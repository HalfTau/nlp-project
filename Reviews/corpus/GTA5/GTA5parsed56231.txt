TakeTwo clearly only cares about your  and nothing else, not the loyalty to the franchise, not the countless hours youve spent immersed in the GTA world, and certainly not the hard work you put into making the experience better for theGTA community. I cant support anything from TakeTwo with such regressive business practices.
