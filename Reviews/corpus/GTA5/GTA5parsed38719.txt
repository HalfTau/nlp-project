We DO NOT USE OpenIV for modding on multiplayer. U do this bcoz u cant handle the amount of hacker on the gta online, RIGHT ?!. it means U CANT MAKE A BETTER ANTICHEAT LIKE VAC DID. U JUST CANT! . thats why u dont allow us to mod again. what r thoose money for that we paid if u cant even still make a better anticheat. SO MAKE A BETTER ONE AND ALLOW  US TO KEEP MODDING ON A SINGLE PLAYER
