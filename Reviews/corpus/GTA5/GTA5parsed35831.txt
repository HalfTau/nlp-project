Well, I WAS going buy GTA IV.  But then they banned modding.  I am a supporter of modding.  You attacked a group I support.  So no cash for you, Rockstar.  I cant even recommend SINGLE PLAYER anymore, due to the replay value now being GREATLY reduced.  Its bad enough that multiplayer is filled with bounty hunters WAITING for people to get a 6000 or more bounty from the AI JUST SO THEY CAN HUNT THEM DOWN and Rockstar just keeps handing those bounty hunters more and more vehicles to hunt people down with, but its even worse that they STILL have did jack and squat about the hacker problems.  There are still people running around shooting explosive bullets everywhere.  This game is horribly broken, and Rockstar refuses to fix it simply because people continue to buy Shark Cards.
