SingleplayerThis game has one of the greatest single player stories ive ever played. It is not as long as some of the previous games, which really dragged on for me, but it is a good lenght and there a barley any boring missions. The characters are great, especially Micheal. Trevor is straight crasy and Franklin is cool. I love how you get to control 3 different characters, and the have their own stories and supporting characters. The heist are great, driving is great, the combat is great, the missions are fast paced and it is truly a great story.9/10.MultiplayerGTA Online is very fun to play with a group of friends. It is good that Rockstar is consistantly updating the game and adding lots of missions and things to do. The heists, MC and CEO work and Doomsday missions are mostly really good and the small little things you can do are awesome. The main problem I have is that you need to grind this game alot to be able to buy most of the things you need. Online is a great concept and Rockstar has almost nailed it.7.5/10.
