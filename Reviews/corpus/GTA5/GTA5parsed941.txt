Do you want 3 s to call you every 510 minuets telling you to buy the dlc? Do you want to grind for weeks and to make 2 mil only to find out that will get you  all? Dont get this ing game. When it came out it was ok, but now its turned to aids. This game has sucked over 1000 hours from me that I will never get back and its all thanks to that wad ceo of take2. God publishers a so ing evil. ffs their going to put micro transactions in rdr2. It sickens me to se what the industry has become now days all this games as service t. then you got the motherthat defend this bunch of ing shills and yes men. if you try to defend any of thisI hope you either put a shot gun in your mouth or dont breed.
