Major props to Rockstar for putting Take2 in their place. I only play this game for the mods I love to fly the planes and add other cool things so its very nice that I may continue to do so.Seems that overwhelming negative reception shortly after deciding to ban mods really did pay off. Very well done, GTA V community!
