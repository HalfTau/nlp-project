Update as of 6/24/17 OpenIV is updated and once again usable. I will not, however, change my rating to recommended. T2 has turned the game into something that I despise, a pay to win grindfest online with no reason to play singleplayer past the 100 mark unless you have mods.Recently TakeTwo decided to ruin the fantastic SINGLEPLAYER modding scene for this game. GTAO has always been garbage and an excuse for them to sell shark cards, and singleplayer mods were the only thing that kept me playing this game past the end of the story mode.
