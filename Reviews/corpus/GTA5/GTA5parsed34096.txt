When the game was only on PS3I bought a PS3 just for this gameThen here comes the PC platformAnd everything is falling downI used to thought that Rockstar is a cool company which makes cool gamesAfter the Grand Theft Auto Online everthing changeRockstar became so greed and wants to control everythingBan people for no reason and the game play became boredEverything is just too expensiveI dont even want a supercar or somethingToo expensive anyway and not even fun to get iti just want the cool Rockstar came backThey used to be coolAnd now they are just greed
