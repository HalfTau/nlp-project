One of the best story modes in a game ever, too bad theyre throwing it away for a crappy militarized multiplayer and shark cards. GTA 5 story would have been an amazing platform for singleplayer DLCs but theyve announced that they wont be happening. I recommend for the amazing singleplayer story but Im giving a negative review due to the fact that GTA has changed from being a great singleplayer story focused game to Lets see who has the most missles in online freeroam. Hopefully GTA 6 will be focused on the story aspect and not multiplayer but these are just my opinions.Thank you for reading.
