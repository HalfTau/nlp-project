I paid 60 for this game, love it to bits, got my moneys worth more than twofold.But attempting to ban mods and now irreversible falsepositives in an anticheat that doesnt even work, just isnt good for anyone. And seeing both rockstar and taketwo making no steps to remedy this, means they deserve a tarnished reputation, at the very least.
