5/10 totalSingle player 10/10Online 0/10No matter what you do online, it pays nothing. Your forced to buy shark cards. This type of marketing is right up their with Korean mmos! They have nurfed every job that use to pay well. I just recently came back to GTA. What a heaping pile of dog sht GTA online has become. They dont even put new online vehicles in story mode anymore. What greedy piles of sht!!!
