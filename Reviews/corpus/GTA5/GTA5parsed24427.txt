If you have few friends and some free time, its a really good game.Of course, they made few mistakes for example, making mods illegal to get rid of hackers... But hey. Show me another big corporation, which made such a good game, with so many FREE updates, and didint made any bad decisions... After all, they are just people, its obvious they cant make only good decisions, and in my opinion, that whole downvoting because they banned mods is a bit stupid... I spent a lot of time in this game, never recieved a free cash from cheater, also never bought any shark cards. AND ITS STILL A PRETTY GOOD GAME.
