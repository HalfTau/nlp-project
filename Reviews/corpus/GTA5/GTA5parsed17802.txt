Single player is awsome still no DLCs for it tho. Online was okay at first but after a while modders took over public sessions horrible anti cheat system that more so in the end bans more people for getting money dropped on them rather than the modders using the command. Online over time turned into a joke with more and more DLCs and updates coming out. Gun running was a joke so many differernt forms of anti air vehicles and weapons yet they all suffered from the same thing the homing launcher did.I.E jets being able to out run the missile by flying in a circle at top speed. making best thing coming from the update to use agenst air units is now explosive rounds for the heavy sniper rifle. while also simply  making flight or driving around in unarmoured cars annoying.
