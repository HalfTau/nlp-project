One of the great things about this game is the modding community. Incredible added value, at no cost to the customer, and no loss to the publisher. Yet, Take Two has decided thats some sort of threat. Given their lackluster ability to enhance the gaming experience, this is now a nobuy situation. Look elsewhere for collaborative entertainment that values its customers. I know I will, which is too bad, because GTA has been a mainstay for me for a very long time.
