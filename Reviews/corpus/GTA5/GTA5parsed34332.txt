Not recomended. They shut down modding singleplayer and that is not fair...like many others I cant play online and I mod my sp to be able to access features like the vehicles that I cant because they dont update singleplayer..so you have to do the dlcs but you dont get ANY of the nrw features in them...and now you take away out ability to add our own features yo the game.. sorry but you suck guys.
