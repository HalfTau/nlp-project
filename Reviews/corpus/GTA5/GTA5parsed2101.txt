I really enjoy this game, and I find the community, generally, to be a welcoming and helpful. However, the never ending crapshow that is modders and hackers in this game just makes me want to uninstall and never pick up a rockstar/taketwo game again. Five different sessions just today, and each time, some modder ruins the experience. As far as I can tell, there has been ZERO change in the frequency of disruptive modders in this game since I started playing. How can you justify charging people so much money for just the game not to mention shark cards and then have this crap happening constantly. Extremely disappointing. Do not buy, and I would suggest, do not buy their future games either if thisis their idea of customer service.
