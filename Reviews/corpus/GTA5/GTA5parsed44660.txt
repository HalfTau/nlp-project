What irks me the most about the whole OpenIV issue is T2 is only hurting the singleplayer base. Singleplayer has been getting screwed the whole time GtaV has been out and then they take the last thing that singleplayer had while also leaving the online players high and dry when it comes to people ruining online lobbies.
