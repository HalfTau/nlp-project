Too much grinding, it just seems like you would either spend countless days into this game or give them hundreds of dollars just to have a bit of fun in the game, I would see why there are so many money modders because most of us dont have money to pay for fake money or time to make fake money, if they fix the way money works in this game then it would be way better and a lot more fun for all
