Its a terrible game, that bans you for having MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner or any other program that has a Menu Overlay such as overwolf and so on. Just like me, progress erased and banned for a month for absolutely nothing, other than the game freezing my computer, crashing and banning for no reason. BEST OF ALL. It doesnt even tell you exactly why.And now let us ban OpenIV, really hope this terrible game dies out,
