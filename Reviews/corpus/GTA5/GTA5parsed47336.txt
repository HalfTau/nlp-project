I bought this game originally knowing there are single player mods that make the game more fun from the days of GTA IV but now this is not the case with OpenIV being forced to shut down I would now not recommend anyone buy this game.Modding has been acceptable to Rockstar and fairly open for many years so long as they arent used in multiplayer but to force the main tool for installing these mods to shut down via cease and desist after all this time is really quite unfair and unacceptable.
