please please please please do not give rockstar money until they fix the servers, i know its hard to play without buying shark cards but if we keep feeding their greed they will not see a reason to fix the servers. and its not just a christmas thing, the servers have been bad way before the holiday season. if gta 6 comes out this millennia then i hope rockstar makes better servers and makes ingame prices less stupid for it. thanks for reading my sick rant i tried not to type a rant novel for gta 5. if they fixed the servers the game may not suck. who knows, it might be worth the 2 left clicks to start it.
