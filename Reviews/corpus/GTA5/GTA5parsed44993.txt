I used to love GTA V. The open world, interesting story, and free multiplayer DLC were great. The game isnt perfect and by removing modding from single player I cant recommend this game. Modding is my favorite part about GTA, it adds so much to the game and removing that is a slap in the face to PC gamers, many of which bought the game for this reason and want to continue playing single player for the mods. Further, the DLC they keep releasing is great, but its obvious they dont care about single player and havent added any single player updates. Its sad that rockstar cares more about money than what their players want and until they bring back modding in single player, I am giving this game a huge thumbs down.
