Because they cannot find a way to stop the cheaters, then think banning singleplayer modding will make a difference and stop it. I spent my money on GTA 5 with the sole intention of modding singleplayer to have fun and now i cannot launch the game because something is messed up with my files. Everything worked perfectly until they banned OpenIV.So now i have to lose all my files i installed and reinstall the game. Rockstar/taketwo, this is the last game i ever buy from you.
