No point in buying this game now that Take Two have disabled the use of openIV. You would think after milking the games release on many platforms and then only making crappy multiplayer dlc that they would be satisfied with the hundreds of millions of dollars that they leached from rockstars devs. Instead they go after the modding community that is willing to provide the content to people who want to play single player. Absolutely disgusting, do not buy this game, do not support these practices. This game will now be unplayed by me.
