Great game, excellent and engaging storyline, but Take 2 RUINED IT.Basically, Take 2 sent a cease and assist letter to a popular modding tool, which was protective of the games assets and could only be used in single playerCould you play Minecraft without mods? How about Skyrim? Fallout 4? NO! This game needs mods to survive!
