This game could be very good  However it is not. Though the single player is ok the multiplayer is unplayable. It mostly resembles a really lousy FTP MMO with the only real option for advancement being OVERPRICED microtransactions. I would have recommended this product anyways but given the recent openiv debacle its clear that this game and T2 are not worth my time or anyone elses.
