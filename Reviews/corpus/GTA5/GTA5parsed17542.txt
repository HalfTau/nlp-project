Im not sure if my words would carry weight, with my humble amount of playtime.But I will let it out here anyhows, as what happened to me was unbelievably absurd and can happen to any one of us here.One month ago, while I was logging into GTAO, a hacker deposited 50k into my account. It happened while I was locked in the loading screen, so basically there was nothing I could do about it. I usually try my best to avoid open sessions, but with the recent update I had to visit that hellhole from time to time for research purposes.Shocked, I immediately reported the incident and one of R staff assured me that I do not have to concern myself with itRequest 10955889 on Rockstar support, in case anyone from the company reads this. Hence I played on, until I got the message yesterday saying that my account was adjusted due to an illegal exploit. It was yesterday, which is August 25.I had 32mil in GTAO. I logged in, and found out that I had 16mil. Half of it was gone.So a hacker gave me 50k without my consent, simply because of the fact that the game forced me to be with one of them, and they take away 16mil from me EVEN after I reported the misdemeanor without hesitation.I asked for adjustment. R gave me a generic answer saying that I was involved in illegal exploit, yet againRequest 11211134. I guess doing everything by the book, and making a single mistake of joining an open sesson that is a perfectly legitimate content of the game are now an illegal exploit.I tried my best to be most reasonable and calm with them. Now they do this.Bravo, Rockstar. I always wanted to believe in you. Now Im certain that I was but an idiotic fanboy. I guess you want me to grind for it mindlessly again, or even better, purchase shark cards. Well I wont, ever. Ill make sure not to purchase a single game that youout from this moment on.Well of course the company wont listen. So up yours, Rockstar. Thank you.
