Dear Take Two...  you.Please dont buy this game until Take Two get their  together.Singleplayer is dead.Multiplayer is also dead because as soon as you join you get 500.000.000 dollars in your bank account. Essentially, whats left is doing stupid  with your friends, so good luck doing that if your friends dont have GTA V.And yes I have hundreds of hours, but thats mostly from finishing the singleplayer twice and AFK time. Im only level 70 on online and tbh, I dont think I will ever be playing it again,
