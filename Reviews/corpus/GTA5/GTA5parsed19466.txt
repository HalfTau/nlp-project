In my opinion, if game offers you 1/1h game time, its a good game. I have bought this game for PS3 and PS4 too. Total game time in consoles is about 500600h. Now......how to put this......I honestly dont know if I should still recommend this game or not for PC. There are way too many hackers for PC. Loading times are horrible and servers are buggy, I get Connection Error everysingle day. There loading bugs too, usually I end up being in loading screen forever. I can see people using chat and talking.....and I can talk to them if I want.....but Im still at loading screen. Cant press Esc to join other session....no I have to restart the whole game or wait 15 mins before my session ends.Basically what Im saying is that I spend 1h in game/session at loading screens just to get killed by hacker on PC.
