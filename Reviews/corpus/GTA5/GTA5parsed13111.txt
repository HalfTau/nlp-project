Capitalism V The rich stay rich and the weak stay weak, unless you buy shark cards to get more money. Ive actually heard of someone buying the Megalodon card and getting banned because apparently nobody can have that much money! Like, What the actual hell Rockstar? Fix your damn game. I was lucky enough to get into the rich side of GTA, but still I had to deal with thisas much as anyone else did so listen here, you need friends for online, and grinding certain missions does NOT work. The best tool I use to farm is the Vehicle Warehouse, and thats only when you have it. I can remember I wasted so much time on missions alone to get practically nothing. Switching the subject to something else, like maybe THE FLYING MOTORCYCLES. What the hell?! They are so difficult to hit, and they are practically the most  thing Rockstar has introduced into this game.
