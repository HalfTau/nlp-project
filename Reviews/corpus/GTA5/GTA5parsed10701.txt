Good story  characters. Online is well done with alot of features that should be implemented into story mode. Since these features dont exist in story mode and you lose cars that you pay big bucks for which is angering to say the least the online is what you should buy the game for. Hackers seem to be dealt with so online is better than it used to be. Worst thing about the game is the crazy loading times
