The single player for this game was decent, online is a bit of a mess but also decent in its own way, But what really makes this game replayable over and over for me and well worth its price is its modability, Something TakeTwo and Rockstar is trying to put an end to, for this future of installing mods is uncertain i at this time cannot recommend the game.
