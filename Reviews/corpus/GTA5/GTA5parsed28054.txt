Love this game, never wanted an online version, just wanted a damn coop for the story and all the crap take 2 is talking about the players makes it less desireable, its a shame for such a good game to have this crap going on and because of crappy gta online, to hell with gta online and take 2 interactive, hope they have cancer, dont buy it.Have you noticed how all the videos are for gta online purchaseable items, youll have to spend on shark cards to get it cuz ingame currency was stolen by devs, dont buy this and just torrent for the single player, 2k already got all the money back three times for this.
