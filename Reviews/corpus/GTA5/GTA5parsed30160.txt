No. This game is garbage since they sent a CD to OpenIV. What the actual hell is your problem, Take Two? Thousands of other games like you allow mods, and sending a bloody ceaseanddesist letter to people who modded your game, because they wanted more out of it, is not okay.To all who read these reviews, do not buy this game if you plan to mod it, you are wasting your time.
