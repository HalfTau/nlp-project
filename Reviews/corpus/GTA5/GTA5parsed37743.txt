There is no reason to buy this game without OpenIV and the ability to mod. Buy GTA IV. Youll get a better story with better multiplayer and a modder friendly enviornment where you can customize your experience without spending 50 extra for enough shark cards to get anything worthwhile.Hopefullly Rockstar doesnt ruin Red Dead Redemption 2 like they ruined GTA V.
