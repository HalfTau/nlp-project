Why the hell would you kill the modding community for this game? Sure your vanilla content is great but much like skyrim, the modding is what made this game great. When you made GTA V, you built a fantastic game, but beyond that you built and engine. You built a platform for people to dump as many mods as they want and use the realistic gameworld to simulate out anything fun they could think of.Rockstar. You F up. We get it.Its not too late, roll that update back, the people have spoken.
