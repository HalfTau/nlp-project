Graphics are AMAZING.But unfortunetely, anything else is not...Maybe the most horrific Singleplayer storyline in whole GTA history.If you want to just kill everyone, rob everywhere even if youre a millionere, you rob and take huge risk to get like 1 of your total fortune, go to Stripclubs and have conflict with pedesterians while you try to have a normal conversation with them.Multiplayer has no aim. Rob everywhere to buy new car and gun to rob everywhere. Legit mate.I miss Vercetti, I miss Nikos miserable life story, I miss Hey cousin, why dont we go to bowling?Love  Best Wishes from the Liberty City
