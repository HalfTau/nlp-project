This game is after so much time full of bugs and glitches which are really annoying.It already takes ages to finally load up the game and sometimes it just decides to not load at all.From all the time I have played this I have enjoyed about 5 of those hours tops because most of the time youre going to just be grinding and sometimes even for nothing because the game just decides to not give you your reward because the cloud servers barely work causing you to lose all your progress.
