Rockstar said they arent monotizing this game enough... This is a full priced 60 game and paying 100 for 8 million in online in absurd. They make it so evrything is super high priced so the only way you are able to afford anything without wasting weeks doing the same boring moneymaking missions or supply runs is spending real money on a already full priced game.
