Take Two and Rockstar Games are the epitome of anticonsumer practices. This game itself is excellent, but the development teams continue to push online DLC with copious content that can essentially only be aquired through prolonged uninteresting grinding or by buying shark cards when will game companies learn it is not a good idea to charge for ingame content on a 60 game???. Rockstar has left many issues with the game unfixed while focusing on filling their pockets. Take Twos recent cease and desist of OpenIV alligns with this greedy mentality. Until the publishers turn a 180 on their quality control and ethics practices, do not buy or support this game.
