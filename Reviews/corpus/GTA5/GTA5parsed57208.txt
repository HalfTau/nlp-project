Incredibly aggressive and unpredictable banning system that also targets innocent players?CheckBan system only looks for excuses and arbitrary reasons to ban said innocent players that have completely normal stats?CheckIncredibly inflated economy to the point where simple weapon reskins cost more than a car?CheckCheaters and modders STILL running rampant online due to the elusive tools they use to put the blame on innocent players?CheckMoney is so grindey and a pain to earn, people form communities where they freely give it out to others?CheckAll of these glaring problems people have stomached till now, but the most glaring one just came out today.Kill the entire modding community of this game by lawyering to death the most vital tool necessary for it, all because of greedy desires?ing check. Rockstar, TakeTwo, and everything they stand for. I will never buy a Rockstar/T2 game ever again.
