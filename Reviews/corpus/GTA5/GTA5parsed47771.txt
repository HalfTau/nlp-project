There are so many elements to this game, but every aspect of this game is half Rockstar does not take any feedback from the community to better the game. Instead they say Youre going to play it and like it. We still have your money. Rockstar is honestly the biggest piece of sht company. Theyre ones to shoot themselves in the foot in fullauto mode when it comes to PR.
