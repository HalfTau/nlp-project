The singleplayer experience is not what I bought this for.So my review cannot apply to that aspect.I love this game and have poured tons of money and time into playing the multiplayer online experience.Bottom LineThey took 1.7 million dollars of legit money from a friend I grinded it with.I hear that people have gotten their money back but those are special cases.
