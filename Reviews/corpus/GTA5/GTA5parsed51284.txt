Do not purchase this game. TakeTwo has attacked the OpenIV team and completely eliminated single player modding from GTA V. They dont deserve a single cent of your money for what theyve done, and I encourage everyone to leave a negative review on every TakeTwo game, aswell as continuing to NOT support this sorry excuse for a company.It pains me to know that one of my most beloved games, Kerbal Space Program, is now owned by these idiots. God help us all.Sign this petition please
