Ive sunk plenty of time into GTA V starting on the PS3 and PS4 and finally the PC.Playing this on PC is by far the best looking, best performing and best overall experience. Optimisation is top notch. Loads of options to tweak should you have any issues. Unlike a lot of games SLI actually works well in this game.Plenty of replayability, Hundreds of hours to spend in singleplayer and even more online.The campaign/story is brilliant. Everything you would expect from a GTA title. Awesome radio stations, comical advertising, a plethora of crazy and interesting characters. The humor is spot on, everything and everyone is stereotyped. No political correctness. Its perfect.The gameplay has been improved much since GTA IV. Cars handle better. Shooting and combat is more fluid. The world is far more dynamic and feels alive more than ever before.I have a few gripes with multiplayer. Heists are ruined by early quitters. Once someone quits your back into the lobby. Back to waiting many minutes to recruit new players. I would have loved a mechanic that pauses the mission if someone quits and recruits a new player. Give that player an incentive to help such as a cash or XP bonus. Also cash and XP feels like a HUGH grind, decent vehicles and apartments are unreasonablly priced.Probably one of the best games on Steam. Highly recommended!PS. Heres hoping to RDR2 has a PC release.
