Everyone in the reviews section are pisd off over the hack protection in GTA Online and give negative reviews. I mean yeah, even Id be angry if they ban the victim from Online permanently but that being said, I didnt understand why no one recommends the game for the story mode.First of all, I agree that the price is rather high... which is the reason I bought the game when it was on sale at 50 off give or take a few . For the sale price, the game was well worth the cost. I absolutely enjoyed the story mode and if youre a perfectionist kind of guy, you can get a lot of hours from this game.On a side note, the graphics optimization is AMAZING. Sleeping Dogs not Definitive Edition lags at medium settings on my PC but this game works without any lag at all. If you have an NVidia GeForce GPU, I recommend you download the GeForce Experience to optimize the graphics settings for the game for maximum FPS.GTA Online on the other hand... well, its nice and fun but having to be cautious of hackers all the time takes a toll on the mind if youve read the many sob stories in the negative reviews. No, I am not insulting those reviewers.Overall, Id say the game is well worth it. You can squeeze dozens or hundreds of hours from the game until you get banned anyway so Id say its worth it. If its on sale, then even better.
