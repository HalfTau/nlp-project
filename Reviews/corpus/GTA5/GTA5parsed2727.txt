This review is only about GTA V ONLINE.So I started out having a lot of fun but it started to feel like I have to do a lot of grinding, and I REALLY hate grinding in games. And at a point it felt like I had to pay to win. What makes it even harder is that when you do grind you have to deal with people who have the crazy new car with guns mounted on it or something! I thought the game was suppose to be realistic but at this point its just pay to win.
