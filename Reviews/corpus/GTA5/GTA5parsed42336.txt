Single Player is fine.Multiplayer  buy shark cards if you dont want to do that and you shouldnt!, then you have to spend hundreds of hours playing the game waiting in lobbies only to be able to afford a car.at least 15 of players of any given lobby are modders running around with godmode on, removing your weapons and whatnot, ruining your gaming experience. The only help is to countermod these ers I always loopexploded them until they left. And that is the only thing I did apart from giving myself some money, but that can get you banned from the game.
