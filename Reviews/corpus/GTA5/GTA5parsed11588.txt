Ive spent a good part of my time on this game, its very addictive but like every other game there are hackers who ruins your game experience, other than that the game its amazing. The single player campaign has an unique story plus the with the mods this game its timeless, the online its more difficult to grind money but its more fun to play. Its a MUST in your library!
