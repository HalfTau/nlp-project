Let me start by saying Ive had over thousands of hours on Grand Theft Auto V. Ive bought the game the first day it was released on the 360, I bought it when it was released on the newer consoles, I bought it when I finally bought my PC and I can safely say that Take Two shot themselves in the foot while detonating a bomb strapped to there back. All I can say that Take Two are not looking out for fans or the longevity of there own game. All they care about is making money and taking down anything that might stop that. It hurts millions of players and I personally will not be supporting such actions
