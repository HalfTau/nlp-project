I have played a lot of GTA5, since ps3 launch. Over the years R is getting more and more greedy. Its a good game dont get me wrong, but youll need to grind and grind and grind OR buy gta dollars with Shark Cash Cards.Cant recomend this game at the moment, R is simply to greedy, the game isnt cheap and they still ask for a lot of extra cash.
