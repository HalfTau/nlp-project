I would not recomend buying this game.  Although the single player is fun it get boring and you will probobly want to try multiplayer.  Playing multiplayer is not a good idea because to be good at it you must spend a ton of money for ingame cash to buy cars and building and weapons.  Playing multiplayer also puts you at getting banned for no reason even if your not modding or anything agaist their guidelines like i did.  Modders corrupt multiplayer by ruining other peoples fun and cheating game physics, while themselves not getting banned.In conclusion i would not recomend wasting your money on this game unless there is a sale going on and you really want to play the single player.
