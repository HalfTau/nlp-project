This is total t. You see the hours I have invested into this game? Only 2 of those hours, are in the  abortion of an Online mode, this ucking publisher, wants to shove down my throat. You think, I will invest my time into the Online mode, now that my game files, that I paid for,  your lisence, I own it, not you require more stupid ing workarounds. Ill do the workarounds, Ill get back to enjoying my adjusted FoV for driving and shooting, regenerating health, more aggresive police AI, a more fluid driving system and the butt load of mods I have and plan on having.This industry, of gaming, has fallen prey to greed and profit margins. Bean counters and uncreative antiartistic s have infiltrated it and have made it about nothing but maxing out profits, on barebones, SkinnerBox technquies. Its t that the stance Rockstar makes is that of a sellout. A bunch of developoors, working 1020 hours a day and getting told to make more money every year off a game that is almost 5 years old. The ing greed, its horrid. Its not developers killing this industry, its the unrealistic demands publishers make and demand of studios. These money hunger s would rather make GTA V into an aborted MMO, that needs you to either dolord content grinds of the same dungeon, to grind for gold to buy loot, or buy this level up to XX card instead of leaving Online to a simple Free roam experience like it was in GTA IV, with less emphasis on this whole half wannabe Destiny/Vanilla WoW/GTA. I dont even ing know. I was too busy having actual fun playing my, Arcade style, FarCry makes a baby with GTA V and Halos old regen system. I had shootouts with cops for hours and hours because of all the mods I installed.
