I enjoy this game yeah. I liked the story, I like online. Most people stop playing games after a year apart from skyrim and fallout this is really lucky people still play it considering prices are extreme but it wants you to work for it and be a proper criminal which is why I like it because of the missions you must do to earn that money. It isnt hard to earn either. a whole large warehouse is worth 2million.
