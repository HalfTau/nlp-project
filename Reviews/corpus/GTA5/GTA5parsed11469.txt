Single player is addicting the play with a nice story. Once you get to the end of the story, the game becomes completely boring for me.DO NOT play Grand Theft Auto Online! The only thing you will get out of it is modders ruining the experience, people killing you all the time, thousands of hours of grinding to make any real progress, load times longer than Skyrim, etc. I hear about players getting banned left and right when a modder gets them involved with their shananigans, which is completely dissapointing.Overall summary, singleplayer gameplay is awesome, Multiplayer is worse than No Mans Sky.
