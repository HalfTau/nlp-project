This game contains an amount of detail like no other for its generation. Ive replayed the campaign multiple times and it truly never gets old. I also am a huge supporter of GTA online. Though it does get boring at times, as soon as you start to get bored they go ahead and add more dlc to keep you interested. I would recommend this game as an essential to every free roam lover!
