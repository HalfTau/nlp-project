First one I gonna say is that it is definitely a good game on Online ModeWe know that every few years there gonna be a new serie of Grand Theft Auto which is very impressive for all of the players who play R games and which R games is famous for its GTA seriesAnd the good things in this game are the following things what I list below1.Accessible for most devices which means that you can play it even on a poor condition computer2.Great scenes in the Grand Theft Auto series ever!3.Rich Diversity in Online ModeEvery few period of time there will be updates on Online Mode including new transportations especially stories weapons and clothes which GTA want to create a sociaty comparing reality4.More stories in this gameStory Mode you can play 3 characters which directly add the context of the game also with random things you can play and Online Mode you have many things to do to earn Money   to earn Money and to earn MoneyDisadvantages are that Ive being thinking that Why I am already tired with just 36 hours of gametime and that is why I wanna say disadvantages in this game1. Small mapMaybe it is so subtle discribed in the city causes the occupying of 70G space in desk and the programmers are already tired in programming other cities which cause me tired in one city and I wanna say a part of San Andreas is not enough for our players to play this game. The map is even smaller than GTA3 on a same city2. Simple physics in driving flying divingEasy to drive is the tradition of all GTA series that is totally good for you firstly play this game. But as a totally fun of car sports which totally bothers me is that all GTA series Do Not have the ABS system in cars even in GTA5 with a more better physics than GTA4 and the invehicle mode is not good enough developed causes many players stil play this in a third person view3.Didnt change much after you do comparisons between GTA4 and 5When you actually play GTA5 after playing GTA4I found the differences are that GTA5 have more stories and a better physics and that is all4.Why am I already feeled Tired with a 36 hours game timeMotivation for players as a person to play this game is what Ive already mentioned beforw MoneyStory Mode is all about Robbing Banks and carrying out plans to rob banks which totally bothers me beause during the preparation of Robbing there exists more other smaller missions for you to do causes a more time for you to wait in a small mapthe same happens on Online ModePlayers just wanna to make money when playing the game which ruins the meaning of GTA5 as a game to play.Which often happens in a particular  scenario when you become rich in this game.You dont know whats the interestings to do next which ruins you to enjoy the process when playing this game directly cause you dont want to play this games any more because you become dominant in the Story Mode and Online mode.Particularly happens in Online Mode is the Bully to the novice playersAnyway its a game that should be Always comes to the end with a motivation
