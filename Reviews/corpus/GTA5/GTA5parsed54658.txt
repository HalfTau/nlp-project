this is a good game that id love to give a good rating to. however, the developers are ruining their game by removing mod support. mods arent cheating because they fix the game rather than exploiting the game. mods make the game more fun for a lot of people, and rockstar doesnt care. I think that this game 100 deserves the mostly negative reviews, because its rediculous.
