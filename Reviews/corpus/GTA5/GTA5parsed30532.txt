2K treated us like were sheep. Ill not stand for this. Theyve always treated us like st but never have I seen such pure acts of bullcp. Banning modding, one of the biggest drawins for new GTA V buyers. Good job shredding your own product taketwo. And as for you Rockstar, you couldve stood up to them and done what was right, how could you accept an offer so full of horsest and think it would be for the gamers? You were one of the only developers left that I felt were legit in terms of caring for the players, apparently I was mistaken. Although I can forgive you, fk take two.
