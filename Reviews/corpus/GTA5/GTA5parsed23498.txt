Take Two has to be one of the greediest publishers ever. Even EA wouldnt pull off the stuff that they did. Who in their right mind thought they should ban mods? Thank god they eventually let open IV do what they want again. The game is still good but I wouldnt recommend getting this game right now like I did. Also online is fun with friends but toxic with random people just a warning.
