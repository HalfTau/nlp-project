Why the hell would you ban modding?!?! Im not a heavy modder myself but considering that a significant number of people bought this game for the ability to mod and have fun, I cant feel anything but disappointment in you guys. Go eat.If you want to stop the GTA online exploits arising from modding, go fix that instead of being lazyand outright banning mods. You single handedly reduced your game to nothing but filthy trash stained with your laziness and disrespect for the people whove supported you and your game.
