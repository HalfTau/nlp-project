Even with the modding support fiasco over, the Online portion of the game is ruined by hackers, Rockstar removing money earned through ingame actvity, and a huge pay wall set up by a sleazy system that may as well be paytowin. Do not buy it, even for the single player. None of the multiplayer DLCs are able to be used in single player. While youre at it, avoid buying Red Dead Redemption 2 when it comes out.Do everyone a favor and let Rockstar know they overstayed their welcome.
