The single player is kinda OK, but nothing ground breaking. The map feels big, but actually its not. Theres not much to do if youre not into silly stunts and pointless driving around town. But overall the experience is good if you like sandbox games. The engine much improved since GTA4, but still there are some memory leaks and such. I had to restart the game to recover it even with 16GB of RAM and 4GB VRAM... Vsync is kinda wonky too.But on the other hand the multiplayer is PURE GARBAGE. With every passing month, since the launch, the hacks are getting worse and worse. Many coop missions require 4 players to beat. Good luck finding them! Dont buy this game for the full price. I got it 40 off and still it feels like a total ripoff.
