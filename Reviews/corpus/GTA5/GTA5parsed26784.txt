Hmm, what should I start with?Oh, yeah. If you like farming salt from your enemies tears when they get obliterated after randomly blowing you up for no reason, then this game is for you. I highly reccomend you use a Hydra so you get extra salt from all the hydra noob messages that will be spammed in the chat.Also, if you want to be called a modder, just use the explosive rounds from the Gunrunning DLC and you will see people asking you for money in no time!10/10 would blow someone up again.
