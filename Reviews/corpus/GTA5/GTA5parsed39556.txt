The Single Player is still exactly what youd expect from a GTA game. Except theres no story DLC, and there never will be. GTA Online is a huge cash grab. You like grinding? No? Then buy shark cards! Woo! You like mods? Well dont buy this! They dont like mods. Since they can effect multiplayer. Where they make their money. Off shark cards. Because everything is too god damn expensive.
