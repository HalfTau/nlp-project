Grand Theft Auto, whats there to say? Online is a delicate topic, as it is mostly grinding or buying shark cards as the prices raise so that the player is forced to play more missions, having fun if done with friends or at least it is intended that way.Great Game Nether The Less... RECOMMEND TO ANYONE
