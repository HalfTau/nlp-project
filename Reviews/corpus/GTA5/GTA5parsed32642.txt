I bought this game to use mods, and to use the amazing sandbox, and in secondhand for the story. But now when mods are gone there is no meaning in playing this game. Ive spent money on this game, but I cant enjoy it any more. Makes me really mad. Its like you would buy a toaster and then the toaster company would say you cant have cheese on your toast. Sure you can still have toast but not cheese on it, you lost the enjoyment in it. Because this ban of mods I will no longer buy games from take two, to make a stand, and hit them where it hurts. This is really sad, for me, the comunity, and the gaming industry as whole. I hope you will revert this change soon.
