Not recommended. The single player is ok, not great, but the online is super lame. For as much as they have added to it, the content gets old in a week or two and the public sessions are unplayable because they are so full of modders. Also be careful of any interactions with modders, sometimes they will give money, and spending their hacked money will get you banned. Because the online game is such a grind, with payouts being super low for jobs relative to the price of anything you might want or need to access the content, its a microtransaction riddles how. So while the game is in this state, and the fact that it is old, and hacked to bits,  I cannot recommend this as a great investment.
