Take two wants to kill their game. Banning all MODs.Edit 7/7/2017Open IV might be back which is good they heard us out. Well least Rockstar did. Rockstar was able to pressure or rather come to some senses with Take Two, but Take Two  in the way they worded things this could easily go back to how it was. I enjoy Rockstar, and Im glad they did the right thing. Though I cant support Take Two so I wont be changing this back to positive. Maybe one day Rockstar can branch away from Take Two.
