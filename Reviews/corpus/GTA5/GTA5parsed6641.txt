If you do not like the game do not play it.... no one is forceing you to play it, right??? I see peoples review on this game and loged more 350 hours, total hypocrites. it briging be to my next point, mods you can not use them! so all you moders out there that are so upset over this one thing, people just wright negative reviews. And to sum it all up most people think that every game should be free, and you would be able to hack to your hearts content, reality check IT IS NOT! If you want to make a game do it yourself... its simple that.
