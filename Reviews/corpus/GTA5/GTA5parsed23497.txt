Am sorry but your Single player modding is bleeding in to GTA Online. it hard to make money and do Missions as is with out modders useing god mode in the mod manu as well as nother mods like pick a random player and blow them up. crash the lobby. GTA has a lot of good player who are cool and love the fight.also players who just want to do mission and not get killed but thats not what GTA was about. If they stop players killing other players it would not be GTA anymore it would be dum as fact is the Modding Issue with OpenIV is you the modders who take yourtoo GTA online if you did not do it then none if it or the fight with modder killing GTA online would be happening. I ing hate All you modders out there who take it to GTA online. Its your falt not Rockstars I like this game i would Recommend it. it can be fun. it be even better if all you modders stop Massing with GTA Online!
