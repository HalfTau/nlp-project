Lets be real here its 2017 and theyre gonna monetize every way they can. If it means killing mods, they will kill mods. The software isnt even yours anymore, you just rent it. Gone are the days of those CD or DVD cases in the corner you could always count on to go reinstall one of your old favorites.GTA 5 wont be remembered as one of those old favorites  not anymore. Good job on shooting yourselves in the foot though. Im sure the extra cash will pay for the hospital bill. Hey, as long as us idiots keep buying it, youll keep making it, right?Time to get a new hobby.
