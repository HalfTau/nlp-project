Multiplayer is utter garbagethe whole thing is a grind fest, due to this the limited number of missions is quite apparent, and how often missions are recycled but just with a different goal e.g. Lamars missions where the 2nd and 3rd mission is just drive from A to B then shoot incoming waves of enemies from different places preplanning feels like a waste of time, with no purpose but just to serve as an.The game constantly tries to shove its Sharkcards down your throat by makingreally ing expensive, and by using the equivalent of popups, in the form of reminding you every 2 minutess that they have a  reallyexpensive base that costs min 900 ing k or more, from which you can access the new missions which Ive heard are quite a pain to do as you have to do some of the preplanning in freeroam.There are also a ton of script kiddies in you can avoid them if you turn passive mode on BUT if you pick up money that has been spawned by them you have a high chance being banned. You can also get banned for leaving any mods in from. when joining a session, even if that mods is just a texture mod/overhaul, this just shows how  the AntiCheat System in place is.During the 2 weeks since Ive purchased the game the servers were down for hours, but when checking the official R site about the status, of course it still said that the servers were up, despite the fact that people were complaining on the formums.Ive had constant issues with lagg and latency issues when playing with others in a session, taking a cliporso to take down a single enemy, with headshots often registered as, however this all quickly changes when you are alone in a session, the number of bullets to take down an enemy noticeably decreased and headshots registeredas often.I also checked whether the problem was on my end or not it was not and found that it didnt make a difference whether I was hosting the heist/mission or some random, the issue was still present, leaving me believe that the issue must be with the servers not being able to handle the bandwidth or something.Loading screens would often take way too long after missions, ranging fromit load at all, as I had quite a few ones where I just gave up and restarted the game. Joining would often take twice as long to join multiplayer than, even though it doesnt need to load in that much more, again, leaving me suspect that its the servers that are slow.The multi still has problems, latency issues, script kiddies, loading times and many other things Ive not mentioned despite being out for over two and a half years 2.7 at the time of writing, and if they havent fixed it since, they never will.I wouldrecommend it for theor if you have a friend or friends for a better experience to play with and a load of free time however it definitely does not worth the 40 asking price, wait till its on sale or avoid it if possible its probably better if you do so.I recently discovered that you can view stats on e.g.. total income, which for me over a little less than 40 hours was just a wee under 1 million, which just goes to show how much you have to grind in this game. Even if I kept it all, and not spent a dime, I could just blow it on a SINGLE VEHICLE, but I had to spend on guns to be capable taking on more difficult missions, meaning that early on  you have to spend on guns, then later on some armoured or gun mounted vehicles become a must for these missions.
