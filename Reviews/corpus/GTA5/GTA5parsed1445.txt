Good game and very addicting, but earlier I was suspended for 2 months from harrasing and threatening. I was taking advantage of staying low while modding, while some fellows decided to approach me and harrass me for being a fat american, in my defense i said some very offensive things, that I regret doing. But what suprised me the most was, I didnt get suspended for modding, it was for verbal assault, after I have been modding for 3 months plus. My advice is, mod as much as you want becuase no one gives a but watch out forwho get butthurt easily
