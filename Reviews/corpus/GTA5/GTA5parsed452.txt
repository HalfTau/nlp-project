Memory Leak makes this game unplayable, bad port once again from Rockstar. Rockstar only care about console sales and if it runs when on them, they dont give a  about PC or are too dumb to work out the stutter bug but since we didnt get Red Dead 2 and had a shitbag port like GTA IV in the past i would think they just really really dont give a  about PC aslong as they keep getting online money.
