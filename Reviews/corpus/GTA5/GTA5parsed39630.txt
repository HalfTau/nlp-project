Single player is fun but sadly the game really isnt all that friendly for modding. After completing the main story I modded my game, however the last update for the garbage online content made it unplayable. Even reinstalled the game and tried with the bare minimum of mods, still useless.GTAO is always trash with one of the worst player bases ever.
