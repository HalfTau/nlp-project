My PC crashed in the midst of writing a very detailed review based around my thoughts and opinions on this game.Heres a sumup because Im too lazy to type all of that again.Great game hidden behind horrible business practices. Its worth playing but do not give in to their microtransactions. Just get a group of friends together and play play play. Make sure you get the game on sale as well. There really is no reason to purchase the game full price anymore. It goes on sale regularly, just have patience.
