Singeplayer was incredible, I really loved playing singleplayer because of its great story, funny moments and overall great gameplay. Moving on to multiplayer.... really fun to play with friends in a nonpopulated lobby otherwise hackers/modders pretty much everywhere. Overall Singeplayer was really fun for me, Multiplayer Better have friends who has any of those otherwise its hell. Dont get this for the multiplayer experience unless youre with friends.I am giving a good review for the singleplayer experience and a meh for multiplayer unless youre with friends then its goes to good
