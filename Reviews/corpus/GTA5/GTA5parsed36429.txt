As someone who has 400 Hours into this game of countless grinding, Missions, Updates and more i can say this game is amazing, but with the recent update with take two. I had 20 mil, Id say 70 of it was from grinding and missions, the rest were from annoying spanish modders giving out money. My Account was reset and im utterly Ive invested over 300 bucks on this game and im shocked that the people who own this game treat it like this.
