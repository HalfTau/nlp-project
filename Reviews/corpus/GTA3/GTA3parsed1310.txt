Oh my childhood...This was one of the few games that really defined my early PC gamer years. I was around 10 when I started to play this masterpiece and I still cannot get bored with it. Nad I didnt become a psychopath eventually.I just bought it on Steam, but earlier I spend tons of hours driving arund in Liberty City, shooting and hitting innocents fighting the police, using one of the hilarious cheats I still know after a decade. Back then I loved the story as well, know know its a bit lame, but who cares? Maffia, triads, yakuza, Jamaicans, the Cartell and everyone betraying everyone... I loved it.This is still my favourite GTA and I can only recommend it to everyone.
