This game is a classic the gore was the reason I like this game. When I see it now I think as it as one hell of a goodgame and you get no s but you get lots lots lots of things to do and some glitches make it even more fun. I thought my self this is better than games today all because of the god damn gore and missions were fun expect the gernade throwing god damn that one is hard because of the idea. And I say 9/10 is best for this game it better than our games today EXPECT A COUPLE but there more ing bad games than good one right now.
