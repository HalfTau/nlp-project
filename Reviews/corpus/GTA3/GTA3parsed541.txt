Anyone wanting to know how to make a open world shooter, GTA3 should be lesson 1.Liberty City is split into 3 islands. Each with their own neighbourhoods. Each neighbourhood has its own look and gang.The side missions, alone, make for great fun drive a taxi, be a vigilante hunting bad guys in car chases, drive an ambulance or fire engine.The story missions take you on an interesting journey, working your way up the mafia ladder for starters.The downsides are the lighting seems way too dark on most models. Also, lighting normals seem to be nonexistant. This seems to be a thing for this era of game. I dont know whether it is that normals are broken, or they just are not there.Definitely recommended, if on sale.
