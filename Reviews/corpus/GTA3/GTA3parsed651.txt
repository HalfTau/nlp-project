I loved this game when I was younger as I am sure a lot of people did....and I still do more or less.The only gripes I would have are these. The lack of proper controller support is a pain in thebecause lets face it nobody likes driving with keys. It just isnt as good. There is a mod out there to fix this and unfortunately it didnt work for me but hopefully you will have more luck if you try it. Im new to mods and pc gaming really so thats probably why.The other issue I had was when i first loaded the game up the menus wouldnt load which makes the game unplayable unless fixed unless you can use the force to see which menu icon you are hovering over. There is also a mod out there to fix this which thankfully did work for me lol.Apart from that its the game I remember playing as a child instead of doing homework. The fact the textures etc are updated doesnt bother me. It doesnt effect the fun you can having playing the game. Its another sweet slice of nostalgia pie.
