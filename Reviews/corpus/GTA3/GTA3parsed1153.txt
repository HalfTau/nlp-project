The first 3D entry!... it shows! Maybe its because I lost my nostalgia goggles but while GTAIII is a solid game its not neccesarilly a timeless game. I respect it for bulding the ground work that future enteries would build upon and for innfluencing practically every open world game to follow Even if Driver technically did it first and for successfully making the transition to 3D. That said if you really are in the mood for a retro GTA even Vice City holds up better but that has more to do with it being a more polished successor to GTA III than it does to do with anything else. Not to mention this version has a lot of Windows 98 related compatibilty issues that made my trip down memory lane quite brief and I dont think GTA III is good enough to justify me patching the hell out of it to get it working fan made patches. I only reccomend it for people who lost their PS2 or Xbox copy.
