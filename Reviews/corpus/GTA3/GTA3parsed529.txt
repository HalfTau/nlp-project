I fell in love with this game when I was in grammar school. Nothing more then just going around and killing people and causing all sorts of mayhem. Me and my friends use to just go around causing all hell and laughing about it. I still have my original copy for the ps2 along with all the others that ill never get rid of because its a classic. Its always fun to come back to this game and beating it has become so easy. Im glad to now have a digital copy and i can play it at any time i decide to. This game is a true meaning of what GTA is suppose to be and will forever be one of my favorites
