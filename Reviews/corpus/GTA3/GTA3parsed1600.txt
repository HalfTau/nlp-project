Remember how I was excited when the game was just released. At that time it was real breakthrough. Ok, it was 13 years ago. Now you cannot impress one with 3D and openworld. But still this game has its own taste. If you dont mind old graphics and pretty high difficulty you can get dozens of fun here.Apart from that, theres also few negative moments. Ok, you can not swim. Ok, theres only cars and not a damn bike. But the absence of a map is driving my fcking crazy at the beginning. Theres really big city ok, not so big comparing to the next chapters, so give me a normal map and not a mocking circle in the corner.
