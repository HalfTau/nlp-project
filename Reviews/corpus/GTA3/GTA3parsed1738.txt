If you play this game as it was meant to be played  as a missionbased game, with the possibility of diversion  its the best GTA by far, and one of the best games ever made.The cars are unstable and break apart quickly, and walking is not a viable option for more than a block, meaning that you will have to keep commiting crimes and attracting police attention. This ensures that the pacing will never bog down. The high difficulty of the latter missions is completely necessary to the game, as it brings out the greatest strengths of the open world genre  the player will often HAVE to get creative and find an alternative way to solve a mission, because the standard way is either too hard or outright impossible. Couple this with a ton of potential for utter chaos to occur, due to rather chaotic, loose mechanics, and you have possibly the greatest use of the freeroaming model ever.An utterly brilliant game. Its not perfect  it could be larger, the story could be a bit more complex, and the shooting could be a little better, but dont get Vice City or San Andreas over this. Theyre good, but this is, even after all these years, still the best freeroaming action game that we have.
