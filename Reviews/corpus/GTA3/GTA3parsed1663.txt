What can you say about Grand Theft Auto 3, very fun game worth buying. Playing with cheats/mods is really fun, the gta community has so much to offer in regards to mods/guides/cheats.Maybe the game  is not suitable for those who didnt play back in the day, it has not aged well.Big down side to the game is once you complete Sayonara Salvatore portland becomes annoying to drive around, both gangs start shooting you with uzi and shotguns.
