Grand Theft Auto 3 is well regarded as a pioneer in the third person sandbox game genre. It can be compared to other genre defining games like Wolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 before it.The core foundation that GTA3 rests its hat on is simplicity. It has a very simple premise, after being betrayed during a robbery you set out for revenge in Liberty City. The story is full of mostly entertaining characters and mostly fun missions. That simplicity works double for the gameplay.GTA3 introduced and perfected a gameplay loop that the franchise has still kept for the most part. Theres a set of story missions you undergo inorder to unlock further parts of the game and see what happens next in the story. Alternatively you can ignore the story and explore the city at your leasure. While doing sidequests like driving a taxi cab or looking for hidden collectables. This core gameplay loop of missions, sidequests, collectables with a freely explorable open world wasnt a common thing at the time, and it blew people away with how impressive the whole experience was. At the same time though because there have been so many games based off it, it occasionally feels like it lacks an identity compared to the glut of sandbox games that came after it.This is fundamentally the base game that all future sandbox games jumped off from. Its a game I like to go back to every so often to remind myself where it all started. And to remind myself that Rockstar set the bar pretty high from the start and just kept going from there.
