The first real GTA as we know it today.  So much better than the topdown GTA and GTA 2.If youve been spoiled by newer GTAs already this one might seem rough.  I went into it only having played Vice City so I didnt have too many issues with it.  Of course its been a while since I finished so I dont remember all of the details.8/10
