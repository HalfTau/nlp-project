I remember playing GTA2 back in the 90s. But when GTA3 was released, thats where it all started for me.I really really like this game. Even if its old, its still better than VC, better than SA...Im not sure its also better than IV  V ... I havent played them, I have a really old computer....Some missions are really hard, if you are not used to  play fps games... It can be very annoying to aim, and you have to be quick too which I am not...Anyway ... I like the way it can feel casual, you can cruise around all you like. I like driving taxis around and make money, finding secret packages, selling cars for cash... You can even grab a policecar or ambulance and go on vigilantemissions, while listening to the 9 different radiostations, or your own mp3 player ... This was so original, back when the game released...You start the game on an island called Portland, the bridge to the other areas are closed due to repairs... First time you drive around in Portland can be very confusing, but as you learn the map, you can easily make you way around.When you have completed like at least 10 missions the bridge will be repaired. That means there is a whole new area to get to know, it is a pretty big map, and you can get lost pretty quick. There are new cars, new secrets and some new weapons I thinkSome CONSI have completed half the game, but got stuck on a really tough mission.... Some missions have a timer, but most dont. There are usually multiple ways you can complete the missions... It would have been awesome if you could skip the missions that are too hard, and I wish I could just save the game at any time... But i still love this game...The company behind this game sucks... They couldnt stop being greedy  just read a review for San Andreas if you dont know what Im talking about...
