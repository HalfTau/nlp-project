This game is Legendary for me and is the first game i can recall playing when i was just a little kid and what i attibute to getting me into gaming as a whole. I still remember what i did when i first played it so long ago. I found a shotgun, shot a cop, and stole a blue station wagon in the red light district. GTA 3 was a major step for games as a whole and practically pioneered the Sandbox genre and laid the framework for what it is today. Graphically this game obviously does not look the best but it by no means looks the worst when you consider this game is almost 16 years old i would say its graphics have held very well given how ancient this game is and as a plus this game also supports native 1080p resolution.  Even though the graphics are impressive for the age the main selling point nowadays would come from having the chance to experience one of the most revolutionary games ever developed and even today GTA 3s storyline and exploration of Liberty City still provide a fun and compelling experience that is worthy of your time.
