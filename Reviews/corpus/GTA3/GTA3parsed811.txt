This game is a great way to see GTAs beginnings. Its a classic and reallly feels like it. If youre coming from future GTA games like I am, youll see how stillplayable the game is. It might look older, but gameplay wise and atmosphere wise its the same. I recommend you listen to the chatterbox radio station for some laughs, it really adds a layer of quality to the game.In my older review i downvoted the game because it felt unplayable to me. ive now figured out that you can lock on while shooting in these older GTA games, which I didnt know. The standard PC control layout isnt very good, I highly recommend you install this directinput mod so you can use an Xbox or Playstation controllerAs well as this game fix to make the  game less buggyBoth of these mods are free and easy to install, and will make your experience SO much better.If youre using a 360 controller like I am, RB is to lock on. Im sure you can lock on with pc controls in classic mode too, but I havent tried that.Happy Gaming!Old ReviewIts really interesting to see how the 3D open world GTA experience first started out.However, the gameplay is extremely flawed and somehow manages to be harder than Dark Souls. The controls are terrible and guns just dont work.Watch this one on YouTube unless youre here for nostalgic reasons, or youll just end up giving yourself a headache.
