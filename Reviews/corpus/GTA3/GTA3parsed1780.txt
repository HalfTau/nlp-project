The game that started the phenomenon. Theres a lot of fun to be had tearing through the city on  your own personal crime wave. Offensive, yes, but the game doesnt take itself seriously. Its fun precisely because you do stuff you would never do in real life. Arcade action.While fun, the game doesnt hold up well against modern openworld games. Some missions can be difficult, so be prepared to try and fail multiple times. Difficulty isnt a problem, though. I like a challenge. Poor controls on the PC, limited camera control, lack of ingame map, and overall fragility of your character/vehicles cause a lot of frustration. Half the time I feel like Im fighting the game itself, rather than overcoming a challenge. The costs of failure is high, and you are more likely to just reload a previous save, meaning youll need to visit your safe house to save between every mission. I may eventually finish this game, but I have to take it in doses. Im hoping Vice City and San Andreas are less frustrating.About controls... I like to use keyboard/mouse on foot and an XBox 360 controller while driving. The game does support controllers, but it doesnt recognize all of the buttons. If you want to use a controller, save yourself some grief and spend an extra 10 on XPadder. Its still not great, but at least youll be able to use all buttons. Youll need them.
