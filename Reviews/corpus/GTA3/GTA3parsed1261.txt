For those having issues with the menus on startup, Press ShiftTab to pull up the steam overlay. Once the overlay comes up, release tab, but keep holding shift. The menu will phase in to view until you release shift. Then Shifttab again to close the overlay. Youll probably have to do it on each start up menu, but once you are in game the menus are fine.Quite an odd fix but it works on demand for me. Hope this helps!
