I still rememebr the first time I played GTAIII, after experiencing the first two, I wasnt expecting immersion at this level. The acting in this game set the standard for many Rockstar games to come, as if Max Payne wasnt good enough!  The open world seemed impossibly large at the time, and the mission loading screens made it feel like you were just making small transitions, not actually waiting for a game to load.
