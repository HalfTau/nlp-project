Doesnt work on mordern PCs. It plays but ALL the menu text is invisible, and you have to blindly select menu options, even when saving your game etc. Shame. Rockstar still sell their old stuff but leave it all unplayable.UPDATE Continuing a saved game just causes it to freeze forever, so you cant even load/save.And yes, Ive thoroughly looked for solutions for hours, and Silents patches didnt work.
