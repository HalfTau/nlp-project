The granddaddy of them all. I played this game back on the PS2, and repurchased the game for Steam so I could have it in perpetuity. All modern sandbox games owe everything to this series, and this game in particular.In case youve never been exposed to a sandbox game before, you effectively are dropped into a city which lives  you can go around to various contacts looking for missions to accomplish usually involving driving and shooting, explore the city looking for sights and items to collect, or even accomplish random missions like running a taxi or putting out fires with a fire engine. This game marks what was effectively the first time this sort of freedom was in a 3D game.The games story puts a lowdown person fresh out of going to jail into a criminal underworld where he slowly climbs his way to the top to get revenge. Ive played through this game multiple times and while its ultimately the least of the trilogy, it is the giant whose shoulders the other two stands upon.I have not yet dabbled in the mod scene for this game, but searching around seems to imply theres a fairly healthy number of them to pick from, so if thats your thing, its worth a look. At any rate, this is a classic which should be a part of anyones collection. Very, very highly recommended.
