Is it GTA V? No. Did it set a precedent for all games during the time of its release? Definitely.Clunky controls. Low vocal quality. Good voice acting. Retro graphics. Small map. Short game. Terrible music.But its all worth it.If youre playing with a controller, I suggest downloading a controller mod from GTA Garage. It syncs the buttson very well  explains how to install it easily.
