Feel nostalgia if its not your first visit to Liberty city. Feel scared, if it is.Try to drive clear with no Carmageddonstyle  but youll leave pool of blood behind anyway.Enjoy new city, get lost with no markers on the map.Find Dodo, fall into the sea.Escape from killers, collect money from the plane, bomb another plane, kill enemies just to see the third plane. Fall into the sea on every plane you try.Have fun with car acrobatics, get stuck in the bench.Ride, ride, ride more. Try to look around the city while riding  feel yourself blind.Ride through the street of any gang  be blown up after a second.Start to play in the evening  discover yourself in another week.This game is a great song for mess, explosions and relaxing in fire,
