GTA III isnt as great as GTA San Andreas, GTA IV or GTA V but it i still great for one purposeGTA III was groundbreaking when it first came out. An open world third person shooter was not really a thing before GTA III. If the game has been pushed to the side by GTA SA, GTA IV and GTA V, then why do I still like this game? BecauseThis game runs on my laptop. Bored at school? Just open GTA III ON YOUR LAPTOP. Wanna kill a  between your history and chemistry lessons? Go right ahead. A solid 30 FPS experience. One downside though I dont have a mouse for my laptop so shooting is a bit of a problem. P But this game wasnt made for laptops. Laptops werent really a thing back in 2001.GTA III doesnt have the great storyline of GTA SA.GTA III doesnt have the great map of GTA V.GTA III dosent have the great hand to hand combat of GTA IV.But GTA III works somewhat as a replacement of GTA SA and GTA V when you are bored. It doesnt take 3 hours to load to every menu like GTA V and it doesnt call you a BUSTA! STRAIGHT BUSTA! all the time.The story is okay and the graphicsa are okay considering that it is 16 years old. I just wished that the FPS lock of 30 FPS would be released on the PC so that I can get 60 FPS but it is 16 years old so ofcourse the support has been ended. Damnit. It is a fun GTA SA/V mini when you arent around on your main computer and just have to go out and kick some low resolution
