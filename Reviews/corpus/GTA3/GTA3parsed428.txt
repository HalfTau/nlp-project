Amazing game... if you can get it to work.Buy it else where.  Steam no surprise is absoluteYou wont be able to see the startup menu at least on windows 10.  Even with any other compatibility.There is no support, claiming its the other company.I used to have the actual CDRom.  Worked flawlessly.Do not buy from these .
