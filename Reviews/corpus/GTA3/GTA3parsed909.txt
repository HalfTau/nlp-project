First 3D GTA.Even though it doesnt have many features compared to GTASA its my favorite one in the series. Also has not very popular multiplayer mod which is awesome for such old game BUT all servers are dead because of hackers. For that I wont rate it as either positive or negative one.StorySide MissionsGangsCheats and ModsOld grandma with shopping bags highkicking you in the faceDrugsBadmute MCNo customizing except paynspray and 8bombNo motorbikesNo helicoptersDoesnt support gamepads natively
