Grand Theft Auto III... been almost 14 years I believe since released, and still is a huge success as it was the first GTA game to be featured in 3D. Before I had Steam, I played this on my PlayStation 2 and then bought the CDROM version of it.. was not any difference really but I still prefer it over GTA Vice City, San Andreas, Liberty City Stories, and GTA IV not GTA V though, because it is way better! since this game of all GTA games, is by far the goriest if you have not noticed... And that Claude Speed as a mute, makes him by far the best GTA protagonist of the entire Grand Theft Auto Franchise.. Since nothing is better than a mute human lol. If you like GTA games, do not waste your time and buy this one now! youll love it! I know I do...
