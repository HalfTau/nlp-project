When this game came out it was revolutionary. Now, its age is very visible, especially in the graphics department. The missions can become repetetive and some aspects of the game are annoying. But I have found myself forgiving the game all of its flaws. It still is a very good open world game, and it does have its moments. Give it a chance, you might like it. And if you like it enough you will find yourself putting in 50 hours in the effort to 100 complete it. Whatever you decide to play, have fun.
