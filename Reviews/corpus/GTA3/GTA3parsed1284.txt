The game that singlehandedly reinvented the openworld sandbox genre is just as much fun today as it was way back in 2001. The dark and grimy streets of Liberty City provide endless opportunities for exploration, experimentation and unabashed carnage. Guns, explosions and car chases, the holy trinity that has more or less become the bread and butter of the GTA series, were first brought to the forefront with this game. If you can look past the oldgen graphics and sometimes blocky textures, what youll find is one of the most iconic games of all time, as well as one of the most infinitely replayable.
