If the video games of the 1980s are remembered for Super Mario Bros and the 90s are remembered for Mortal Kombat and sadly Superman 64, the early 2000s will be remembered for Grand Theft Auto III. It introduced a truly nonlinear concept onto gaming and emphasized choice and freedom over everything at the time. While it is mostly known for its violence and the fact you could have terribly animated car sex with a hooker, do not forget its godfather inspired storyline and quite frankly hilarious dialog. Nothing is more hilarious than hearing a police helicoptor pilot exclaim hes going to kill you when the copilot is going YOU CANT SAY THAT, ITS NOT IN THE BOOK!. The controls are sluggish by todays standard and if youre wanting the definative GTA game on this engine it is San Andreas you should be looking at, but lets not forget the game that started all.Saints row is still a better game than GTAIV however, deal with it.
