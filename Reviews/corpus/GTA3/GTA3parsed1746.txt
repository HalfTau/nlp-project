Grand Theft Auto 3 is the first game in the series to be in 3D. Its a fantastic jump too. Being the first open world 3D GTA it has its fantastic but not a perfect game. The City is Liberty City Same City as GTA IV but more more different  and is parody of New York, you play and Claude Speed Who has no voice after being betrayed by your now ex girlfriend and being put in prison you escape after your police van is attacked and now youre on a revenge trip. The City is large for being the first 3D GTA game and not as alive as Vice City Vice City only came out not even a year after GTA 3. The Radio is decent having Push it to the Limit otherwise there is only a few recognizeable songs. The Story isnt too great. Your character doesnt talk all he does is go to a person and get a job and then execute it. Not much more than that just rinse and repeat. The jobs range from Assassinations to picking up hookers and driving them to the local Police Ball. The Combat is something I want to touch on too. Not too great. The camera can be wonky at times and the shooting seems clunky Much more improved in Vice City. There is side content to do. Like Taxi driving and Vigilante Missions though both arent too interesting but at least they are there for people who like to do that kind of stuff. The Driving is practally the same throughout all the 3D GTAs so theres not much to say except the driving is good but not like a racer and it feels arcadey but fun Considering it lasted 3 games each being a little more refinded. All in all GTA 3 is still a fantastic experience. Does it still hold up today? Not really depending on your playstyle and if you can deal with not too refined game mechanics and bugs and werid controls. 7.3/10.
