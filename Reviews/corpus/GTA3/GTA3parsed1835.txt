This game came out in 2001. By those standards, this game was golden. A full 3D city to drive around, shoot, and get into trouble. Set the standard for modern sandbox games. By todays standard it doesnt fare so well. Besides the main missions there isnt much to do, and it has very limited graphics for today. It also has issues with modern systems. Widescreen does not work so youll need to turn that off to achieve 169 resolutions properly. I recommend it because this is a gem of video game history. I personally enjoy playing old games, but it requires a lot of patience. 9/10
