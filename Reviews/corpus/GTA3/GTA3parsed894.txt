Grand Theft Auto III is a fantastic game, the gameplay, while somewhat stiff, is still pretty fun especially with cheats, but the story is basic youre a criminal out for revenge on a former partner that screwed you over. Despite how generic the story might seem, its still fun to play through, even after all these years. And the soundtrack is pretty small, especially compared to later installments in the GTA series, but you can play your own music ingame, which negates the whole theres barely a soundtrack problem.The side missions Paramedic, Firefighter, etc. are much easier than they are in later games, but are still challenging due to the aforementioned stiff gameplay, but I think you can learn to live with it, especially since the rewards for completing them are so good with the exception of the taxi mission. The collectables, which are a staple of the GTA series, return in the form of Rampages, Hidden Packages, and Stunt Jumps. If I remember correctly, those are the only three, but they are still satisfying/rewarding to complete. Also, this is the only GTA game with detachable limbs i.e. limbs can be shot off, which is pretty funny with the crude graphics.At the time of this review, GTA III is 9.99 USD. Its definetely worth a shot, considering its low price which gets even lower during sales. I give it a solid 7.5/10.
