This is a great nostalgic game that brings back many memories. I beat the game at least twice as far as I remember that the gameplay is superb and the environment is nice. I definetely recommend it to everyone who loves open world organized crime video games especially the GTA series. This is probably my favorite GTA to be honest. The very first one I played from the franchise. I will give this a 10/10. Buy this one sale and you wont regret it. Besides modding this game is addiciting as hell. D !!!! LMFAO XD
