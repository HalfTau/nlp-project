Besides the poor car physics, this game flowed the direction of GTA wonderfully. It embraced the culture as the first ever real sandbox game, leaping graphics, gameplay and an overall great game which has now lead to a fantastic franchise. I have now finished it about 10x and tho its old, its still alot of fun. Yes GTA has now fixed the kinks but damn this game really was high qulity and espechially for its time  thats why i rate it as the best GTA ever.
