great game, but I dont recommend you get it for pc for the simple reasons of, 1 there is sound bug in the game world you cant hear all the dialogue the peds are saying and it cuts out and there is no fix or help to fix this annoying bug in the steam forums whatsoever. 2 very slow loading ive expericenced, sometimes wont do crap unless you enable the steam layout and directly exit out of it which is very annoying pcs are suposed to load games quick but the forced loading by activating the steam layout makes this a major pain in the butt! so i closing i would not reccomend this game on steam,, great game though but stick to the console versions of it....
