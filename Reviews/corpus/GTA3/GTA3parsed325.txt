PROS Set a solid foundation for 3D GTA and sandbox games as a whole Soundtrack is catchy once it grows on you As always with GTA games, its fun to go on rampagesCONS Limited guns Nothing to do with money besides spend it on guns. armor and ammo Super small soundtrack Game gets tedious towards the last third of the gameIt might seem like I hate GTA3, but I dont. Its a fun game, especially to go back and see what they did here that they did in future games. From the perspective of someone who played it in 2001 I get why people called it one of the best games ever. From the perspective of someone playing it in 2017, Vice City and San Andreas blow this game out of the water.SCORE 7/10
