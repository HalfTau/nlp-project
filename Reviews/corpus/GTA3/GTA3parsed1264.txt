I wouldnt say the game has aged gracefully in terms of graphics and claude is an absolute piece of wood in terms of personality but its the world hes in and the people he interacts with that makes gta III and enternaining game. But if you have played other gtas before this one i only recomend it if you want to see how gta got its start
