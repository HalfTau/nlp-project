The game that started it all. If youre a huge GTA fan like me, you want this game just to add it to your collection. But, it is the worst of all the 3D GTA games, smallest map, worst control and camera, and shortest sound track with not too many catchy songs, except flashback. I recommend this game if you love GTA and modding the game out and just having fun as if it were new, but to a new demographic I would not recommend it, get GTA SA the best one of the 3rd gen 3D Gta games.
