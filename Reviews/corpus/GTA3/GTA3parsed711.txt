It certainly hasnt aged all that gracefully, but damn if it hasnt left a still noticable impact on the gaming landscape as we know it. Theres a lot that can be said about Grand Theft Auto III, from the initial media perception to how it shaped free roam and open world. But at this point why bother when I can ask the simple question Is it a good game?Well sort of, as mentioned prior GTA III hasnt aged that well, although still tolerable it lacks many refinements brought by later franchise entries and youd likely not play it as much as you would years ago upon release as more enjoyable games exist. However this is not to say the campaign itself isnt worth playing, it may not be as well written as the likes of IV or even VC but it has its own charm ignoring obvious clichs and maybe youll get something out of seeing how far GTA has come.
