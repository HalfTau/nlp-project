In my personal opinon, I feel that Rockstar and Steam shouldnt have the right to sell such a broken product without even as little as a warning about how bad this version of the game is. And if youre running Windows 10 like I am? HA! Good luck...cause youre gonna need it. I got this game to run better by setting up a PS2 emulator for my PC and playing it that way. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY for an otherwise AMAZING experence.
