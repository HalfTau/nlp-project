This game is really good, but its sad when the PC port is the worst version, the PS2 version is less polished, but looks nicer, the XBOX version is amazing. Id recommend buying the XBOX port, this is still a good game, but it feels rather dated, even compared to Vice City, cause it suffers from the problem GTA IV had, where everything is brown, black, gray, and rather dull.Bottom line, you should play this game, but its probably the worst port. Worse as in a little bit. Not Doom 32x bad.
