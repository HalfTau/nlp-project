Where to begin....First off this will forever be my favorite GTA game out of any and all of them made and to be made. This was my first GTA game I ever played on playstation 2 and have been in love with it ever since. Im glad I can now play it on steam whenever I want and have had tremendous amount of fun beating and killing people all over again. Now graphics could be a lot better compared to newer versions of GTA but newer GTA games have become to complex for a game that should just be about missions, shooting, killing and blowing up things. Now you have worry about car insurance and houses and other stuff that doesnt belong in GTA. Next thing you know youll be able to have families and live in the suburbs like the Sims games. This is the orignial and I wouldnt change a thing about it because in the end yes this game is old, the graphics arent the greatest but I cant still blow things up, kill people, and still have fun playing it not having to worry about other useless stuff compared to some of the newer versions of GTA
