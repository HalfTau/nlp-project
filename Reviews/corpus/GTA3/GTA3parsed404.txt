Its an old game and has some issues like no world map, permanently locking out you from 100 completion if youre not careful, but otheriwise its a fine game with a dark humor.However I cant recommend it after the recent events with Take Two and OpenIV. So unless you think its okay for a publisher to try an kill the modding community, dont buy this or any other of their games.
