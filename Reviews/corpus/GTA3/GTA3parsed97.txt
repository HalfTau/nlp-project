Grand Theft Auto 3 was very influential to the thirdperson sandbox genre and it was a major factor to the success of PlayStation 2 and, consequently, its vast library of games. However, even in comparison to its spinoffs that are Vice City and San Andreas, it did not age well at all. I did 3 playthroughs of this game  in 2002, 2009 and 2018, and only on that 3rd playthrough Ive been able to notice its glaring issues.The lack of a full map makes exploring Liberty City and completing missions very uncomfortable the weapon balance is thrown out the window  M16 and the pumpaction shotgun are very overpowered, which results driving through hostile areas utterly infuriating. Exploring Liberty City is rather boring and its depressive, gray atmosphere doesnt help. The radio is rather forgettable, except for Flashback FM and Game FM, personally. Sure, typing in cheats and spend an hour mowing down everything is fun, but VC and SA simply have more toys to play with. The game itself is rather short  if youre not a 100 completionist and only play through main and optional missions, youll most likely be done with the game after 9 to 13 hours. Notice that I havent written anything about the story, since it clearly wasnt intended by Rockstar to put much effort on.I understand that AT THE TIME, all this stuff was completely new  I myself spent quite a lot of time on it with amazement back in 2002 before I was able to play Vice City a year later. Even though I still have fond memories of it, a lot of time has passed. GTA 3 earned its place on the gaming history, but it should be played as exactly that  a piece of history.P.S. No comments on the Steam version since its objectively a pile of hot garbage. Oh, and Rockstar/TakeTwo abhor PC and modding  avoid buying any of their titles.
