Aging is rough on open world games and I look back on this having had no childhood experience with it. Without the benefit of nostalgia and from a modern day viewpoint, I cant recommend getting this game. The story and dialogue is good and the concepts it introduced were truly revolutionary but if youre like me and want to play the classics, maybe start with something a bit newer. And I dont want to criticize the game for technical limitations but it seems this is where some of the difficulty like no mission restarts, crashes, and only being able to save in one place come from.Oh yeah and it says gamepad support but youll actually need to go install a few input mods to get the game to recognize a gamepad correctly.
