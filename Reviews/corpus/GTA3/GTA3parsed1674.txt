This is not as good as vice city or san andreas but it is the first one of the 3d universe and it inspired all open world games we have today.It has missions that can be really hard, gun play is also hard and iritating because you have no autoaim like console versions.so you better need to have a good mouse and some good aim to hit ennemies from long distances because you are dead in a second if people are shooting at you.Also i need to note something bad and that is......AI... The ai in this game is the most iritating and one of the only bad things about it.especially car ai, people drive likein this game and they keep crashing into you.
