Hell, it may have aged horridly, and its a long shot from the best that title still goes to Vice City but I love this game to death. It started one of my favorite franchises and kicked off the 3rd person sandbox death frenzy we know as Grand Theft Auto.Also you can edit the handling, and that makes for some hilarious scenarios.9/10Pick it up someday if you havent already.
