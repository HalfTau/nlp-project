There is something to be said for simplicity. More recent titles have taken the series in new directions and up to new heights but, theres just something about how pure and untamed GTA was back then. GTA3 is just classic GTA but 3D. Its the reason people still play Doom nowadays. Simple and clean action with no strings attached.
