Grand Theft Auto lll  the first 3D game of the famous game series crated by Rockstar games. Radio Stations . Some bugs and glitches can be used for an advantage in gameplay. Interesting game plot Tires cannot be popped, so you can drive free Mr. Player. Rewards from side missions are really helpful. Almost all Sportcars, are quite weak, and get crashed/destroyed easily. Emergency vehicles dont have radio. Interesting game plot causes almost all gangs 5 out of 7 in Liberty City become hostile to you, and it makes harder to travel in some of districts. Not enough story missions. personally for me
