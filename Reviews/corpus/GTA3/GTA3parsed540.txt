I absolutely love this game. is harder than most gtas but personally. i love that. the fact that is different and harder compared to other GTA games. the outdated part is the fact that the reso cant go really high but a modfix can fix that easily and you will surely have fun with this game. i really recommend it to anyone who likes some classic games.my final rating is 8/10 being the reason for that its controls which can be confusing with a joystick for who started playing this game on the ps2 like i did
