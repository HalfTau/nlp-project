While innovative at the time of release, GTA III hasnt aged well. The lack of verticality, the lack of different vehicles, the limited arsenal, and the subpar controls make this a hard game to recommend especially if youve played the far superior sequel, Vice City. If youve never played a GTA, this is good place to start. If youre used to the more modern titles, skip this one.
