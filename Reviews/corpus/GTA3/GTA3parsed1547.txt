This is the game that started it all  the craze of third person, open world sandbox games. GTA III has a immersive story that you follow, and along the way, wreak havok on Liberty City to your hearts content. With a varied range of weapons and vehicles, achieve your goals in any way you feel like it, or just explore what Liberty City has to offer. Time has not been so kind to the graphics of GTA III, and animations are a bit wonky and broken, but that doesnt detract from the fun that will be had during the whole game. On top of all this as well the game features fleshed out characters and stories than few games had achieved at the time, and a very memorable soundtrack.Replayability, unfortunately, is one of GTA IIIs shortcomings as theres not much to engage in after the main story has been passed, save for rather bland side missions, and blowing up Liberty City for the 100th time, theres not much after to look forward to. 8.6/10
