I dont really know what to say about this game. I mean, I didnt get the chance of playing it on its release, Ive skipped straight to Vice City. Either way, some years later the curiosity about this title started to grow on me so eventually I decided to give it a chance. The first thing that I noticed is that the navigational resources that we have avaiable nowadays can really make everything much easier. In that game you cant really get to rely so much on that so you gotta pay attention to the map to realize where you are, where youre heading to, whats the best way to get there etc. The graphics are quite outdated but thats not much of a problem if youre more concerned with the entertainment value instead of the looks. The story is quite simple You start from the bottom and every mission you complete makes you climb another step of the ladder, allowing you to meet some people with influence, unlocking stuff etc. Therere some radio stations available but the songs get old really quick, trust me. Besides, therere some missions where you need to race against the clock that are simply unforgiving. In other words, its the kind of game that was made specifically for Duke Nukem yeah, because he got balls of steel. Overall, if you dont have much patience I recommend you to stay away from this game. Now, if youre up to a good challenge, then definitely go for it.
