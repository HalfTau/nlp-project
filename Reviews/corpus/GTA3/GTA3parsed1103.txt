First grand theft auto game i ever played and not my favourite due to all the flaws. The only gta game ive ever completed at the time of this review is gta 5 which is the easiest by far but these older games are still really bloody fun and deserve good scores, they are really difficult to complete too especially this one.I first played this game on the original xbox at my uncles house and i was about 4 or 5 years old and this game didnt seem all that violent and i hardly ever did missions i used to just run around a kill people and have fun but now that i have the steam version and around 10 years later im actually old enough to play it and i understand the game and enjoy it even more, i havnt yet completed it but will eventually hopefully and man this game is worth buying.I recommend you buy the bundle with GTA3, GTA VC, and GTA SA. Otherwise you arent getting all the value you should be getting. play each game for about 35 hours before you judge them because even though they are old they are still amazing gta games. i havnt played a gta i havnt liked although ive never played VC Stories, and LC Stories or Chinatown wars or even GTA 1 but played all the others and havnt completed any besides 5 and ive gotten close on pretty much all of them. but anyway im just yacking on now.Pros  Interesting characters besides Claude the protagonist who doesnt talk, big map, nice cars, good weather effects, decent graphics, fun missions, money is easy to make but easy to spend too, really good soundtrack.Cons  Terrible combat system which got me killed many times, not a whole lot of guns, some pretty hard and frustrating mission were in there, lifeless protagonist, cars felt too slow sometimes, cops were hard to lose, poorly explained mission objectives for some missions, soundtrack is good but not many songs.Good outweighs the bad here but could be much better. By the GTA 3 trilogy for GTA 3, VC and SA and its well worth it.7 out of 10. could be 8, 9 or 10 but the missions are unbalanced and some required about 20 retries for me and really annoyed me and im not even halfway yet but its still pretty awesome.
