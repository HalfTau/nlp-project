What this guy saidCurrently the game publisher connected to this game is praticpating in anticonsumer activities. Though Rockstar Studios is a fantastic company their owners have recently banned mods on GTA V.I would recommend GTA III to anyone but at the moment I can not give a positive review to any game that TakeTwo studio is connected to.
