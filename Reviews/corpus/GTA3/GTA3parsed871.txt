Classic game. As good now as it was back then.Might require some additional maintenance to get it running to optimal standards for todays PCs or, in some cases, to even get it running in general.The only thing that hasnt aged well are the controls, in particular, the aiming. Would personally recommend using a controller, switiching to autoaim, and mapping the controller out to match the PS2 controls.So, it does require some effort on your part to get it really working, but, once you do, its really worth it.
