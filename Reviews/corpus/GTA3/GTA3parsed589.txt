Grand Theft Auto III has truly changed the video game insdustry. It was first release in 2001 on the Sony Playstation 2 console. I still have my original PS2 copy and still play on both PC and PS2 from time to time. One of the best games ever made. GTA3 came out and set a new standard in gaming. Most games afterwards have used many aspects from this game to help created better games from that moment on. This game was the first of its kind, 3rd person free roam 3D game, walk or run anywhere, using cars to drive anywhere you wanted, and the choice to complete missions or not. No rules, except police try to stop you if you start to be destructive and violent. GTA3 really does deserve the Test of Time award. All real gamers own or have played this game before and know exactly what Im talking about. If you have never played this game, then you better get on it.
