This game was always a favorite of mine, I used to just skip the missions and focus on smashing into people, then when I learned how to save at age 7 I started out the missions and wouldnt ever stop even if the missions were frustrating. Eventually I lost the disk and was no longer able to play it. I highly recommend not only for nostalgia purposes but also because it is very fun, in many ways a nice storyline with good conflicts, and a great openworld. After a while it can get a little boring, but is always replayable. Cheats also make it fun, like itsallgoingmaaad and weaponsforall.Many may not want to hear another nostalgia story, but if you read it thanks.
