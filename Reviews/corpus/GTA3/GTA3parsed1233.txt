Firstly, its Grand Theft Auto. Any title is awesome besides GTA IVs PC port, but thats on a performances POV and GTA III is the first of three games that are set on IIIs universe, therefore Rockstar names it the GTA III trilogy. I mainly played the game again for nostalgia remember, its from 2002, I know right, time goes by so fast and for the fact that I hadnt truly completed the game in the past. Setting that aside, GTA IIIs story is not original but its only a pretense for the crazy missions you will be doing. You will always have some people you get to work with the mafia, yakuza, etc your character goes to, to receive a mission, then on and on until you complete all of them. Voice acting is pretty impressive considering the games age, and there many bugs that irritated me coming down the stairs and getting launched into the air... but nonetheless it was a great experience. I dont know if I should really recommend GTA III because you will probably just be playing GTA V.
