I want to like this game, as its decently laid out and easy to follow.  But Im having a ridiculously difficult time completing some of the missions because of the cops, to the point where I had to Rage Quit to keep myself from throwing something at the computer screen.  So Ill recommend it for people who enjoy these games and have more patience than me.
