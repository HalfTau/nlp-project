Grand Theft Auto III is the most infuriating sequel since HalfLife 2  for all of us lore junkies, its just a real trying time. Where has Claude gone after the end of GTA2? Why have we gone back in time twelve years? Why are the graphics so bad now compared to the stylised magic of the previous instalment?Rockstar should have just given up while they were ahead. And dont get me started on the numbering system from this one onwards, none of it makes any sense! Actually, whats the deal with this one  isnt this actually Grand Theft Auto IV?! How dare Rockstar ignore London 1969?!
