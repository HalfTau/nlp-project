Why, oh why, oh WHY does this game not have a restart mission button? I spend about 50 of playtime running from the REALLY ANNOYING safe house the only place where you can save the game to the mission start points, go through all the load screens, work on the mission for a few seconds before realising that I will not be able to complete the mission, reload from last save point then do it all again. This has become too much of an annoyance for me to continue playing this game, which is a real pity because the actual gameplay is not too bad.
