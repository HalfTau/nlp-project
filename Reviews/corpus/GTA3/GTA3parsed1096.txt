I bought this game after playing Grand Theft Auto IV and V, two of the best Grand Theft Auto games ever, and I have to say that this game holds up well even after playing them. The weapons are fun to use, the driving is pretty good for a playstation 2 game, same for the graphics, it doesnt look as good as games like Kingdom Hearts but it still holds up even today. Id recommend getting this game over Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Mostly due to rockstar sending out a terrible patch that disabled the use of mods, removed various songs, and made the game overall terrible but only after buying Grand Theft Auto IV and V.
