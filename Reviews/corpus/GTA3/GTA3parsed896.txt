I am very biased and nostalgic about this game because i grew up with it. I bought it on steam just so i own another version of the game and to speedrun through it for the 100th time.Putting my biased opinion aside this game is nowhere near as good as vice city and san andreas. The story is not as good, the characters are not as memorable or interesting and the missions themselves are more varied and offer a lot more then gta 3.Vice city and san andreas are easily 10/10 games to me, even though i want to i cant logically give gta 3 a 10 because there is no denying that the others are better. Its also a very short game if you are just focusing on the missions there isnt much to do outside of missions anyway. It will obviously take you longer to beat on your first playthrough the later missions can be very frustrating and difficult to new players.9/10 Amazing
