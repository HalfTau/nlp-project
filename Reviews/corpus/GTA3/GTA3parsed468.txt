I grew up playing GTA3 when it came out on PS2.  Back then, it was awesome.Now, not so much.  Many cars have high centers of gravity such that they easily roll over when making turns, the surfaces result in your car crashing from the slightest of bumps, and cars are very fragile such that they blow up relatively easily not to mention they catch on fire and explode if theyre rolled over which can kill you very easily, especially if a gang is shooting you and the police decide to shoot at you because you ran over a gang member.The compass doesnt show points of interest outside of mission origins such that you have to pause the game and refer to an online map to catch your bearings if you want to find health, armor, gun shops, pay and sprays, or safehouses.  The targeting system the PS2 version came with is broken since you either use standard controls which dont target or classic controls which do but dont allow your mouse to freely aim.  A lot of the missions are ridiculous as well in that theyre timed while you have to weave through congested traffic and the computer gets insane handling.Lastly, many players complain of launching bugs.  I had a few myself, but thankfully got around them.  The menu button labels start transparent and gradually fade into appearance.  The game itself will freeze you computer in the intro screens unless you launch in compatibility mode as an administrator.  The game also defaults to poor resolutions that many players are unable to play without.15 years ago, this game was the bomb.  Now, it just has a lot of flaws that arent worth dealing with.
