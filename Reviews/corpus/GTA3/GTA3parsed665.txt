Recurring graphics glitch. A semiopaque image of the menu persists in gameplay when reloading a saved game. Requires a hard reboot to fix. Difficult/impossible to change controller key bindings some commands are not bound by default and the game would not let me assign them to a button. Refund requested after an hour of gameplay. Love the game, but this PC port is pretty much unplayable. What a shame.
