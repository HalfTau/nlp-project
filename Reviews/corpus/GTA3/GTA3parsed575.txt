The game has a big place in my heart. I used to have this game on the PlayStation 2 and its definitely a lot better than I remembered! Im very happy to be able to play this game once again! I would recommend this game if you havent played it or even if you have, GO FOR IT! and yeah it may not be everyones cup of tea but this game brings back good memories! and it is a step down from GTA V but still amazing! Id perfer San Anderas more but GTA III will always share a place in my heart! 3
