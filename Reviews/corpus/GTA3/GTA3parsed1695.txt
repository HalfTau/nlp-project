A great game that I had much fun with going back a few years on PS2. The controls are easy to get a grips with and for a price of 2.99 you cant go wrong. This game is all about the nostalgia of being back in Liberty City with 2002 graphics. But to be honest, graphics on these old GTAs never matter if you are a true GTA fan. The story line is as gripping as ever, also I reccommend once completed that you try out different cheat codes and mods to give a little more fun because once this game is completed it can be a little tedious to play. However, the game is an absoloute classic and goes down in my books as one of the best in its era.
