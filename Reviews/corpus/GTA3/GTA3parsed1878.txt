Grand Theft Auto is the definitive answer to all the critics of violence in video games. It simply smashes all those statements allowing you to kill anyone you see, destroy everything and have a good time too. It raised a lot of controversy that did nothing but help the sales, my guess is that its the best card Rockstar has under their sleeve and dont forget Jack Thompson. The series have seen a new life within 3D graphics, making Rockstar Games, become superstars. These days its easy to see the faults of the game, but its a very nice nostalgic feeling of returning to this world of crime and violence... Ah good days.
