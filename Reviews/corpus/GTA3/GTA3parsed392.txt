First youd be banned from GTA Online for something as simple as a singleplayer FOV mod. Then TakeTwo hired private investigators to stalk the developers of a nonGTA Online multiplayer mod and issued a ceaseanddesist. And now TakeTwo has destroyed the GTA modding community by issuing a ceaseanddesist letter to the OpenIV team, who have made GTA modding possible for almost a decade.Avoid anything published by TakeTwo like the plague.
