The progenitor of sandbox action games, Grand Theft Auto 3 combines good driving with decent combat  while the combat isnt impressive, combining it with popular driving gameplay and an open world to explore set off a revolution in game design. Throw in some fantastic radio stations Chatterbox FM! and a story thats a hilarious parody of crime fiction, and it still stands up well today.
