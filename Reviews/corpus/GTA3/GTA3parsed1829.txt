If youve got a lowend PC and some time to kill, you could do a lot worse than this.  Its a very good port and actually features some improvements over its console counterparts FPS style aiming ftw.  Its always nice to give respect to the classics, and this is definitely one that gets sweeter with age.  Theres something timeless about the rythm and cadence of exploring and completing missions in a game like this.  Something that the newer games have sadly lacked.  If youve got the inclination, get back to your roots sometime with this classic.  Youll probably have more fun than you think.
