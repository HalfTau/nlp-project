Theres a couple of mods that you should probably get just to make it somewhat more playable in terms of controls and UI and resolution type stuff, but its still a pretty solid game.It doesnt exactly live up to the nostalgia obviously. Youll probably play this game for an hour or so before having an itch to play the newest GTA game. Its sad, but these games didnt really age well and a lot of the mechanics are overly punishing. Like, I dont remember this as a kid, but good luck completing most of the later missions without failing them a dozen times first. I totally forgot how unforgiving this game was.Still fun, and usually on really deep sales, and for that reason alone I can recommend it.I still have an audio issue I cant resolve. Its almost like when theres too many things taking up the channels the audio crackles ie if I have the radio on, I crash into a pole while simultaneously hitting a person, the persons scream/shout will crackle like hell. Its very possible the original game was like that, both on PC and on PlayStation, but its a bit annoying and doesnt feel good for my speakers.If you didnt play through this game previously, like in your childhood, youll probably really not enjoy it. Most younger people who see this who have played modern GTAs think its really unfair and antiquated. And I mean, it is, but its historical and kinda neat in its own right.
