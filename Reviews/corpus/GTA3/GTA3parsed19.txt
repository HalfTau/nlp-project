Currently the proud owner of the title worst piece of sh!t Ive ever played on PC. You see, theres challenging which makes you think and enjoy the game even more, and then theres well we made some cheats, lets get them to use them!. I have never in my life more faulty a design, honestly I have no idea how they leave such shame on Steam. Im an average gamer, and if takes me 50 trials to finish a mission because they cant be bothered to add the minimal aiming function  well then fck you, Rockstar.
