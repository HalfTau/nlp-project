Does this game even need another review? Nevertheless here it is. Of course this game is absolutely amazing. I was playing GTA 12 when i probably shouldnt have been. hen i saw the first trailer for GTA 3 back in 2001, i couldnt believe it. Even at that young age i knew this would change everything. None of my friends understood why i was so excited aside from what it was, because i had played the first 2 and knew what we were in for. No one understood why it was titled GTA 3 because they had never heard of GTA 1 or 2 and were thinking it was a new title. he Grand Theft Auto series has come a long way, but nothing will ever compare to the original. after 15 years this is still my favorite one and i still get full enjoyment everytime i play it.
