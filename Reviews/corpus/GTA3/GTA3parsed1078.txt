GTA III is an excellent game. While there might not be so much to this one like the more current enstallments IV or V you really dont have that much to do beyond the main story missions, its still a classic in a great franchise.The story never misses a beat, and the gameplay is varied enough to where it wont get boring. Theres not really any filler, everything that happens during the story is relevant to the main plot.Besides the story, you can always fall back on the old GTA theme of grabbing some guns and causing some general havoc, and its just as fun in this installment than future enstallments. I found in the PC version the police are particularly aggressive making running from the police more challenging and fun, but I might just be forgetting playing it years ago on the XBox.Overall, anyone who is into openworld gaming should really play this game. Its a modern classic. Obviously, the majority of the content in this game might not be suitable for younger gamers, but honestly I believe it makes it more realistic and relatable.9/10.
