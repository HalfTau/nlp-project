Its definitely made its mark on the gaming industry, and despite being vastly inferior to its successors, Id still say give this one a try.Personally, I experienced some glitches, such as garbled splash screens, emergency vehicles appearing black, and splash screens not fading fully during gameplay, however Ive heard this is a Windows 10 issue lol.
