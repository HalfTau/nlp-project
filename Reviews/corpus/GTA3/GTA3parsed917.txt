Ok so this game and windows 10 arent the best of friends despite this, on the PS2 this was my first GTA game, played like an hour or two over multiple reinstalls of this on PC before finding the Ginput mod that makes controllers compatible etc, now its like playing on the PS2 again, no issues with the game apart from i get a flashing screen that would give epilepsy suffers a fit for sure, i have sorted this now but none the less the game is 8/10 for me Vice City 9/10 and SA 10/10. The III Trilogy is one of my favourite trilogies ever and it all began with this badboy and double cleff
