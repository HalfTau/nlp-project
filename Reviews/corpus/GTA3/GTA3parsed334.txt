Grand Theft Auto was use to be an arcade type of game in the 90s, but it wasnt so much popular as it is today. Grand Theft Auto III changed gaming for the best! This game took elements from the first four games and expanded further from 2D to 3D, and from Arcade to an Open World. This game is amazing! The story is really great, the missions were awesome, the characters have great personlities, and the best part about this game is that you can freely do whatever you want. Kinda like the last few entries.I would highly recommened this game to anyone who has never played a GTA game. The game is dated, but theres a lot of replayability with it! A ture classic of the series! I wonder if Take Two ever plan a remake of this game. If that happens, Ill flip!The only problem I have with this game are the controls though. Using a Dualshock 4 works but the only problem is that theres no option for you to control the camera on the remote. The only way to control it is the mouse and I find it very uncomfortable to use the DS4s touchpad to control the camera, so I wouldnt reconmmend using it.Buy this game! Youll never be disapointed!
