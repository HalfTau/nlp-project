 The map looks really nice, feels like an actual place and feels bigger than the VC map due to verticality The cars control really well, in my opinion better than in SA and VC The radio stations except for the horrible sounding technoreggae station all sound great Pretty easy to mod Dismemberment System from Soldier of Fortune due to the usage of the GHOUL engine Mostly great voice acting Great cutscenes Some really well made missions Not a port of the Xbox version which had actual shaders and a bunch of other improvements Pretty bad PC port Easy to fix that with mods though The lack of an actual Map is incredibly annoying, Id rather have no minimap and a real map. Some missions dont show you the actual objective and you have to find it yourself which becomes quite tedious without an actual map Some missions are unneccesary difficult due to rtarded A.I or just feel not that well thought out in general Every radio station only has 5 songs and about 3 voice lines, the Radio stations also all have atrocious sound quality The cutscenes before missions are incredibly brief and characters mostly say in 2 words what you need to do, the lack of exposition hurts the already bad story even more. Claudes motivations arent really comprehensible, he doesnt act the same way consistently a problem later GTA games also have The game in general feels quite unfinished, when flying over Skyscrapers you will notice that many of them dont have an actual roof and the ones that do mostly only have a cosmetic roof you cant stand on because it has no collision, scattered over the entire map there are white lines visible where two parts of the map come together, the game always hardcrashes at certain locations Leones house after which makes a certain mission unbeatable unless you cheat. The lack of the ability to swim isnt a problem in VC due to water only being between the two cities but here it is because Liberty City has quite a lot of rivers that you can accidentally fall or drive into and while I almost never died to water in VC I died to water in GTA 3 quite often. Also since theres no option to jump out of a moving car, you cant escape in the last moment like you can in VC. Its pretty short and the story is just good enough to not be atrocious. Absolutely no memorable charactersOverall this game was a good entry into the 3D universe but its not necessarily worth playing even if youre a GTA fan. It was probably a 9/10 back in 2001 but gets dragged down by parts incredibly awful mission design and definitely didnt age as well as San Andreas or even Vice City.5,5/10.
