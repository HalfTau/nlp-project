The game that started it all. Still every bit as fun, darkly humorous, atmospheric, wellpaced and immersive as it was in 2001. A mustplay for anyone interested in the GTA franchise and in openworld gaming as a whole. Be sure to download the fanmade GTA3 Reborn mod pack in the Steam Guides for a muchimproved experience.
