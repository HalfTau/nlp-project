It feels like just the other day I was leaving primary school as an eleven year old boy to go and see a friend, and play GTA3 at his, taking it in turns trundling down the street in a tank, seeing how long we could last with a six star wanted level...Yes, Jack, Im an autistic boy who played Grand Theft Auto 1, 2 and 3 growing up, I turned into a well rounded individual, with a firm grasp on reality, shock horror.The story revolves around a mute character whod been betrayed by his former girlfriend Catalina, after being shot while making a getaway from a bank job on a street you never see again for some reason.During the game, you fight your way up the crime ladder, killing pimps, dealers, and destroying gang operations throughout Liberty City, all the while, looking for the  that stabbed you in the back, and left you for dead in an alleyway.The violence is golden, the freedom is liberating, and the fact that its the first properly threedimensional Grand Theft Auto game ever made, makes this beauty a shining example of the genre.Shut up and play it.
