A good game first released ing 14 years ago, as the first 3D one from the series.Im the 100 completion kind of guy, and thats how I went on GTA III. Although this journey took a lot of effort, I had enough fun doing this. It gets pretty infuriating sometimes, like the Paramedic mission, but accomplishing nonsense and mafia style missions is what makes this and other GTA series titles so fun.Things that werent so funnyThe pros are all the good points of any GTA titleAlthough being old and the effort it takes, I had enough fun, so I recommend this game! See you on the streets of Liberty City!
