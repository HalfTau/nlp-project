I love GTA 3. It was a great game and still is.I dont recommend this game on steam because it is a terrible port and the controls are wonky. Also there are some pretty major graphical discrepancies between the PS2 version and the PC version. The PC version got a massive graphical downgrade compared to the PS2 version... I know it might be odd to some people in 2015 but PC gaming hardware back then when the game was released wasnt what it is today with the whole PC Master concept, back then PC gaming hardware was inferior to the consoles, so the developers downgraded the graphics and mechanics so that peoples computers would not catch fire and blow up.So unless they go back fix the terrible controls, and add features they had previously removed in the PC version to accommodate the new hardware, I wouldnt recommend this version of the game to anyone.I recommend GTA 3, just not this steam version.
