A classic like no other. The story is silly  why they decided for a silent protagonist is beyond me, but the missions past the initial tutorials are generally good and fun and lucky dont bring morality or filmlike plots into it much. Very tough end game and not a great deal to do outside of missions but there is a lot of gameplay, and in spite of dated graphics it holds up remarkably well, with just about every modern GTAs gameplay mechanics in plain sight  something to mull over when contemplating any future ones since most of it has been done before.
