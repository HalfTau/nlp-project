Created well before Rockstars rush towards modernization in the series, GTA III plays in an arcadey style in almost every way, from combat, to aesthetic, to vehicle handling. The more barebones plot may put off those coming straight in from narrativeheavy titles, but the plots never in your face or repetitive. Youll encounter ton of hilarious banter/dialogue as you build influence and respect in Liberty City. This game ranks a little higher in difficulty than some others in the series at times, and features a nice variety of missions. Rockstars first GTA entrant into 3D is a winner.
