Ah, Grand Theft Auto III. Where do I begin?Hello again friends! Like Grand Theft Auto Vice City, I have been playing Grand Theft Auto III since its release date back in 2001. When this game was first released it was revolutionary! The first 3D Grand Theft Auto! Amazing, truly amazing. The storyline is excellent  YOU, CATALINA! and the soundtrack is actually not that bad listen to Rise, MSX, Flashback FM, Head Radio and last but not least Double Cleff FM. The only downfall to this game was not including the beautiful and talented Misty into more missions. What a shame. Anyways, if you are sitting here reading this review contemplating whether or not to buy Grand Theft Auto III I say buy it RIGHT NOW. It is a classic. Also like Vice City, this game was made when Rockstar actually cared about gameplay more than appearance. So if that doesnt make you want to buy this game I dont know what will. Once again friends, I thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules and I sincerely hope that I have influenced your opinion on Grand Theft Auto III and your choice on games.Yours in gaming,Dubgame.
