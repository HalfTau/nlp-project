I cant review this game, my nostalgia is thicker than PEASOUP cheat code to make stage 3 foggy weatherthe nostalgia is so thick that I just cant review this honestly without feeling overwhelmed by how much fun this game brought me when I was a kid even though I played vice city for nearly 14 hours each day, this game was played significantly less but for some reason I like it MORE!THIS GAME and Vice City were basically my childhood and I loved EVERY police chase, shootout, mission even though I never finished the games and I still cant get enough of these gamesmain reason why I like them small map with memorable landmarks so you are NEVER lost unlike GTA 4 and GTA 5
