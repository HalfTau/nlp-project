GTA III is back when Grand Theft Auto was still kind of brutal.  The dark atmosphere and the fact that the game is always during the nighttime is really unhelpful and just doesnt feel like it fits the ridiculous pretentions the GTA games in the past and in the future embodied.  GTA IV is certainly an improvement on the idea, but GTA III has enough good ideas that I can let it get away with it.  Everything is really dynamic, cars dont spin out like theres grease on the wheels, although there is a blighting lack of bikes, the narrative is solid and even though the BJ Blascowitz lookalike doesnt talk and therefore has no personality, theres nothing objectivly bad with it.  Its a fine and fair reminder of where all this began.
