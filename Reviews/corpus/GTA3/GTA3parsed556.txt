Unplayable. Past versions of this game may have worked good on consoles, But this pc version has many faults. Menu screens can dissappear so u dont know what your doing on menu Mouse doesnt recognise games screen edge on dual monitors so when you turn mouse in game you end up seeing the mouse appear on 2nd monitor, and when u click such as to fire gun you end up clicking the other monitor and minimising game.You would think ROCKSTAR would have patched these two main issues. But 15 years and nothings been done, and the forums are filled with post about these two issues. If you own it try get a refund from steam, they shouldnt be allowed to sell faulty products.Definitely makes me not want to pay 80 for GTA V if they cant even release patches for minor issues in their well known game franchise.
