Its a great and original concept, even though it has some downsides such as crashing opening video screens, terrible menu glitches in which its invisible, poor FPS settings.For the actual game I think its very repetitive, but what most people like about it is that its an open world. Gameplay, graphics and the characters are neat and I love how the protagonist is silent.Joystick support is terrible, it does not feature auto aim nor does the joysticks work properly.Orginality and an open world environment is what makes this boat sail. I thought the story was fairly alright.imdbScore 7.5/10
