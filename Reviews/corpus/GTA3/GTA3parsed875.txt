The true father of modern GTA games and probably the prime catalyst for modern openworld sandbox games in general. You know what to expect with a Grand Theft Auto game, a mediocre story, fun but sometimes infuriating missions and lots and lots of messing around. The real joy here is just hopping in a car or boat, if you can stand the wonky controls, putting on your favorite channel and just cruising. This version is the excellant PC conversion done in 2002 with a great control layout and runs perfectly on my Win7 64bit OS.
