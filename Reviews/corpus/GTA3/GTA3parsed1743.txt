Okay, where do I start?Guess Ill begin with a personal opinion here. Personally I think this is the best GTA. At least it is my favorite. To me, it beats San Andreas and Vice City. And unlike GTA IV or mabye even GTA V which I havent played it doesnt aim to be super realistic.And now, onto a proper reviewGrand Theft Auto III has a dark and cold atmosphere, the story is quite interesting and throughout the game you make yourself more and more enemies Triads, Mafia, Columbian Cartel.The dark atmopshere gets underlined by the amount of gangs cruising around Liberty City. The game itself is overly dark, Taxis are in a really dark tone of yellow, you can barely see colours of cars since they all seem almost black.Like I said, this game hasa really dark atmosphere, and this is what makes the game better than Vice City or San Andreas.Furthermore, this was the first 3D GTA, so it was the beginning of a new era  the old topdowncamera is still available though.All in all, the game is really worth its money, you should definitely pick it up, maybe wait for it to go on sale to do so.
