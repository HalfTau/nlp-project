Good game, I still like it besides the T2 t. I just think they should go after GTA 5, GTA 4, and Max Payne 3. Not the originals which were way better than those cashgrabs. Also, OpenIV wasnt even used for the originals, so give hate to the ones that I mentioned before. I think T2s actions are stupid, but I still like the original GTA games, not the HD ones.
