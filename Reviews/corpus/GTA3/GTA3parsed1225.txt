Ive played countless hours on GTA games, over a month on GTA V. But, were my love started from the series was gta 3. Even though I have GTA 1 I didnt play it at the time. My Mom and Dad got my Sister a Ps2 for Christmas in 2003. I went over my Uncles house for a bday party and saw him playing GTA 3. I was 5 years old and I started to play and my Dad watched me. I got in a ambulance at the hospital and started to drive great for my age. Little did my Dad know that I would spend 1,000 on video games after that.This one game started my gaming career, and I would love to design one of these games for a daily job in the future.Thats just my story, I would give this game a 9/10. Changed the GTA Series from arcade type game to 3D story action/shoot em up game. The fact that each game gives you a bigger free roam makes every GTA Game better. Cant say this any better but, this is my second favorite series in the whole world of Video Games.
