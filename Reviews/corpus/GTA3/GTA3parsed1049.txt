Personally, i think that GTA III is the weakest in the 3D universe, but its still an awesome game. It only falls behind because the other GTAs improved on this one, but being the first 3D GTA, it was very impressive at the time and still today. The story is simple, being a mute guy that mostly just takes jobs from other Liberty City residents. Gameplay wise, the onfoot and shooting sections are a bit clunky, but it seems that Rockstar Games was aware of that, and most of the time youll be driving, with simple but responsive gameplay. And the missions feel surprisingly varied, and arent too hard with some exceptions. The music is good, but the soundtrack is a bit short. And of course, free roaming is as good as ever, especially while driving a tank! In the end, if this was the only GTA out there, it would stand the test of time for me, but the others put this on a bit on the shadows. But definitely a classic, especially because its one of the roots for all sandbox games today.Note Even if you dont like mods, theres 3 that i would probably recommend.1  SilentPatch, an unofficial patch that fixes many bugs and issues.2  Widescreen fix, for adjusting the image correctly for your widescreen.3  GInput, if you want to play with a controller.
