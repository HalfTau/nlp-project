Nice purge on the wrong games you idiotic man babies. Instead of making a clear point of Purge the unmoddable, support the moddable, youve created a ces pool full of negative reviews that make you all sound whinny and unintelligent. Dont purge games that are actually still supporting your cause just because they are associated with the publisher you morons. Thats like punching a Trump supporter in the face just because you do not agree with Trump.
