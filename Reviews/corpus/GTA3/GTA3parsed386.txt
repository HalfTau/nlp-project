GTA3 was where it all really really took off. 3D game world, full free roam after completing the game, fab storeline and missions, way better controls than GTA1/2, and a tour de force when release on PS2 first. But the game is really a 2030 hour experience as is.With modding, the game has an unbelievable extended life that console platform players wish they could achieve on the PC.I love R and all the Grand Theft Auto family of games, but lets be real here. R banned all modding recently in their nuclear management decision to curb cheating in their more modern GTA franchise starting with OpenIV. With OpenIV, modders and the Grand Theft Auto Community, you have a game that can be played for years in SP mode for GTA4 and 5.When Take Two publisher decides to monetize on that goodwill withOUT creating any additional content or assets for the SP user base, trying to force those user online and destory it at the same time, I cannot recommend ANYONE to put their hard earn money into buying ANY Take Two Published games.It is exactly like a politician taking away your RIGHTS  RIGHTS mean something that you have with no questions asked  since modding and OpenIV does not HARM the purchaser, publisher or online experience whatsoever. The mods ONLY work in single player. It is absolutely one of the main reason gamers even buy GTA in the first place.Again for the reading impared, OpenIV CANNOT and does NOT allow any of its modded contented to be used online or interact with that post apocalyptic Detroit where no Robocop can be found they call GTAO.Before anyone disputes this, lookup what OpenIV actually DOES, and note there are CONSUMER FAIR USE LAWS in most IP protected countries that allows private modding for personal use.So NO, I do not recommend anyone to buy ANY Take Two published games including GTA series from R until they change their shill corporate policy towards the community that built them in the first place.If I can I would REFUND all my Take Two published games and delete it off my HD right away.
