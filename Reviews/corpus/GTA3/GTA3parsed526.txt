GTA III for me is a classic. Takes me back to my PS2 days of looking up cheat codes, and turning all of Liberty City into a battle ground. Cars instantly explode when they hit the tank, and the OP assault rifle can destroy the entire motor pool of police cars in a single magazine. Its good to be back!
