This is a terrible port. In my case even getting it to work was a nightmare as the game loaded without menu text and no cursor. Once I magiced my way to modern resolution, fixing the missing menu issue, I found a game with no mouse lock, making playing while multiple monitors are enabled a mess of constant focus loss. The audio of the game is constantly cutting out, with many of the NPCs in the world only getting a word or two out before being cut short, and many repetitive sounds such as pistol fire fails to make a sound at all. This ruins what should have been an immersive atmosphere.
