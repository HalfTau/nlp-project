This game is really fun and nostaligic to play, The soundtrack is great,  The story is fun and its just fun to drive around with Flashback FM while running over pedestrians and cops coming after you. The game runs fine for me on both Windows 7, and Windows 10 without issues. Also, The game is not limited to 30 FPS like the Framerate police said, I guess they do not know what the frame limiter option is... 10/10 GET THIS OR VICE CITY
