I just love this game, sure the graphics didnt age well, but quantity over quality. The soundtrack is neat, You have a radio station dedicated to Scarface. It is one of the first open world 3d games, which was an eye opener for its time 2001. Some of the Voice actors are from famous movies from the 80s and 90s. Like Frank Vincent, Micheal Madsen, Joe Pantoliano.
