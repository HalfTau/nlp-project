Unfortunately the PC port is not to hot, and youll definitely need the widescreen fix mod, and maybe the controller input mod if you want to play the PS2 era GTA games as they were intended.However, once you apply these fixes the game becomes an entirely different beast, and you can truly see just why this series became the behemoth that it is. GTA III, the first 3D release in the series still plays incredibly well 15 years after release. Playing it is like going back and playing Doom after a while away  regardless of the passage of time, its still an immensely enjoyable experience. Id even argue that this game is a tighter and more polished than Vice City, even though VC is perhaps viewed as one of the best in the series. The cutscenes are slick and wellpresented, and the cutscene character animation is perhaps superior to both VC and SA, the voice acting and sound design are all fantastic, and the gameplay is tight and fun. Its still a wonderful experience when the second island opens up and you can cruise around the big city for the first time.There is a degree of nostalgia affecting me here, and I cant say for sure whether the experience will entirely translate to those migrating back from V or IV, as this is the most arcadey of the PS2 GTAs, but the gameplay, the characters, and the controls still hold up really well. Im actually shocked how well the game has aged, again, providing you install the fixes I mentioned beforehand.I highly recommend it.
