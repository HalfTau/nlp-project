Another classic game from Grand Theft Auto Series.The story takes place right after Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories,so youll see what happens right after those events.The setting is correct,Liberty City is based on New York,it is a dark environment,it will add on to some missions.Combat is the same throughout all 3D Era games,same goes to vehicles,so if you like Grand Theft Auto Vice City or San Andreas then you will like this.I recommend to those that want a good 3D Era game to try from GTA,and if you want to see what happens after GTA LCS.
