This was the first openworld video game that I played back when I was 7 years old. Trust me, I didnt even know what I was doing because I had just arrived in America at that time and my computer seemed to have a problem with allowing me to play it normally cause the screen would go black every 5 minutes and Id have to change the camera view to get it back to normal. Suffice to say, Ive managed to reconcile the problem since then 15 years ago and it works beautifully. I suggest modding it a bit to make it look and play like a more modern GTA of today. OnePieces HD Cars and TriPack plus some much needed improved HD city textures will allow it to look a bit more fresh Its a classic and one of the best GTAs to try and get 100 in since its one of the easiest to do so in. Also, I recommend switching out Steams EXE with a regular 1.1 version if you want to avoid the dark colored cars problem. Editing the TXD file works too but changing the EXE wont break the game. If anything, itll allow more mods to work since some dont work with Steams version. Overall, its still a good game even in todays modern period and holds up well even without mods.
