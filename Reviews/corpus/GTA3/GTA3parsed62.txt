The game itself is fine, the issue is the port that they made for the Steam version. It has a lot of bugs, a lot. And a lot of them has to be fixed in the workshop or by downloading a lot of patches. The game should be good to go in the first place, but i guess Rockstar has they priorities set on GTA V dlcs instead of taking care of some small but game breaking bugs that requires minimum amount of time to fix.
