I was so excited when I started playing this back then. My PC could barely handled it, but after some settings, I was able to play smoothly.I was a very violent driver back then, and I hated the fact that the police comes chasing everytime, but these days Im glad they have that kind of realism on GTA, cause if a game is pure violent without any sort of consequence, thats gonna potentially mess up the mind of a young adult, and of course its boring.Tried playing it again today using an XBox 360 Wireless Controller, and the button mapping is all messed up.Thankfully the problem with controller mapping was solved by installing a mod called GInput from GTA Garage  also available for GTA VC and SA.
