The game that shaped openworld games and gave us a standard for future upcoming third person games.Considering this game was their first 3D game, the controls are good. I mean it is smooth and responsive. Incredible how well it actually holds up. From a modern pespective the game is limited in terms of objectives. There is not a whole lot of things to do and the missions can be very frustrating at times because of the lack of checkpoints. The structure of missions is dated too. In retrospect the map is still feels big and it is quite impressive for its time. The characters lack personality, but for their first 3D game, its not bad.The colors are very depressing to be honest. A lot of grey, and black and white. I only remember the game for its rain. It has aged pretty well and still perfectly playable. There is also a lot a texture popping, which was very common for its time. Despite all my complains the graphics is still amazing.Quite amazing for its time. The voice actors are very good. The most memomable thing must be the radio stations. You listen to them all the time. There is a lot of variation from DnB, opera, 80s music, raggae and hip hop. The songs are so good you can listen to them multiple times. The real charm is coming from the radio station hosts.I love to go back to GTA III now and then. It holds a lot of nostalgia value for me. Unfortunately, it never got its claws on me. It did in the later games. It is mostly the dull colors and forgettable story that holds me back. I still think GTA 3 is fun, if you can take your mind back to 2001.
