A CLASSIC! Playing this brings back memories of when I firist played this with my cousin all those years ago. Even to this day Grand Theft Auto III is still one of the best games out there. Gameplay is still amazing! Plus I can play this on my potato laptop! That makes it even better! I would reccomend this game to anyone with a potato computer or even a great computer! 10/10 would buy a million times.
