By far one of my most favorite game of all time  if not my favorite.  Back in the day, coming off the PlayStation 1, this game blew me away in almost all aspects graphics, changing weather, and the freedom to do what ever you want in the open world.My biggest complaint with the PlayStation 2 version was the aiming controls. It felt clunky and awkard. The PC version is completely different and feels smooth. Despite a few glitches, this is well worth the price.
