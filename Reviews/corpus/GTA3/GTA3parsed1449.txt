Grand Theft Auto III is the game that changed the gaming world for the better. It was a step in the right direction, this is the first full 3D 3rd person grand theft auto game, thats right kids, this is the grand daddy of 3D games!The game takes place in the dark Liberty City, you play as Claude, a mute,but badass, person out for revenge after you were dumped by your girlfriend and shot in the middle of a bank robbery by her.Now claude should do what the Aggalah ft. Sean Price song said Keep Rising to the Top.The vehicles are great, each handles uniquely, An SUV may be brawny but slow and understeer like hell or flip over like a landstalker while a sports car may grip the road and move like a small rat but will easily get damaged. Rockstar games has put a lot of effort into this title. The game lacks features like bikes etc.. but vice city fills that need.The games story is great, voice acting is good, gameplay is excellent. Soundtrack is topnotch, youll find Scarface music, Pop and Rock music or 2000s Rap music.I recommend this game even today, it supports X360 controllers with a small mod. 10/10 would recommend!
