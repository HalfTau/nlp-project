PROSAh where do i begin.. i first played this game when i was 10 or 11 cant really remember and oh boy did i haveton of fun with this game. GTA 3 at its time was a masterpiece that barely any other game can come close to and raised the standard for the future Grand Theft Autos. The story was quite interesting and i wont spoil anything but in this game you are going to experience rollercoaster of emotions and explore all gangs in liberty city and get to know their plans etc..The music is exquisite ranging from 80s,Reggae,Techno and even ing Classical music.. yes you can listen to Beethoven while you drive over helpless civilians. This game has alot of cultural refrences and easter eggs you can discover scattered throughout the Liberty City. All in all you get quite a good package here and to consider what sort of crap we are getting today this is pure GOLD.CONSHowever i was quite dissapointed that our main character was bland as ... he cannot speak and most of the time he nods like a little baby.Most of the cars are unstable as  and little oversteer will result in you being on a roof and resulting in a big boom.NO ING IN GAME MAP???? ...Had to use google pictures ..A blast from the past 10/10 would play again.
