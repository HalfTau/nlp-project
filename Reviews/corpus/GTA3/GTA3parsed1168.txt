Its raw, unbalanced, sometimes too easy, sometimes too hard, and sometimes frustratingly buggy.But its a classic. Everything in Grand Theft Auto III is a labor of love and chock full of quality. You can nitpick about how San Andreas had far more content and Vice City just did it better, but this is where it all started and this is a damn good game.I recommend using SilentPatch and the Widescreen Fix.10/10. Thank you/screw you Rockstar, for stealing most of my teenage years.Oh, Asuka, youve got a new massager!Thats not a massager.
