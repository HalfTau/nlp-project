My alltime favorite GTA. I can play any of the new titles and within weeks, probably months later Ill go meh and stop playing until the next is released. Its been 14 years baby and Im still in love with this game so much. The memories it brings back, the epic sound track, the new era of 3D gaming. It would have been a dream come true to have achievements or badges for the game, but to everyone it has been buried years ago. Not to me
