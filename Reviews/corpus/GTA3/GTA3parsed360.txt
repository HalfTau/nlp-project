This is the original PC version with no modern enhancements. GTA3 itself is a good game, but theres no cloud saving whatsoever, the controls are iffy, and the graphics are the same 2001 graphics from the original release. Whys that bad? Because somehow, the mobile version has said enhancements. Its a weird day when a classic game like this is better played on a phone than on PC. So this desperately needs an update, but dont count on it.
