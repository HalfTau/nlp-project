this game is actually pretty fun for being over 10 years old, besides the fact that you cant swim and theres no map at all. If you like shooting anything in your path and stealing cars while running from the cops at the same time than this game is for you! GTA 3 also contains a storyline too which is a plus because the missions bring a challenge to the game that the previous games didnt actually bring. If you like GTA 4 or any other GTAs then get this game even though its really old!
