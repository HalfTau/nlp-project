This is a great game on console, but the PC version is not a good experience. Unless youre a completionist or something, youre better off getting this on PlayStation or Xbox. The controls are off, it crashes, and the buttons on the menus begin to disappear after going through a few options.Grand Theft Auto III was something that changed the way we play games today, and this is an absolute abomination.
