The first GTA that started it all, this game being only half a gigabyte holds so much content that will take you a week to finish. The gameplay is great and the story is fun. And the sequels gradually get better and more advanced. All the way to the latest game GTA V.I really recomend this game to anyone, this game can run nice on a potato of a computer and still be fun. 9.5/10
