I dont like this GTA game too much, maybe I should have played this game when I got my first PC 10 years ago. I enjoyed GTA V, Online, IV, EFLC, SA, but this is somehow boring.The cars have strange physics even with locked 30 fps,I cant get used to the handling,The protagonist cant speak,The missions are repetitive and boring,The cars roll over easily,You cant ADS with your guns, only fire from the hip,...and the list goes on... theres a lots of things which I dont like, but Ill continue to play through this game because its GTA.
