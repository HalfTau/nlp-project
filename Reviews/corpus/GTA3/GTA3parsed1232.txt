Dont be fooled by my hours, I have played hundreds on the disk version, the first PC game I have ever played too 2004.. . Still a ing great game!!! Storyline, gameplay and modding are all awesome, community made multiplayer mod that works on Steam version too, but the only thing you need to do to make it work is to download older patch and you can go play without any problems.Also the only thing that I remember from the early 2004 is trying to fly Dodo, but failing miserably. Good times!10/10
