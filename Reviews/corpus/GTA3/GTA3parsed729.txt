GTA III takes place in Liberty city, in the year of 2001, and we play as a silent bank robber named Claude, that was betrayed and shot by his girlfriend, and after escaping a prison transport, he wants revenge. it was a MASSIVE revolution in the open world games back in 2001, blew everyones minds and shaped the industry to the open world era and the GTA clones. First GTA ever to be fully 3D Good graphics for the time looks dated now, but tolerable Great gameplay for the time Good arcade driving physics Rockstars first try of a story for the GTA series, and even if its not great like later games, it was a nice start, with charismatic characters and voice dialog The open world, now considered tiny, felt HUGE at the time Good selection of weapons Opponents can be dismembered by shots, something that is only possible in this game on the GTA series so far Iconic cars like the banshee, Infernus and the Stallion were born in this game There is a plane on the game, named dodo a bird that couldnt fly, and it fits the name very well, since flying this thing is a challenge on its own. Its basically a minigame. Nice soundtrack Flashback FM is the best radio station, with the whole scarface movie soundtrack huge mod community Missions get quite hard at the end and can be frustrating, because of the respawn system the hardest 3d game of the series IMO You cant swim Motorbikes, helicopters, and planes proper planes were not present yet gets stretched visuals on widescreens To fix this I recommend the widescreen Patch by ThirteenAG The shotgun and M16 are very OP, and can kill you ou blow up your car in a few shots annoying on late game by the end of the game, mostly everyone hates you, and cruising the map in certain areas can be very dangerous and annoyingI also recommend the silent patch, by silent, that fix many bugs of the gameOverall, this is a piece o video game history, a masterpiece of the early 2000s , a must have for GTA fans and fans of open world games in general
