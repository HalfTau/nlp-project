What a truley Atmospheric Gem this game is. Modern games have definetly uped the anty, but theres just something about this game and the world that it creates, everything just comes together, and creates a gritty but loveable playground to be explored. If you can ignore graphic limitations and rubish controls, but enjoy an rich atmosphere presented to you, Its a must play.
