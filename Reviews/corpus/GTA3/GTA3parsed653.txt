I really like GTA. And GTA III is, where it began as we know it today. But you can clearly see, this was Rockstars first attempt to make an action open world game, since there are a lot of things missing and just horrible. It sucks, that this game has no map and you almost die instantly, even with kevlar and good weapons, since the M16 is OP as hell and aiming is very bad. Also there are a lot of missions you just CAN NOT do first try, which sucks. And oh yeah, you cant just repeat a mission, you have to wait until the timer ran out and start again by searching the guy who gave you the mission. But it can be fun though and it is probably the most rewarding GTA, since its so difficult sometimes. In my eyes every other GTA is better, but you should try this too, just because of the map and to play the story, since some missions are quite well made.
