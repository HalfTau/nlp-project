Well its Grand Theft Auto so Obviously its good !But its not the best  in the series. To me thats San Andreas or Vice CityNot so bad Graphics but very Fun even just crusin around the 3D Universe Liberty City is still fun. I actually think that this version of the city is better than IVs Prediction. There are some fusterating levels and I dont remember one Building you ever get to go into but its still a fantastic game. 7/10
