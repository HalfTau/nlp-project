Check out PCGW for an essential patch. Otherwise, this game is still as awesome as it was over 10 years ago! Truly a classic with great art, atmosphere, and controls. A note  I was having problems with my gamepad, so I went back to keyboard only. Apparently the easiest way to use a controller is map the keyboard and then use Joy2key or something similar.
