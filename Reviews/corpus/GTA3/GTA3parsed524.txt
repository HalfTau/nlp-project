In 2001 Rockstar Games released one of the most ambitious games they had ever released to the public. Grand Theft Auto III was the first game ever to start what has culminated today in one of the greatest games known in videogaming. Being the first open world game to feature polygonal tridimensional models, it started a trend that would continue to evolve until this very day. Rockstar Games is known to many as a Publisher that invests everything in their games because they want to excel in what they do and they want to deliver to the public. With GTA III it is shown how that set of mind started and how each Publisher and/or Developer should treat their IPs.GTA III has a fun story plagued with satiric comments to Pop Stars and the way of life of the era it is situated in, in this case the 2000s. If youve not played this game at all, I wont spoil the story, but damn its 2017! You better start playing it!While right now GTA V surpasses in every way the now outdated GTA III, it still is a fun game to play to reminisce about how it all started, and lets be honest, doesnt matter how polygonal the city or characters are, its always fun to smash your car against other cars and shoot everything that moves, because GTA is mayhem and thats why you are going to buy this game!So, ready to go back to Liberty City my friend?8/10Buy it, play it and dont regret it.
