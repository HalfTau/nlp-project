While the game itself is great, a lot of the missions require precise rapid shooting, and so you need a controller. However after getting a controller, the setup is really bad and takes hours to map the right buttons to the right directions. Example, you cant turn and move forward. Turning the camera is separate from turning the person. This means in a fight, you are locked into one view of the action and then you have to aim from that view while the target can move all around you. You end up shooting at stuff that is behind you. Frustrating, because it is a really fun game.
