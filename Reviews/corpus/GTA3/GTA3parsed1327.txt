A fun game with plenty to do. The main story line will take between 812 hours depending on how many times you fail some of the harder missions. As for all the additional stuff to do hidden packages, car collections, vigilante missions, medic missions, taxi missions, etc these will extend the gameplay subbstantially and you do get in game rewards for this. These can include weapons at your hideout as well as other perks.As for graphics, the pc version i would say looks alot better than it did on ps2. You can find extra in world objects, some game mechanics work differently. But there are pros and cons to the pc version in comparrison to the ps2 version. There are some good videos outlining this on the game hub page if you are interested in the differences.Even though this game is now over 10 years old, it can still bring fun and laughter especially with the radio stations, missions, backround dialogue and mayhem.I dont think many people would regret having this game in their library. Definately worth the money.
