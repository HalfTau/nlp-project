If you havent played this gem of a game get your sh together and buy it. And if you already had played it do it again for old times and funs sake!P.S. I would recommend installing a fix for the Steam car colors as they are much darker than nonSteam versions.Overall score 8/10Breakdown of the scoreGameplay 8/10 PROS Fun and challenging storyline missions, though it is not the case with the very first set of missions as theyre boring and easy.Entertaining, not as good as its sequels, but was a 10 back in 2001.You can still have fun testing how far you can survive the onslaught of a 6star wanted police level, with a mediumsized decent map, and numerous hostile gangs as you progress with the storyline.Decent amount of side quests.CONS No bikes, driveable planes  helicopters aside from the Dodo which is hard to control, and melee weapons aside from the bat. You cant swim, but it is trivial and I dont mind it though it is annoying because it could make you lose on some missions. There is nothing much to do after 100 completion aside from a couple of time/checkpointrelated missions which you already have to finish before becoming permenant.Odd jobs side missions especially Paramedic become excruciatingly difficult to complete after certain points in the story.Story 7/10 Nicely progressing story about a silent and strong ruthless protagonist who works for various gangs and organized criminals.Some parts of the story reminds me of the Sopranos and Goodfellas, but there arent much notable references to films or shows.Most characters are not very memorable unlike the sequels.Ending 8.5/10Graphics 8/10 Decent for todays standards, awesome back then.Art Style 9/10 Beautiful aura and setting. Only thing that is holding it back is the few pedestrian models, low quality trees, and how some characters look.Character emotional development 6/10 the only thing we can observe is the body movements of the protagonist during cutscenes and his decisions which we execute, but we can easily relate. Other characters arent very interesting too except for a few.Customization 5/10 the only thing you can customize is Claudes skin, a cars color and planting a car bomb, though customization wasnt meant to be very important in the first place, but they are relevant to the gameplay.Ability to modify game with ease 8/10 fairly easy but no builtin platform to assist you except for the player skins and mp3 folder.Voice Acting quality 7.5/10 Great voice actors such as Frank Vincent, Michael Madsen, Guru, among many others.Music  other soundtrack 7/10 very entertaining the first time you hear it, but gets old after a while.Homage to Scarface as an 80s music station with songs from the movie. Appropriate with the presence of the Colombian cartel.Hilarious talk show station, and some advertisements.Background noises 10/10Finally, give some patchlike mods a try like The Leftovers Fix to get some fixes, graphical improvements, and PS2 features back.And if you liked this game, buy GTA Liberty City Stories as it is newer and its story is a prequel set in 1998 while GTA 3 is set in 2001. Basically it is an enhanced GTA 3, but its only available on PSP, PS2 and PS3 unfortunately.
