The game to change all gamesDo not dismiss my review for my short play time. I have 100 the game twice on other platforms. GTA III changed games as we knew them. This game brought violence, grit, pure unfiltered satire of out modern society into a massive openworld game.Story 10/10You play as someone who has been cheated on. You are double crossed during a robbery by your girlfriend and left to rot in jail. Luckily you dont make it that far. Your convoy is interrupted and you manage to escape. You need money to climb the ladder and get revenge on the people that wronged you. The characters and people you meet are the seediest of their kind. Mobsters, pimps, dealers, the common criminal. You do work for them to get the paper.Gameplay 8/10For a game with nothing to take ideas from this game works surprisingly well. The guns are weak at first, but as you unlock more the shootouts get better. Cars play the biggest part in this game. The city is pretty big and you will need to get around quick. The handling is a bit unrealistic and there is nothing as annoying as flipping a car and having it blow up on you, but speeding around the city is amazing.Graphics 5/10What did you expect for a game from 2001. The people are blocky and the terrain can be muddy at times but in its time it looked damn good.PC Port 5/10I originally played this on the playstation two and a bit on the iphone for the mobile edition. Honestly the PC port is pretty bad. You will probably need to run it in compatibility mode to get it to work at all. Even so it does crash from time to time.Overall game is 10/10 This version gets a 7/10I would reccomend this game to anyone looking to have some fun. This will probably forever be one of the greatest video games. I just wish the PC port was better.
