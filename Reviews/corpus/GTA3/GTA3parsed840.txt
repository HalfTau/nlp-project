My hours playedXbox version 500Playstation 2 version 6400PC disc version 15,330This is my favorite game of all time. This is the game that started free roam third person RPG games. The developers give you a choice to play as the silent protagionist, or to play as any pedestrain you want. Be you, be me, be free. Customize the texture of the protagionist, make him more you. Ride a train, steal a car, walk around, find secrets, find easter eggs, drown, try to jump the blown up bridges but fail, do whatever your heart desires. I may have 22,230 hours in this game, but I have my entire life of playing this beautiful game ahead of me. Warning This version of the PC port has a few minor rendering errors causing cars to be dark, headlights to not shine, and pickups to not glow. To fix this Download the silent patch.GTA III states that I will burn till I cant burn no more, shine till theres no shine no more, till the Earth cant turn no more, Im the king.
