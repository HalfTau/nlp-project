Something really hard about this game is progress.When a game like this brings so much money to a company like Rockstar, you cant imagine how many improvements theyve done during around 20 years.I always wanted to finish the first 3D GTA of the franchise the prevous in 2D even if they are old are excellent.My first fix was Vice City. Good in every ways, it reminds me many great moments related to an amazing atmosphere/story, awesome soundtrack.But frankly when you return to this one, its horrible.So many things are difficult to tolerate, like the lack of map to find important locations many times ive been searching for hospital in vain... and its an exemple, horrible physics where you can fail a job because you car turned upsidedown due to a carton box. Missions without appropriate briefing Exemple the Mafia asks you to kills some Triad Warlords and at the end you have to find a fish van... the problem you have 2 or 3 types of fish vans....Or, something weird, when you go to Liberty City down town well in fact you stay there around 2/3 of the game, you see some Triad gangs in cleaner suits shooting at you on sight even if you drive a Firefighter truck... as if you wrote MAFIA THUG on your face/ vehicle.So even if some games on Steam are very old, i still buy them to remember their uniq aspects they represented in their time.Like the first Quake games wich are still very cool and keep entertaining even today, or reworked oldies such as Strifer Veteran edition, and many others.To Conclude Maybe i will finish GTA III when they will do some kind of polishing on it.But frankly my First GTA experience in 3D was and will stay GTA Vice City.Beautifull, Fun, Cool and just unforgettable.And the funny thing that nobody says about GTA III is that the hero never talks....Contrary to Tommy Versetti  in Vice City, who is one of the best characters the franchise has.Like so many like Ken Rosenberg, Tommys lawyer who appears in SanAndreas with Kent Paul.Even the soundtrack is boring, like Razlow on GTA III who works in a debate radio and in Vice City he is a crazy 80s Rock radio presenter !Nostalgia can be painfull some times and GTA III is painfull...go play Vice City instead !N.B My play time doesnt show my experience because i played offline for quite a long time.And i think i will review Vice City after that.
