Classic? Yes. But that is all it offers Nostalgia. For those that are wishing to experience the first game of the 3D universe for the first time, I personally wont recommend it. It has aged badly and honestly, only those that have played it during its earlier days may enjoy it. Dated mechanics, repetitive and occasionally frustrating missions really made the game much more tedious than fun. The godawful soundtrack doesnt do any justice either.Nutshell If you are eager to go through the history of the grand theft auto franchise, go for it. Its not a bad game. But comparing to its sequels, it doesnt really hold up and its certainly because of its age.
