Its a good game. I really had a hard time doing some of the missions.The traffic and PED is tricky but working better as Vice City.I managed to complete the game in 16 hours and had a great time. The game had me both laughing and mad at times.Its a good, old school GTA game.Its just difficult that the payn spray icons are not displayed on the map.Nor are the ammunation locations or any locations of interest. Except for the missions.There is no map button, no way to see the map. Sometimes the game asks you to go to a certain location and you have no idea where that place might be.There is an annoying bridge sound you hear from afar when the bridge opens, pretty annoying.Pretty good game if you ask me. Worth the 10 bucks.
