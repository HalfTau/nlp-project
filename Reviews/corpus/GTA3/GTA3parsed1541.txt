I chose to play this to go back to the start of the most recent installments of the franchise. Ive played later titles such as San Andreas which are i think overall better games but having said that this is still good value for money if you dont already own it. The gameplay, graphics, size of the open world etc are of course more basic than later versions and theres the incredibly annoying downside of the character not being able to swim. Overall though theres still nothing quite as much fun as setting a gangster on fire while hes trying to kill you or doing an insane 400ft jump off a cliff. Theres a reason this game got so much attention when it was released
