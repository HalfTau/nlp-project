This is a great game, but its old. It just doesnt hold up anymore. The controls are all messed up. Trying to play with a controller is really difficult, especially if you are used to dual sticking, or driving with the triggers. Rebinding some of the keys does help, but its still really hard to handle. Playing this with a mouse and keyboard may be your better option.The game is alright, but with GTA IV and GTA V looking and playing so much better, its really hard to justify playing this game now.
