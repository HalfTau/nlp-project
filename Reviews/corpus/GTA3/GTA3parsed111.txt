Game is absolutely amazing, till you realize howthe mechanics of the game are. There are some missions, where you either get melted by auto aim bots, or the physics of a car put you in a non stop flip and you blow up. I grew up with this game without playing the missions, and i enjoyed it. But the missions are just absolute garbage, and extremely boring.ProsChildhood gameIts GTA!ConsIts an oldgame, so dont expect much!Game mechanics.Extremely buggy when you mess with the display settings. download zipfile to fix menu and load times and also fixes some in game bugs.
