This was the game that introduced me to console gaming way back in highschool. Game is still extremely fun and very immersive even 10 years later. Graphics are obviously very dated and there are still a few bugs around. Missions are still a blast, as is exploring and running over hookers they literally make squish noises xD. The radio stations are worth a listen to, especially for nostalgias sake.Overall, even as dated as it is, its still an amazing game. Well worth your money, as long as the graphics dont scare you away.
