 Missions seem too much alike one to another, too much driving around Its unplayable without widescreen patch that makes aiming possible Cars that dont have any weight to them so they fly even after a slight bump at high speeds Story doesnt really go anywhere Annoying gangs that shoot you anywhere you go, making side missions, later into the game, impossible Very limited engine so things spawn and despawn super fast, you just need to look the other way Poorly scripted cops, kinda dumb AI in general to be expected of a game this old, still a con... the list goes on. Couple of missions are very annoying, having you cross between all 3 islands. Mission at the payphone on the 3rd island takes the cake tho... Which one is it? Play the game to find out D Vigilante side mission that actually gives you useful stuff, which are Stars at your hideout Hidden packages are also nice to have, tho there are not many missions that involve shooting so buying AK47 at the shop from time to time is more than enough. Voice acting is pretty interesting at times Radio is pretty interesting considering how much time you spend driving, but it can repeat a lot if you only listen to one radio statio I recommend Chaterbox Killing random people is satisfying Good choice of weaponsA game that was groundbreaking at the time as 1st 3D GTA now falls short to its successors. Its nice to play it if you are completionist, but after finishing the game, there arent many interesting things to do. If you know what you are doing, it should take around 15h to complete. If, on the other hand, you want something more out of the game, try mods, but I strongly recommend playing newer games, like VC which is very similar to it, but many times better, or SA which is masterpiece in GTA universe..
