A great game even though its old, totally worth it and i can recommend that you pick the game up in Grand Theft Auto Trilogy.Digging deeperDo not buy this game for its graphic, because that is totally awful.Graphics 3/10Sound 6/10Gameplay 8/10Story 9/10Its worth all the money, for me personally it has been 2 euro for 26 hours of good and ballanced gameplay.
