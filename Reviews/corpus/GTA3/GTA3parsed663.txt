If you havent guessed by the title, yes it is Grand Theft Auto III. Enjoy!Very Solid Story.Character Design was good for its time period.A very sizable Map with a big sense of open world first of its kind.Tony Cipriani, one of the best characters ever.A very nice Soundtrack in form of Radio Stations.The Missions are for the most part enjoyable to do.Tony Cipriani, one of the best characters ever.Sound Effects, while simple in there execution, are memorable.Some of the most memorable Quotes you will hear in video games.Did I mention Tony Cipiriani? I probably did.Bikes are not in the game mostly because of budget reasons?Some stuff got cut that would have been awesome in the game.Nothing to do with Money except buying weapons.There are some major bugs in the game especially with the Replay Function.No Steam Achievements.No Steam Trading Cards.Some of the side missions like the Taxi Fares and Rampages can be tricky if not annoying to do.Read the full review at1  Not Recommended2  Recommended at High Discount!3  Recommended at Slight Discount!5  Must Buy!
