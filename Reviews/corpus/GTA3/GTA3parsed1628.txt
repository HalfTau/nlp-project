GTA III is a great game for its time. I highly encourage you to purchase this game to relive the memories of classic GTA, however, this is the WRONG platform to do so on. The PC version of GTA III is a broken console port teaming with compatibility issues. There is no stability in the framerate due to the designers screwing up and making the game render all geometry reguardless of weather its visable or not. Grab a copy for the ps2/xbox so youll actually be able to enjoy playing this game.
