This is a very old game, but its one of the first open world games ever. Yes the controller doesnt work with it, and yes missions get MESSED UP. But really, its a very old game and still exhibits some very solid gameplay.Also this game doesnt put you through the t that the newer games do with forcing people to register before they can play etc, also this is before they ruined the game by adding stupid bikes to it.
