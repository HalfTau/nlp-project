I wanted to play GTA 3 as I loved vice city and san andreas, but the experience I had in Liberty City was a sour one. There are many hurdles to jump over to get this working. Firstly you have to go into the properties and change a few settings, fair enough that is quite simple. Then when you boot up the game the text is invisible which means you cannot play the game. I began looking through forums with people saying that they had had the same problem. There was a patch you could download but it had been taken down from Google drive so I began looking elsewhere. i downloaded the patch off of Mediafire and placed it in the games directory folder and the patch worked, the text was clearly visible. I booted up the game and controller support was limited not knowing then that you configure the controller settings in big picture as I have done for other games since and I felt a keyboard and mouse for a game like GTA was unnatural as i have played on console for most of my life I still play FPS games with a mouse and keyboard im not a complete noob. I uninstalled the game and left it at that. A few days later my antivirus detected that the patch I had downloaded was a virus better late than never I suppose and so I can not recomend this game to anyone.
