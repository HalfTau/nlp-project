Amaaazing gameplay for a 2001 game. Still great to play today despite newer releases.ProsMaxed out graphics on almost every machine built after 2004.Much more advanced controls over the console counterpart.Nostalgic as .Supports MP3 playback.ConsAI and player movement is jacked up slightly  cars crash randomly, people jumping into road etc.Reversal is nearly IMPOSSIBLE in some vehicles depending on terrain.Unhandled exception error is tedious to fix.Missions are repetitive and redundant at times.
