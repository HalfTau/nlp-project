In 2001, I was a junior in high school, and as one, was completely blown away by GTA III. The music, the size of the game, the overall gloomy rainy atmosphere  it was right up my alley. And now, 15 years later, I look back and realized that nothing has changed and that this game still remains one of my favorites. I think its safe to say that it influenced my life quite a lot  I learned to drive while playing it I was learning English at the time and the game helped a lot my music tastes were influenced by the radio stations. And when I was feeling blue, like I did a lot when in high school, I could escape in this approximation of the reality across the ocean.Sure, these days with newer games like GTA IV and V, the graphics are better, the plot is more twisted, guns are more abundant and the music is newer/different. I do like the newer games as well, so cant say they are worse than GTA III. But this one is the one that started the 3D Grand Theft Auto Experience, just like Black Sabbath started heavy metal.So, Im not sure that what I wrote here qualifies as a review, because I like everything, but here it is.
