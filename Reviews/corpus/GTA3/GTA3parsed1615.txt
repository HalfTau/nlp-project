This game for when it launched brought so many innovations in open world gaming sandbox.Now, 12 years later still remains as my favourite game, as the first time i played it back in summer of 2002. it was a birthday gift from my best friend. the only thing the game misses is inbuilt multiplayer mode, but luckily mod communities have brought this too in this spectacular game, Its the first 3D game in the GTA series. This game is history, period.
