Get the game, just not Rockstars Steam version. The car textures are all black or extremely dark. I know that there is a fix for the bad blackish steam textures, but there shouldnt have to be one, because it shouldnt be a problem. For a game that still has support updates still come out every now and then, the fact that Rockstar can release a game on steam with such a basic and glaring issue, and let alone refuse to fix it, boggles the mind. Rockstar isnt known for its dedication to its PC ports, but come on! Its a texture error for christs sake! Get just one guy and tell him to fix it, so you can include it in the next update, hell be done in less than an hour! Easier still, since you are so lazy, just download one of the fixes on the internet and repackage it as a bug fixing update, so the customers dont have to jump through hoops to make the game work right! Pathetic, careless handling of an extremely important classic.
