This was the first GTA I ever played. It was part of what got me into gaming. So much fun can be had just rolling around in a car listening to the radio great soundtracks! and just generally adding to the games debauchery.Then theres the missions, which can be both difficult and fun and strange!. This was /the/ game growing up, and its held up well to the test of time.I recommend this game for anyone looking for an open world sand box game to just generally have fun with music for hours on end. Its worth every penny.
