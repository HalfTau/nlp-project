This revolutionary game which I played mostly on PS2 changed how big and open games could be and how much you could interact with them. Rockstar made a game that players could, for the first time, roam around a 3D open world all the while stealing cars, driving like a mad man and shooting or driving over anything that moves.The atmosphere and social commentary of fictitious1990s U.S. culture and media, delivered through the dialog, car radios and advertisements, is both accurate and controversial. The radio advertisements in particular are so over the top and funny but also disgustingly realistic. I loved the classical radio station in GTA III and wish that one will be in GTA IV.For me, the unique thing that set GTA III apart from the GTA games that followed are the quirky and stylized look and physics. Some of the most fun Ive had with GTA III was driving how you should never drive a car in real life.In my top five games of all time list.
