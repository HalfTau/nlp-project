As an owner of the original game featured on CDROM, this release is a great disappointment. Graphics have been improved slightly, 1080p at 60 fps make even the old textures and models look nice. Despite this, many things are worse than in the original gameThe Dx 8.1 issue can easily be resolved by enabling Legacy Components in Windows 10, but fixing dark textures requires downloading some obscure file which comes in a zipped file. I was pointed to this file at the Steam community and it actually worked fine, nevertheless downloading a random zipped file is not what I call trustworthy.All the other things I mentioned about messed up gameplay make playing this release of GTA 3 a horrible experience, taking a whole lot of fun from it.If you are lucky and still have the CDROM version, you should better try to make it work on your current PC or go for it and find ye olde Athlon XP or Core 2 Duo  PC with Windows XP installed on it and enjoy your alltime classic the vintage way bonus points for CRT!. If you do not have the CDROM version and yo are not a diehard fan of GTA 3, you should better avoid this release as it does not represent the feeling of the game from 2002.
