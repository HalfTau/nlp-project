Its an old game, and you can see that on both graphic and gameplay sides.But yeah, this is the first 3D GTA game! And my first 3D GTA too.Its kind of GTA2, but in 3D, its enjoyable for what it is but its not aged so well and this can lead to some frustration. However is still totally playable and its surely a classic. Worth checking if you want to learn a bit of openworld history, but I still prefer GTA2.
