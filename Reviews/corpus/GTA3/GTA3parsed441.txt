I cant really go to indepth because I dont really do missions in this game, I just have fun.GoodGood graphics for its release 2002Good drivingGood physicsBadAI is awful, for example, if I start shooting people on the street, only a few people who were around a metre or two away would run away from the area. And then the people across the street would go about their lives.I cant seem to save my game when I do a mission, which is why I havent bothered playing them anymoreMain character cant speakVehicles  10/10Physics  9/10Graphics  10/10
