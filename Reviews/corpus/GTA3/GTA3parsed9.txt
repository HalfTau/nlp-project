This game was a technical marvel and breath of fresh air when it first launched in 2002. While it still remains a good game techincally and visually, replaying the game in 2017 feels limiting compared to not only GTAs own sequels but also its modern contemporaries. A lot of the game mechanics and character controls feel clunky and limiting to make it a truly enjoyable experience now. However Im still gonna give this a thumbs up for the game that helped popularize the sandbox game genre.
