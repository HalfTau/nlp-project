The best version of GTA III out there. Though the Xbox version has slightly better graphics, GTA III for PC controls a thousand times better, since the concept of free aim and camera control were apparently foreign in early 2000s console titles.Much more playable than console versions, but nothing mindblowing if you have already played it elsewhere.
