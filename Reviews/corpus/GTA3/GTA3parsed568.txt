Despite my low play time reported on steam for this game, I have played this game for many hours on both the PlayStation 2 and the PC as well.Dont Bother with this one. Beyond it being the first fully 3D Grand Theft Auto game, and one of the first games to do 3D open worlds well being a massive improvement over Driver and Driver 2 before it, theres very little here that was not either also done or done better in GTA Vice City and/or San Andreas. Beyond the main story and the payphone side missions, the only things left to do is collect hidden packages, cause general mayhem and do the police, firefighter, and taxi side missions.Contrast this with GTA Vice city where you have all of that with better and more weapons, better and more cars, better gang distribution seriously, after a certain point in GTA 3s story, one area of the map becomes impossible to drive through without a tank, as gang members who wield shotguns in that area will shoot at you and will blow up your car immediately upon entering their territory, better and less linearstory line missions, MUCH better music Beyond the station with the Scarface OST and the Rap Station I distinctly remember the music in GTA 3 being pretty awful and a more interesting city with better aesthetics. All of this remains true for San Andreas, which managed to improve it beyond what even Vice City improved upon, making it that much more significantly better than GTA 3. For the most part, the liberty city of GTA 3 was depressing to look at, with a lot of grey in the colour palette, whereas for both of its successors, this was significantly improved. What I will say in GTA 3s favour is that its simplicity makes it good for a mobile game, compared with the more complex controls of Vice City and especially San Andreas.Overall, dont buy this, at least not on PC, and instead buy GTA San Andreas or Vice City. Unless youre replaying it for nostalgia purposes or on your phone/tablet, theres nothing here that hasnt been done better in other 3D open world games since. If you REALLY want to play in the Liberty City of GTA 3 on PC, search for mods to add Liberty City into either GTA San Andreas or Vice City, you will get the city of GTA 3 with the improvements of VC or SA.
