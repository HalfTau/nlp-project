I really like this game,this wonderful classic game,and this is the first time I play it.I have only played GTA Vice City when I was a kidGTA3 was released in 2001 and GTA Vice City was released in 2002.ProsI had to try to adapt to its graphics of old times for a few hours,then I found this game is really fun.as the gameplay itself is similar with the sequels,I think its graphics wont be a big problem if you want to play it nowadays.If you love gta5,I think you will also love gta3 only if you can adapt to its graphics.Wonderful storyline with many interesting missions,some missions are a little difficult,and you can finish the mission by different ways.A big and well designed opening world map which depicts the whole city of Liberty Cityis that city real?.There are many gangs in the game,such as Italian Mafia,Triad in China Town,Japanese Yakuza,Columbia,Yardie,every gang has its unique cars and outfits...So you get more enemies except cops.There are many hidden contents waiting for you to explore on the map.weaponsmoneyheartsstars...Thats fun.Many kinds of weapons and cars.Awesome raido songs! I love the songs I am hot tonight and She is on fire.ConsCant check the map of the whole city in the game,and many important places arent marked on the minimap.Can buy guns in the shop,but cant buy and change outfits in the game.Pros or Cons/The protagonist Claude never said even a single word.Overall rating9.2/10Honestly,gta3 is outdated now,but it is one of the best games in 2001.and if you can adapt to its graphics,this game is still very fun to play.
