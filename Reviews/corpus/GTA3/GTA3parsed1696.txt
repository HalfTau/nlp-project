Pros Holds up really well. The city feels real, alive, with different sections inhabited by different groups/gangsChinatown, the Mafias turf, etc.. All of the radio channels are worth listening through. Sharp satire, much of which remains applicable. Cars, boats and a plane to use. A ton of stuff to do, keeping you playing long after youve completed the storyline. Cool story, with twists and backstabbings  a proper big city crime story. Great mission design.Cons Shooting is pretty badthey did realize, and put more emphasis on carmissions, thankfully. The earlyish 3D graphics have really aged. Barely a personality to the protagonist.My recommendation a must for any fan of openworld gaming.
