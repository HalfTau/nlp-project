This was a fantastic game when it came out, but unfortunately, I must say it hasnt aged very well.There are some mechanics that do not make any sense by todays standards.If you have never played this game, and want to witness a piece of history, by all means, buy it.However if you HAVE played it in the past, leave it there. Keep your nostalgia.
