While Driver 2, Body Harvest and Shenmue started the 3D open world genre, Grand Theft Auto III was the one that truly capitalized it. Back in 2001 it was one of the most revolutionary games that came out that year and helped put Rockstar on the map. Due to its success, games like True Crime, Saints Row, The Scarface Video Game, The Godfather 12 games, Just Cause, Mercenaries and Destroy All Humans helped the genre grow more and more. Even though it has been 15 years as of now that Im writing this since its inception, to me, its still fun as hell to play through. It may seem basic compared to the other games in the series that came after it, but Liberty City is still fun to explore, whether it may be finding the Hidden Packages, Rampages or the Easter Eggs, its fun. For me, its in my top 3 favorite games that came out in 2001. Silent Hill 2 and Max Payne were my other two favorites. If you havent played it, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!Warning This game wont work properly on Windows 10. Im using Windows 10 and I managed to get it working again. This video will be very helpful Ill link it at the end of this review so you wont feel like youve been ripped off.This game is and will always be amazing, and be remembered as one of the greatest games of all time. I hope you have fun with this game like how I did.Link to the patch
