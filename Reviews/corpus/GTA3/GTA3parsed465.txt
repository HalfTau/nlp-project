It kills me having to downvote this game. GTA 3 was my second ever GTA game back in the day on the PS2 I started with Vice City. GTA 3 is such a nastalgic game for me and thats why I decided to purchase it for PC. Unfortunatley this is one of the worst PC ports I have ever played. I would actually deem the game UNPLAYABLE. First, the menu is invisible. If you want to change graphics settings or play a differnt save from the main menu, too bad. Second, theres a glitch where every car in the game has a weird black shadow on them, you cant even see the cars. Its a sad and truly pathetic effort by Rockstar and itspoor of Steam to allow this game to be up for sale. Rockstar please fix. Until then DO NOT make a purchase with this game.
