I love this game and i think that this game deserves to be the best game ever. Now, I say this because not only does it have an amazing storyline and great game play for its time, it also was a breakthrough, and historic point in gaming community. Without GTA III, we probably wouldnt have the other amazing games such as Call of Duty, BattleField, Left 4 Dead and others with amazing graphics. I would recommend this game to anyone I know.
