Normal GTA gameplay, and still remarkably fun to return to. Shooting feels solid, and satisfying to use, and the keyboard controls work well, although driveby shootings are very difficult to perform, requiring you to drive using WASD, look out the side of your car with E or Q and press the left mouse button to shoot, while trying not to crash. But since you can get round most of the occasions where you may need to driveby by running over people, it isnt an overwhelming problem.Those used to the new GTAs may be upset with the lack of the ever fun motorbikes and aircraft in the game the one plane, a Dodo, is almost impossible to get into sustained flight, which it isnt intended to do. But it makes up for this with a good story, a  great New Yorkstyle world made of three island, and a enjoyable selection of cars, vans, lorries, supercars and a tank.All in all, GTA III is worth a revisit, if only for a while and for its story.
