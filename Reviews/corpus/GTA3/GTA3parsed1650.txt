This game is amazing!!! First of all, I have played this game a lot longer then it says on my steam. I have already beaten this game once, possibly twice, years and years ago. I owned it on PS2,, but someone stole it, so I bought it again on steam. Why? Because this game is a much needed part in any gamers collection. Sure, its pretty old and the graphics arnt amazing, but the missions are fun, and who doesnt like driving around and blowing stuff up? Not in reality of course. Buy this game, NOW!!!
