WINDOWS 10 Fking sucks!!! I bought this game with the GTA Collection when it was on sale only too find out that none of these games seem to want to work on Windows 10Though I do know it is a good game because ive played the Xbox  PS2 Versions so Id reccomend this game as long as you dont have Windows 8/8.1/10
