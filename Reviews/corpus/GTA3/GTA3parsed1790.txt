Edit Seeing that Rockstar doesnt give a dime about its costumers and constantly screwing them, im changing this review to negative. But this is not the only reason. Even before the game had problems you had to search for widescreen patches, car color patches, and im not sure but they might have removed songs from this game too, like they did in Vice City and SAGTA 3 , the first 3D GTA .The game is still awesome even 11 years later , even though its got a lot of flaws , limited veriety of weapons , few missions , few cars , it still has a lot of things to do and it is still fun to play the game .The visuals are less than mediocre , the cars colours are barely noticeable since all cars are darkened . The city and atmosphere is ugly but thats how Liberty City is supposed to look .The sound effects are mediocre and the radios have few good songs .Overall , this is a must play game even though its far from perfect . This is what started the GTA succes.
