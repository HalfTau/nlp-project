Dont get me wrong, its a great game, but if you have finished it and have great memorieslike i did about it, dont pick it up again, it ruins it. Character is the most silentfor a month not a single word in game time and cold grand theft auto lead everIn gta 1, 2 and london they talked rubbish. Music and sounds are goodexcept police sirens and bridge bell those were anoying , the map of liberty city is quite good, it feels empty a bit, but hey game came out in early 2000s, Missions are quite fustrating at some times, especially when cops are brought into them, They are very aggresive and after one star they never fade away, so allways remeber where paint shops and police stars are my one chase went for a hour or so because i did not find any of those. Pack your self allways with bodyarmor and try jumping around against those cartel s. And whats all the shooting when i stroll around the city feels like everyone hates me. Play it when you havent and are a big fan of gta, stay away if you have.
