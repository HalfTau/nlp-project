i totally recommend it. when i got the grand theft auto collection which features all the gta pc games 3d and hd universe. it was like 10 usd which is an extremely amazing deal and oh my god am i addicted to this game. yeah sure you got hard levels but they can be optional. the graphics would suck nowadays in 2018 but times have changed and we werent as talented at 3d back then but thats the best we had in 2001. but other than the animation quality, this game aged magnificently awesome so i really recommend it
