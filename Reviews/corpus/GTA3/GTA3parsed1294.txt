Good! Ran on Win7 Ultimate x64 SP1 fine.Though, if you have a multimonitor setup like I do, you might run into a mouse problem where if you scroll to far to either the right or left or top or bottom, depending on your setup, your cursor will fly out of the game window and onto the desktopon one of your other monitors and then when you click the mouse button, the game minimizes which is annoying. Yes so it would appear that the game doesnt lock mouse cursor to the primary monitor or whichever monitor youre using to run the game in, in fullscreen. To fix this, you can either disable all but the monitor youre using to play this in, in fullscreen or use some sort of thirdparty patch/software that locks your mouse to a particular monitor until your game closes or whenever.Also theres a glitch if you set your fps cap to more than 30and 30 is game default, you might instantly die whilst sprinting from a high surface to a lower ground surface. I was playing this with a 60 fps cap and was doing fine, except those rare instant death glitch. Any higher and the game gets pretty glitchy....so it would appear that the game was designed to be played at 30fps? idk.
