Great game I got it just for old times, And im not a fan of the gta v because they want you to play as 3 people. I did notice that the tanks cant be destroyed except by fire not sure if ps2 was that way or not. But after all a great game to play just for the memories.Note there is a shooting glitch in the internet cafe where the cops cant shoot you
