GTAIII offered excellent open world game play and map design with a plethora of interesting characters and a compelling story mode set in the underworld of an alternative New York. Too bad it didnt age nearly as well as the next two games.When it came out, GTAIII was heralded as the first great step to a brand new era of Grand Theft Auto games. In retrospect, it is more of a mixture of new elements that later defined the series, and old ones left from the first three games. The location Liberty City, an alternative New York, many characters, and things like the topdown driving camera, car crusher, bomb shop are all relics of the past, all forgotten in later instalments.They fit nicely alongside the new additions though, like thirdperson gameplay, the cinematic mission briefings, the new car physics, and the weapon handling system. These all made GTAIII not only accessible to a wider audience, but did so without dumbing down the game too much for the plebs.Exploration and running amok randomly were always part of GTA, and GTAIII is no exception. The return of the rampage challenges and the collectibles also support the free roam aspect, but the real strength lies in the missions. The loose collection of jobs is replaced by a massive storyline about a mute smalltime gangster who has to work his way up in organised crime to take revenge on the woman who shot him in the back.The plot is grim, but the execution isnt so. The series always had a hefty dose of dark humour and liked to satirise the consumeroriented society. This is even more apparent here, where human lives have no meaning, and you may cause mayhem for the silliest of reasons.The gameplay and controls by todays standards sadly lack a lot, and the engine isnt really suited for post Windows XP systems. But if you ever want some GTA nostalgia, this is the best place to start.
