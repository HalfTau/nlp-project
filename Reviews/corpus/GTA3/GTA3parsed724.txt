WAY TOO LONG, DIDNT READ It can be a  to get running well, some mods are basically a must, story is meh Driving is good, the rest of the gameplay like shooting is okay, has a fair amount of stuff to keep you busy, radio and soundtrack are still very good, is an important game to go back and play if you havent just bear in mind its seriously old now and does have some fg stupid problems which will annoy at times.Liberty City, USA.The worst place in america.Yes, I will be recommending this game but please note the recommendation comes with some pretty hefty caveats, that is for as good as I believe this game still is, there is also some seriously flawed and outdated design and game mechanic aspects to it.Firstly its basically required in my eyes to mod the game before playing, that is to get a vastly improved experience over say, the PS2 original at least which was the only way Id ever played it for 10 years prior, although Im talking simple bring it up a bit more to modern standards mods, not game changing/breaking over the top st, the Silent patch and the XBOX versionPC conversion are probably the best two to go with.Although getting the game running properly at all with or without mods can be a bit of a bear, it took me literally an entire day to get it good n proper with the mods.   L The joys of running 14 year old software on modern OSs and whatnot.BUT if you manage to wrestle with all that and get it going its still mostly worth playing.The story is preeety meh and basic, but then its gonna be with a lead character whos seen so muchthat hes sworn to silence. Claude, baby, were all in this together, we gotta be strong, tell each other whats wrong, you gotta open up budyy, YOU CANT JUST BUTTON IT UP CLAUDE! ahem, excuse me, moving on.So yeah, cut scenes, story and acting not exactly riveting but remember that this is a game from just after the turn of the century and should be given at least some slack for it.Gameplay however again mostly still stands up, well enough to still enjoy it anyway, driving is actually really well balanced and its rather fun to blast around the city with the handbrake, just fg handbrake everything handling, only problem is the vehicles are very weak indeed and are guaranteed to spontaneously combust after just a few shunts and even fewer gun shots, like seriously few gun shots, like literally 2 shotgun hits and BOOM! Instant explosion and wasted, not great.Movement and shooting are generally acceptable, just so long as youre quite slow, careful and dont let enimies get behind you cos if you do then the outdated, awkwardness of the controls will rear its ugly head...badly, as long as you keep on top of them youll be fine little jimmy.Mission variety and general stuff to do are pretty good actually, yet again especially for a 15 year old game, back in 2001 it felt like you could do almost anything! they managed to incorporate some reasonably interesting scenarios despite the extremely limited ways to interact with the world, then theres a number of side attractions, apart from the now GTA staple of simply running/driving around tearing everyone and everything a new one theres a few races, GTA 1 esque phonebooth missions, police car, ambulance, fire engine and taxi challenges, a couple of off road driving challenges, hidden packages to find, which actually have a useful reward garages for collecting rare vehicles, stunt jumps, rampages, RC destruction and probably something else Ive forgotten about, now that I think about it theres probably more side content than main story content, a trend which would DEFINITELY continue as the series progressed.Now here comes some issues, ya know little things like LARGE PORTIONS OF THE MAP BECOMING STRICTLY OUT OF BOUNDS AREAS!! Thanks to the idiotic choice of giving all the gang members which youve upset, which is most of them by the later stages of the game by the way, some of the most powerful weapons in the game and terminator like scanning systems to pick you out and blow you to pieces in 2.5 seconds despite you zooming by at 110mph in a banshee.And then theres the four, five and six star wanted levels, its...indescribable at times, it can truly feel like a glitch sometimes, its just so much no, thats all that needs to be said on that matter.   On a more positive note however, even when youre getting yourripped open at least you get to listen to the still great, eclectic mix of music, talkshows and adverts on the radio, GTA always nails the time period its going for and III is no exception, its basically become a time capsule to the late 90s/early 00s and its still awesome, social commentary n all.Finally, I just think this is an important game to play, like games such as Super Mario Bros. and DOOM before it, it was a cultural and sales phenomenom and spawned countless clones as everyone tried to jump on the bandwagon but at least in terms of impact and popularity no one ever really came close.
