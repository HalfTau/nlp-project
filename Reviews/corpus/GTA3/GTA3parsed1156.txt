Do you enjoy bumping into a wall and knackering your entire rear end in a car?Do you like it when the Mafia will randomly shoot you?Do you desire to hit pedestrians then go spinning out?Are you lusting for an adventure where you dont speak, its 2001, you have a pager, and youre wearing a RADICAL leather jacket?! ?Get it. The original 3D GTA. It might not look astonishing or aged well at all, but, its 2001. And its great.
