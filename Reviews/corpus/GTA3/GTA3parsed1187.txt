This game will have the same review as I wrote in Vice City, cause it have the same problem.This game was always amazing for PS2 and old PCs, but unfortunately, Steam didnt made a decent installation that covers mostly glitches that well face using newer systems and PCs.It took a decent time to fix the game and even like that, trying all mentioned workarounds in internet, the game still becoming crazy after setting Frame Limiter off, so, playing with 30FPS is totally weird and destroy the gaming experience.
