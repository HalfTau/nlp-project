The very first time GTA went 3rd person and it was AWESOME.The game is a legend. For the first time you can do everything a GTA had to offer while living it inside the game and not above it.The main character was not voiced yet at that time, but the game is still awesome, with a crazy story twist of events and weirdfunny characters.Although roaming sandbox games existed before this title, this one certaily was the very best 3rd person full 3D graphics sandbox game at the time.I was glad to had the chance to play this from start to end and if you ever get the chance to start a GTA marathon, you wont be any disappointed!Totally recommended! For old times sake!
