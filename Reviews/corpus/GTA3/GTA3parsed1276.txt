Graphicsespecially car textures are VERY outdated already but game is still entertaining. Some missions are pain in thebut it has some charm in comparision to games we have today that reset you 5 seconds earlier after you fail.If ure fan of the series but havent played this one for some reason, you should give it a try. Inability to swim or climb is little annoying but you will get used to it.Also, dont drive jeeps, they suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
