This is a bad game. It aged very poorly. The camera is terrible, the controls are terrible, the autoaiming system is astoundingly terrible, and so on. These are all massive flaws that existed at the time, but which people ignored because the game was innovative.The difficulty is ridiculous at times, mostly due to the bad mechanics. It took me ages to complete one early mission where I had to stop a car and kill the two guys in it. Id stop them, try to get my gun to lock on, fail, and get stunlocked to death by a shotgun.When youre running in one direction, the camera follows you. You also cant change the camera direction while moving. This means that if an enemy is chasing you and need to kill them, you have to completely stop, turn your camera, and hope youre able to target them with the horrible targeting system before they kill you. Spoiler you wont be able to. Youll die.If you played this 15 years ago, congrats! You were able to play through a horrible game because you didnt know any better. Now you have wonderful nostalgia and can view the game through the rosetinted lenses of nostalgia.If youve never played this game, dont start now. It sucks. It sucks really, really hard. Play Sleeping Dogs or GTA V or any other more modern, better refined sandbox game instead. This one belongs in the past.
