This is a terrible port of from what ive heard a great game. The instant I played the game and tried to skip the intro cutscene, the game crashes. Keep in mind that I have a windows 8 computer that can run 90 of my games at max settings with my Radeon R9 270X but its just a case of a really bad PC port from Rockstar Studios. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC!!! ONLY GET IT ON THE CONSOLES OR AT LEAST THE DISC VERSION OF THE GAME FOR PC. DONT BUY IT ON STEAM. EVEN WHEN IT GOES ON SALE, DONT GET SUCKERED IN LIKE I DID WITH THE SALE. Shameful Display Rockstar. Shameful Display...
