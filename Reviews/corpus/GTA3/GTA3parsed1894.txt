The grand daddy of sandbox fps/driving games! for many of us it was our first GTA and it definitely was my first taste of the GTA universe! I had this game on the ps2 10 years ago when I was 11 and it one of my favorite games at the time next to Jak  Daxter and all the other goodies... GTA III holds a special place in my heart since it was just so much fun to cause mayhem in the city and when I found out about the cheat codes my replay value of this game rose near 10x! it was just so great trying to get the wanted level as high as possible and drving a tank around running over everyone heheh! I dont think I ever beat it but I might try to beat this steam version since I no longer have my ps2 version... anywho for those who never played it and really whoever hasnt get out from under that rock! or for those that have its just a great game to have in your steam library and to play every once in a while listening to the great soundtrack and destroying everyone and everything!
