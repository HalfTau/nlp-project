Grand Theft Auto III is a classic that created a whole new genre of video game that dominates the industry today. I first played this game on the PS2 when it was still fairly new and spent dozens and dozens of hours playing it to full completion. While it looks and plays fairly crudely in 2017, I believe it is still a worthwhile use of your gameplay time. It remains a fun experience once you get back into the 2001 mindset. The atmosphere and world building is still impressive today as well as the amount of missions and sidequests to accomplish.
