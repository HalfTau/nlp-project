I may have spent a lifetime in Liberty City. I couldnt stop playing it and exploring every nook and cranny. Hell, even searching for hidden packages was addictive, after all you had freedom! I also remember how humours it was, taking into account this is a trademark in the series, nevertheless GTA 3 had a darker, more industrial and lethargic feel to it. This game was fantastic and still is considering how much of a game changer it was. What The Matrix was to the movies, GTA 3 was to the gaming industry. The soundtrack got me into drum  bass and dub as well, driving away from the cops while listening to MSX and chilling with KJah.Highly recommendable classic.
