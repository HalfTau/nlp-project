it should be grand theft shoes cause your on foot after half way through the missionsGangs will kill you dead for driving and  will make you pay for trying missions anything bad that can happen will happen. eg step into a icecream van 2 shot gun shots  or 2 seconds later your on fire mission failed. no way of telling other than by memory where the gang turf is. let alone there is no in game map. thats dosnt bother me tho i wish i could see gang turf so as to avoid on mission.Ill still play through it but with a general overtone of anger and hatered with a dash of saddness. and thats why i wouldnt recomend to anyone who hadnt played it before as an individual game. if you played it when it was the best game of its type avalable you probably will  awnser the call of nostalgia and i would recomend it to you. just dont do what i did and expect an easy stroll through this game you will be let down.
