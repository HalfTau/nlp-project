All negative reviews for GTA III PC will get downvoted to hell by cowardly nostalgia kiddies, regardless of how well written they are, so Im not even going to bother.The PC port of GTA III was really borked. The cars are all black, random crashes will occur, no dual analog joystick support i.e. Xbox 360 gamepad, the sound crackles a lot. Anyone who writes a positive review for the PC port of GTA III on Steam has never actually played the game for more than 5 seconds. History keeps on repeating itself, GTA III was a bad PC port, just like GTA IV was, and GTA V probably will be.Reviews which are nothing but praise and nostalgiagasming are NOT helpful! Reviews which explains in detail any potential problems with a game ARE!EDIT Oops! I forgot to mention something quite important for some PC gamers You apparently need to run this at 30 FPS or youll get physics glitches. How lovely!
