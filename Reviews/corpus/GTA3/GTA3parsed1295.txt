A goddamn classic that truly started the openworld genre. Almost every openworld game owes most of its mechanics to GTA III. Its gameplay has not really aged at all. In fact, the formula hasnt really changed throughout the years. The only thing that has aged are the graphics obviously and the radio stations, which are way shorter compared to later entries in the series. If you havent played this game at all which I highly doubt, buy this
