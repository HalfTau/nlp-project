It may say ive only played about 1.5 hours at the moment, But I used to have the disc. I lost it and a friend bought me this. Basically, this is kinda one of the best game I have ever played. If you have the money, GET IT NOW MOFO. its got bad graphics, yeah, But that doesnt change how good this story line is. Its an AMAZING game.
