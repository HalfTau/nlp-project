Just beat the game for the first time, ironically the only 3D GTA game left for me to finish, but theres a first for everything, right?GTA III gave me a hard time sometimes, but in a good way. Its got a nice difficulty level to it which is never unfair to beat, but usually challenging. Storyline is alright, good enough for a 2001 thirdperson shooter. Gameplay works like a charm. Its running extremely stable on Windows 10, have not experienced a single game crash in 20 hours of playing  very nice! Final mission rather simple, but satisfying enough, surely. Works for me.What I didnt like is the fact that GTA III does not have a complete builtin map, only the minimap on the radar, and how the game expects you to know your environment better than you usually would, such as having to find out where the tunnel from Staunton Island to Shoreside Vale is to be found  very tricky when having to escort a police officer in merely three minutes. But thats just that. Small things to criticize, nothing that would ruin a very, very neat game like GTA III for me personally. CAN recommend  especially if youre into rather simple gameplay, and like a good challenge.
