I was a big fan of the original topdown Grand Theft Auto games. I was totally psyched when GTA III came out. A 3d Grand Theft Auto game? This is going to be great!Then I got it. What a laggy, poorlycoded pile of excrement. This thing allegedly had Playstation code in it. Im talking about the PC version. Absolutely unplayable on computers of the day. I was a huge Grand Theft Auto fan but after this debacle, I completely got off the series.Over ten years later, on a modern computer, the game doesnt lag. Much. Maybe in another decade computers will be developed that will be able to run this poorlycoded garbage. Its otherwise a fun game at times.Pwninator score 3/10
