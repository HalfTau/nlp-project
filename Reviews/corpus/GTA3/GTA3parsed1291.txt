All nostalgia from this game aside, this game is okay for its age, the controls are kinda clunky, the missions become boring and repetitive, and it doesnt last very long, all that set aside it is still a gem and one of the best games I have played, but it isnt as great as people make it out to be.6/10  Controls6.5/10  Shooting8/10  Gameplay8/10  Story7.5/10  Graphics For the time7/10  Overall
