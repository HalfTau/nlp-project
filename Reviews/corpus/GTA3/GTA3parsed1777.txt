I dont care what anyone says  this game has not kept its greatness after 10 years. It is a very difficult game, but its difficult for the wrong reasons. Stupid AI, bad physics, and bad controls. If you want to play this, i reccomend getting it for PS2, as it was originally made for the PS2 only.PC 5/10, PS2 7/10
