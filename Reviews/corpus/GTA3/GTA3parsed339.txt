It feels so primitive playing all these years later. Every adjacent game added more and more features, while also fixing several issues. Though this was a massive upgrade from the first 2 games, its hard to tell if its aged poorly or not.On the contrary, the PC version is infinitely better than the PS2/PS3 versions. The graphics, framerate, and features are all a step up. I somehow managed to nearly 100 this on the PS3 despite its sloppy performance. Considering how cheap this is, and the fact that you can use a PS controller if you dont like the new controls, in this day and age Id say this version is the best choice.
