Classic game. Love it or hate it, this changed gaming. So nice i can still enjoy this title, my very old PS2 is on life support. lol. I have a 360 controller, and just like the store page says, its not fully supported. You cant turn around! The left analog stick works fine, but the right one which is used to turn, doesnt. So the partial control support is pretty useless because its unplayable without the ability to turn. But there is an easy fix located in the Guides section on steam.This makes the game enjoyable. It enables the use of the 360 triggers and the right analog stick.
