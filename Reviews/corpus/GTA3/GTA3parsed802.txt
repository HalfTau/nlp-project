Just bought this game a couple days ago, after what Ive seen, heres what I have to say,PROSNice graphics that still hold up today in my eyesNice radio stations with good musicThe immersion is fantastic, Liberty City feels alive, it really does feel like a smaller version of NYCThe driving engine is rad, it feels nice with each car having its own feel and weight to itFantastic characters, they all feel like real people, none of them are stereotypicalCONSNo motorcycles but this doesnt really matter because this was the first 3D GTA gameOur main character Claude does not say a single word, this leaves SO much room for character development, not even in GTA SA does Claude say word but it does tell us he owned a service station in San Fierro and he used to live in San Andreas and ran away to Liberty City wiht CatalinaThe cars damage, it seems like they can be up in flames within secondsgetting out of a vehicle on its side, sometimes i am still stuck in the vehicle vans and trucks, the vehicle sets ablaze and Claude is stuckIf you buy this on steam you will see that all the cars are dark, I had to download a different .exe filethats about it though a part from some annoyances I love the game! 7.5/10
