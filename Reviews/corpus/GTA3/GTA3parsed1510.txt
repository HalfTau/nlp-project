Definately not as fun as I remember on the PS2. The game is fun through the first city but halfway through the 2nd it loses steam. Poor controller support is a bummer as the keyboard controls are far inferior to the console. Worth checking out for cheap if youve never played before or for nostalgic value...otherwise meh.
