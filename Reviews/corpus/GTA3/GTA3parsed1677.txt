For the story, characters, variety of cars and the city, I highly recommend this.However, unless youre incredibly masochistic, I would not get this game if you like go for 100 completion.  All the side activities required for 100 completion range from stupidly easy todifficulty.  If youre the type to rip at your hair when youre frustrated, you may very well end up completely bald by the time you reach 100 if youre determined enough not to give up on it before then.The main story missions have their frustrating moments, but nothing the average gamer cant handle.  Nothing too puzzling with simple to grasp controls and gameplay mechanics its simple thoughtless fun!  Although this game irritates me to no end that I cant hate myself enough to force me through 100, it still holds a place in my heart.  If you like good freeroaming chaotic nonsense with a somewhat decent story, this game might be for you.Just... dont put yourself through the pain for 100... do that on Vice City or San Andreas, theyre nowhere near as bad even GTA IVs 200 pigeons for no real reward arent this painful.
