I love the GTA series. From classics like Vice City and San Andreas to the famous GTA 5. I have no lesser respect for this game. However, if you are using Windows 10, please DO NOT buy this edition of GTA III. I was with the knowledge that Windows 10 was very identical to Windows 7, including compatibility proven by various games and software that was claimed broken in Windows 8. Despite this convenience, GTA III, forgiven by the fact this game is over a decade old, does not work with Windows 10.Encountered problems that I do not consider just a bugCutscenes freeze and can cause the game to crashEntities appear in the wrong place glitched in cutscenesControls frequently become unresponsive or get stuck I have sticky keys disabledMain menu text can become invisible until Steam overlay is viewed possibly just a Steam overlay bugPossibly other bugs that I have not yet encountered, and do not wish to on the risk of not qualifying for a refundI do not know if any of the above is encountered with Windows 8, but I have played a standalone copy of GTA III on Windows 7 and can confirm that it works fine. If you think that this review is misleading, please let me know and I will delete any genuine bugs listed and so on.
