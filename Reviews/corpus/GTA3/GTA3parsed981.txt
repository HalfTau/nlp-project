sorted out initial screen resolution probs, but then found that my brilliant logitech controller which works with every other pc/steam game that states controller support doesnt seem to register  i see from reading on forums on steam and elsewhere that mods can be downloaded  but frankly im not happy to keep ing around with this and potentially download something third party that harms my beautiful pc  so i cant recommend this!!
