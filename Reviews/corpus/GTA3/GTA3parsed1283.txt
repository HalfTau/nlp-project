The game that put the Grand Theft Auto series on the map if you were like me and played the old school gtas which had bad graphics and a ugly top down camera. This thing blew your mind. I spent hours on this game as a kid and it still has its replay value to this day.Yes it misses features from later games such as buying property and motor bikes amongst other things but this game is still top notch.The story of gta 3 and aswell as the variety of missions are superb.Gameplay is simple You can get patches for xbox 360/ps3 controllers from the gta garage community site that work like a charmLots of ways to customise the game such clothing, altering the maps VIA GAME FILES.10/10
