Windows 10 and judging from forum posts, 7 and 8.1 also usersBe aware that this game is old and will probably not run on your PC. Mine worked fine for a day, now it crashes immediately when I try to start it. Same for VC, by the way. To give you an overview of what I tried compatibility modes running as admin deleting gta.set adding the game to DEP Silentpatch download ddraw.dll deleting savegames copying savegames to different User Files directory reinstallingSooo... Be careful what you buy. I usually buy old games from a different platform that actually patches them to run on modern systems shrug sort of expected this here too.If you got an old PC I 100 recommend this game. Played it as a kid and loved it, still do today. Kind of disappointed I cant continue playing
