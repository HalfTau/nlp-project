Oh Grand Theft Auto III, I really have mixed opinions about this port.While it shows the glory of the transition of GTA to a 3D universe, that doesnt mean it controls very well.While Ive seen other reviews talking about resolution problems and the menu just not appearing porblems that I didnt had, I had to say that the problem are the controls. The aiming is horrible if you play with a mouse, and the classic aiming is just a piece ofIf you REALLY want to experience this game in all its glory, try getting the PS2 version. This port needs so much updates and patches that I dont see coming anytime soon...6/10
