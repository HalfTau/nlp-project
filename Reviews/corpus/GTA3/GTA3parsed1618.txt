ProsShould run well on any computer that meets the requirements, and I havent had any problems with the frame limiter off, unlike Vice City.Radio stations are very good, but they are short I dont think any of them last more than 40 minutes before looping.Missions are fun.Liberty City looks good and you can go for hours just driving around.Support for mods and MP3 radio station.ConsNot as much content as later GTA games, but thats kind of a nobrainer.Story not really involving, with the prolouge cutscene being less than 30 seconds, and a mute protaganist.By the end of the game, every gang will try to take you out whenever they see you, which makes exploring a pain in theOverallIts still fun, but is quickly getting dated when looking at more recent GTAs and other open world games. You should really only buy it if you played it way back when on your PS2 or PC and youre looking for a trip down memory lane. As revolutionary as it was when it first came out, it simply doesnt hold up that well nowadays.
