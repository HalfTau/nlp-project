I bought this because I never completed the whole thing as a kid when I had it for PS2... plus the nostalgia , hah.The game runs fine on my Windows 10 computer. No crashing or anything.Ive always preferred GTA3s Liberty City over GT4s. I know Liberty City is supposed to be dirty like New York but I think GTA4 went too far and made it completely unattractive to look at.If youre a fan of any other GTA games then this one is a must have. Dont skip it just because its old and the graphics are outdated.
