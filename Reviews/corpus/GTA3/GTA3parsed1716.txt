While it does have its moments, overall its fairly uninteresing. The different factions shooting and sometimes instakilling you makes the exploration of the city more frustrating than fun. Plus its not like theres much to explore in this somewhat empty city. Aside from the generally mediocre story missions theres just not a lot to do in this game.5/10
