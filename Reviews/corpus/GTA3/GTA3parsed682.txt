I know this is a game from 2002 but I found no joy out of this game. Yeah sure at first I was hyped to get backed to the days of when gta started its 3D universe but even then this game isnt that great for me. Its almost impossiblle to play the game with no cheats while not raging. I get used to getting back to games with old graphincs so this game diddnt bother me in the visual part but gameplay sucks. I wish the missions that were timed or I had to defend something never existed because those were hard as hell. Also you dont get a full map of the game so people like me have to memorize it as I go and sure that seems cool to not rely on a map but liberty city is a hell hole to get around with gangs always shooting at you and if you bump ingto a cop or even if they run into you your imidiantly ed. The amount of hours I put into this game to beat it shows that after half of the game you get realy sick of it. If you want to play through all the games of gta I recommend this game for starting out but BE WARNED ranging is likely to accure.
