Okay gameplay something between VC and SA, pretty nice graphics, but thats all. Story line for this game is 1/10, literally there is no story line. Random and nonsense movies before missions, main character who dont say a word in whole game and context... Yes, context is missing here totally. Just awfull comparing to San Andreas or Vice City. And music in all radio stations just wasnt for me, used my own playlist from PC what isnt good thing for game IMO. And yes, I know, this game is more like old GTAs  just for missions, but still I cant handle missing story line here. Just for missions and default GTA stuff this game will be ok i guess.
