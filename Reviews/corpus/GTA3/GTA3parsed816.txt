Obviously the game itself is awesome, but it has problems. It either crashes on loud up or the main menu doesnt load all the wayno text making it impossible to load a game. BUT there are easy mods out there you can install to fix this. the game rules, just be aware you may have issues initially but there are fixes that Rockstar should have fixed over a decade ago, literally.
