Pros Entertaining, Complex story lineCons Gets really repedative, so Fking long!, Graphics are really bad it is an old game, dont judge too muchThe game overall is alot of fun, I highly suggest it to anyone. Just be aware that it will get really repedative after a while. There arent too many options in the start, once you progress options open up.
