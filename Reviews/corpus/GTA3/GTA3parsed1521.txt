This is a truly amazing game we have here. It may be a little dated and all but there are mods for that. This game has a great introduction introducing the main character Claude Speed and his friend 8Ball who comes into the story again much later. You start doing minor jobs as a driver for a pimp/club owner. Then you do jobs for the mafia from heisting a bank truck, to delivering a corpse to cover up a murder. Again the graphics and AI may be a little dated but the initial freedom does certainly put a smile on your face. The game has two paths you can go on progress through the story, or just explore. To start you probably want to explore to get used to it. Id suggest stealing a taxi and doing the taxi oddjob, which after you complete 100 fares you unlock a special taxt called the Borgnine. The police chases are endless fun as they are in any GTA game. I grew up on this game so it may warp my vision of its age a bit with nostalgia but still it is a great game. It does lack in several elements that are key in GTA games today, such as the lack of a full map and not being able to rotate the camera around your vehicle in angles that arent 90 degrees, and the aiming is a little off but youll get used to it. There also other versions such as the PS2 version, Xbox, and mobile Android and iOS devices these versions do not support cheats but are easily modded. Id heavily suggest that you play the PS2 version first to get a feel for what your getting into. The main differences between the PC and the PS2 are that PS2 has an auto targeting system and the camera isnt consistantly behind the player. This version however has many pros, such as extra items on the map, customizeable skins, mods and many more things. Overall this game is worth the purchase.
