The first 3D Open World Grand Theft Auto, and to this day, one of the best R Games experiences ever.Even to this day, this game sticks out as one of my favorite Rockstar games.Graphics, gameplay, sound, everything, its all great.2001. 9/11 just happened. Time to numb the pain with senseless violence and dark crime drama to heat things up. Take part in street races, product pushing, assassinations, protection details, and other crimnal schemes in this crime thriller.Simply cannot express how awesome this game is. Buy it.
