I have to say GTA 3 is an amazing open world game despite a ton of glitches and bugs. The game is not very storydriven as many other games. Instead its more focused on the adventure and action in the state of Libety City. You play as Claude, a man shot and left for dead by your girlfriend after a bank heist. You try to crawl back from the bottom of the criminal food chain in redemption for your girlfriend as you end up in a mafia war against the triads. The mafia then betrays you and are forced to go into hiding. There are some flaws with the game such as the El Burro racing mission. El Burro tells you he as a job oppurtunity for you and says you are getting alot of street cred. So then out of nowhere he says you have to race. No explanation, just race. And the whole race is just lag and frusration. Dont believe me, just try the game for yourself. Overall, the game is hella fun and deserves an 8/10!
