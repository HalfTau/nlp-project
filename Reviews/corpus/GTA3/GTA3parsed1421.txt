This game opened so many doors, so many eyes. I think players new to the GTA franchise would probably be better served with one of the newer titles, but for someone like me who played this game when it first came out, and plenty more after that, this game is a wellremembered old friend. I have been known to sit in an idle vehicle in some quiet corner of the city, just listening to the talk radio station in the rain. Memorable characters and challenging quests with dated graphics, but still enjoyable and most certainly recommended.
