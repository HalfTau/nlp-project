If you have Windows 10, Get a Patch and youre good to go.Some aspects of the shooting havent aged well. Plus, the driving feels like youre on ice.But theres something magical about playing GTA III again.Its aged like swiss cheese honestly, but its still pretty tasty.Just exploring this incarnation of Liberty City again is beautiful honestly.Also hearing stuff like Yup Ive been drinking again or In the navy! Takes you back to a much more simplier time.When video games were getting more advanced but we were blurring that fine line between advancement and nostalgia.Overall, purchase GTA III to see a relic of how modern video games have shaped up to be in nearly 17 years.
