The game that started it all it has influenced a whole slew of known games, and therefore dare I say the most important game of the new millennium.Despite its age, it remains one of the best, mostenjoyable openworld games out there thanks to the fact that it resembles a wellmade pizza pie based with good gameplay and an ok storyline like tomato sauce with basil, topped with cheesy innuendos and characters and sprinkled with just the right amount of difficulty, like the occasional black olive.Even gets frustrating at times, but it is baked with such care, that it stays crisp through the end.WASTED
