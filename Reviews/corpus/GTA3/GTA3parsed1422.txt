Grand Theft Auto 3 is the landmark game that made the jump shift to 3D back in 2001. Before that, previous GTA games where in 2D top down perspective.As the series progressed, none could have achieved without the stepping stone of this game. Even thou the controls are very clunky, story is very plain, and outdated gameplay compared to the recent entries.Still a very great game to this day!7/10.
