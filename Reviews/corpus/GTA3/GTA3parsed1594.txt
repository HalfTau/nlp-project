This is one of my alltime favorite games, however...not compatible with my system apparently.I run a windows 8.1 operating system and the game loads quick, however the menu is invisible, the graphics were darkend to where yellow cabs look like black police cars, i cant get past the second mission due to loading screen pauses, it just stays on the loading screen for more than 20 minutes. I reinstalled the game 3 times, i dont use mods, it just doesnt work. really unfortunate
