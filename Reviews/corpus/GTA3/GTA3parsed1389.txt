As someone who started from GTA San Andreas, going back to GTA 3 is almost impossible and generally not worth it. There is no map function, you cannot bail out of cars, instant drowning, no icons for ammunation and the spray and pray fortunately the map is small enough that I can generally remember where they are, and just a general lack of features on top of the outdated graphics. Graphics aside, the core of GTA is in the game, but its difficult to enjoy when Im constantly trying to do something available in newer releases.
