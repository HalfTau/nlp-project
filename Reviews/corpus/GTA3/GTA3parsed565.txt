Quite glitchy as is On Windows 10 at least, MacOS version is alright. I installed SilentPatch with DDraw should fix the invisible menu glitch, GInput for xbox controller  support, a widescreen fix patch, and reduced mouse sensitivity to the minimum. Now the game is playable. I hope that helps any Windows 10 users out there.Rockstars should consider uploading a remastered steam version for GTA classics that support Windows 10, widescreen monitors, and xbox controllers.Not worth the full price. Stick to the mobile version for now. Wait for Steam / Humble bundle sales and only buy as part of a discounted GTA collection.
