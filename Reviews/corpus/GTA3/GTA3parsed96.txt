The original of the 3D GTA games. Fun but dated. It can be very hard because of that. Highly recommend getting this on sale and when you do I think installing mods are necessary. Mods will make the game less frustrating.I wish Rockstar gave this an update. Its so weird to say that the Android version of this game is superior, but its true from a gameplay standpoint controls are more difficult on mobile though.
