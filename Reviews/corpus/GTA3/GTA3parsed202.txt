Im not sure why i decided to install gta 3 and play it but im glad I did. I have fond memories of playing it on the ps2 and returning to it on the pc I had a blast. The graphics are obviously a little lacking, you start seeing the same pedestrians and cars quite frequently and objects in the distance pop in and out all the time. Once you get past that and the bumpy start to getting it running well on pc the actual gameplay is a lot of fun. Missions for the different groups, doing your own thing stealing cars, attacking various people finding strange places and secret packages and a story that escalates in an interesting way is all pretty good. My main issue playing the game was aiming weapons with the controller im using but you get used to it.
