GTA games like these were the best. It was not confined to gaming physics, not obsessed by making things lifeperfect. It was about a man with a cube hand, a cylindrical rocket launcher, a car that steers like a housefly with a pentagon shaped steering wheel. It was about the crap mouth to voice sync. It was about being a little kid killing people. It was about doing the most heinous crimes in the most magnificent way possible. Sometimes, crap is better. It is not a HD game abiding by the laws of physics. But boy is it amazing!!! Although the graphics seem dated by todays standads, for many, this was their first introduction to the Grand Theft Auto franchise. To myself and many others, this game and the others bundled within the Trilogy Pack, will forever hold a special place in my history of gaming  Peace!!
