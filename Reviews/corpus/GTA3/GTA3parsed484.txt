Good way to start off the GTA series from the beginning of the 3D games.Be sure to install silent patch to get rid of bugs, also a con is that you need to set FPS with RTSS to be able to play properly above 30FPS, and then still you better drive cars with frame limiter on.But overall its really worth the price.
