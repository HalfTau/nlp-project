GTA 3 is a classic and I would love to recommed this game, but there is one problem, you might have a hard time getting the game to work on a modern PC. I get it, the game is old, but if Rockstar wants to take my money for the old game, then they should at least patch it to work on modern pcs. If you turn frame rate limit off, most likely you will run into problems. If you have transparency problems, download the file below and copy the content into your GTA III directory.
