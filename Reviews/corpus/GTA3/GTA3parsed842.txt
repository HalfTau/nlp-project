Fun for a while if you can find it cheap and put up with the dated, frustrating trialanderror gameplay which is only going to get worse as the game ages. Theres no real variety to the way in which missions can be approachedyou have to try and die and restart multiple times to discover the way in which the game wants you to complete a mission.The mechanics are still relatively smooth and work well, save for some weapon gripes such as the grenades which cant be aimed accurately and only thrown blindly. The graphics and sound are dated but not terrible and the games gritty atmosphere holds up.Certainly no longer as amazing as it once was, but its a decent game.
