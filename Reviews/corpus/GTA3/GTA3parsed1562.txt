Grand Theft Auto III is literally a landmark and pinnacle achievement in game development.Having only briefly played the first GTA back in the late 90s on a friends Playstation I had,well, still have, an N64. Works fine too. I didnt know what the craze was all about when this masterpiece was originally released in 2001. I watched another friend play it for days on his PS2 while his great dane stared at me. The only thing I gathered was the silent protagonist could go on shooting sprees and kill s. I hadnt paid much attention to the story. But having finally laid my hands on the PC copy on Steam of course, only thing I laid my hands on were a 360 controller I grasped the unique and ubiquitious narrative with excitement.Of course I knew the sandbox formula in the GTA universe. Id played through GTA IV several times in 2008 and even beat Liberty City Stories on the PSP! Id also played GTA San Andreas prior to this, just a few months ago. So I knew what to expect. I knew the characters, I knew the story, mostly, and knew the gameplay.It might be 2014, but the 3D graphics are still interesting, the camera work that was chosen cinematic and professional, the dialogue true to the gangs styles. What really makes the game is the satirical take on violent societies as well as the strangeness authenticity to cities such as NY or LA.Not the greatest game storywise, but still enjoyable when you consider that Claude, although emotionless and silent, is the most badass protagonist.9.5/10
