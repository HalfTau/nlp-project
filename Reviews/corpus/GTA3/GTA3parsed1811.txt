GTA II was already fun, but GTA III took the franchise to a whole new dimension literally. At its time it was ground breaking an open realistic world, fantastic sound track and voice acting,  cool characters and endless possibilites.You could just drive through the city listening to music, do crazy stunts, kill cops or play as a cop/ taxi driver etc. The only bad points are some clipping errors and the mediocre shooting system.Even to this day the game is very enjoyable if you dont mind dated graphics.
