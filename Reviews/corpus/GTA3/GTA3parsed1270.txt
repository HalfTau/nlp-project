The very first GTA game i played back in the day. Blew my mind that a game existed like this as early as 2001 the amount of attention to detail whether it be cars, npcs, or the fact that its a very open world amazed me. For anyone that hasnt played it yet, i highly recommend you do.Story You play as Claude, a mute protagonist of the game. The story of GTA 3 tends to branch itself out with the various interesting characters you meet. I didnt really pay attention to the story too much until GTA IV but i can tell you that 3 does deliver some interesting story telling.Gameplay The gameplay is in Thirdperson, but you can switch to first person while using certain weapons. You are able to run, sprint, jump and crouch. There are many cars to drive as well as boats and flyable vehicles.Music/SFX/Voiceacting The music to GTA 3 is usually heard via the radio, Rockstar knows how to pick out good songs its on par with the music selection for Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. The sound effects are also really well made. The voiceacting is pretty good for its time as well.
