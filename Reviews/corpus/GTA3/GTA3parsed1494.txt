I love Rockstar so much. I love Grand Theft Auto so much. Im a little dissapointed that I missed out on the bundle including GTA I and GTA II a year or so ago, seeing as they are both no longer available on Steam. They would presumably have been great examples of games standing the test of time. I know that GTA III certainly meets that mark. I look forward to playing more.
