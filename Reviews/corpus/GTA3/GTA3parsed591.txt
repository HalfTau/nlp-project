In my opinion, every GTA is a great game, a piece of gaming history or atleast Rockstars gaming history, i really enjoy playing these games despite them being so old, they all hold a sense of achievement when you complete a mission, but the one thing i wish is that these games GTA san andreas, GTA III, GTA vice city didnt come with a seperate online feature that is permanently stuck on my games list, i can tell you it would make my profile look a whole lot better without what looks like unplayed games on it.
