This game is the real start to the modern day GTA franchise. Remastered from its birds eye view version, this game was a unique for its time. The controls are a bit finicky as the camera is automatic and makes it difficult to drive, however, after a few hours you do get used to it. A tip to people who want to use gamepads, you may wish to assign your buttons before you start playing as the controller support is very limited. the story is like any other GTA game, going to blips and talking to different mob bosses till you reach that final enemy. This game is particularly interesting after you play San Andreas as there a  lot of tieins with that  story. This games story is particularly short compared to other GTA games taking about 812 hours to complete for the average player. I would recommend this game for people who want to have the full franchise experience.6/10
