For its time it was a great game.But right now it really starts to show it age not even talking about the graphics or animations. The controls are clunky, missions dont feature any sort of checkpoint system, everytime you die you lose all your guns, camera is locked, their isnt a map, etc. This might not seem like a big deal, but when your stuck on a annoying mission where you have to fight a bunch of guys because of the hard controls for example. Then everytime that you die, you restart at a hospital, then you need to get your weapons and body armor again, then drive way back over to where you could start the mission from, then in the mission you need to go again all the way to the other side to the map again toget to place from the badguys. So the game is not hard, but just very time consuming and tedious at times silence the sneak.Would I recommend this game?If you can pick it up for a few bucks, just to screw around in, I would say go for it. But if you are a more casual player looking to do missions I wouldnt recommend this game unless you are used to older games and/or have a lot of patience.P.S. Look up the cheat codes for this game. It really helps out!
