Over my 22 hour lovehate relationship with GTA III, I can say its a game that shows age in gameplay and graphics, but I would definitely consider it a classic. If youve played later GTAs before this one it definitely takes getting used to since there are less features and the gameplay is a bit clunky. I will cut it slack since it is an old game, and I suppose it was a fun challenge at parts as opposed to an often brutal one. But make no mistake, if you love older games, this is a musthave.
