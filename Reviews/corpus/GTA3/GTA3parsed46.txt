Good game for early 2000s standards. Ive had a lot of fun replaying it last time I played it was about 15 years ago, it didnt age too badly. Everything is fine, if you can stand horrible aiming and lack of ingame mapLiberty City is small enough, so it wasnt that bad.It requires Silent Patch to run properly on newer pcs/win10. Its not a big deal for me, but it should be fixed.
