Wow, this plays terribly on my Alienware Aurora GTX 1080 Win10.  Invible Menus until you AltTab or Xbox Button on controller, and even then they are really faint.  For that reason, it makes configuring the controls nearly impossible.  I can only barely control this game with an xbox controller.  I tried using Controller Companion which usually helps in most cases, but with the menus barely visible, I cant even determine  map all the keyboard settings well.  The onscreen map flickers sometimes, some lights flicker, and in the few seconds I played it, I saw a glitch where a gun wasnt in someones hand, just floating there or maybe a hand was missing.  In any case, I decided it isnt worth it.  In my opinion, this game shouldnt be for sale on Steam anymore if it plays this badly on modern PCs, or Steam should help fix it.
