I have a long history with this game. I would get home from school when I was 5 and ask my mother and father to play it. I played this game all the time. I have been playing this game for almost 12 years now, so this game is mostly nostalgia for me. The game is very basic in gameplay. The story is good, the characters are good. Only bad thing about this game, is it is very basic, but it was the first 3D GTA game to come out in 2001. Vice City, in my opinion, is better, but this game is more of a childhood game for me, more than Vice City.
