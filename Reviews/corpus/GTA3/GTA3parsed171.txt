It would be nice to play this game. Doesnt work on Windows 10.You cant see the menu. If you press shift  tab the steam overlay helps bring the menu back in to see the menu options. But you have to do it each menu screen.This is lame. How much money do you have Rockstar? Give us an update on this game, controller support and a menu I can see.
