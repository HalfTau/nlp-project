Had a LOT of issues getting it to run on Win10. Kept getting Directx errors requires at least 8.1 to work. Finally got it to work in Vista Compatility with 640x480 resolution enabled. Also had to go into Control Panel  Programs  Turn Windows Features on or off  Legacy Components  enable DirectPlay. Seems to work okay honestly, Ive only done one mission because I spent all of my time just trying to get it to work, I have music and sound effects but I dont hear voices.This fix also worked for GTA VC except I ran it as Win XP SP2 for compatibility
