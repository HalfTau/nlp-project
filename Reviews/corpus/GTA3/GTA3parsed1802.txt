Legendary and Epic! Of course it has its issues and annoyances, but in the end one has to remember when this game was made. Combat system is pretty much terrible, but that is weighted up by the story all though not as deep as the other games in the 3DGTAseries and the amount and hours of fun you will experience in this game. This game drives you to explore the environment all though not as much as VC and SA, but it is, in my opinion, way more fun than, for example, GTA IV, which was an epic fail. This GTA III, though, is the opposite! Definetely musttry/musthave game for all openworld and RPG enthusiasts!I recommend!
