I remember playing this game a lot when it first came out. It was fun and exploring an open world, at the time, was something completely new and fresh, Obviously the open world aspect is nothing new anymore but I still recommend this game if you are nostalgic for that time, like me.Howeverif you intend on playing this game with a controller, you are better off playing one of the console versions. Like, say, the Playstation Two version, for example. I tried playing it with my wired Xbox 360 controller and let me tell you, the controller support for this game sucks. You cant control the camera and barely any of the buttons work. Not to mention the controller menu doesnt do a good job of listing anything. Everything goes by numbers and Now I know what youre thinking Well this game is really old. Of course it would go by what those controllers had back than and let me say Postal Two is just as old and it does a good job of showng what does what. X button is X button. Left Trigger is Left Trigger. All it would take is a small update and badda bingbadda boom, you can tell what does what.In general, if you are nostalgic and want a trip to the past, buy it. But if you intend on playing with a controller, look elsewhere.
