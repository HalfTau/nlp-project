GTA 3 is simply the best because well... IDK.I had a slight issue when launching on Win 8.1, it wouldnt launch without DirectPlay. Itll happen on Windows Vista and over 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 10AU but it happens on VC and SA as well. AT LEAST there is no GFWL requirement, as 7 and under have that, 8 crash.Overall, my rating is 8.5/10.
