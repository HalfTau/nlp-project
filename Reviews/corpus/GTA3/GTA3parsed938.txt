To the one who said that this game is too old to be enjoyed.Well, he was wrong.I enjoyed this game from the beginning to the end.Actually, this game require a skillcap that we dont find in actual gta games.I rebuyed this game cause i never had the occasion to finish it while i was a child, and im glad to have finished it.Buy it. Buy it while hes on sale, hes pretty cheap.And play it.And enjoy it.Im sure that you will.
