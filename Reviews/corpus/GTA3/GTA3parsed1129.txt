The game works correctly on Win8, however you have absolutely no reason to play  it. The storyline is superboring, cut scenes horrible, gameplay, driving physics or shooting guns totally suck. Actually most of the time you repeat a mission its because of a glitch, or for some totally unimportant reason.
