For starters, this is a fun game. Fun mainly because you can steal guns, kill hookers and murder pigs... I mean cops.However this game is not worth buying if you have or also want GTA San Andreas. This is an old game and Rockstar obviously tried to make the missions too good but didnt focus much on the free roaming. One thing that really bugged me was the wind sound. Its so freaking loud and ear bursting! I also hate the graphics and yes, I understand its old and doesnt much features as GTA San Andreas. I would have probably not reccomended it at the time though. But it can be fun when youre really bored out of your mind and want to play something.
