8/10 NOT FLAWLESS BUT PRETTY DAMN CLOSE!im gonna give you an honest review and none of that this game is perfect because of nostalgia t.PROSLooks and runs very nice in 1080p. some games look streched and washed out when trying to play in HDbut GTA III handles it like halflife,fear and red faction,Missions are justly rewarded so funding future missions isnt an issue,looking at you liberty city storiesplenty to do side missions,RC racing,collecting packages ectA loose but entertaning story not tight enough to have lore but entertaining,especially if youve played LCSCONS THE RISING BRIDGE TO SHORESIDE VALE.No map why they didnt think to implement it in a patch ill never knowNo purchasable armor late game after locations have been memorized its not really and issue but early game its a No motorcycles this can be overlooked since the idea probably hadnt been though of yetNo 360 gamepad support you have to download a mod,which is simple,but annoying nonetheless
