One of the best games ever made, plain and simple... it is old, yes, but that shouldnt matter because this is not what you are looking for. If you are looking for one of the classiest openworld games the world has ever seen until 2001 then this is the perfect starting point, I personally guarantee you, actually the entire world guarantees you, try it, ask anybody Pros made by Rockstar Games leaves nostalgic footprint you can mod the heck out of this game, literally edit/create the entire game into a new game if you so desire you should know this by now it is long a lot of missions and things to be done 10/10 replayabilityCons it is old but that doesnt matterScore 9.9/10Conclusion Its a must!!! Without thinking!!!
