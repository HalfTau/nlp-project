Grand Theft Auto III The games storyline is quite good, it follows the main character Claude as he works for the Mafia, Yakuza and other parties throughout Liberty City, while simulataneously seeking revenge against his exgirlfriend for backstabbing him during a robbery. You feel a connection to all the central characters in the game and theyre very intriguing. As with every Grand Theft Auto game, you have the ability to cause complete mayhem, using flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades, military grade assault rifles, pistols, shotguns and more. Great weapon choices. Side missions available and hidden packages/frenzy tasks to complete. Extra content there. Graphics are dated but for the time period 2001 they were amazing. This wont impact on your fun. Nice music on radio stations, adds to the enjoyment. Short game, takes around 20 hours to finish, side missions included. Ill admit ive finished the game multiple times in the past, so this could vary if youre new. But generally, its short.Overall Score 8/10Grand Theft Auto III is a classic game which launched the GTA series into fully 3D environments, Memorable and fun.
