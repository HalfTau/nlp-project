Grand Theft Auto III is the perfect example of a groundbreaking title that still is just as enjoyable today. Arguably the most controversial game of 2001 and the first massive success in the video game industry of a post 9/11 world, GTA III is a game about revenge, murder and chaos. Set in the fictional New Yorkinspired Liberty City, you take control of a mute named Claude. He and his girlfriend Catalina are escaping from a bank heist when she turns on Claude, shooting him and leaving him on the ground for the police to find minutes later. A few days later while on a transfer to the citys detention centre a car intervenes with the convoy and frees the prisoners while also managing to destroy the bridge the event took place on.The game contains a great open world that was extremely impressive back in the year of release. It has a good story but admittedly its not very indepth. The soundtrack is full of fantastic songs from the main themes relaxing piano to the various radio stations filled with a selection of liscensed and original tracks. The graphics are still pretty decent by todays standards but the character models have not aged that well. There is oodles of activities and situations to get yourself into in Liberty City.Overal this game is a masterpiece that will keep you playing for a long time and its something I can reccomend even to detractors of the sandbox genre.
