Umm, wont just launch, requires me spend serious amounts of time to get optimized to play on my gaming rig. I literally play games like Witcher 3 maxed out with zero issue, but I cant get this poorly ported copy of a PS2 game to load.Seriosuly bums me out. Will take down and rereview when it actually works.
