This game is a complete masterpiece. I remember playing it for hours and hours and having tons of fun. The same happened to me now. Here I am, almost 15 years later, enjoying the same awesome game.I must warn you that this game have compatibility problems. So, I recommend to launch in compatibility mode with Windows 98, as administrator and run at 640x480. Im aware that is awful to run this game like that, but perhaps you will not be able to even launch it if you dont.It would be great if Rockstar could release like a HD patch supporting better resolutions, though.But, please, dont let that little problem convince you to not buying it. Is a must have for every true gamer.
