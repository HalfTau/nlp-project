I never thought going form 2D to 3D will be any good for GTA. Boy, was I wrong. Since the release Ive finished it about a dozen times. Bought it on Steam just to have it in my library. Some may call it nostalgia, but its money well spent. Writing this, I feel the next playthrough is just around the corner
