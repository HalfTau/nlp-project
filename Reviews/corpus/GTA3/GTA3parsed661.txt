Silent protagonist with a nice main story personally took me roughly 10 hours and counts as about 4045 total completion, and pleasant driving, all mixed together giving a very solid game.Aiming with a weapon is not smooth and shooting takes a bit of a practice to get used to. Minor bugs but nothing game breaking.Some missions might be frustrating, especially the timerestricted ones, but once you get past them you forget them quickly enough but not enough to want to do the main story again so soon. Nothing much to do in the game after main storyline is over, some side missions can keep you busy for only a set amount of time and one simply cannot enjoy causing as much mayhem in gta3 as in gta4 or gta5, mostly because the protagonist has to stop every time to fire a weapon, but it is still fun to a certain degree.Some hidden features like taking the train and subway to get around can only be discovered by mistake or actually reading the game manual....Overall, this is a great game for its time and still totally worth someones time. And theres just something painful but satisfying about not having a full map which forces you to learn the roads and how to get around. That being said the map is not that big.Oh and before I forget, you get shot on most of the map by the other gangs the more you do the main missions, making it difficult to move around freely later in the game, and absolutely impossible to stop and admire the scenery or do side missions in a gang zone at the end of the game.PerformanceWorks great on a Windows 10 Laptop having an Intel Z3735F with Intel HD GraphicsBay Trail on maximum settings40fps on average at 1366x768.P.S. After I completed the game, I tried the NaturalHDPack, which is an incomplete texture pack by Dinglemansadly, not available on steam which I found by browsing around and the game looks better5fps drop in average fps... but totally worth it...
