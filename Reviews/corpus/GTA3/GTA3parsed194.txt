This game put GTA on the map for me.  It was light years ahead of GTA II in every way.  If you want to go back to the roots of the GTA franchise, you should play this game.  It might be considered easy by todays standards but has a great storyline with a lot of famous voice actors.  Graphics look impressive for its age  it wont take you years to complete.
