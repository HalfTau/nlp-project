Its easy to learn and has a great depth of missions and superb pacing of player skill development. A huge playground to explore. Different experience every single time! And what about that soundtrack...unbelievable! The sequels were good, but the original started it off and will ALWAYS be a classic.This game was my favorite for a long time, and still is one of my favorites. Maybe it cant stand up to more recent releases of the GTA series, but for its time, best of the best.
