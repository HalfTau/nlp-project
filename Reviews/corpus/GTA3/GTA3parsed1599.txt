The game that started it all! Humour is absent in this one and our protagonist does not say a word. I believe GTA became really good only from Vice City, still, if youd like to see the first TPS version you can pick this one up if discounted. It certainly looks dated and a lot of features were missing e.g. shooting out vehicle tires that later on made the gameplay really good, still, it is a classic and theres nothing wrong with looking at where GTA came from.Even today it is nice to see that 10 years ago someone could make a game with a huge city full of side missions to complete. I suggest that those of you who love the GTA franchise pick this one up if discounted and spend at least two weekends to see where the series came from. And yes, I know this is out on smartphones along with Vice City, but Id stick to the goodold keyboard and mouse combo instead of tapping a small screen.
