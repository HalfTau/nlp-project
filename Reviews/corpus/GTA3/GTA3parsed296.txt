Great game.ProsOne of the best GTA games apart from SA and 5Open WorldMissions are great.ConsThe main character does not speak. Rockstar did this so NPCs could speakIts graphics are outdated But who cares about graphics? PGameplay is a little repetitive.Overall8.6/10The classics are always the best.
