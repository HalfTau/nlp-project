What a big difference to GTA2. I missed a great intro movie but the new 3 dimensional world was just too great to be sad. The point of view of GTA2 is not playable because of bold black borders around the cars, but really soon I didnt missed the old charm.I played many great mods to keep the fun right after finishing the game at 100. Although I played the missions multiple time.  Makes too much fun.I suggest to play the anniversary android version.
