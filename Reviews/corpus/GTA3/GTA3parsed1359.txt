GTA III.I bought this game when it was on special. This is a very addictive open world shooter game. The soundtrack is rich and diverse. Lots of tunes from classic artists to get pumping. Missions are challenging yet it is very fun to play. You can nver get sick of this game. I played this game from the beginning till the end. Storyline wise is epic. GTA series has a way of continuing the story. Some of these characters may end up on VICE CITY etc. The story always keeps on getting better.Lots of gangs and destructable objects. like the cars catching on fire and exploding. People screaming and running.GTA III  VERY addictive.
