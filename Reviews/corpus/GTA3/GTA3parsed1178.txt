UPDATE I was able to fix the settings and access the menus using this modThis mod also gives it full controller supportJust unzip and place into the games folder and it should work.However these mods do not fix the framelimiting bugs. Basically, the game is locked at 30FPS unless you disable the framelimiter in the video options for the game. This will make the game run a hell of a lot smoother, however disabling it causes a lot of bugs most notably backing up while in a car it goes EXTREMELY slow. Ive also heard that GTAVC and SA have the came problem.So basically, you can either run this game at 30 FPS and have it choppy and MOSTLY bug free, or go beyond that and the game breaks.I still cant reccomend this version of this game since these fixes are still done through an unofficial mod and the game has no decent 60hz support.ORIGINAL REVIEWDont get me wrong, this game is AMAZING. But I cannot reccomend that you buy this version. I cant access the ing menu since all the options are invisible, the game is stuck at 480p, and I couldnt rebind the controls during the one time I could access the settings.Rockstar needs to get theirtogether. Youd think that after this game had been out for almost 15 years that they would have updated it, but no!  you Rockstar!
