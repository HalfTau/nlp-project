If you ever see the GTA Trilogy go on sale and think its a steal of a deal, its not.The only game that was a semicompetent port is San Andreas. GTA III and Vice City are god awful on Steam.Controller support is awful. Yeah, I can plug in my Xbox 360 controller and I can move around and everything, but I cant look around, and the buttons are all jumbled around. B is to accelerate, A is to shoot, Select is to change the radio, clicking left stick changes the camera? Awful.And the graphics settings are terrible. Theres only draw distance, frame limiter, widescreen, and resolution. The game looks atrocious. Literal PS1 textures, what in the hell. They dont use the Xbox versions textures, and they even removed some things too!Those reasons alone are good enough for me to say dont buy this game, emulate it for free.If you ever see the GTA trilogy on sale, just get San Andreas on its own. Even then, I barely recommend that awful port, bt its not as bad as this one. Only get this if you dont mind using the keyboard and mouse, and dont mind the ugly textures.
