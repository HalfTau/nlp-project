I would normally write a constructive review giving people an insight of the game but I doubt many need an insight for this classic! This is the GTA I have completed the most and when I seen it in an offer on steam I could not resist. If it has been a few years since your last playthrough of GTA III then I suggest picking this up when its on sale like I did and giving it a blast. Great memories!!
