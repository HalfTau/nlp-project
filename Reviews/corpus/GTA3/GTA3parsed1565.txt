Okay, heres what Im going to say right now.This game is great and all, but Im going to have to say that San Andreas was probably much better than this. The confusion begins when the first mob hates you and then, literally, every mob hates you. You cant complete the game or leave your PC without getting shot. You cant drive more than five minutes without getting shot. You cant even get on or off the subway without getting headshot oh so suddenly.I understand you make everyone hate you, but if it means it breaks the enjoyment of the game, then I guess Im sticking to GTASA, GTAIV, or even GTAV.
