This was my first GTA. Back when there was a Blockbuster video, I used to rent it every few weeks for my PS2. You have not lived until you have played this game. You are missing out on the birth of the true open world without it.Buy it, play it, love it. Come back to it every couple of years and love it all over again. Just like the FWB you see whenever you go home.
