Absolute gem of a game, glad to see such a timeless classic on steam.The legend of a game where you play some mute guy who has a M16 that had surgery and therapy to believe it was a GAU8.The first of the 3d GTA games, and it shows, the gameplay is the same as youd expect from other GTA III era games like vice city or san andreas, but things that are taken for granted in later GTAs such as being able to see the map or get dynamic directions to your destination are nowhere to be seen here, but if you can put up with a sometimes frustrating lack of information having a physical or digital map helps alot, or you already know the cities like the back of your hand like me, the game is very rewarding and its dialogue still cracks me up to this day, listen to chatterbox for an hour or two and youll see what I mean.You couldnt even win a raffle, LOSER! notification after losing a raceCoPilot Were gonna kill you!Pilot You cant say that  its not in the book!
