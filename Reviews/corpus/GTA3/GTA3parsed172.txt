With now over 100 hours of my life spent in this game I can safely say that Grand Theft Auto III is one of my all time favourites.Playing the game for the first time in February 2016 I was suprised at how much I was enjoying the game dispite its age of 15 years. The missions were unique and exciting, the characters were quirky and humourous and even now Im still exploring the open world. The feel of the gritty underworld of Liberty City is displayed perfectly, like in GTA 2, youre working for pretty much every gang in the city for at least 3 missions, giving a refreshing change of missions style every once in a while. And reaching 100 game completion will give you plenty of play time.Ill definately be continuing to play this absolute masterpiece of gaming history for many more hours to come and Id recommend it to any players who are breaking into the open world genre or to any people who want to play some classic games.
