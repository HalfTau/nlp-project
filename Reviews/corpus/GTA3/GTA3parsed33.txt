GTA III didnt age that well. The driving is still bad and its still a console port when you buy it here on steam. Not that optimized.I stopped at mission 40 or so cause the randomness of the traffic is ing me up. DConclusion If you really wanna feal the nostalgia buy it in sale or so. But maybe consider getting Liberty Stories instead if you wanna play in LIberty City.
