While the idea of open world games have been around since the creation of the ultima series, NONE have brought it into the third dimension as effectively as GTA3 has. When this game came out, there was NOTHING like it at the time, leading to the very birth of the open world genre.On top of being a footnote in gaming history for its stylish, gritty comic book world, youre always being challenged with a wide array of missions that sprouts lots of variety on your way to the top of the criminal hiarchy. In addition to the missions, theres also great incentive to explore every nook and cranny of Liberty City its blooming with tons of secret collectables and missions for you to discover where youd least expect them !All said and done, while some fans consider the sequels to be more polished games, theres no denying that GTA3 wrote the book on how open world games should be made. Liberty City may not be quite as big as other landmarks this day and age, but its ALWAYS alive, theres never a moment when theres nothing happening, and thats very important to take into consideration when youre designing an open world. Nobody wants massive enviornments with nothing to do in it.Therefore, for all its merits and how well it holds up today, I cant reccomend GTA3 enough to anyone thats interested in not only seeing where it all began, but how much it managed to get right even when people didnt even know what genre to classify this gem under !
