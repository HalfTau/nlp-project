This is a pretty cool game, very nostalgic.But what I do have to say is that GTA 3 is 10x harder than any other GTA you may have played what with it being the first 3d game Rockstargames ever made.Another thing On the mission Espresso2Go, youll need the bulletproof patriot that Ray gives you and to ensure you have it, Id save with the patriot in your garage.
