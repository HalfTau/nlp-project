Pretty hard to do without a controller, but can be done. My first ever GTA game being vice city, this game is kinda of a bummer. I know it was great for its time, but compared to now I would rank it thirt to last best GTA game, behind GTA I and II. Its fun, dont get me wrong, I reccomend it, just dont expect what you saw in San Andreas or Vice City.
