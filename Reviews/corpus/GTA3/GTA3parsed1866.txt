Ahh GTA III, the freeroam game that set the standard and set off the media on a frenzy. Suggestive movements and moans when you recover health with a hooker in a car, sheer amount of violence and gore for the time, censored version in Australia to protect minors though begs the question to why you would let them play in the first place, and one of many of Jack Thompsons blame the game defences.For the game itself, its not that much of a farcry from GTA IV and Im sure you can pick it up easily. If you havent tried any sort of freeroam game, then GTA III is a decent game to start. I recommend picking up the Grand Theft Auto Complete pack if you dont have any games from the series, best if you get in during the holiday sale.
