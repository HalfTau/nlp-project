Classic game, virtually unplayable on Steam without Silent Patch to fix so many problems.If you are NOT COMPUTER SAVVY   DO NOT BUY!If you can figure out how to download and install playermade patches   Good Luck!If you still have a PS2   BUY IT ON PS2!EDIT  The Silent Patch installation process is actually pretty simple.  You should be able to figure it out.  Lol
