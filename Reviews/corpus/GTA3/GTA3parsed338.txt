Before I start, I would like to start by saying that I understand that this game came out in 2001 which explains its limitations and the issues I have with the game.Right, lets do this.GTA 3 is an open world 3rd person action sand box game set in a parody of New York City. You play as Claude, a common crook arrested for being part of a bank robbery gone wrong. After escaping from the prison transport van you begin to do jobs for the american italian mafia for a range of characters which include helping hookers get around the city and being the driver in a bank job. The game continues like this as you get given objectives from various weird, angry, stratigic and manipulative characters there are a wide range of mission types and mission objectives through out the game.Although this doesnt mean that the game does not have its faults. As I said before, I know this game is limited by technology of the time however this does not change the fact that the gun mechanics are cancerously bad It is some times a struggle to aim correctly at people and kill them quickly with anything other then a pistol or micro uzi. The npcs can shoot and drain your HP way to fast before you can pin point the cross heir on them.The car physics are obnoxious and the slightest bump will spin your car out if you are going at any sort of speed. Furthermore the cars seem to just melt if you crash once you might as well just get a new car because it wont be long untill that car is on fire. This is not helped by the fact that everywhere you go random gang members will shoot at you which makes no sense at all and it very frustrating.There are some bad missions that are just plain dumb, or expect you to get somewhere on the other side of the map in 1 minuet or are made to take on the entire world on your own. Also there is no large map in a pause menue so you can either memerize the entire maps layout, which you end up doing anyway, or having a map of the game in a different tab.Even though there are all of these terrible, down right annoying things wrong with the game, there is a massive variety of missions and brilliant voice acting in this game not to forget the okay sound track and talk radio show, not the most extensive radio selection and you will definitely hear most songs over and over again, if you want GTA with a good soundtrack, get GTA Vice City, or San Andreas or V, IVs is meh. Finally it will work on almost any PC made in the last 10 years so its an alright game to play if you are limited by your computers powerTo concludeCons Buggy cars and driving physics Bad shooting mechanics No large map in the game Annoying missionsPros Some great missions with a large, diverse selection of mission objectives Some good songs on the radio Good map design with interesting locations Humour is layered through out the game on the radio, in cut scenes and on the streets of the city Modding community with skins for the player among other thingsSo I would recommend this game but take it with a huge grain of salt and understand that it will have its limitaions and you will get annoyed at times but overall it is a good game.
