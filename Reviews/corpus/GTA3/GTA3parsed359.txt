I had a problem with this game where it would tell me Im not running DirectX version 8.1 or higher, but I was running 12.In the comments someone posted a solution.Its hilarious how most, if not all, of the other recent reviews are people downvoting the game because of Rockstars decision to remove OpenIV.But I think they shouldve complained on GTA V and IV, because theyre isnt really any unbiased recent reviews. But heres one.So basically, after a cutscene, you are placed straight into a mission. The game gives you a little tutorial before getting you to drive to a certain location. The graphics are good for 2002, the sound is good, never heard of any of the songs, but I dont like the lack of waypoints, as I have no idea where I am going, and how easy the cars are to damage, and flip. I ran over someone and even the ambulance that arrived was beat up.Well I cant get past the first level because of me damaging and flipping my car so... Well, at least the explosions are cool.
