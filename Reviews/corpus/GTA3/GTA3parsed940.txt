First off, I have no nostalgia for GTA Ive only even beaten GTA 5 and didnt even play GTA 4 until 2013. But I do know the significance of this game which is why I gave it a go.Short version I love it on the PS2!Kinda long versionI couldnt play this game as it is on Steam. The control schemes are too wonky and rebinding them is way more difficult than it should be. Im not completely new to PC gaming but Ive only really been at it for a year or two, so maybe its my own shortcomings. That said, the console version is way more managable as far as controls and movement, so much so that I stopped noticing how aged the game looks.If youre trying III, Vice City  San Andreas for the first time, Id recommond a console version first. Theyre a pioneer of openworld sandbox games as we know them and theres a ton of great little details in every game. But if youre like me and grew up with a controller instead of a computer, this is one of those game where it makes a huge difference.
