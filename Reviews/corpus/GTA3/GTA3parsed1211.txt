Although I am recommending this, make sure that you take this recommendation in due caution.  I run Windows 8.1, and I had to do a little bit of modding in order to even get the game to play at all.  However, the modding is not terribly complicated, so most of the community should be able to do it with ease simply go to GTAgarage and download the SilentPatch for the game and a new ddraw.dll and throw it in the program file and yay.  Then you get to relive all those adventures of running over that Big Gay Al sounding Indian Taxi Driver all over again.I would like to say that it is terribly disappointing however that Rockstar hasnt managed to fix the issues on there own, and instead relies on a thirdparty to do their grunt work for them.   Thank you to Silent for doing it though!
