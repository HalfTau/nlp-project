This game is a classic. The GTA that started it all, a truly genre defining title. Story/Characters/SFX Music 10/10. The only problem with this game is, from my experience, it has terrible controller support. I am using the Logitch 710, basically a clone of a PS2 controller. For a game that was released on the PS2 I would expect its PC port to have a setting for the same controls.
