Great game, although one that didnt age as well as the others.Very basic compared to nowadays.No jumping out of moving vehiclesNo limb based damaged, headshot is as good as a body shot if it isnt a sniper.Jumping and touching anything will cause you to flinchNo in game mapNo blips for pay n spray or Ammunation after a certain pointExpresso 2 go is complete .Definately a classic, these are only things that came with being the first to pioneer this genre, which doesnt make it bad at all.
