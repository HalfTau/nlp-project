After playing all the other GTA games in the series, I never really got too far into the game back on the PS2, so I recently bought it again on here to complete it.The games performance is perfect and the visuals despite being dated are still very nice to look at, especially when you download the Widescreen Mod, so I have been playing this in 1080p like a remaster.I also would reccomend the GInput mod, as it gives you 100 Xbox 360 controller functionality, and has made the game just as playable as the later games in the series.I would like to point out I am playing on Windows 10, without a hitch.Overall I recommend this game as the story is great and it is definitely worth another play just for it.
