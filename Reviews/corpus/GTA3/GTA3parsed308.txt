Classic Game!!! Stands the test of time.In order to get it to play on windows 10 I did the following1. RC shortcut, goto properties, added norestrictions one space behind Title.2. Set compatibility to WinXP PS3.3. Upon start up I couldnt see menu, I arrowed down to options and right arrowed, as I did the screen became clearer with each increase. Started game and now I can adjust the resolution both in and out of game, also upon restart the main menus appeared. Now playing  3840x2160 .In my opinion the best game in the series, groundbreaking 3D rendering at the time. I played the originals and this is what I thought of when I did lol.
