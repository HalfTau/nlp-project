This is the game, this is where it all started. In 2001 Rockstar games released this title and made history and pretty much everyone has played this game and knows whats it about, but the question is  while being a ground breaking title more than 10 years ago, is it worth playing now and how it has aged ?So game looks pretty good, for the time and even nowdays  the graphics feels tolerable. It features day  night cycles and dynamic weather. Environment is pretty huge and worth exploring, youll find some hidden weapons, side missions etc.Voice acting is done pretty well, however recordings them selves are at pretty low quality, game has several radio stations with different styles of music and tracks, however I disliked pretty much every soundtrack, but maybe thats just me and for the time that music was actually pretty cool.Story is really generic, with you leveling up and making name for yourself in underground crime scene. Game had descent number and variety of missions, starting with some more simple and ending with some quite creative goals for the time, sometimes even involving whole map. It took me about 13 hours to complete the story and do about 4060 of side stuff.One aspect where game have aged terribly is the game play it self. Car handling is good, but physics sometimes are just awkward and bizarre and sometimes slightest hit can make your car flip and spin like in first flat out game. Gun controls also are pretty weird, were you have to often aim at where bullets are going not where crosshair is pointed.Missions themselves are quite challenging and more than often i found myself replaying same missions more than 3 times in row.At the end i would recommend this game if you somehow missed this title, to see where sandbox genre has started. If you want to go and get some nostalgic feel than its a mixed bag, with some things cool and fun to play while others just being aged and a bit frustrating.I guess at the time game was mind blowing and had earned a lot of 10/10s, but today for me game feels like solid 7.0.Thanks for reading.
