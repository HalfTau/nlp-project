Grand Theft Auto III, What a classic in my eyes. The story in this game is really good and enjoyable, but it is really short. The game has aged quite a bit in the graphics department , but its still fun. If you plan on using a controller with this game, get ready to fight with the camera. The Music in this game is excellent, I find myself listening to these songs even after so many years. When installing the Steam port, I had a lot of problem with textures, but a simple patch fixed all that. I cant say Grand Theft Auto III is the best choice for someone looking for a first time GTA game. Its aged and story is really short. I would say pick up Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, or Grand Theft Auto IV for a first time GTA player. Its still a good game even so.4/5  Wonderful
