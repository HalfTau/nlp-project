i used to play this game back in the early 2000s and can always remeber starting the game over and over because at that time i was too young and could not afford a memory stick for my at the time Playstation 2, after not playing this for at least 10 years and playing it on pc for the first time i do feel like im back to being a young kid playing this, seeing some of the map and seeing how it has evolved into what is GTA IV i do see very humble beginnings with this game.the gameplay is quite clunky now that i have had more experiance in other games and after playing this one i do feel like we have come a long way in terms of technology.the story is still very bland and doesent seem to make in my mind much sense, would i still buy this game ?Yes i personally would but if you have never played this before and youve only just got into GTA at number 5 then you are going to be disappointed without a doubt, but for the nostalgia of this game and seeing where GTA started to grow is a must buy
