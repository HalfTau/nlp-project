I bought this along with GTA Vice City, San Andreas, GTA 4, and the DLC that comes with 4 for 15.After being super excited that this deal was real, I quickly purchased it. Then read the reviews, and got nervous.. A lot of people are having issues running it on Windows 10. Im using Windows 10.. BUT, Before I even started the game I went to the program folder steam/steamapps/common/GTA3, and right clicked the application, and clicked the compatibility tab, and had it run as Windows XP SP3.It works fine, and Ive had fun playing it again. Cant wait to play the whole story, its been so long!Must buy for anyone who shared awesome memories, and loved playing this!The only thing I have seen act weird was the menu. Sometimes the menu selections disappear. I just quit the game and tried again. Once I had to just blindly guess navigating through the menu. Small price to pay for someone like me, but I know some of yall dislike anything that isnt perfect.
