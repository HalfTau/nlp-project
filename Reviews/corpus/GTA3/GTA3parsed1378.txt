9/10This game was the predecessor to 2 of my favorite games ever, Vice City and San Andreas. Now, with that said, I still really love this game, for it what brought GTA into the mainstream, it defined the series, and with mods still going strong, 12 years after release, I enjoy it evemn more,The radio stations are amazing, the story was a bit over the place in the beginning, but then you understand what Claude has to do  yes, thats the guys name, making it a top notch story and a must own game
