A classic. I remember staying up late at night playing this on a rented PS2. It changed the world of gaming forever with its approach. The world is big not as big as new GTA versions but it was at the time, the options are seamingly endless, the sand in the sandbox is deep again not as much as new GTA games but was very much so for the time.The fact that the character you play speaks no words is in itself, a very interesting dynamic to the game. It makes you more aware of the other characters, the missions, the world everything is embellished with great detail because of your silence. You carry out bloodthirsty murders, arsons, and robberies with cold indifference to your actions. Its kind of chilling to think about.The violence of the game was disturbing to lots of people and it is pretty bloody. The concept of a freerange murderer is kind of frightening, but the game is very much a game so there is nothing to worry about. Have fun blowing cars up. Its just a game.The story is very obviously borrowed from gangster movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas and such. This is a bonus though, as everything seems very familiar to you, like you are already a made man.Excellent game, and playable all the way through.10/10
