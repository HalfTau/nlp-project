This game is such a classic now. It can be frustrating sometimes with the lack of GPS like the other GTAs, but it is still workable. Just google GTA III maps and you are good to go. You cannot move while shooting certain weapons, but it is still workable. The actual gameplay and fun factor is high. It is incredible to see how far they have come, and how even with the gameplay flaws this one has, it is still highly playable! If you like classics, try picking this one up when you can!
