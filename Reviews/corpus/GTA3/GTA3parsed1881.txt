First game in Grand Theft Auto series with 3D graphics! What else do you need actually? This game was very popular when it was released and is still good enough today, I would recommend to play this game for every GTA fan, because thats where everything started. So many great, famous actors from Hollywood have voice acted for this game. Radio music is simply amazing, awesome soundtrack. 10/10  Real Masterpiece.
