Oh boy this game brings back memories. Love the fact that Rockstar did not take out the cheats because there is only two cheats that I care about pedestrian have weapons and pedestrians attack each other. Makes the game totally chaotic but hella fun. Wish they had some achievements but its whatever. Oh yeah and thank god for the controller mod. I can not play this with keyboard and mouse controls so thank you for the modder that made it so you can play with full controller support.
