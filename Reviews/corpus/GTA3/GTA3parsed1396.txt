I remember Christmas morning 2001, tearing open thru every single damn present box until i found this..that year, along with my PS2 i got a bike, some stupid wrestling toys and hell even my first guitar..im pretty sure i forgot all about that once i started going on rampages shooting and running over everything in an ambulance... ultimately picking up a hooker and then beating her with a baseball bat to get my cash back. What great childhood memories.10/10 get it.play it.live it.
