I was suprised I was able to purchase this game at all from the shelves. I will not mention the city it was purchased from but lets just say they would ban the future installments of the series.I had to wait years before I could play the game however since I tried to play this on my first PC which only had a 16mb graphic card.I was still in elementary when I was in possession of the game.As a kid I had enjoyed rampaging about in the previous intallments of the GTA series, most notably GTA2 when visiting friends or at family functions away from my parents prying eyes.I began to do the same with GTA3 senslessly going around committing a rampage. Then I started to delve into the story and it was then my appreciation for the series grew. As much the story was simple and some characters were bland, there were those characters which grew on you.The satire within the game makes it all more enjoyable. Compared with future installments it felt as if GTA3 had only begun dabbling into some of the satire whereas the others ambitiously plunged further.
