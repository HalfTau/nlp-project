Despite what game critics might tell you, this game still holds up and in my personal opinion, its better than Gta San Andreas. This game is a fun, chaotic mess. Although the game isnt perfect, my biggest gripes with it areOnly story elements are betrayal and plot twistsShotgun can blow up cars in just 2 shots.Can only run with Fists, Pistol, Micro Uzi, Molotovs, and Grenades.That one ing DIce mission.Shoreside Vales confusing layout and design and Staunton Islands at first.Large districts are usually controlled by gangs, and since 5 of the 7 gangs in the game are hostile, well.. Its not that bad unless youre in Portland and in Mafia territory.Odd and annoying way to input cheats.Crashing a car into a street lamp will make the hood fall off and in some cases, if the cars taken enough damage it will CATCH FIRE.I would give this game a an 8.5/10Very fun.
