Almost every midend game story mission feels like a chore. Cop AI is ridiculous, and cop cars will bumper car you at high speeds at almost every turn during a chase with 3 stars.Money is pretty much not a problem at all as missions very quickly give larger amounts of money, but the mini map doesnt tell you where the ammunation stores are at, so youll have to remember where they are if you have to pick up weapons for a mission that requires you to enter a gunfight.You may often find yourself wanting to quit and reload the game in order to keep your weapons, rather than continuing after a death, because as stated earlier, ammunations are hidden from your mini map.Future games in the series have less and less of these issues stated, but with nothing to reference back during IIIs initial release, this game was better received back then than if it were to be reevaluated by todays standards.
