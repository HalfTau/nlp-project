The game that kicked off the global phenomenon that is GTA, GTA 3 does lack a few quality of life features mainly the big map in the pause menu, and the pay and spray  ammunation icons on the mini map itself and features some of the hardest missions in the GTA series and in my opinion, is the hardest GTA out of all the 3D games.It is however a very enjoyable classic, and you will never be short on cash and will be able to cause all sorts of destruction as you want and the missions may be challenging, but completing them is sure a fun time except those guys on SPANK, they give me nightmares.
