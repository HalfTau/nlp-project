Grand Theft Auto III is worth the money. Period. If you are a GTA fan you must buy this game.I used to play it at a friends house when I was 67 because I wasnt allowed to play it at home. We and his little brother created imaginary GTA 3 movies  about 15 mins each  and when one of us died, it was the next ones turn.Buy GTA III
