Great for a first GTA game in 3D. It was like GTA1 coming to life in 3D, it was excellent and never been done before. I think thats what made it so great.The engine was pretty terrible by the way it used a filter that would require too much power. Thankfully it could be turned off, but it was still heavy on the CPU usage. Still, if youre looking for the best GTA game, try Vice City or GTA4 first.Rating 88/100
