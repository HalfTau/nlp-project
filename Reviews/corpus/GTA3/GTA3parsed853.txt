So I got this GTA Trilogy pack from my good friend and I wanted to play this game after a looong time  ya know, nostalgia.Aaand I cant play it at all  why? Win10  didnt find good solution yet RIP my childhood.Still 10/10 would recommend it for every GTA fan, especially to those, who didnt play GTA 3 is this possible? !GTA  GTA 2 were different kind of GTA another camera angle and all that stuff so yea, GTA 3 is the game where everything began!
