We go back to 20012002 when Rockstar Games finally figured out how to transform Grand Theft Auto from 2D to 3D.There isnt really much to say other than youre name is Claude, you have no voice.. and youre in Liberty City. The only problem i have with this is the horrible draw distance/close popin even when the draw distance is set to maximum and because of something within a file all the car colours are very very dark.I say buy it, and with the Steam Summer Sale.. Buy it now in the bundle along with Grand Theft Auto Vice City and Grand Theft Auto SanAndreas
