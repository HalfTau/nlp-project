Running on modern hardware, this game is borderline unplayable. I know that its a landmark in gaming or whatever, but I only managed to play for a few hours before giving up altogether. It has issues with framerate if you chose to Unlock in the menu, physics stop working and you cant move properly it also borks the menus, and the controls are the worst thing Ive ever encountered, and I play a lot of older games w/ antiquated control schemes. Your character cant even rotate the camera without the numpad. This game also apparently hates my 360 controller, and wont let me bind anything to the triggers.I would imagine that there are a number of unofficial patches that you can download, which would tidy up a bunch of these issues. There are several threads in the forums for this, but  just like San Andreas,  GTA IV .If you get it in a bundle, you could install it to marvel at how far weve come particularly regarding driving physics, but thats about it.
