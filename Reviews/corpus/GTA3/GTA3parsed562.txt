I used to play GTA 1 and 2 a lot and when in 2002 GTA 3 was released for the PC it was really cool to see GTA in 3D for the first time. One of the first things I enjoyed most in GTA 3 was cruising the city with my radio on. Exploring new parts of the city and finding new side missions.Pure nostalgic for veteran GTA players, but also fun for players who like classic open world actionadventures.
