Grand Theft Auto 3 is the great transitioning of the old Grand Theft Auto formula into a fully realized open world gameplay. Grand Theft Auto 3 was developed and published by Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive.Grand Theft Auto 3 is revolutionary for bringing about the realization of a 3D open world game in the bustling mimicry of New York known as Liberty City. The possibilities in Grand Theft Auto 3 are truly up to you. Jack cars, drive off cliffs, start a massacre, jump off buildings and bridges, hook up with P rostitutes, work for crime syndicates...the least of what is possible in this game and its sequels is entirely up to the persons choice, a relic of freedom in gaming.
