Dont get me wrong, GTA III is an awesome game  arguably one of the very best GTA games ever made the story is a helluva lot better than GTA V, but this Steam version is garbage. The game was made for Windows 95 and in typical Rockstar fashion, they continue to sell it unpatched despite it not running properly, or even at all, on modern systems. Even in compatibility mode, youre lucky if you can get it to work without crashing or freezing on every loading screen which means every few minutes if you do the missions. Intro videos wont even play at all, because theyre in a resolution too low to be supported by modern graphics cards and monitors.If you run Windows XP, you may be able to run this game, but otherwise Id recommend to not bother wasting your money.Otherwise, GTA III is a great game. It was the first GTA game to depart from the topdown view and try for a more indepth story. Its of course old and looks old now, but it set a new standard in its day and was one of the very first open world games. Just dont support greedy developers who continue selling old games without bothering making sure they even work on current hardware hell, they cant even be bothered to support GTA V, so not really a surprise.
