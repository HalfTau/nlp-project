Manny people saying that this game is horible xDDD, But I must say i realy like it because I have play it sence I was 6 years old 2006. And If you like Gta Sa or Gta Vc, this game has a higher chance that you going to like it  The game has manny frustrated missions and glitches but that makes the game more fun and challenging that the other Grand Theft Auto Games P, So this game is at least worth a try
