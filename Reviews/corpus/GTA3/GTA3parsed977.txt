This third dimension debut for the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is perhaps one of the best GTA games ever, and one of the first believable open world experiences in gaming history. Despite some small annoying flaws and nowcrude visuals, the gameplay is fun and engaging, even today, and is more arcadelike than the newer sequels. This is a classic game that I can warmly recommend.
