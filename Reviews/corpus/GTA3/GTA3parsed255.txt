This is the most bare bone of the 3D GTA titles but its still a excellent game. Its to be expected considering its the first of the 3D titles. The world still feels alive and liberty city is a great parody to New York.You play as Claud Speed Fido when a bank robbery goes wrong and his girlfriend shoots him and leaves him for dead and takes the money. You are captured by the police and you are being transported to a different portion of liberty city when the bridge you are on is blown up by terrorists. Thats when you and 8 ball make your escape and Claude goes on the hunt for Catalina his ex girlfriend to seek revenge once he is established of course.The gameplay is dated by todays standards but its still easy enough to play once you get used to it. There is not a lot of weapons but its enough to get you by and have a fun time causing chaos.This is still easily worth picking up today if you like open world games or any of the GTA titles. The story is excellent and filled with colorful characters as usual and there are lots of side quests to keep you busy. The world is large for its time and varied. Runs great on modern day PCs.
