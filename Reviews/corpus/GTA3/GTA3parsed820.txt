This game brings back some good memories from playing it with a friend,the city is called Liberty City,a parody of New York City,the city is a darker one,also the protagonist is a cool one even he is mute and never talks,also we can see him in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in 2 missions.His name is only called in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,Claude,also dont confuse him with Claude Speed,the protagonist of Grand Theft Autowhich these 2 games are in different universe.The missions are very cool to do,also this game have something that other Grand Theft Auto games dont have,GORE,yup you heard,when you shoot someone with a M16 in leg or hand that part of his body is dissapear,note this only is in PC version i believe,also on Steam version is a bug that color of all vehicles are darker but this can be fixed i believe.Also the worst part for Grand Theft Auto 100 achievers like me is when you complete the game 100 you dont have anything in your advantage like 200 health instead of 100 like in Grand Theft Auto vice City.Just play this game,is fun.Final note9/10
