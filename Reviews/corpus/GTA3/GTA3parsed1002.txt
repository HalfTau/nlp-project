Some potential problems on newer software. These problems can easily be fixed. Youre in for a blast if you do decide to buy this one!Lots of action, guns, blood kind of, murders and fun.Lack of voiceacting from the protagonist can be a turnoff for some. Including myself. I would prefer having the main character not be a mute.Also, the voiceacting in general was not necessarily all that great.You get to shoot guns though. Thats good.
