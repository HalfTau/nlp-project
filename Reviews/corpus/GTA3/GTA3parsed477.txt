Grand Theft Auto III is my alltime favorite of the GTA Franchise. I grew with this game and wasnt able to complete it back then, but now I finally completed it on PC. There is nothing more satifsying then completing one the most difficult games in my steam library.After all those years it is still the same feeling to play this game even with the old graphics.I love this game and will always love it.
