This game borks my computer about four different ways when I start it up, Im getting major glitches even just on the menu screens, cant adjust the resolution, cant map gamepad controls, et cetera, the usual problems playing old stuff and then some. And the driving is terrible anyway, far worse than I remembered. If you feel it might be worth your time, play it on an old PS2, youll have less to worry about.
