What can i say? its a classic! runs fine on windows 7 although the audio does crackle every now and then during the cinematics but its not really noticable. If you can forgive the graphics for being horribly outdated then this is a must buy just for the nostalgia of stopping traffic and hijacking a car before going on a police chase D
