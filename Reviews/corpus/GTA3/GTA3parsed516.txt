grand theft auto 3 what can i say the name mostly spells it out for you its a nice blast to the past as i owned and played it on my ps2 as i no longer have a ps2 i got it on pc my only complaint is it doesnt have full controller support for some reason when i try to set it up useing a xbox 360 wired controller it tetects the controller but only have the buttons anre detected or mapped like for example i can use right/left bumpoer to change radio ststion when in a car but cant use the same 2 buttons to switch weapons when on footother then the tiny complaint above its a great game and a great blast from the past if youve also played san andreas you will realize gta3 is a sequel to san andreas
