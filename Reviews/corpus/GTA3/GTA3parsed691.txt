This review is from someone who never really played and beat the game until yesterday 9/9/2016. I had played it for mayhem fun at friends but never felt like beating it. Im glad I bought it along with the other GTA games during the summer sale.The game has aged well and it still maintains its rating 9/10 but dont expect more than it has to offer. Dumb AI, no DLC, and a very lightstory but it has a ton of content that will make you play at least 4050 hours.I played it with the Steam Controller and it was fun. I had to configure both the controllers on the Game Settings as well as the Steam Controller settings but the time invested was worth it. However, some missions were really hard to do with just the controller mainly because of the mousesensitivity.Edit Just to conclude, it is still a very good game, worth a sale buy.
