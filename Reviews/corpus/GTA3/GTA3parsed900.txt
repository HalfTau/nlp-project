GTA 3  the cornerstone of the whole modern richness of openworld games, a musttoplay even still, after 14 years after release. You may ask, why it is still a mustplay, when we have so many fine games of the same genre, with GTA V in the first place?As usual, the point is in the impact this game made on the whole gaming world and all around it.For example, when Ubisoft desired to make its own ala GTA product, they look namely on the GTA III as the base model. You can see the similarity with your own eyes in the map, in the cars. Almost senseless vigilante Aiden Pierce is also not a big step from GTA3 protagonist Claude, even if he talks more, his behavior and usual activities are just about the same except of haking, of course.Seriously now, this game is not a history, it is fine place to go even today. Camera and controls may be a bit tricky for start, but when you succeed with it  youll get a nice trip into underground world, one of the best interpretations in the whole criminal stories cluster. It is just as playable now as any of GTA clones, like Sleeping dogs, Watch dogs et cetera... but it is original.Well, for me this is one of those unforgettable things Ill carry in my life, with all tips, shortcuts and armor locations, which I remember, while not touching it for more than 10 years. But it is not about nostalgia. It is just a really strong stuff. Maybe not the best in line, maybe dated... But still pure and stout. Good taste.Solid 7.5 mark in my book, without any rebate for former experience.
