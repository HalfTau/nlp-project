The best in the GTA games, city to remember great characters this was Liberty City at its best...GTA has not been same since. I first played this on the Playstation 2 big change into the new 3D engine at the time. For the playstation 2 this was a big leap forward with plenty to explore, rich characters, fun weapons  making the star signs go up being in a mad city police chase. Other GTA titles have done well but never matched this titles story  urban city feel, Certainly one of the greatest games in history.
