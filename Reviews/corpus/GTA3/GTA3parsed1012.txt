Simply one of the best games ever made, and even better than the console versions thanks to mouse aiming and higher resolutions.Assuming you can get it to run.I myself had no major problems on Windows 8.1, though Im reading reviews of problems on Windows 10 and some of the other newer OSes.   One fix I found, and this applies to GTA Vice City and San Andreas as well, is to ENABLE Vsync.  The games arent really meant to be played at todays ridiculously high framerates, and as such, this can fix a lot of timing and control related issues.But if you can get it to run, just, holy crap.  There is elegance in this games design and relative simplicity compared to the later entries that makes it enthralling like few other games out there.  IMHO, it still holds up extremely well, even compared to its sequels.Even if this game doesnt work, you can ask Steam for a refund, then use that money to get the PS2 version for like 2 new on Amazon or something.  It wont be AS good as this version, but itll still be an amazing experience.  So yes, I recommend this game.
