Pros A fun storyline with interesting characters Pretty good music stations, with a pretty funny talkshow as well Some major starpower from various crime shows and moviesGameplay is pure chaotic funCons Game cannot run on modern systems without the Silent Patch Some missions have an artificial difficultyCars can flip over easily and catch fire, which is frustrating to say the leastConslusion While its not the best GTA, its a great introduction and it set the stage for the future of open world games.
