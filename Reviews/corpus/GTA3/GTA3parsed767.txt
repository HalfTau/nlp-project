I cant really complain since this game is a classic in its own time from the early 2000s with its old graphics and layout. A true testament from what we are used to from today. Follow the storyline, pick up a few vehicle missions, explore or encounter a few classy s to go on a date. Just the typical Grand Theft Auto, but without all those extra features that you would see as the franchise grew. Many memories of playing this game from the PS2 made me want to revisit Liberty City on the PC, so I am cruising around in an old time classic!
