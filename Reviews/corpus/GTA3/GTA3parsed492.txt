This is an pretty decent game. The story and missions are fun and take some time to finish, and it forces the player to explore parts of the city to finish missions and find weapons. There were some difficult missions that frustrated me because either they werent clear enough with the instructions or the timer was too short and it rushed the missions for me so I needed to find a walkthrough to finish. The cars in this game flips over really easily and you cant flip them upright no matter how hard you try so that might ruin some gameplay and missions for you especially if gangs and police are chasing you and ram your car over. With a silent protagonist and not alot to offer after finishing the main missions its not worth coming back to. I never felt immersed like I did in San Andreas or GTA 5, the soundtrack wasnt that great but it did bring nostalgic memories back. I would recommend this game if its on sale or if youre looking to play it again for nostalgic reasons.
