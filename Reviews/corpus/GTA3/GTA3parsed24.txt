This is the game we all should be thankful for. It is the reason we have GTA V. The GTA series started as a topdown game but GTA 3 changed the entire gaming industry . The story is ok, the main character doesnt speak but it has some dope moments, anyways Its not the best, nor is my favourite, but I still do love the game as its a classic. The gameplay itself is chunky but that is what makes it funny P. I would definetely recommend getting the game if you like to play classics. I will still give it a 10/10 because its old and its normal for the game to not be the best! The gaming industry was expanding a lot back then. As I said though, I recommend it
