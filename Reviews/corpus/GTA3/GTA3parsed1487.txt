DID NOT FINISHI do not feel that this game stands up today especially not next to the sequels that have come from the franchise. The engine, gameplay, graphics, sound, story, AI and dialogues are all subpar. The game does have good world and level design in all fairness but that doesnt make up for everything else that has been highly improved in later games. This game is still fun but not more so than later games and I dont recommend people buying it.7/15  Later sequels are better
