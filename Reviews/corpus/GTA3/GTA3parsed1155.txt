I actually didnt start playing this game until after I found out about Vice City but I instantly was a huge fan of the game and its story. It was a bit frustrating back in the day, as there was a problem where if you ran into the Mafia they could one shot you with shotguns and blow your car up. Beyond that hiccup its definitely fun even today to play through. They definitely dont make story lines like this anymore!
