Grand Theft Auto III is the game that led the open world adventure video game era. Grand Theft Auto is personally my favorite video game series, and Rockstar hasnt given me a reason for it not to be. The game is usually 5 on big sales, and I picked it up during the Winter 2013 Sale. The missions are challenging, and there are tons of them. Side quests, main missions, sensitive controls and physics. Try ramming a car into a streetlight, or a try pushing a car with a fire truck for a while. This game promises hours of fun and goofiness, while at the same time coming off as serious and meaningful. Enjoy the game, 10/10.
