Let me just be clear GTA 3 is an amazing game, Id super recommend it 9/10. But, DO NOT GET IT IN PC. At least not if you have a new computer. Its sad, but if you want to play it, get the PS2 version, because this version is broken due to lack of updating. Like I said, great game, jus buy somewhere else.
