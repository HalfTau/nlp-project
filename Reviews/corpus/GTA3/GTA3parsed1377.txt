I have played every GTA and GTA III was an okay game.Any good?Played it a lot a long time ago. I think.. hah I think I bought my first Geforce card to play this game.. I still had a 3DFX card.. turned the rear lights into red blocks haha. So when I purchased my Geforce 4 mmx it went marvelously well and smooth. Played it out and thought of it as a great game.RecommendYes. Though these days I have not got it installed because of newer versions I like better. But hey a nice game.
