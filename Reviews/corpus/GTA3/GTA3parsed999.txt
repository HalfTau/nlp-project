Played it for the first time ever, so its a fresh look without nostalgia.Gameplay is solid, its fun to drive around, sadly the world is small and dead and theres not much to do aside from the missions.Radio is horrible, with only one good music station Flashback, two stations that have a couple good songs Lips and Head and an amazing Chatterbox with Lazlow. When I got tired from music I listened to him non stop. All other stations are worthless.Some characters have broken motivation for their actions. Plot is seminon existent. Its told in little bits, just so that we can get the picture, but it fails at being a mosaic that we put together and ends up distant from the player. And the ending is anticlimactic.In the end its not enough. Playtime is decent, it took me 18 hours to complete, with exploration, side missions and package retrieving. But the plot couldve used some more depth. Characters couldve been drawn out better. They appear and dissapear and slip out of the mind.It is a good game, but perhaps the worst GTA Ive played.
