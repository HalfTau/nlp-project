One of the most remarkable game of game history, that at the time of its release blows up peoples mind with simple 3D living open world in which you are free to do what ever you want. Theres no much of a difference in gameplay back then and now. Go back to Liberty City if you didnt and spend your time to work for the dark side of this city!
