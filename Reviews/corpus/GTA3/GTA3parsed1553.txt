The game that invented sandbox gaming, and a powerful gaming series! Admittedly not very well done on the PC very buggy, practically unplayable but was AMAZING on the PS2. The game is visibly outdated by todays standards, but put yourself in the mindset of this games release day, and you will enjoy imminsely. For best effect, make sure vertical sync and frame lmiters are ON. If they are ON, you will see all cars as black due to a bug. But if they are OFF, especially on higher end PCs, the game will play in fast forward, and virtually every tiny little thing will take health from you falling off the curb, etc. But aside from the cars looking weird, the game plays fine. Enjoy a classic!
