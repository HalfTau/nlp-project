It is hard to put into words the influence of Grand Theft Auto III. I could go on about the innovations of the game and whatnot, but what I am especially in awe of is how well the game has aged. It was refreshing and bold in 2001, and it still has that impeccable charm that has graced very few games over the decades. It is still so much fun to speed away in a stolen police car, or take out a gang leader, or kill the snitch whos telling a rival your bosss secrets, or escort a hooker from point A to point B. Despite the somewhat dated graphics, the gameplay is rich and thorough as Liberty City is a place that feels real a moving, breathing city.The first mission of the game is called Give Me Liberty. Little did any of us know just how much liberty we would have in Grand Theft Auto III.
