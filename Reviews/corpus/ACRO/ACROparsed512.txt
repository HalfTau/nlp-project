Ok I waited until I got the hang of the game...Was never a big fan of this franchise because of Ubisoft, but I bought it on sale and WOW! WOW! Man this game rocks...I am a military man used to fighting on ground but once you get the hang of the naval combat it is brillant it is awesome to sink ships and see the damage your cannonballs do. It also takes tactics I took out a lvl 14 frigate with my ship during sequence 2 it was a bit of luck after i took out the gunboats but I shot an ice berg and caused a huge swell to lift it up and vurnerable to its broadside and shot evrything into it and sunk it man what a rush it was awesome my crew thought so to. I have np running the game either it is constant at 6062 fps steady. The graphics are unreal and the screenshots I took are just the beginng as I just got to NY only played the game through 3 sequences and having a blast 10/10 never had this much fun with a game I cant stop playing it.
