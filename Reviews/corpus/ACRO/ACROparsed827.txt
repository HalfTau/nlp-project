By far the best of the Assassins Creed games. I have plaayed through this game a total of 4 times, twice on Playstation, twice on PC. I hope that Ubisoft continues to pursue a line of Templar oriented games, as I find myself agreeing with them more often than any of the Assassins. The story is fantastic, while I was not a fan of Unity, the seemless transition from this game to that was beautifully done. 10/10 times I would recommend this game to all.
