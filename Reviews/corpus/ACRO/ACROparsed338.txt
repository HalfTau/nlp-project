This is a great game if you are planning to start in the assassins creed franchise. I bought it on sale and am super happy with my purchase. it combines on land and sea gameplay which makes it interesting thoughout the enitre game. I know i havent finished it but once i get back from vaca i am psyched to go and finish it. i have played for about 10 hours so far and am only about 7 procent in the game. very densely packed and fun to go out killing crews and taking over ships to enhance and upgrade yours. I love it and recommend it.
