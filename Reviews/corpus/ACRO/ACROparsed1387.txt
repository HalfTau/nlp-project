Assassins Creed Rogue is one of the best games Ive had. It has the intrigue in all the historical chapters, and Naval Fleets galore. It has cannons,motars,carbines,pistols,swords,nades,knives,poison darts,maps,relics,and so many collectibles.The graphic nature of the townships and citizens will have you hooked on the game in a minute. The action sequences are so well rounded reaction time isnt as limited as some faster paced scenarios in some other games.When the newest Assassins Creed Syndicate is released I recommend it, and this one too.
