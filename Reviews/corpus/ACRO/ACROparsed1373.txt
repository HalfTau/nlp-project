8/10PositivesGreat storyAwesome settings including the North Atlantic, The River Valley, and NEW FOOKING YORK BABYYYYYFantastic Protagonist Seriously cant stress this enough, best character since Ezio, He makes his own ing luck.Interesting sidecharacters except Gist, he has like 4 lines of dialogue, Anne Bonny still best first mate/quartermasterWell written dialogue for the most part, you will find the occasional cringeworthy pun or halfjokeReturning characters including Haytham Kenway, Achilles, Adewale, and George WashingtonHistorical characters like George Monroe, Lawrence Washington, Benjemin Franklin, and James Cook.Tie in to Unity not spoiling this, since its basically the finale of the gameAND ITS BUG FREE!! Have yet to experience a single bug, other than one that ended up being an issue with Steam itselfNegativesNo multiplayer Honestly not sure if this is a negative, but I can see why some people would miss itShort campaign about half as long as Black Flag, which isnt saying alot since Black Flag has lots of pointless missionsCustomization somewhat lacking When the hell are we going to get to dye our clothes again, like in Brotherhood?Obnoxious Collectibles Somewhat subverted due to the fact you can just buy hunting supplies at most ingame shopsBounty Hunters on land are hella overpowered. You have been warned. DONT KILL INNOCENTSUnderwhelming Assassin hunting mechanics. You basically use Eagle Vision to detect where the Assassins are, like in Multiplayer from older games, and intercept them before they assassinate either you, or their target. Thats literally it.
