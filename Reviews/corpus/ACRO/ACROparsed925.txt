This was an interesting side story to the AC III/ACIV corner of Ubisofts franchise. It was in the end less thrilling or interesting that I might otherwise have hoped, but it did give closure to some plot bits from ACIII and also your modern day plot from AC IV. If you missed this one, you wont feel a loss, but if you have a vested interest in the ACIII/ACIV/Liberty timeline youll enjoy Rogue.Pro good story for about 70 of the way through, more ship stuff.Cons felt akward, on a ACIII/ACIB engine hybrid so tree running was a pain at times as the ACIII engine seems to have pathfinding issues compared to ACIV, and most of the busywork in the game really, really felt like busywork. Fortunately you are not forced to play through most of it if you dont want to.
