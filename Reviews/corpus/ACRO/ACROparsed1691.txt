Ubisoft FINALLY did a good PC port! Huzzah and good cheer for all PC gamers! The graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is smooth. AC4 is still to this day my fave AC game ive played all of them, but it ran kinda poorly and had really bad screen tearing. I run AC Rogue maxed out on a GTX 760 SC, and never drop below 60fps. If you played AC4 and couldnt get enough of the naval combat, grab AC Rogue on your next Steam store visit.
