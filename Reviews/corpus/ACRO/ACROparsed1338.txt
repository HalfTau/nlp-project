Unfortunately with the new Nvidia update, this game is unplayable with flickering images, object disappearing, and voice out of sync with characters. It might get fixed later on with another video card update. For the meantime, you will find some different solutions and opinions in the game forums, so you might want to check it out before purchasing.
