A good sequel to assassins creed black flag. Very familiar but with its own style. Also a prequel to unity but i wont spoil it for anyone who cares. I focused mainly on the main story without getting distracted by too many side quests. Took me around 10 hours to complete it. The side quests would add maybe 15 more.
