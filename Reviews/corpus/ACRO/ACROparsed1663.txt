I couldve sword this game was a standalone DLC for AC4 but apparently no. Ive been playing it for a couple of hours and so far its as identical to AC4 Black Flag as FC4 was to FC3. And as good as AC4. I recommend it only if you want more of AC4.Update. After a few more hours with the game I found a few things I dont like.First I found a glitch in a fort where the door was closed and I couldnt kill the captain. Im looking for a way to open it but Im not very hopeful.Second Uplay. That poor excuse of a DRM is harming the legitimate players like me who bought the game and does nothing for the pirates who torrented the game without ever being annoyed by the stupid thing. Uplay is down? You cant play, but a pirate can. Uplay deleted your savegames? Has happened in ACUnity for some people. Pirates dont have that problem either. Yesterday I had a message coming up during launching the game that said achievements have failed to synchronize or something. Today its still coming up but somehow I can run the game now.Third, why does every Ubisoft game have to be packed with collectibles. Im kinda obsessed about that sort of thing, what they call OCD but it isnt OCD obviously, but in this game they just drive me nuts. Chests, Animus fragments, templar maps, viking swords, prosperity and more. All they do is clutter up my map.Update two. This game has some sort of problem with MSI Afterburner so shut this down if the game doesnt start for you as well
