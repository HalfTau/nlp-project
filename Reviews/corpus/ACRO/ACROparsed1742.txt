This game is absolutely fantastic. This is what Asssassins Creed is all about. The graphics are wonderful. The performance is fantastic, got everything set to max and no fps drops what so ever, constant 60 fps on a 780ti. The story is unique and intriguing. If you were upset by the failure of Unity, then fear no more. Assassins Creed Rogue will make your faith in Ubisoft come back. The Soundtrack is bloody AMAZING! the chills it gives you when it plays, its a fantastic feeling. If its one thing that Ubisoft knows what to do, is always delivering a fantastic Soundtrack, it deeply emerses you into the game. The whole I was an Assassin, now a templar the story is so fantastic it makes me so happy that ubisoft put time and effort into this game. I highly suggest you buy it, its a full game, with a full story, I havent completed it yet, because I have been having fun with the Ship battles, plundering and getting them monies! but so far its had me sit here playing the game.Story 8/10Graphics 8/10Soundtrack 10/10Glitches, bugs or fps drops None that I have seen so far.Gameplay 9/10 just like you remember it in Black Flag, its FANTASTICThe game is fantastic and for the price its WELL worth it. Pick it up, You wont be disapointed! I promise! !
