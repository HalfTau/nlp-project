Great game and story. Mechanics are exactly like Black Flag. The story was well done and I firmly believe Shay Cormac should have gotten more story than what he got. The series as a whole has always had a Good VS Evil vibe and this game does a great job in blurring the lines makng the two sides the shades of grey that they really are. The only thing I did not like that was that crafting was a lot more difficult to do, but in the end it didnt matter. I only upgraded my health once and that was it, not including everything I did to the ship.ProsGood storyExact same core mechanics as Black FlagHunting Assassins wanting to ambush you can be heartpounding at timesAI is not as dumb as previous gamesConsStory seemed too short. I didnt realize I was at the end when I realized my fellow former assassin bodies had all been eliminatedCrafting was not as easily done as the previous two games. Animals were hard to find since most of the game takes place in cities and villages apart from the naval gameplay. In the end, this didnt really matter.Shays story just ends with no follow up or DLC because of Unity. Would have enjoyed a tiein in Unity or something. Shay is a very interesting character and it bums me out that he doesnt get more attention.
