A solid entry into the series in terms of gameplay possibilities. The seafaring of AC3 mixed with the renovations and money system of Brotherhood. The story ends up being somewhat lackluster, and Shays betrayal is based over the classic soap opera gig where main characters dont give each other enough time to explain everything, so it all goes to hell.Also, I hate Shays voice actor.
