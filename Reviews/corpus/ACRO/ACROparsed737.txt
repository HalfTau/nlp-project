As a big AC fan, I enjoyed Rogue for what it brings to the series as a whole in terms of both the historical and Abstergo narratives, set between Black Flag, ACIII and Unity. However, I have to admit that the experience in itself felt like little more than a slightly lengthy addon to its precursor. Youll enjoy this if, like me, you wish to experience the additional story elements for yourself, or if both Black Flag and the Freedom Cry DLC didnt quite parch the mighty thirst you had for seafaring. Still, Im torn between the welcome additional contextual information and the feeling that this is all just a bit of a lazy money grab. Ultimately, I cant recommend Rogue as, simply put the more I played, the cheaper it feltwhich is unacceptable for a game that sells at the same price as Black Flag at the time of writing this.
