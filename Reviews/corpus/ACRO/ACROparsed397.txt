Great game, combines the classic AC gameplay with the newer ship missions very well. I personally enjoyed that the story is around 50/50 on land and on sea but I guess thats very subjective. Only drawback is that the first part of the mission is a bit too strictly guided for my taste and that you cant skip the credit after the finale, wtf.
