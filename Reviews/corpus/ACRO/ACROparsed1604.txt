All I can say is WOW.Ubisoft really did a good job with this game. They really compensated the short storyline with heap loads of side activities, ranging from capturing gang headquarters, assisting the Brits in frontier clashes and intercepting Assassins. I mean seriously, the game even forces you to look for hunting goods to craft your upgrades! Otherwise you would have to spend an average of 1250 pounds to craft something.I thouroughly reccomend it to AC fans.
