The most apt description is the one already given to it its Black Flag 1.5. Seemingly equal parts naval combat and traditional AC gameplay. The story was decent enough and I liked the tieins to other games in the series particularly those relating to AC 3. Perhaps not the most memorable, but not bad by any means.
