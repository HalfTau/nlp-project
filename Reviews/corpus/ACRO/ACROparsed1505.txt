Im sure this game would be great, unfortunately I have not been able to play more than 2  10 minutes between crashes.I have opened a ticket with ubisoft, tried several different suggestions, none of which has fixed the crashing.Im running on a i73.4Ghz, 12Gb Mem, GTX 660. I have multiple other games that runs just fine, but this one game just keeps crashing on me.If this is ever released for XBox One then I will definitely get it, but for PC I cannot recommend this game.
