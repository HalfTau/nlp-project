This is the best Assassins Creed yet, with Black Flag as a close second. It combines the brilliant naval combat with the roofrunning cityscapes that are the series trademarks. The story is surprisingly good and relatively uncliched, especially when compared with Unity. Targeting can be a little funky, and I havent been able to get any legacy outfits, but these are the only real problems I have with this game.
