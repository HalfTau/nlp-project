AC Rogue, the game that no one knew even came out because of the super hype around Unity, so you might think meh, must just be an afterthought from Ubisoft, cant be that good. Oh but youre wrong, if you liked Black Flag, this is that game only much better, and the reason is fantastic character development. You start off as an Assassin who, after experiencing what Assassins do, joins the Templars. The whole story around this and the internal struggles the character goes through is more intense than most other AC games. The world is great and includes ice/snow regions as well as temperate, so more of a variety than Black Flag. The ship and sea battle mechanics have been fine tuned and upgraded. Thought Black Flag wasnt a proper AC game because youre a silly pirate but liked ships? This is the game for you, proper AC story...on a boat!
