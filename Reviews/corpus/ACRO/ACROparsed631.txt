This one was of the best AC games for me, heres why I liked it.1. Shay was such a good character all together, he really felt like the Protagonist that AC needed for once!2. The Game was basically a mix of AC3 and Black Flag Literaly and those two were also favorites of mine!3. Old characters return such as haytham, adawale, achilies, and others!4. It felt like a fresh breath of air to play as a templar and kick some assassin butt5. Shays story was very intresting as well, he has been throguh so much and still refuses to quit.Now heres some cons..1. The game was TOO SHORT with a whopping 6 sequences2. There is absolutly NO trace of shay after Rouge3. Lots of Recycled content
