Amazing, one of the best ACs, would recommend playing this before Unity, stories match up great!!! Would play AC 4 before this one too.Only negative, on a newer Graphics driver the snow glitches when walking on it. However, this isnt a huge issue as you dont spend much time really walking on the snow. So if you can look past it, it is not a huge problem.Maybe using the driver that came out on release day may fix this.
