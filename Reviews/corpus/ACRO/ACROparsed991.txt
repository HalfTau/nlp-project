another part to the ac storyline, only this time its an assassin called Shay, who finds out what the assassins are doing with the pieces of eden and then turns antiassassin!great game to play, alot smoother than blackflag, altho the controls arent that fluid. nice to see we can still steal fom peasants and not give any s.....altho i enjoy playing the ac series i thought this entry was a tad short.... but still a good game to purchase, now to play the next installment and see what the crack is
