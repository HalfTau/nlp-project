my friend recommended it to me, and I didnt think that Id like it so much. I always thought that the game was about nothing but freerunning, but I was so, so wrong. Of course, there are some flaws, but the plot is very interesting, the graphics are good, the sound effects are nice, and the shanties sound brilliant. Overall, I can say that its a strong 9.
