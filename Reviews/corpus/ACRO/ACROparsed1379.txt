Today i just finished black flag for the second time and was excited to play it but something dissapointed me. I play using two 24 inch tvs and had absolutly no problems with graphics in black flag, but when i got to rogue there was dissapointments. I just got out of the animus for the first time in this game and the frame refresh rate was terrible. I dont know how to fix it but if i can play black flag without any problem then what the hell is going on with rogue.
