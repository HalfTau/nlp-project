I dont know why maybe its just my game. But mine crashes. I have a built gaming computer so it cant be something with it. It crashes at the same part usually. Being in Absurgo however you spell it.. I hate that their games STILL switch back and forth but whatever.Up note from where I stopped 50 I love the game and the fact it has Haytham! Its amazing and makes you think with a few puzzles. Its very fun and I loved every second.
