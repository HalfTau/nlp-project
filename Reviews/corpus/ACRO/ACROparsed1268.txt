I absolutely love this game. I just completed the main story, and it really is fantastic, far better than ACIII and depending on your opinion better than ACIV. The games decision to have you play as a Templar makes it one of the most interesting AC games to date.The gameply itself is just a reskinned Black Flag, which is fine, because Black Flag was solid in that respect.The music is awesome, and is slightly remniscient of the Ezio trilogy.The locations are interesting, and one of the main cities even brings back territories to take over, similar to Revelations.Another interesting part of the game is how it ties together ACIII, ACIV, and even a little bit of Unity, although I thankfully havent had to experience that mess yet.All in all, definitely worth the 30 its asking for at the time of this review, and definitely worth the 9 I payed for it on sale. If you are a fan of the Assassins Creed franchise, this installment will exceed your expectations.
