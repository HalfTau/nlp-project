Im two hours into this and its my second least favourite game in the entire Assassins Creed series, the first being Liberation. The writing is bad, its just an average game with none of the great qualities that make the Assassins Creed games stand out, just lacks the sort of conspiracy and politics and magic of the rest of the series. The characters act in a flat and unrealistic way, they are not written well. Ive noticed the same thing in Liberation. All the other games have incredibly realistic characters. Im going to try to avoid Ubisoft Sofia titles from now on.Overall, boring game, waste of money, avoid.
