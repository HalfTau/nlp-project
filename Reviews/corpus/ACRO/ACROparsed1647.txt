I have to say i play all of the Assasssin Creed and my fav being the 1st one but man i got to say i really did enjoy this one. They made the story in this one amazing i love the idea of you being a assassin an not you have to turn on your own kind to protect those that cant them self i dont want to say much to spoil it but man the story epic. The game as well looks amazning and it runs perfect i was playing with all max setting in 1080p with no drops an that great as many know the last assassin creed has issue with being stable but in this one it all gone and perfect and i love the entire boat fighting gameplay how you can baord someone elses ship and take it over and loot everything on it. I made a review for this game as well so if you folks would like to hear my opinion on the game check it out.
