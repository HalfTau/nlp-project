This game in my opinion is the best of the Assassins Creed franchise after AC2. The story of Shay Cormac is a very interesting one that answers the question why hasnt one assassin been like what the heck are we doing here. At first I was having framerate issues but after tweaking a few settings the game looked amazing and played insanely well. Have fun in Assassins Creed Rogue and question the creed my friends. Its time for the Templars to rise
