I Couldnt find a flaw in this game. They took everything great from Black Flag and improved on it. The story was so perfect that I didnt care it was a couple sequences short. I wish it kept going but it was so perfectly laid out I didnt mind so much. We finally got a game with the assassins being our enemy and they executed it flawlessly. The signature moves were used against you as well as you performing them. Shay is a great protagonist, his decisions are well thought through and makes sense why he would go Rogue. Rogue ties in with  Unity, AC3 / and Black Flag perfectly while answering and also revealing so much more to the assassin creed universe. This game had all the elements to be a masterpiece and it succeeded. Worth every penny. Solid 9/10.
