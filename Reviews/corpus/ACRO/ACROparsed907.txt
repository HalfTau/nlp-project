Another great addition to the AC franchise, while the gameplay is definatly nothing new and basically a complete copy from Black Flag and AC 3, Rogue brings us a new perspective through Shays eyes as he walks the path of both assassin and templar.This game benifits alot from his personality and story, along with several other characters that make your game experience totally worth the time.The story was somewhat short for a stand alone but really enjoyable to go through, meeting new characters each with their own motivations and some characters from previous games that enrich Shays journey.The gameplay hasnt changed a bit. from combat to travel and naval battles, theres little to no changes, aside from a few new weapons and the always enjoyable naval battles now with burning oil available aswell.The territorial disputes could have been better if they brought along the territorial wars from Revelations, but oh well it is well made and it is definatly interesting to play the templar side of things.It really shows that this game suffered from Unitys release, it could have used some more attention, all things considered, Assassins Creed Rogue is still definatly a better game and experience than AC Unity, even if the graphics arent as shiny it profits from better FPS, overall superior optimization, solid and fast gameplay without the random bugs and crashes.Assassins Creed Rogue is definatly worth the purchase, hold on buying it until a sale arrives since most of the gameplay if nothing new but the story will be worth the money, a solid title with a good story, a pity that the developers didnt give it the attention it deserved.
