Assassins Creed Rogue is basically Assassins Creed Black Flag 1.5. Its a reskinned version of the great piratethemed Assassins Creed that came out the year before, but with a few nice refinements. The story is very short and basic, and not that interesting. I never really warmed to the main character that shifts from Assassin to Templar after being betrayed by them. His motivations to change sides seemed pretty shallow, and strangely the Assassins that you deal with in the game act like and the Templars act like bros, so it just felt like in this instance, it felt right to swap sides. If this character had been working with another Assassin brotherhood, this would not have happened.The gameplay is pretty solid though, you can run around an outpost swapping between stealth and combat pretty easily, and the naval combat is as fun as ever. You just dont feel invested in wanting to unlock everything or see every location like you do in Black Flag.If you are an Assassins Creed fan, and you can get this cheap, its worth a run through. Its just not that interesting as a whole. It does however come with a nice revelation at the end that links it into the next game in the series chronologically which is Assassins Creed Unity.Pros Solid gameplay mechanics, refining all the skills and features introduced in the previous games Probably one of the easiest to use, and most lethal characters to play as in the franchise The game looks and runs great Nice ending that links up with Assassins Creed UnityCons Short and simple story that isnt that interesting in comparison to the other entries in the series You dont end up caring about any of the characters except for the few that were present in other entries in the series Doesnt really reveal anything new about the Templars that we didnt know before No Templar specific skills or weapons. You are basically an Assassin working for the Templars.
