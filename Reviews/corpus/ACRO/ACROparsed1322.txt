I held off playing Rogue since for a while it was only available on XB360. I remember seeing the March release date for PC, but I forgot about it. I went to get Syndicate the other day based on a friend recommendation AC was my favoite franchise, until Unity ruined everything, lorewise. So no preordering anymore, and saw a 11/19 release. Well, I needed my AC fix I was set on.After scrolling through a couple reviews and seeing the very positive rating, I went ahead and purchased it, full price. I could not have been more surprised and pleased.They took the good things from Black Flag, and spun the story around. It was incredibly refreshing! The redundancy of the Assassins actual creed, missions, and beliefs were starting to get to me. Their story was always told with the Templars being the ultimate evil, while hinting that what the Assassins were doing wasnt much better.If youre an AC lore junkie like me, you will be very fulfilled with Rogue. Lots of goodies just like Black Flag. Its not without some terrible controls and parkour stickiness, but they are minimal and you learn to cope. The ship battles are improved, and the world is as big, if not bigger than Black Flag! Lots of side areas and places to go.The ONLY downside is I feel the main story is incredibly short. A couple more sequences would have been nice.Some might complain about the gfx, but its obviously a lastgen console port. On highest setting it is still immersive and good looking. Sound is good, and music is great.Overall, I would give this a 8/10
