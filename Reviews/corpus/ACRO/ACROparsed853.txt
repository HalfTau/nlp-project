Its normally very easy to get bored with the repetitive storylines in the Assassins Creed games. Rogue is quite different however. This is the first game you play as a Templar, and actually experience the villans point of view first hand. It takes place between the events of Assassins Creed Black Flag and Assassins Creed 3, and is very similar to Black Flag.ProsBeautiful sceneryDifferent storyline perspectiveMore variety with player skinsMore variety with terrain and the places you exploreImprovement on naval combatGive more detail into Haytham Kenways story before AC 3ConsThe weaponry functions almost exactly the same as in Black Flag, except they have different names and appearances although there are a few new thingsLots of minor glitches invincible enemies, phasing through the landscape, being hit/detected through walls which dont cause much issues with playing, but definitely break immersionAlthough showing the story from a Templar perspective, the main concept is the same Find and kill a list of targets throughout the game, getting closer and closer to eliminating the main target at the endAll in all, Assassins Creed Rogue is worth the money, and if you liked Black Flag, you will definitely enjoy this game. However, if you are expecting this game to be new and groundbreaking in the Assassins Creed saga, then you will be disappointed.EDIT I have started seeing a LOT of glitches when it somes to onfoot combat. If I board 20 ships, about 18 or 19 will have some kind of serious bug, like being hit by enemies that are stuck in walls and cant be killed, or using my last berserker grenade on a cluster of enemies, just to have them stand there doing nothing. In one instance I glitched THROUGH the boat I was boarding, landed in water, and couldnt get out. I had to wait for my crew to finish killing the amount of enemies necessary to complete the board. I still reccomend, but combat, especially boarding, needs some serious work.
