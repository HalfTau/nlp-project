25  for 10 hours worth of gameplay is cheap. The history and characters is great, certainly interesting to play as the Templars for once. It runs great on full graphics on normal laptops, and have decent graphics. The locations is kind of repetative and i didnt find any thrill to explore them all, which would have taken at least 10 hours more. Anyhow, a good throwback to the Black Flag elements. I wish they put as much effort into the story as this with AC Unity.
