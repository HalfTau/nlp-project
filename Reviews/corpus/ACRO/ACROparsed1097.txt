Owned every physical copy of AC on consoles so Ive been considering getting a PS3 or PC copy, then the 60 off showed up in my face, damn Im getting the 60fps one... Mentally Im prepared for a AC4 duplicate work, so the game itself does not disappoint me, most impressively a solid 60fps performance on my laptop feels really great during my gameplay, u know after all this years playing notthatstable 30fps ACs on consoles...gameplay feels kinda the same as AC4, I spent 40h in AC4 so I enjoy the my first 8h in ACRo. Shay is a character that is more humanreal than ever, the struggle inside him is finely presentated, but my gameplay paused for a long time for some reason, Ill pick it up later. Btw the game supports Xbox One controller perfectly during gameplay, a solid 60fps and a responsive controller, what could u expect more if you are a console gamer on PC?
