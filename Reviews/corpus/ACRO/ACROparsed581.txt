Only buy on discount, yet another super clumsy console port. Expect to jump up the face of walls when trying to attack or climb a pole instead of trying to attack or pointlessly jump in a pile of stuff instead of trying to dodge or you get the idea. Trying to do too much with too few controls, nett result really clumsy gaming.Add in the ohh so disgusting POS keyboard mashing, chase the big white character on screen, really super gaming, yep really draws you in that asinine key board masher activity. Why do those idiots do it, just why.Looks OK, ships use is not too bad, just a shame about the super clumsy lets make one key do half the stuff in the game thatll work.As always for bad console ports, facing the enemy to attack them is entirely optional, infact trying to guess which enemy you will attack in a crowd in the norm, apart from of course randomly tring to climb stuff if it should come into range instead of attacking, completely randomly.
