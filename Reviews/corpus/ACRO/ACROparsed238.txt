READ THE CRASHING FIX SECTION Finally an AC game that wouldnt be better titled Assassins Creed Panhandling Streetcorner Hobo. They actually give you enough money in the normal progression of the story to upgrade your ship and buy decent weapons with some semblance of balance to the timing. You dont have to spend every other hour scouring tiny islands for noisy treasure chests.Sticking straight to the storyline without getting tricked into any pointless sidemissions they made a moderately fast paced game that follows the precise AC formula were so accustomed to which completes in about 1215 hours AND does not force you to constantly hunt for money.the crashing fix sectionCrashing was out of control.
