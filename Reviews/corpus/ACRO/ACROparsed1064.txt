Story was extremely compelling and offered a welcome twist to the franchise, playing as a Templar! Although some may argue the game was too short I felt thawas as long as it needed to be. Another great installment to the series and a worthy successor to Black Flag. Also, from what Ive heard its a lot better than Unity.
