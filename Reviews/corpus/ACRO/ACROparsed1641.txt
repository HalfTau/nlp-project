Unlike the disater of ACU, this game feels like its predicessors.bear in mind that this is my opinion after 12 hours of gameplay.Pros Does not have any microtransaction BS like ACU Smooth contols Improved ship controls New ship Upgrades. VERY interesting story. 3 Unique areas. New York A large City, I know, surprising. The River Valley, Semilarge islands with, again surprisingly, rivers. The Rivers DO infact handle differently that out on the open sea. And the North Atlantic, small, frozen islands amid a wild ocen, full of ice and honestly scary rouge waves. New unique weapons. I personly enjoy the air gun, an updated blowgun The story is also very unique, as you are viewing it from the other side of the war, and you even meet some old faces, friendly, or othersise. the UPlay reward that grants you a japanese set of swords in not overpowed. I have replaced them with a midrange set alreadyYour first mate if the best NPC in 2015 so far. Its friggin Richard Dumont.CONS Not many types of side missons.So Far Helping the British, who will easily become hostile if commiting a crime. Forced Uplay Intergration.
