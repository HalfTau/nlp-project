Despite the complaints about this game being a money grab Ive come to like it. The game is a bit short, only 6 sequences, but is a very good filler to the storyline falling between ACIV and ACIII yay nonliniar progression of timelines! and answers questions about characters from both games even if you never asked them.As to the only 6 sequences issue, this isnt a major numbered title, fillers are usually shorter tho no less funActual things you may not like,Stalkers, someone went way overkill idiot mode with theseCaptains, Brutes, etc now take 2 or more pistol shots to kill unlike Kenway you only have 2 shotsYour so called Allies will shoot you for being on buildings you payed to renovate or cleared gangs from, theyll also attack you for defending yourself when stalkers attack sorry but imo this is just stupidThings you may like,You can murder anyone except civilians, even your idiot alliesYou can berserk guards who will then attack civilians Ive come to believe my character may have started the revolution by instigating random attacks on the populace by both French and English troopsYou get to kill and maim characters youve come to like and admire ok maybe you have to be a psychopath to enjoy this but hey, its thereEven tho it may cause desynchronisation you can zerk farm animals or some random guy with a broom who then chases people swatting them with it
