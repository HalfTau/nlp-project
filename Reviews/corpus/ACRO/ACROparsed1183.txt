If you enjoyed Black Flag you will love this, unless you are bored of that game. Runs beatifully compared to unity, though its not a graphics powerhouse it runs cleanly and smoothly at a lovely 60fps on a r9 290. Very immersive and plenty to do. Like a greatest hits of AC.The only negatives are the invasive Uplay which is required to play the game and still crashes for me occasionally. I also had an issue with the newer Crimson AMD drivers crashing the game after the first cut scene and had to copy an older aticfx64.dll and atidxx64.dll file across to the main game directory same fix required for Fallout 4.
