Crap. Didnt take the other negative reviews seriously, and now Im too requesting refund because the game crashes in seconds when I start playing, and no online solution took me through the problem. Ive played every AC since the first to the fourth in the series, but I am NOT going to try any new one.See folks? Thats how a  company manages to put an end on something that WAS an incredible franchise.
