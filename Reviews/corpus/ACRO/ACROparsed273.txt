I honestly dislike the naval system because I dont like sometimes controlling the ship, shoting it and etc as it is confusing. But overall the game is not that bad ,and I get very good fps in it but it sometimes does not respond when you are stuck on a tree, ship, or a crate and you are basically stuck there for like a solid 5 seconds before you can move.
