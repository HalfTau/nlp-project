Rogue is basically the same as Black Flag, in terms of gameplay, with a few added features. Namely, this time around, not only can you board other ships but they can board you as well. And theres a grenade launcher.You get to see things from the Templars perspective this time around, and instead of handling it in a these are the bad guys, these are the good guys, the end type of way, it really greys the line between the Assassins and Templars. The game sets the scene for both 3 and Unity, dealing with characters from both games. Adewale makes a return as well.Theres not much else to tell, really. You can read about the synopsis elsewhere, and as far as gameplay goes, like I said, its pretty much the same as Black Flag. The game performs extremely well, much better than Unity in any event.
