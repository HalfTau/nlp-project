A beautiful, underrated entry in the Assassins Creed series which very well may be falling from grace. I myself was a huge fan of Assassins Creed, then I started drifting off after the first original four games. Rouge was my attempt to get back in it. With games like Unity, and Syndicate, this is an amazing breath of fresh air.PROS Nice Graphics Well designed open world Sailing If you liked that from Black Flag, dont worry its not overused A great story that drifts from traditional Assassins Creeds Not a lot of outside of Animus segments Which I think everyone hates being taken out of the Animus Parkour is fluid and has plenty of variety Ending Leaves you satisfiedCONS Open world has plenty of things to do, but only a few are actually interesting and fun. Side missions arent too great. Quality v. Quantity Forts. The forts where you would attack from your ship and then go in to raid them just didnt draw me in. They seemed like a waste of time and the ship attacking segment with your cannons is a bit too long for my taste and a bit boring. Depending on your definition, the story may be short. About 1112 hours of campaign. I just wish there was more of it. A decently long story.OVERALL RATING 8.5/10A must buy for any fan of Assassins Creed.
