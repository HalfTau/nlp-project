If you liked Black Flag, youll like this one. Basically the exact same gameplay, but with a new world, characters, storyline, and freezing water.The world is broken up into different smaller sections you have to load in to, instead of being one big map. I havent come across any storms tornadoes, rogue waves, etc so I dont know if they exist one of the things I loved about Black Flag. Blowing up ice bergs in battle is neat as it causes a small wave that damages smaller ships. The story feels like it is lacking a little bit right now, its not really explaining much of anything. Hopefully that picks up. Combat mechanics are fluid and ship battles are still epic even without the storms again I dont know if they exist or not. By the way, you can pick up bodies and toss them in the bushes which is a big plus.I do feel that it doesnt quite live up to the epicness of Black Flag like I had hoped, but fun nonetheless. It is pretty much a gigantic expansion pack worth about 3540 in my opinion. Id wait for a sale, but if you dont mind spending the money go for it. Ill try to remember to update this review after I complete everything.
