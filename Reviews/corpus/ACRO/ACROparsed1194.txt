Effectively a sequel to the one good Assassins Creed game, this now makes it only the second AssCreed worth getting. Basically this takes Assassins Creed Pirates and expands upon its mechanics, includes a larger amount of interesting items to aquire, and given that you become a Templar the story is far more interesting. If you liked Black Flag, youll like this.
