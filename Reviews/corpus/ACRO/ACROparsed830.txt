i love the storyline of this game, its a bit of a cliche but it is presented so well. The modern day stuff is still a bit boring, but it was always going to be. The ending is one of my favorites of the whole series, as it ties together so much, it explains how achilles got his limp, how the colonial assassins got wiped out, and how the templars rose to power in america, and it also leads beautifully into unity, by having you play through its opening scene as papa dorians murderer, and seeing dorian meet his templar lady love from an outside perspective was very fun, and if you havent guessed by now i played this after unity
