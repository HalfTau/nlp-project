This game doesnt get enough love. I feel like this game was pushed under the rug a bit, and I dont see why. The perfect balance between land combat and ocean combat which I think makes Black Flag a bit redundant makes this game one of the best. Ive yet to play Origins as I am currently in a finacial situation that makes Michael Barrimore look like Bruce Waynebut i can say i love this game. I gave high praise to Syndicate aswell, but i think this has the best storyline and sense. Why would Abstergo, A templar compamny, make so many games that make the Creed seem awesome and The Templars like s ? It makes sense that theyd make a game about someone who realised the Assasins were powerhungry fools and left theyre cause to join the templars, which gave them cool perks like a piece of the navy AND EDWARD KENWAYS SON. Also Im sad that Monroe died. But at least I got some baclstory on Achilies limp and walking cane.
