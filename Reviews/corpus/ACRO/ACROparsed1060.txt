It most certainly is dark and although the story is short it is very compelling. It tells of the templar turned assassin shay cormac and is a prequel to ac3 and sort of a sequel to ac4. The game mechanics are the same as ac4 except that their are a coulpe of different things like gang headquarters. Also you meet haytham kenway and some other ac3 chararcters. It is quite dark as you must ruthlessly murder all your friends in the assassin order accept achilles. All in all it is a good game but I would get it on sale.
