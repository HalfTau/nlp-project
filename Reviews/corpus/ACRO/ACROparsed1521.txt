Heartbreaking.  Thats the word I would use.  I want to be a fan of AC games, I really do.  Its hard to deal with the frustration that comes with having to find tech support solutions for the games, they dont install well, they dont start well, and its really frustrating.The games are awesome, I enjoy the exploration and the visual aspects of the game, the story lines are very entertaining.Its just a shame that Rogue is such a p.i.t.a. to get up and running.It will NOT run unless its in offline mode.Cmon, Ubsioft.  Take some of the money we give you 50 bucks?  Really?  For a cut n paste copy of Black Flag? and pay the coders enough so that we dont have to pull our hair out and shout curse words into the internet.In the immortal words of Fry from Futuramafix it fix it fix it fix it
