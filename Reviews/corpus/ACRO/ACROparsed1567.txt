20 reportThis game is really impressive so far.  I dont know why, or how, but I can completely max it out on my rig with pretty steady 60 fps whereas AC IV and even AC III would make my computer bleed.  I think Ubisoft secretly released an amazingly optimized, fullyformed, and enjoyable AC game in the wake of Unity not even going to try to run that mess on my PC.As for the story, I LOVE it so far.  It picks up where AC IV left off in a way, putting you in the shoes of a selfish and hardheaded outsider.  Only this time, youre hurrr spoiler the bad guy, a Templar, dispelling those selfentitled and whiny Assassins.  As a pretty big AC fan, I have to say, it is weirdly satifisying to dispatch members of the Order, almost disconcertingly so.Oh, you know how awesome it was messing up fools on the high seas in AC IV?  You can do that too, with improved and expanded combat, new weapons, and NEW SEA SHANTYS.Graphically, it looks like AC IV but runs like a dream.  Granted, Im on a discontinued AMD 6100 and a GTX 770, but for me, its really quite nice.  I guess it only took Ubisoft 2.5 games to get their engine optimized for PC...After AC II, this is my favorite in the series so far.  If youre a AC fan, buy it now.  Otherwise, just buy it on sale.8/10 incomplete review
