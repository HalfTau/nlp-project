I definitely recommend this game especially if you are a AC fan. This new installment tells a new story which is slightly similar to that of Black Flag itself but gameplay wise is everything Black Flag was meant to be, not at all taking from Black Flag as I in fact loved that episode of AC being a historical fan of pirates in real life, Black Beard being my favourite of all pirates and was a really big thing for me to see him ingame.Part of me is unsure as to which storyline is better, Black Flag or Rogue? Something about the storyline for Black Flag was inspiring and very immersive for me, Rogue kind of cuts straight to the chase but with a somewhat equally inspiring storyline and the fact you get to play as a bit more of a solid bad guy than the other episodes is cool too. Needs to be more games based from the villains angle. Playing as a Templar agent is quite bad .Even if you are new to Assassins Creed this storyline will be easy to get on board with however I strongly recommend playing the earlier ACs to really soak up the depth of it all as this series takes on a whole new universe of its own and the overall storyline for Assassins Creed is quite interesting to say the least and honestly worthy of a high budget film lets just hope they dont  it up.Some of the things that still annoy me about AC to this day and still seem to be an issue I find throughout game is when the parkour spazzes out and simple jumps just cause you to derp out and get stuck which in some situations is highly frustrating but for the most part the engine runs quite smoothly and situations as I have just mentioned happen quite rarely but when they do happen you will know exactly what I am talking about. I have also witnessed AI glitch into objects and become unresponsive or simply get stuck and start running in a spot which allowed me to metagame kinda a few situations and exploit a bugged AI to my advantage but even this I have only seen maybe three times in my time playing.
