If you have played the previous one, black flag... well this is almost the same. A lot of recuperation of what was in black flag. I found it a tad boring in that regard. The only thing I really liked was that assassins were hidden at places and could attack you. This gave some element of surprise. So, just an average remake of black flag. If you liked black flag this may be ok. So I recommend it but not fully.
