Long story short this kind of standalone Assassins Creed gives you a whole new perspective among the storyline and the other games in the series, as you get to play as an Assassin gone rogue and joining the Templars side, thats a fair change and something innovative I guess, its good to see both sides and what each faction stands for. I personally loved this one as it keeps the game style and control layout of AC Black Flag one of my personal favs. I would totally recommend this one.
