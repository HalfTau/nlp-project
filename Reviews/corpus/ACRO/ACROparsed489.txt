Ubisoft gets some bad press for making yearly sequels, but Im not sure why.  Ive liked almost every game in the series and with the exception of AC3 theyve essentially found ways to make minute improvements each time.  In Rogue, we bring back some of the multiflavored bombs of revelation and add stealth enemies while removing most of the frustrating getting spotted loses you the mission stealth sections.  In addition, we have an interesting main character with clear goals, unlike Edward in the previous installment.All in all, a great experience.
