Firstly, Ill start off with this I LOVE the modern day aspect of this game. If we didnt have the First Civ and current day Animus Technology in game, I think this game would lack relevance to the current day player, and wed feel like we were just playing a historical Kill Em game.This game took me from start to finish 17 hours, including some moderate grinding. For comparison, Ive played through Assassins Creed 2 3 total times on Steam not including xbox before PC Master Race, and full completion took 20 hours each time. Game time spent, Im very happy, because I got it on sale for 9.99, the only time you should really buy this game, IMO. At full price, you dont get anywhere near as good value.The sailing was mostly the same as AC4, no super noticeable changes. The parkour/free running was mostly the same as AC4, felt good. The actual map exploration I ended up doing was next to none. AC4 revealed the map in way better time, and provided much better incentive to easily explore areas. There are whole areas of New York, for example, that I havent even set foot in, and if story had even taken us through it once, I would have likely cleared it, or at least synchronized in that area.TLDR Game was good, but dont buy it at full price. Comparable to other games, big WOW moment at the end when you see the connection to AC3 I wrote that obscurely on purpose, to avoid spoilers.
