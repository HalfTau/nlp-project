My first AC game for PC, graphics are better than the PS3 and controls are much easier to use. Gameplay is the same as blackflag but you get multiple types of ocean / river areas to play in so it doesnt feel too similiar. The story is definitly a step apart from the previous AC installments. As the games approach the modern world and technology improves perhapse will see a AC set in WW1 or 2 in the future perhapse a game outside of the Animus Modern world.
