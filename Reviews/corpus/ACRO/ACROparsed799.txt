In terms of gameplay, its a ripoff of ACIV, srsly, and ACIII. But some activities are from the perspective of a Templar, which is refreshing.In terms of plotline, also refreshing, makes you feel sorry for Shay, the plotline is original and good, and do some justice to ACU which was released the same day.In terms of graphics, think of this as, a combination of ACIII graphics with ACIV gameplay.
