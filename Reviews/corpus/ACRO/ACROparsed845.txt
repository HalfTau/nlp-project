Id say better then unity. Thisis pretty good. Black flag ship and fighting mechanics with a better story. U ing destroy the whole asassin order all by yourself. You also adewale from black flag and work with Kenways son whose a templar. AND you kill Arnos father from unity. I tried to shoot arno but the game wouldnt let me. Just add some more memes. EDIT I forgot to write that the parts when your in the abstergo entertainmet building in first person is the ing dumbest feature posiible i ing despise it but overall the game is ok
