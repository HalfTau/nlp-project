This game is amazing  As Black Flag is generally lauded as the best in the series, this game is basically a reskinned version with some added mechanics and a new story. My only real complaint is the horrendous amount of busybody filler in the form of an obnoxious amount of collectibles this should be expected from any assassins creed/ ubisoft game by now, but still i wish they would tone it down a bit seeing as i do enjoy 100 completing games like this, and I dont like spending 20 damn hours sailing around to find grab outofthe way chests and the stupid glitch things or whatever.Still, dont let that deter you from a fantastic game. I think, with the twist of the story and whatnot, that I enjoyed this more than I did AC4.
