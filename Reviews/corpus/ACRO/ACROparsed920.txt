What on earth has gaming come to?by holding wshift i can essentially traverse ANYthing whatsoever with no single bit of effort on my part other than staring at a few animations. There is absolutely zero skill involved in getting around anymore, the combat requires a tiny bit of timing but thats essentially it.Why on earth this series still pretends to have stealth elements to it is entirely beyond me seeing as the mechanics for that are broken or useless since a few stabs to the face to the job just as well as spending 5 minutes of coutious timing and planning.The characters are dreadful. Nothing special, nothing interesting, i have honestly not a clue in whos mind this looked like a good game.But then again i should have listened when my ubi senses were tingling.... its the same garbage ubisoft throws out since years now and it only gets worse.AND THEN COME THE BUGS.Game crashes, freezes, guards turning into formless pixel monstrosities and fly directionless through the entire screen over and over again.TLDRShallow, bland, and if you have more braincapacity than a potatoe, utterly boring.Screw ubisoft and screw that moneygrubbing attitude that ruins good game series.4/10 at max.
