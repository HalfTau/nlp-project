After nailing the formula in Black Flag, its a wonder why they went back to the failings of ACIII in this edition. Whiny main character? check. Base/Ship not tied to story progression? check. Fast Travel your way through the main storyline? check. No point having an open world at all? check. Linear styory and assiniation missions with almost no tactical thought required? oh hell yes check. Now with added terrible voice acting.I mean, it must be endured because of its premise. But in terms of its execution its only slightly better than ACIII because it uses assets and features from Black Flag.One which must be endured.
