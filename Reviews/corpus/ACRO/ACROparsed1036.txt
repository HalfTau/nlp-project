If you were a fan of AC4 Black Flag, then you will love the hell out of this game. It is definitely more challenging in some areas ship battles are more fast paced, and the Legendary Ships are indeed epic, and the story is basically a direct continuation between AC3 and AC4 for expanding the lore.Im extremely disappointed that Ubisoft decided to pour all their marketing and attention into Unity, which was a steaming hot mess of bugs and gameplay problems, and pretty much snuck Rogue in under the radar. Its a great game, and well worth the addition to the Assassins Creed universe.
