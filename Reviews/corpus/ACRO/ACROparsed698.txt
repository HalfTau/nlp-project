I am just going to come right out and say it, even if its not the most popular opinion.  This is the best Assassins Creed game that has ever been released.  Having played all the other games in the series it was incredibly unique to play from the enemy factions side of the fight.  The gameplay is exactly the same as Assassins Creed 3 so if youve played that and liked it than youll like this games gameplay.  The story line of this game also connects to AC Unity which was released alongside this one.  If youre a fan of the series than get the game but it isnt a good place to start with it.
