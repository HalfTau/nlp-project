I think that the assassins creed games are good but the assassins creed rouge was the best that I had ever played in a while. While there are more assassins creed that have been coming out recently I think that rouge was the one that Uplay had spent alot of time working on it. Im talking about the graphics are amazing and they made better story lines the gameplay is amazing with new weapons and costumes are new with new moves to kill your enmieines and new traps out like the rope dart i know that it was in the number  3 and 4 but with the rope darts in rouge you can kill you them by you choking them on a branch and by taking you can fall off the branch and leave them hanging with the dart still on the by hanging on the tree. So if you are looking through the assassins creed series I would recomenned the Rouge out of them all.
