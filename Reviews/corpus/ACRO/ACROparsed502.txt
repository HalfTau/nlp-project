this is the first assassins creed i played in the series, was really excited since i heard good things about Assassins creed games but now after playing im hooked and i think im in love. Apparantly people say this isnt the best game sof the series so obviously you know assassins creed going to make money on meUnity is next.Was not too crazy about the idea of pirates ships and battles on sea but it grew on me,Im a person who love stealth games and sometimes stealth can become sickening and you just wanna burst in guns ablazing and since stealth isnt your only option in missionsif your not looking to score 100 syncronization, you can burst in sword swinging with guns on your waist make the experience even betterso for my firsr assassins creed games ill say 9/10. Losing that 1 score because of the ship battles.
