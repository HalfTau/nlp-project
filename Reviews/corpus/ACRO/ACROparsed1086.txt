I will break this review into two parts, a short pros and cons list for those who dont want an in depth review and then go into more depth for those who would like one.ProsPlay as a TemplarSailing/Ship fighting is itegral to thr plot as in AC 34Haytham Kenway is backThe length is around that of AC3ConsSome of the side quests are tedious with no real pay off unless you play the game multiple timesthe unlockable quest armors have no noticeable extra effectsone of the legendary ship battles in virtually impossible without precision timingReviewAssassins Creed rouge is, at the time of writing this review, the conclusion of the American Trilogy, consisting of AC4, AC Rogue and AC4. Chronologically, the bulk takes place between AC4 and AC3, bridging the gap between the two.Gameplay and story wise it takes the best of both games and blends them together to create something that fans of either game can enjoy, whether its the open world sailing and piracy of AC4 or the dark colonial story of AC3.This time, however, you play as a templar, giving you an up close and personal look at their operations, ideology, and methods. Portraying them as keepers of the piece and status quo in the rather anarchic world of the fledgling American colonies. In this way it portrays them in a new and sympathetic light as opposed to the Saturday morning cartoon villain treatment they got in the Ezio Trilogy, or the manipulative puppet master treatment they got in virtually every other game in the series.In addition Familiar faces return as new allies and enemies including Haytham, Achilles, and Adewale.This being said there are a few drawbacks to AC Rogue. The Collection quests are a bit of a frustration as the items you get for competing them are only marginally better or not unlockable until after the main story has been completed. In addition, the hardest legendary ship battle requires precision timing that some may not be able to achieve with keyboard and mouse controls.Overall, Assassins Creed Rogue is a great game with only a few minor drawbacks that provides a fresh and sympathetic look at the series traditional villains the Templars.
