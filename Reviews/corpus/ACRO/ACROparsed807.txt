First thing i wanna say, great game. I also wanna say if you played AC black flag try not to compare them. Yes it plays like AC VI but there is where the simmularity ends. First, Black flag is set in the early 18th century at the hay days of priates, Rogue in the mid 18th century at the time of the 7 year war. A total diffrent backdrop. My advice is if you wanna play  as a pirate, where al are friend or foe, play Black flag. if you wanna sail under the Engilsh flag as a more civilised induvidial, play rogue. although there is much more to it then that, goes for both games. All and all, good game, good story and alot of fun sailing.
