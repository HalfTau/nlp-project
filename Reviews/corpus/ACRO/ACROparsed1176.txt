Lets start with probably the most important thing This is for all intents and purposes an amalgamation of past AC games. It uses the sailing mechanics of Black Flag with some of the places, characters and climbing of AC3. That said, it is perhaps the best parts of each of them.The only problem was that it was too short, only 6 sequences. It felt much more like a placeholder or an explanation of the intervening years, than a full entry. Before I knew it, I had already accidentally finished most of the side missions and made it through the story.The main character is interesting though and its clear why he does the things he does, but the problem isnt with Shay. You never have to ask why he turns against the Assassins, but you will wonder why the Brotherhood is doing what it is that makes him leave. And the Templars dont have any better motivation in their grand plan other than just combating the efforts of the Assassins.The modern day storyline is similar to Black Flag in that you play as another nameless, faceless Abstergo Entertainment employee who gets to go around providing IT support for coworkers while theyre away from their desks. Every now and then youre pulled back to modern day to run an errand and find some misplaced iPads and then you get to go back to Shay. Sadly, Abstergo has gotten better at covering up their dirty laundry and the only information you get from hacking computers is about the people youre working with and the upcoming projects that Abstergo/Ubisoft have in the works. Maybe some day theyll actually make good on their teasing for a fullfledged Assassins Creed entry set in China or Japan or India.
