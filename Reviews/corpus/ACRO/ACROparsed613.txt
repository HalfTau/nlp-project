AC Rogue is much like AC Black Flag 2.0  except the main story is far shorter, and all the sidequesting is ultimately pointless unless you want to upgrade your ship. However you dont need that many upgrades to beat the main storyline.Still, the story is decent and we get to see the Templars and Assassins from the other side. You also see more of the setup to AC III.Should you get this? I would say so if you like the Assassins Creed series, enjoyed Black Flag but want more piratesimulator or love getting lots of collectables.Dont get this if youre expecting a big thirilling main story, or if you didnt like AC Black Flag.
