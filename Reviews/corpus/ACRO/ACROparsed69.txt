You are Shay Patrick Cormac, a colonial Irishman trying to find his place in the war between the Assassins and Templars. Proving to be a skillful Assassin, Shay must overcome his habits and doubts in order to become the Assassin he always wanted to be. However, his doubts still haunt him, often having disputes with fellow Assassins and his Mentors guidance and judgement. He wanted to fight for humanitys freewill, but feels that the Brotherhood has been distracted by the race for the pieces of Eden. When Shay embarked on a mission to retrieve a piece of Eden, he mistakenly mishandles the artifact triggering a devastating natural disaster that leaves thousands of innocents dead. Shay blames those who sent him in the first place, and tries to convince his Mentor that this pursuit for more artifacts would only doom more to die. However, his words fall ignored, leaving Shay no choice but to betray those he once loved in order to stop them from repeating his mistake. He no longer is an Assassin, but an AssassinHunter, a Templar.I dont care if fans consider this AC game nothing more than AC Black Flag 2.0, or that this is the shortest AC game. It is definitely one of the most unique and compelling AC story in this franchise. You finally get to play as a Templar until the story ends. Really drawing out that nothing is black and white in the AC series. There are Templar agents that have noble intentions and there are Assassins who are ruthless and corrupt. The story sets in the Ohio River Valley and the North Atlantic during the French and Indian War and covers the events between AC BF and AC III. Yes, the gameplay and graphics are very identical with Black Flag, there are few new gadgets and a tweaked economy system that still can give Rogue its own identity.There are familiar faces that are welcoming, such as Achilles, Adewale, and Haytham Kenway, and the story gives off rather a very engaging experience. Definitely not one that a fan of this series should pass. I enjoyed it very much.
