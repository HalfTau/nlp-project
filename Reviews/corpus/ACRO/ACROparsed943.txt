This game is an exact copy of the AC Black Flag in every way. And its not a bad thing if you really enjoy sea battles, upgrading a ship and jumping from island to island.There are 2 sea zones with islands and one zone of land New York.I always like the citypart in Assassins Creed games. Maybe thats why I didnt enjoy the exploration of islands, because there are many of those and there is nothing to do there looting few chests, some collectibles and some random wild animals for skin hunting. The sea battles are always the same and they didnt improve those since the Black Flag, so there is literally nothing new to make it feel worth your time.Apart from that, the story is quite unique. For the first time you will experience the story from a Templar perspective and there will be some nice story correlations with other AC games. I really liked the ending.
