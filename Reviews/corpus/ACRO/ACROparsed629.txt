This game has a really good story, probably the best since the Ezio trilogy. The Graphics are kinda  because it was made for lastgen consoles without enhancements on the PC version. But in my opinion everything looks good except the hair textures on the civilians, that looks awful. This game is like a puzzle to connect blackflag and III together and it gives you a better understanding from a templar perspective.
