So now that the PC version of AC Rogue has been out and I have completed it I advise everyone to skip ever playing AC unity and play this instead. Even if it sometimes feels like it plays like AC Black flag 1.5! It has all the good bits of Black Flag with extra stuff and a new well put together story line.Once again it has the same interface with the future that Black Flag had. Where you are a non seen, non talking minion who goes round hacking and doing shenanigans before going back to the game of the past. I kind of like that style. It makes you feel like the modern protagonist is actually you.The game is fun and the new character is kind of cool, especially once he leaves the Assassins. In my opinion he was a bit of aas an assassin. As a Templar he is awesome though, I found I liked the character even though I still dislike the Templars. The actual past story I feel flows together well, and is well written. I was a bit sceptical of his leaving the Assassins but it fits in at the end. Also it is nice to see things from the Templars eyes. It adds a perspective that is nice. I am not spoiling the game by telling you that this is the story of a renegade Assassin.The best bit is when it fills in story blanks from other AC games in my opinion. This game has a few of those. Also this game nicely ties things together. The history of the world and the conflict of the Assassins versus the Templars interlink. I highly recommend this game.
