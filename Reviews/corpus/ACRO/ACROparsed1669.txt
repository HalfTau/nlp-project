Game would be better if the developers would actually show the character more  e.g. save guy being hanged, game puts you in a fight vs 4 enemies underneath the gallows without you being able to see anything. In barfights, byestanders block meaning you cant even get close enough to the enemy to hurt them. In the first bossfight, the game shows the corner of the room making counters impossible.Basically, a shorter and less good Black Flag for people who desperately want more Black Flag
