Fairly below average as far as AC games go, combat was satisfying at times and buggy/inconsistent at others, its pretty much like black flag in many ways but without the pirate charm. You can still do the same ship battles, legendary ship encounters, fort raids etc. that you could in AC BF, but why do that here when you could just play black flag?The story was average, Shays motivation for going rouge is understandable but the characters are so forgettable and boring that none of the emotional moments really hold much weight if any at all. Shay himself is not quite Ezio but at the same time  hes not a Connor either. If I had to describe him in one word, Id probably say Irish, because theres not much more to him than that.I also found it dumb that instead of the developers coming up with a creative way of getting the player on the templars side  they just make the assassins extremely unlikeable instead, so much for prompting you to question who the bad guys really are, just make the assassins into thugs its much easier that way.Who cares really Im just writing this so I can get that Steam community badge. Thank you if you even bothered reading this.
