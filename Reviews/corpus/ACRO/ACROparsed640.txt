Do you like Assassins Creed? Do you want to play AC3/AC4 again, but with a different plot? Play this. Recently, AC has made people worried about glitchy, unplayable games. This is one of the most polished games in the series.Whats new in this version You play as a Templar for most of the game, so you have to dodge assassins for the last third of the game. That means youll bewalking around and an assassin will jump out of a bush, or off a roof, and theyll do pretty heavy damage if they hit. There are also sidequests to protect people who are getting targeted by a bunch of assasins. Both of these new things are fun, and appreciatied. They also made all of the shiny collectibles easier to get. There were very very few collectibles that were frustrating to get, and I think I 100 all of the shiny things.But it still has some of the old problems You also still have the overpowered blow gun from AC3, but now its an air gun. But now you have a grenade launcher to go with it. Shrapnel grenades, sleep grenades, beserk grenades. I didnt enjoy this. AC has had a problem where it acts like a stealth game, but it doesnt always play like one. This has gotten worse as the series as progressed. If you are mediocre at brawlers, you can fight off about as many enemies as they can throw at you. There arent a lot of rewards for actually sneaking, or for avoiding killing anyone. OH, and the end credits are STILL unskippable.
