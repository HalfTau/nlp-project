I had never played this series before so dont know how this game is compared to others in the series.  But I think I should get my money back.  Parkour seemed fun at first, but it doesnt really rely on the player skills. Rather, the game does the job for you.  Also, the character movement maybe this is a problem for the PC version, I dont know is far from smooth/natural compared to other PC games Ive played  unless this series does it on purpose like some nonaction horror games do to frustrate the players. It made me feel sick looking at the movements.  I truly dont understand the hype.  To me, its one of those games that make players at any skill level feel awesome while there is nothing so challenging about it  except the unnatural movements/commands.  I had a high expectation to begin with, perhaps.  But I was truly disappointed.
