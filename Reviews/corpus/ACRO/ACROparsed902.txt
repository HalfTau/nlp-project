Ive played every Assassins Creed game since the first, and enjoying Assassins Creed 4, I decided to pick this one up.Its very similar to 4, first off. If you liked the sailing and piracy of 4, its practically the same in Rogue. However, there is substantially less content in this game than the last few Assassins creed games, and apart from some minor gameplay changes and additions, its just more of what made Assassins Creed 4 tedious. The endless collectathon of chests and Animus fragments continues, although you arent required to do this for anything but 100 completion.This game is also very short, the main story is much shorter than the other Assassins creed games in recent memory. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing it took me about 910 hours to complete the main story, and thats a leisurely pace. By comparision, Assassins creed 4 took me about 20 hours to finish, and it really started to drag on at some points.Story spoilerNothing of any interest happens in the main story Shay doesnt really have an arc. No significant developments take place, really all Shay does is set up other Assassins Creed games, namely 3 and Unity. The characters are not engaging, although they dont get any screentime anyway.This game is really not worth your money. Pick it up if its 10 bucks or something if you REALLY liked saling around collecting chests, and cant get enough of boring stories.The scenery was nice though.
