I dont care what others say about this game or whether they dislike Uplay or not...Im just here for the freaking game and Im totally in love with it! Cant believe I played 8hrs in 1 day with this game! The story is what that really captures me and it would to you if you are a true Assassins Creed series fan like I am. The story lies between AC3 and Unity and you will be in for a treat I promise
