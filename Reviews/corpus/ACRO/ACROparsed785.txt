Liked Black Flag? Wanna more of it? Good grab this one you wont regret.Are you new to the franchise? Them give a try to Black Flag first, this game has less content them it and all in all serve as a complement to Unity Ubisoft shouldnt ahve release both on same yer that was complete retard, this game could be as good as Black Flag but since they were working on both Unity and Rogue at the same time to release them on same year it kinda fell rushed so I would recommend you to get Black Flag first them get Rogue if you liked it, but all in all its a good game or passable if not.
