Assassins Creed has always been an interesting beast. On one hand, it has a tendency to be INCREDIBLY inconsistent, as evidenced by the bungled release of Unity. Yet, for some reason, I continue to come back to it. Maybe its because Im a history buff, and few casual fans of this series actually appreciate how many of the depicted ingame events actually happened. For example SPOILERS in the opening sequence of this game you find yourself in Lisbon in 1755, site of one of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history.I sank haha, because pirates a HUGE amount of time in ACIV. Im new to PC gaming, so I played on console, but I would guess I played for 60 hours total. It had an awesome setting, good protagonist, and was brimming with stuff to do. Im reviewing this game a bit early, having currently only played for about 8 hours. Thing is, it doesnt take an AC veteran like myself long to figure out what this game is. It truly is just a redeployment of the ACIV forumla. Luckily, it was one HELL of a winning formula, and this game succeeds BECAUSE it emulates it predecessor. Based on what Ive seen you can take the number of things there was to do in ACIV and TRIPLE it. This gaming is BURSTING with stuff do. If you liked Black Flag, youll like this game all the same.
