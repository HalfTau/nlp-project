This Series of Assassins Creed, is probaly one of the best in the series! There is so much to do in this game, like when you are sailing, you could harpoon/hunt for marine animals by enetring a small boat, and hunting it down. And the graphics on this isnt bad at all, in fact if you have a good laptop or computer, you should put the graphics to high quality! the main idea and conflict of the game is a interesting idea of the game, i never get bored! I got this on the winter sale for 7.99, but it was originally 19.99, so for the price i got it for, id say it is totally worth it!
