Assassins Creed Rogue could be the best optimized game I have ever played. I wouldnt think that a laptop with an Nvidia GTX 765m and a pretty bad i7 processor could run any game from the past 5 years at max settings very well. This game proved me wrong 1080p 4050fps on max settings! I also played through the story before on xBox 360 and it is great! I dont have DLC so I cant tell you about that, but this is a great game.
