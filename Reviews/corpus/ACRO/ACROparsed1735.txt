This is a some form of hybrid mutant child that AC black flag and AC3 dumped out. Then they stopped the pregnancy early and aborted a child which was called AC Rogue. Rogue had an older brother called Unity that was far more superior to rogue and had original ideas. Rogue failed to do his duty however and kids mocked him at school. Then the underdeveloped kid called Rogue grew up and went to school. All the kids around him had neutral opinions about him. They did not want to mock him but also didnt wanna make friends with him because of his mental state. Unity had become a drug addict. He was broken and his parent hated him. The parent didnt want Rogue to become independent as well so they made him a perfect kid. A kid that had the traits of both of the parents and good education. He was smart but still a bit . Rogue lived a long life shy because of his mental health but brave because of his parents.
