Great game! I love the 3 large maps that allow you to explore. There are very minor glitches with the toons interaction with the world. Ive managed to fall off buildings, where in the other AC games it prevents you... unless you hit the shift key. I also love to see a little bits of the earlier games represented. Black Flag by the ships, AC 3 with the characters that you kill in this game are your friends.
