waste of time and stole my money. great on xbox but its HORIBLE on pc. it wont even load up on my pc, all i get is my screen flickering and then when i try again to load the game i get a game already running notifacation and NO GAME. this was AFTER struggling with Uplay for two hours trying to deal with an error. NOT worth it and im furious this game was made public with such an annoying glitch. and on top of it, I CANT CONTACT SUPPORT!!!! i have to create an account to even try to talk to them. im sick of jumping through hoops. great game on console, its incredibly fun and i love sailing and singing the shanties as im a member of the sca, but this is absolute garbage and i shouldnt have to strugle and get frusterated with somthing that should be relaxing.in summaryget on console. avoid the pc version.
