Lets Review Assassins Creed Rogue!Like the title says, you join the adventure of Shay Cormac, one of the Assassins that turns on them, siding with the Templars, and if you are aware of the Assassins/Templars War, this is a big deal. Shows you the other side, the Templar side while still having that lifeline to the Assassins. A storyline that tells you a different side of the same coin, well written and well executed in this game. Brings back the open world and naval warfare that made this Franchise great. Serves as a stepping stone to Assassins creed 3 and a connection to Assassins Creed Unity. Beautiful graphics like always, and yet some improvements. Big variety of activities,  environments and mission types. Some graphical glitches but nothing thats game breaking. Uplay connection that sometimes interferes with the game, but its a rare ocasion  thank god . Lack of Multiplayer. Assassins Creed Rogue, lets you experience the other side, the side youve fought so many times, introducing new mechanics blended with old ones. Its a good game, but can at sometimes feel like an extension of Black Flag, but if you enjoyed that one, youll enjoy this one without a doubt. I give it a 7.2 out of 10.Enjoy Guys and Girls, and if this review helped you in any way please leave me a Thumbs up, i would appreciate it immensely.
