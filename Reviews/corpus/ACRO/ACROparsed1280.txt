I hope the creator will see this review i write. why do you need to put all those bloody stalker in this game? they are irritating and really WAY TOO MUCH. let me give a an example. i just wanted to do some shopping due to your idea of not putting enough shop in this game i went down to nyc, and guess what? i was stalk by a bunch of stalker ! what for? ALL i just wanted WAS to buy a stupid item and they just come out of no where and attack me. so what even if i kill them? they will come even more! its feel like a copy and paste lazy game play please stop all these stalker nonsense! one or two is ok but look at that! there are abunch of army my god! the best part is when i finally reached the door of the shop, your stalking  attacked me, so i counter and kill her, then guess what! all the soldiers got alerted! ITS DAMN BLOODY STUPID! WHY CANT I JUST GO TO THE SHOP AND BUY THINGS! I PAID GOOD MONEY TO GO TO YOUR STUPID SHOP TO BUY ITEM WHY YOU SEND SO MANY DAMN PERVERT STALKERS AND ARMY TOME!? I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED!
