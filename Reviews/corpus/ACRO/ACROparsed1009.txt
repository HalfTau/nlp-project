TL,DR Fun pirate game, but lacking amount of missions and things to do compared to Unity and SyndicateThis is fun, acrobatic, and stealthy, like other Assassins Creed games, but also quite empty. The only other AC Ive played was Unity on my PS4 after they fixed all the bugs and I LOVED it. Sure, the main story wasnt remotely good, but there were so many other missions to do in Unity that it made up for all of that.While Rogue was released at the same time, it definitely feels like a step back, because of the lack of things to do. There arent tons of missions on the map that you can do, its the main quest and then some occasional others... so for people who want a huge environment to flip around in, kill people, do some detective work, etc, Id rather recommend Unity or Syndicate. I know Ill definitely be buying Syndicate.BUT Rogue redeems itself with the ships! Pirating is so much more fun and so much harder than the general runningandflippingandstabbing.
