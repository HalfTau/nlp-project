This really is a good Assassins Creed game, if you buy this you will be in for alot of surprises especially about certain characters which will be brought up! also the Versailles finale is great!There are new weapons and parcour is pretty good if you ask me. Even thought Shay has the same animations as Edward which is kind of a dissapointment but the story and setting makes up for it.Really, buy this game.
