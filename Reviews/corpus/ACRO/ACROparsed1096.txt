So from the trailers and reviews I was expecting a game filled with stealthing, quick combat, some sea battle, and a cool story. Yes, thats what I was lead to while being persuaded to buy a game that was on sale. After waiting some time for the game to download, and when finished I was ready to play the game. Adjusting my seat in front of my setup, slipping on my headset, activating the product on Uplay, I then launch it. The usual stuff Multicultural influances, staff, historical stuff, blah blah. Then Ubisoft logo, Abstergo Industries, then the game title logo comes up Assassins Creed Rogue, lastly it shifts to the title screen with the caption of Press a key.This is where the magic happens. I press Enter, strangely nothing happens. Press Space bar, Nothing. I press W, nope. A, S ,D , Shift, Ctrl, Left mouse, Right mouse, Nothing happens. It then goes back to showing the usual AC game start up stuff, and pressing keys skip through the individual bits. I was appalled to what was happening and escaped thanks to the magic of AltF4. I launched the game again to see if I could get past the Title Screen, and to disappointment I could not. Then what I soon concluded was, I bought. I looked online to see if others had this version of the game and found that only a few others had this.As far as gameplay goes, the usual keys get you through most of the logo stuff, theres not much of a story, the color palette of what there is consists mostly of blue and white. I suppose Ubisoft intended there to be a game here and all I got was this, 11.99 and 8.2 GB for a Start up simulator.
