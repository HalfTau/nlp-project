I beat this game a little while back. I enjoyed the idea of playing as an Assassin turned Templar and experiencing more of that Haytham Kenway storyline before Connors and Arnos story began.For the character, Shay, he is, in my opinion, one of my favorite characters in Assassins Creed ever only behind Haytham and Ezio and one character that Id be willing to play again.Despite that it plays out like Black Flag with the ship, I give this game a 9.4/10.
