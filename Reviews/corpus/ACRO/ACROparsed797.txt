This game is alright. But the main problem I have with this game is that, whenever you enter a battle side mission you cant leave it, even though you try to load out of this battle. I just entered a legendary fight and its extremely stupid to even let this happen. I was against 2 lvl 75s and 5 more other ships, while I had 4 friendly ships on my team which leveled between 24. This battle is impossible to win so I do not understand why you can forfeit!!??This game is alright, but the  company Ubisoft have a lot of work to do.
