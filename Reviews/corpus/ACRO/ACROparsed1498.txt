Assassins Creed Rogue, a short but juicy storyline that tells a story of Shay Cormac and a random guy at Abstergo.  You betray your creed because they do not realize how powerful the artifacts of the Ones That Came Before are and are continually investigating on precursor sites and destroying cities. This game shows that not all Templars especially Haytham and Shay are bad guys and not all Assasins are good guys. Oh yeah, and the guy at Abstergo. You play as him in first person and is being bossed around by a few people because youre a numbskull and you get lost around the place often. You only play as him when you need to fix Abstergo servers to unlock the other parts of Shays story. Everytime you pop out of Shays story just to fix servers, try... not to smash your screen ok? Like I said, this game is short but amazing. It only took me 12 hours to finish the story and not the side quests.
