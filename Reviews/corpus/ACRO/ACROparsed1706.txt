Unusual story for AC series. We can now see the whole story from templars side.Great sandbox gameplay which was slightly modified since AC4.Seven years war is a very interesting history period.One of the best PC ports. Even better than AC4.The whole bunch of the new gadgets including puckle guns,grenade launcher,air rifle,burning oil.Making money is much easier now,thanks to rebuilding incomes.Modern part of the game is much interesting now.Sometimes graphics are great,but sometimes its looking horrible.Maybe its because game was creating for X360PS3.AI is still horrible.Sometimes parkour gives me surprises.Character jumps in wrong directions and other stuff. Looking a bit old after Unity.You are the templar now,but gameplay doesnt changes too much.I dont like the new eagle vision at all.This whispers makes me mad.Too short,comparing to other AC games.Price is still the same.I recommend this game,but only for AC fans. Its expanding AC3 and AC4 stories. So it will be a great game,but for fans only. Still, very controversial game.
