I liked the story and the main character. This takes place after AC4 and before AC3  AC3 happens after 4. This is VERY similar to AC4. You get an air rifle that shoots darts and small grenades. Some missions have you stop assassins instead of just killing someone which is nice. Did I mention this is similar to AC4? They added the multiplayer system to the game, which means that some npcs will hide and do huge damage to you if they catch you. Its ing annoying when they get you while your busy doing something else. Im REALLY glad that im almost done playing in the same environments in 3 games. All the locations look the same in this and AC3 and 4. Next is Unity which is in Paris. EDIT Dont bother playing any Assassin Creed games on pc ever. Ubisoft is leaving pc users in the dust.Like the other Assassin creed games, there are times when it can get very frustrating. You often will just want to kill people instead of being stealthy. You have to go after your friends who you betrayed, but catching them is so ridiculous and difficult that you actually want to kill them. They run through groups of guards who can outrun you and stop you, and they drop poison gas bombs and randomly turn around to shoot you, which cant be dodged. And if you are out of bullets you are screwed. I will often have to restart a chase because I ran into something like a chair  and tables which you cant climb over. Sometimes when you are climbing to get away the climbing system screws up and you suddenly cant grab something you clearly should. As Im typing this Im waiting for the 30 min long credits that you cant skip. This is also kinda like AC4.
