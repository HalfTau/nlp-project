Ive been a lover of the Assassins Creed franchise for a while. Each game has such a unique story and the details graphics, etc get significantly better each time. Ill be honest Black Flag was a little tough for me to get through but it was the story line that sucked me in, and thats what Rogue did for me as well. The story of Shay and his transformation from Assassin to Assassin hunter had me hooked and it almost made me question the previous games I played as to whether or not I was actually doing good...or bad through the eyes of an assassin.As everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so am I. I loved Rogue and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
