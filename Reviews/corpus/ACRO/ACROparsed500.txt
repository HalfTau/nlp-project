Good 3/4. This game is so well done, everything looks good, runs great and the controls are the best Ive seen in a 3rd person game. Just the amount of polish that has gone into things like facial animation, level design and the core platforming was staggering to me. You can seamlessly switch between keyboard/mouse and joypad at any time.Clearly the developers are some of the best in the business. Unfortunately I cant give it 4/4 because I get bored and quit often. The story is just too slow.
