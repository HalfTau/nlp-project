Rogue is a good game, probably one of my favourite AC games, its underrated and overlooked by many. The only problem, and this is a big problem, is if you have played AC4 Black Flag and completed it prior to playing Rogue, you will most likely find Rogue dull, repetitive and just a slightly newer and transfromed black flag. Thats not to say you wont enjoy it, but you will wish it was a little more different and unique.
