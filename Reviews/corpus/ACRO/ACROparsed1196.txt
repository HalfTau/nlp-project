This game, while quite short in the story sequences, has one of the best storylines of the recent releases in the series. The best part of the writing in this game is how you are slowly turned into a templar through slowly seeing the assassins as a criminal entity. Gameplay is mostly the same as Black Flag, with some slightly new weapons and mechanics. Overall a good game to get on sale.
