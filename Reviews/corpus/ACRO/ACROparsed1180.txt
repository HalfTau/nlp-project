Huge map, short game. Very short. 14 hours it at when i finshed, and 3 of which i idled. I even did plenty side stuff like take on the 4 legendary battle ships. check my screenshots for how little the map you actually use. I think the map was even copied directly from ac black flag. Worth it if the game is on sale.
