Shays RebellionThis really shouldve been a DLC to Assassins Creed 4. Nothing changes its the same but the templars view of things. Which I would argue is better but thats left to oppinion. The Story is a bit better than 4, But is very short. At the end of the day you know what happens in Asssasins Creed 3 so Shays part in the series amounts to  all. So if your pirate boner is left lustin fo more then you might want to buy this game. Otherwise I would sudgest Syndicate. At least there is a train in that one.M
