This is a surprisingly really good game. It brought similar mechanics from AC Black Flag such as the naval combat and game engine thank god its not Unitys engine. Ubisoft seems to have learned their lesson from AC Unity and made Rogue actually optimized with very minimal bugs. If you want more of Black Flags gameplay, but a totally different setting/climate, Im pretty sure youll enjoy this game.
