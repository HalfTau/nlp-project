This game is pretty much the same thing that AC has put out a million times before. I didnt play Black Flag, but Im pretty sure that by playing this game I already did. Its an AC game, it runs pretty well, its not going to blow anyones mind. The game looks like its a lot older than it actually is. Buy it if you havent played the othe ship based AC games, if you have I would guess you wont find anything new in this one.
