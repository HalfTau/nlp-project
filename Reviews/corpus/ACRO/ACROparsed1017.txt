A very good game.Much better than Unity.Using the same engine of ACIVBlackFlag.Templars are so rich, you dont need to worry about money somehowI like the counterassassins styleStoryline not very long, but filled the blank between ACIII and ACIV and also told us whos the real murderer of Arnos father. Arno is the hero of ACunity. LOL, Arno killed so many people for revenge. He surely didnt know anything.I bought both ACunity and this on sale, roughly 25 in total. Well ACUnity is not matching the price and its 50GB space, while ACrouge is definitely beyond the price and the space, 10GB.An 8/10 if you have played ACIV BlackFlag, and a 10/10 if you havent.
