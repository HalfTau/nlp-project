This game is honestly so underrated. I was more excited for this game than i was for Unity back when they were both first announced, mainly because you could play as a Templar, and who DOESNT want that? I was expecting some badass hunter turned hunted gameplay, outwitting your opponent, and the fall of the Assassin order prior to AC3. What I wasnt expecting was a story that made you really understand that theres heroes on both sides. And while I wont spoil anything, the ending of the game really shows the morally gray part of the war that very few Creed games did before. Shay is very much human, with personality and goals. He didnt want to become an Assassin Hunter, but he was forced to, and while he doesnt enjoy it, he is willing to do what is necessary. It has fun gameplay, although not much has changed since Black Flag with a few exceptions to make way for the fact that you have better gear and are fighting stronger enemies.
