Too similar to Black Flag and AC3 i dont talk about the idea of being some kind of pirate, i mean the structure of the missions. For me its also too easy.. but apart that, this games has the same graphic engine of Black Flag but its so well optimized that the game will ask for less resources and have better graphics.. Some glitches here and there.. but the ship fights are always gorgeous and.. am i the only one who already liked the Templars? Anyway, not regretted taking it even for a second!
