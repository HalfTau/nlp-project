Honestly after the monster that was Unity I promised myself I was never going to buy another AC game, I am glad I changed my mind based on the reviews of others and due to the summer sale, this game is fantastic and if you enjoyed black flag you will love this game, runs well and is well optimized, makes Unity look like a joke, expanded naval combat abilities and upgrades, many many sidequests and unlockable outfits with the dlc, overall a very good addition to the series I hope Syndicate comes out just as well but I will still be waiting to see how it is received before deciding if I will or not.
