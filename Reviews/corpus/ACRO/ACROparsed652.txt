This is a must play game for any AC fan! really like the game, if you every played black flag  its feel like the same game, just shorter or in this game i skipped most of the unimportant island and do mostly the main storyanyway very nice game as the other AC. i got it in the bundle pack come with black flag, unity and syndicatethis game is ends where unity start so its fun to play them by the order unity have much better engine with a new problem of its own but..  7/10  too short, but very fun to play
