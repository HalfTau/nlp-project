This game is quickly becoming my favourite Assassinss Creed game to date, a true hidden gem in the series, Although shorter than your average AC game, the gameplay more than makes up for this. Think of this game as more of a Black Flag 2.0 with improved ship combat and great addtions to on foot content. This game did the impossible and made the out of amimus sections actually enjoyable with exploring the depths of Abstergo Entertainment collecting lore about the series and characters in it. Overall this game is definatly worth a play, a fantastic budget price AC game.
