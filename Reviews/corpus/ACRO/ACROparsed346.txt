Now that I finished the story, I can say that it was worth playing. I was a little sceptical about the quality of this game knowing that it was made just to please last gen fans that couldnt play Unity. But I was pleasantly suprised at how good the story was for a game with such little time invested in creating it. It was very cool to see how this game played into the Unity storyline. My only issue with this game with the length. As much as I apperciate Ubisoft for considering last gen, for the price its almost not entirely worth it. This game on sale would be great though. Unless you have played Unity, may change how much you enjoy Rouge in my opinon. But I am also very bias towards this game being a huge fan of the AC series and to me, at the end of the day, more content is more content and I am a happy fella. This games storyline was still enjoyable to me as a casual fan anyway, so buy it. Why not? The price....well uh....yeah good point. /
