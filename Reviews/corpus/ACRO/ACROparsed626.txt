If youre like me  you absolutely hate all of the nonanimus t you have to put up with to keep playing the protagonists story line...... its the same in this game too..... They are still going with the ABSTERGO ENTERTAINMENT or whatever front they created to distract from the fun stuff. I dont like it. I dont even like playing as the modern assassins in syndicate or any of the other AC games.That was the big negative for me with this game so far.The other  rushed intro. I know this game didnt even premier at 60 dollars, im guessing because of its Assassins creed story feel, meaning  not full game, just a different taste kind of like Star Wars Rogue One. But anyway, the intro feels super rushed. You play for five minutes and suddenly youve already got your blades, swords, and ship that can easilly take on enemy boats for now of course. I really liked black flag and I have a feeling they didnt break the mold with this game so Ill probably enjoy this one too. Just those two negatives for now.
