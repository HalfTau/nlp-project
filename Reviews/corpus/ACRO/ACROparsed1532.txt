If not the most optimized Assassins Creed game on the PC and most important of all. Its really fun!Ubisoft did a great job with this.Edit The game is also very strict when it comes to settings. Note that the only AA is FXAA and there is no PhysX. Anisotropic filtering setting returns and there are no performance issues with any of the settings if you have a midrange graphics card. There is no multiple graphics card support. No CrossFire or SLI. You wont need CrossFire or SLI to run this game smooth.
