This game makes you feel like you can trust ubisoft again, aside from the kinda short story there is nothing I can say about this game that is bad. NOTHING. Its almost too good to be a ubisoft game, but then you load it up, youre hyped, you are ready to play this game. And then outanowhere UDONTPLAY RKOS you and gives you a bigillion updates before you can even see the Ubisoft logo. FUN I love watching a buggy bar slowly load and then when it does load you have to enable all the cheap dlc youve bought, because it was on sale, and then you realise its 2 in the morning well there goes my day of lazing about playing an ACTUALLY GOOD Ubisoft game now lets go to sleep.
