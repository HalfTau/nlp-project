The Assassins Creed weve been waiting for!Personally, thought this game would have been perfect in place of 3, however that would have left some people you are supposed to kow out key players. That said you dont have to had play 3, but youll recognize some things and people. Furthermore, this game connects details and facts from AC3, AC4, and AC Unity, its incredible.Story 8.5/10  One of the best all around naratives in AC for a while no. Believe what the description says about dark, turning back on your friends then hunting them down leaves a bit of your soul feeling dirty. Overall, it creates a wonderfully mature narative that many will enjoy.Gameplay 7/10  Give it a 7 here just because its still the same all AC that we saw from 4, just with more content. Cormack is given some new weapons and tactics but nothing revolutionary. Same old AC gameplay here, but fun none the less. Less Buggy FeelingReplayability Medium  Ok, so I love games that let you keep going on after the story itself is over like GTA5 and Fallout 3 w/ DLC, but a lot of things that you can do just dont seem to have a point to them. However, if you are a completionists, there is absolutely an unfathomable amount of content here.In total, I highly recommend this game to anyone who may have overlooked this game due to Unity, and past fans of the series, as well as new that may have some background knowledge of the game. If you are looking for just fun gameplay with lots of mechanics thrown in, this game will also be perfect for you.Hope you guys found this review helpful, and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did!
