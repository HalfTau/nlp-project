Im an Assassins Creed fan, and have most of them. My favorite is part 2 , Hated part 3s first 68 hrs of B/S.Now just going to keep this short. The control, frame rate, camera, are just great.Combat and kills are awesome as ever. Loved the cut seens.  cameos from past an current characters PC an NPC.  ties In AC3, Blackflag an Unity. I wont give any details on the story to avoid an spoilers.  If this were the XBOX 360 version i would recommend 100.However...The PC version has a crapload of gameplay problems. Major rendering issues. I put settings from ultra to low an everywhere in between an still rendering pop ins i have invisable surroundings , as well as invisable enemys all i could see was their swords. Steam/Valve gave me a full refund wich i am grateful. I just cant recommend the PC port of Rogue.
