The Enthusiasm has run out,We all know it, but dont want to admit it.the story line accounts for about 50 percent, then it comes to running around, collecting fragments, scrolls, chests, pieces of paper, your moms underwear that has flown of the line..... well not the latter, but its about as embarrasing.Few if any bugs, Ive rin into no issues. But the gameplay is just so monotonous, more so than 3, almost as much as 1.I skipped unity because of its reviews. that said this game isnt bad, its just not edge of seat, excitingly new...I think its time for an overhaul
