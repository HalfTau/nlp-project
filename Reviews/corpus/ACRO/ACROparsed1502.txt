I enjoyed this game. However, Its very short, its quite easy and the modern day bits that are in all the Assassins Creed games, are more annoying than ever, with their patronising t.Think of it as a spin off of Black Flag, A few alternate features and tiny differences. With a slightly different story.If you enjoyed Black Flag, you will most likely enjoy this game. I do however suggest waiting for steam to put this on sale. Then you can get this game at a price more accurate to how much its worth.
