Quite possibly one of my favourite games in the entire series, to be frank. The story, both of the main game and the minimal amount found in the modern segments, alone was enough to make what I spent well worth it. The game play is smooth and has little to no glitches, and while the graphics arent as nice as Unity the game still looks fantastic.The only possible complaint I could have about this game is that it wouldve been nice to have more plot for the modern day parts, and I miss having the old multiplayer around.
