AC Rogue is a bit of a mixed bag. It was realized alongside Unity, but feels much more akin to games from the last few years. Theres a sailing sandbox much like Black Flag had, now set during the 7 years War in the 1760s, the hunting and crafting mechnianc thats been there since III and the old Capture enemy outposts to claim teroritory thing from Brotherhood. So its pretty much Black Flag 1.5.Narratively its a bit more interesting, picking up from the plot thread in Freedom Crythe mysterious Templar Package, Shay Patrick Cormac, is a new assasin who slowly turns his back on them and goes to work for the Templars. The result of which is the destruction of the Colonial Brotherhood, leading into its miserable state Conner found it in III.So essentially its a bridge game. It fits in the gap between IVand Freedom Cry and III, with a story connection to Unity as well. It fits in much the same way that Revelations did for the Ezio games, in that its a little different but an awfully lot of the same. Sadly playing as a Templar is much the same as playing as an Assasin, except that every so often the Assasins will pop out of nowhere to try to murder youthough, having played as an assasin, you should have a pretty good idea where they would hide.Its a fine game and an interesting chapter in the series, but its not going to be anyones favorite AC game.
