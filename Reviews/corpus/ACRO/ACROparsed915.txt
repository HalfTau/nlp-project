I must say after the original Assassins Creed this is the next best game for me. Story wise the game is good actually you get to know about history of some of the characters from AC3 and 4, and the best part was the ending itself the intro of SPOILERS ALERT Arno. I must say i enjoyed the tower takedown from ship in this game more than AC4. I think where AC4 made it all about being a pirate this one had a good mixture if you dont like sailing just dont do it, there are hardly 3 or 4 ship missions.Edit  Hardly 8 hours of story gameplay which makes it one of the shortest campaigns D
