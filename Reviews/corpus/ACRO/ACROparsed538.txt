A refreshing look on to the Assassins Creed franchise.Ever felt like hopping the fence to see if the grass is greener on the other side?Thats what this game is about.I wont go into lore details but the game is entertaining.Lauched at the same time as Unity, wich was supposed to be the flagship game but this one turned out better.In technical terms, the game borrows alot from Black Flag, yet, it has a unique sense to it in some cases.Id say, if youre looking for a different kind of approach and view on the Assassins Creed games, give it a shot.
