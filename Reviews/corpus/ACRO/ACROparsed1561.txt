Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who has never played Black Flag and is only about 50 of the way through the game. I have played through Freedom Cry a couple times, so Im at least familiar with the ports brought over to Rogue.This is an outstanding game. The visual aesthetics of New England and the Atlantic are absolutely stunning. Especially if you have a computer that can handle the highest level of graphics. The combat is fun and engaging and the story is very interesting to follow. I can just sail around and explore random locations for hours without even touching the main storyline missions. Theres plenty to do and I havent found myself lost with what to do yet at all. Paid full price no regrets.9/10
