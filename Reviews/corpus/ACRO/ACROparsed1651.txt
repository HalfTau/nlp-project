This game is definitely a must play for any Assassins Creed fan who enjoys both its rich narrative and insanely addicting gameplay. I think its best to compare to AC Liberation. Liberation introduced a character tied to Connor Kenway in AC3, much like this game introduces a character connecting to Haytham Kenway, Adewale, and Achillies Davenport. I feel that, in terms of lore, this game holds a lot more weight than Liberation and is overall a more polished and envigorating experience. It returns to the excellent naval gameplay of AC4 whilst bringing back some favorite characters from AC3. In addition, Shay Cormac allows us to experience the Templar Order in a new light. When we got to play as Haytham Kenway in AC3 we got a glimpse at what the Order was really about and how their goals arent so different from the assassins. Shay offers this same opportunity  as players used to fighting for the assassin cause, Shay enables us to question their true motives, making for a really interesting story.This game was really overshadowed by Unity in many ways. With Unity being the bigger title of the year, Rogue was out on its own plane. As one who has finished both games, I can honestly say that Rogue is better in almost every way and its seriously underrated. I hope that this game gets more attention because people deserve to know that this game carries great weight in the AC universe and its concepts could and should be given the opportunity to return later on in other games to continue to delve into the understanding of the ideological war between Assassin and Templar.
