After writing off Assassins Creed as a repetitive series after watching most of the first game. This game singlehandedly caused a desire in me to play the whole series for two reasons. First, so I could experience this whole epic of what feels like two warring factions of the Illuminati and second, to play this again understanding all the nuances and insights the story seemed to be providing in my first playthrough.
