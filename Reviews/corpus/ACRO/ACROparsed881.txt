I liked the game overall but cannot in good conceince recommend this game. Its been out for quite some time and its still not running properly on Win 10. When I do get it to run it still will crash in uexpected areas and times. Takes 115 false starts to load the game..... Just saddens me that the DEV team has given up, and hasnt put out any patches to fix itI will also add this is for most Ubisoft games and Windows 10system specsi3GTX 960.5 TB SSD8Gig RAM
