7/10  GoodI like this game a lot...a good follow up to Black Flag featuring the epic naval combat with some improvements along the way. Interesting story with a different perspective on the conflict between Assassins and Templars.What really holds this game back is that its even buggier than most AC titles. Most of the time I was defeated in this game was due to the glitchy parkour and combat...worst Ive seen in a while. No, this game isnt broken, but it can really take you out of the experience when youre handicapped by Ubisofts typical lack of quality control.All in all, Id still recommend this game, just be prepared for some serious frustration.
