Graphics are OK from what I would expect from a game released after Black Flag. Physics were also sub par from expected, definitly worse than Black Flag, especially the boating physics which Ubi said they made better, but my opinion was worse. I have not gotten very far in the game, but it is not motivating me to go much further. So far I am being lead to several small areas, so not a very open storyline so far which is what I expect from an AC game.I may finish this game, dont know. I would have to be bored, and not have other better games calling.
