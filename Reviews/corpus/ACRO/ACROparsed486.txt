If you liked AC IV Black Flag , you will like this as well, its not as good but its a nice addition. This game is basicly mix between AC III and AC IV Black Flag.Howewer the story is much shorter and side quests are pretty much all some kind off collectibles special armor, maps, keys etc. and it gets pretty repetitive. The only original side quest is the Assasination interception.If you are AC fan I recommed it but not for a full price, grab it when it goes on sale with at least 50 discount.6.5/10
