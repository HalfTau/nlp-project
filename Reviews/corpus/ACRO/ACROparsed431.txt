Overall, Rogue is easily the best Assassins Creed game so far in terms of mechanics caveat being that Im playing the series in order and havent played Unity or further as of this writing. The blend of returning, improved, and new elements creates a game with a lot of variety and the best versions of each of the series elements so far, combined with one of the most interesting and varied worlds of the series. The story and characters are not as deep as I had hoped, but they provide a fresh take on a series some have called stagnant, and fighting Assassins is one of the biggest thrills Ive had in the series.Full review
