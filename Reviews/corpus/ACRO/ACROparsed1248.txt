This game really wowd me. Its like Assassins Creed III and IV had the perfect baby. The story is captivating, the characters are engaging, and the gameplay is so refined that its the best rendition of Assassins Creed on this Engine. The game takes around 10 hours to finish. If youre a fan of the series, this is NOT one to skip. It answers so many questions, and provides so many awesome story points! The game is so well done and is really a breath of fresh air. Not to mention, playing as a Templar is always unique. It ties ACIII for my favorite Assassins Creed game, and if I didnt love ACIIIs Native American theme so much Id probably say Rogue is the best by far. 9.5/10 from me. Play it!
