I was surprised by how well it runs, but thats to be expected since its a last gen game. The story is much better than the fourth game, as well as the characters. And there are a few new weapons and abilities as well. Would recommend if you liked Black Flag and AC3. The main theme is very nostalgic as well, mixing some AC2 songs with the AC4 songs.
