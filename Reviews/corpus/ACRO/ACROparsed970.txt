A very nice one !First of all it brings a little bit of a much needed change of perspective for a player  though it is only a very small one, it still gives this game quite a unique feel. Also the story is really nice  I found it giving a little deph to the world and characters. Finally you dont see the world presented as totally black and white  with the first being the assassins and the other  templars. We knew they had a similar goal, but a different method  now we can see that which method is better really depends on the perspective...On the other hand the game has some minuses. The worst of all  it is way too much similar to Black Flag. You almost have a feeling of playing some kind of DLC to that one rather than a wholly new game. Also  AS Rogue was first released as a console game, and with PC port you can feel that  there are moments quite a lot of them actually when the game feels a bit simplified or empty in comparison with AS 3 or AS 4 Black Flag.Personally I had a ton of fun with this one, even with its minuses. I still think that pluses outnumber the minuses in this case. So I totally recomend this one  especially if you liked Black Flag !
