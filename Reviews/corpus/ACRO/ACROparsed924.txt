My main interest in playing Rogue was to experience a story that would take the rare step of portraying the AC world from the bad guy perspective in a TIE Fighteresque manner. Though the game accomplishes this in a way that makes it at least worth seeing through, the bulk of Rogue nevertheless consists of doing side activities in a metagame that has little function narratively, though thankfully there is a point where one can ignore it to focus on completing story missions.
