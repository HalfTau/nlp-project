Not impressed, really.  The game was not properly optimized to play well, at least not with an AMD graphics card.  It crashed at least once an hour, sometimes 10 times in an hour.  The plot isnt fantastic, either.  AC4 had a very satisfying story, and I was constantly looking forward to finding out more, but Rogue just didnt have that for me.  The premise was great, and it looked like it was going to be fantastic, but they really didnt do a great job with it.  I did enjoy the new mechanics to ship warfare, but that does not justify buying the game, because all they did was adjust a few small things and add iceburgs.  If you want a solid game with a better story and exciting ship battles, stick with Black Flag.  The story in this game did not even touch half of the locations on the map, and the crafting plans for some of the upgrades call for animals I never even came across.  I ended up just buying the pelts in the store.  Whaling is exactly the same as Black Flag, except for chunks of ice that you might end up hitting.  All in all, Id give it a 3/5, simply because Black Flag was twice as good in every respect that matters.
