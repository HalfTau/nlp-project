This game is awesome, a fresh storyline being its biggest strength. The naval combat is awesome, and the litttle improvements over AC4 like new weapons or naval clashes are awesome as well. The more diverse world with an arctic and a river islands map adds an extra dimension to the sailing. All in all I think this game is a big success!
