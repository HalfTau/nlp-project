My experience on all assassin creed? When i know rogue will be using older system from Black Flag, i knew that this game will be nice, even though i prefer new parkour system of Unity, but cant blame them for any imperfection as it is the 1st time Ubisoft using such new system. As for Rogue? Well it will be same as Black Flag with tons more upgrade, hell lot bigger map, stronger ship. Hell if u are assassin fans u definitely will like this game, best story and plots so far, and hell ya i love naval battle.
