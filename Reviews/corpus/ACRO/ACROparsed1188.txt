Nice game , The Missions are fun but just one thing..I dont know what the hell is going on with the editors, Butto sail about 10 hours from the time of playing the game , In a boat like 5 min To get to urMission location , Its really dumb...You sailing on the water , Without doin Anything...Not The best , But its ok
