I only recommend this game for those people thatlove the series and actuallymore hours of AC.The game is still unpolished. Its more than playable, true, but one has to establish some standards here! How is it possible that such a huge team of developers is able to publish this game, patch it and still maintain a straight face with the results? My head ached for each name I saw sliding in during the credits.The basis of the game is actually good. The naval battles are cool, the story... But the way everything works together is not, because they simply dont work harmoniously.Also, please stop with the way you make collectables. Its just a waste of time! The computers with the little puzzles are ok since you get a better glance of the backstory. But the uncharted chests, etc... Thats bad Game Design. because youre travelling there JUST for the collectables theres no decent reward for it.About the Naval Campaign I had the experience with IV, so I tried to do as many missions as I could right from the beginning, getting menowar and whatnot, but was only able to do half of it by the time I got 100 synchronisation! That, my dear friends, is insane.As I said, only buy this game if you feel that you need more hours of ACIV.
