The two words I would use to describe this game is half The story was good but the story telling was just awful. There was no attempt to get you attached to the characters but some kind of expectation for you to feel bad for them. It was super dissapointing and felt rushed. It is basically Black Flag with less mini games, a few small new mechanics that you will use once or twice and a lot less polished.They should have just made this a DLC for black flag for 10 bucks and cut out all the collectible nonsense.
