Finally can kill civilian dudes. They send bounty hunters after you so you can kill even more dudes. I think we need more Templars Creed games.Ok, seriously, this is like a swan song for all pastgen AC games we had and its truly beautiful. No need to say that it has only the bestest of all previous AC games, and I wont even mention a godlike optimization Im pretty sure some Pentium would gladly give it a smooth ride. Well, if youre new to AC series you go away now, this is not for you but fans just MUST buy this game, worth every penny.
