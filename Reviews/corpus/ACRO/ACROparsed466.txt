After playing the previous, this game is just as excellent!The story is nice and original because we play a Templar,it allows to have another image of the assassins and Templars.The gameplay is always the same, climbing, shopping, battles at sea are just great, improvements are also nice and having a crew is even more interesting.The graphics are beautiful, well detailed.I recommand it !
