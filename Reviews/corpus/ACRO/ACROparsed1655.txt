Ok, this is a sequel to AC3 or Black Flag, not to Unity. It is the old engine, so it looks a bit rough compared to unity. On the good side, frame rates rock! I loved AC3 and Black Flag so I am liking this game, but if you feel bad about paying premium prices for an old engine game, then stay away. I am assuming they have 2 or 3 teams working, one Unity, one black flag, one AC3...they will churn out as much as they can on their respective engine to maximize earnings. 2 games each maybe before moving on? Anyway, if you loved black flag, you will love this one too, pay and enjoy.If you need the freeflow crowds and super grafx of Unity, stay away!! !
