If you liked Black Flag or AC3, you probably like this game too.Had some problems in the start though Problem with memory leaks after awhile in Abstergo, so i get out of there as soon as i can. Consider the game has been out for awhile, i think its bad that they havent fixed the memory leak. Seems to run ok when im playing as Shay. Aslo had to change resolution, because the default one didnt show everything on the right side of the screen.
