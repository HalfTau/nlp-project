Great product, its a little bit inproved than black flag and they have made some things more realistic.  And i like the way they took Shay to become a templar after training as an assasin, that chaged a lot. and u can have a boat again and be a bloody pirate wich i loved in black flag. I played it for 7 hours after buying it
