Assassins Creed Rogue is a lot of fun, but most of that just comes from it being more or less a continuation of Black Flag. It has its own story and takes place between Black Flag and AC3, also by the end it leads into Unity. So ultimately, this is just a half AC title that helps connect the timeline. If you havent played Black Flag, play that instead. If you have and really enjoyed it, definitely give Rogue a try. However I will add that this game returns to the focus on Assassins v Templars that Black Flag abandoned.
