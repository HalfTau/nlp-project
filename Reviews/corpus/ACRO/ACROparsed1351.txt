This is a better game than Unity. However, the same platitudes that make all AC games characters and stories feel ankledeep shallow also prevail in this game. A pointless cargo system where you have 1 cargo worth money Tobacco. The rest is used primarily for crafting, upgrading. And the only thing you can do with tobacco is to sell it. You still have to go through the motions of selling it. This shallowness of the series has turned it into an entropic death.The gameplay mechanics of the series are great, however unchanged and poorly developed over the last decade. The games stories and characters are annoyingly simple. Dialogues and monologues are cringeworthy in their writing.The gameplay is just as linear as other AC games.This game wouldve been given a very cautious thumbs up, had it not been for the overwhelming performance issues plaguing it. Performance issues that exhibit different symptoms based on what nvidia drivers are installed.If you want a proper assassin game, get any of the Hitman games.
