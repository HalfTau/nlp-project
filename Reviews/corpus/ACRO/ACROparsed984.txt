So, I am an Assassin with a grenade launcher, for stealthy reasons... when do I get to be an assassin with a dog as a way to distract guards?Following up after AC IV Black Flag it had a high competition and managed to, at least, not disappoint me.The story is well written, if you played AC III and AC IV, as well as AC IV Freedom Call, before you should already be familiar with most of the characters and get a much deeper insight into their backgrounds.I could not entirely agree with the ways the story went, the characters are all pretty stubborn so no surprises on their decision makings. Overall pretty linear.The real world part was fun in between, those little puzzles were always good for some change. But why were there 21 Computers of 20 you have to hack?Overall well made but nothing really new. Most weapons are already known, but work well, and the new weapon, the airrifle with the grenade launcher were a blowpipe and bombs in previous games.Finished it in about 13 hours with some of the secondary objectives done. Completion rate 50 at the end of the story.
