For anyone who is a fan of the STORY of Assassins Creed, this game is very significant. Rogue ties into Assassins Creed III, Black Flag, and Unity Wont say how. That said for anyone who is interested in a new take on GAMEPLAY, dont bother. This game is essentially Black Flag with snow. Shay says all the same things as Edward when he commands his ship The Morrigan. The crew sounds exactly the same, even the shanties are EXACTLY THE SAME.Despite all of these things, I still enjoyed Rogue. It is still worth picking up if nothing else for the sake of basically playing through another Black Flag.Overall, good gameplay, actually very good story, just was not fresh or new enough to stand out as a truely different game than Black Flag. Go ahead, pick it up, but dont be surprised if playing Rogue just makes you want to replay Black Flag.
