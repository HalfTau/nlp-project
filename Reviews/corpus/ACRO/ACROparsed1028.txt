One of the worthy Assassins Creed games.Fine exploration, good graphics, excellently optimised. The story is okay and main character is probably the only interesting character in the entire series Templars are the good guys, what a surprise.Controls are very bulky, some missions are annoying, and swordplay is boring and dull.Overall, a pretty decent game.
