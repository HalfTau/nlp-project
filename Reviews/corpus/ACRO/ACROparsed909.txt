So AC Rogue is like a better AC 3 , better graphicsmore refine , the protaganist is way betterShay Cormac then the one from AC 3Conor Kenway and you have a boat but in North AmericaA mix of AC3 and AC4. For AC fans like me , to play the templar Shay Cormac doesnt really change the gameplay from an assassin to a temlar. Of course Shay was trained as an assassin but you STILL dont get any difference from playing Shay to Ezio, Edward, Altair or Adawalethey are almost all the same.Ubisoft added one cool feature though were you are basically tracked, tailed by other assassins since you are a templar target walking on the streets of New York and other places. Although it is cool that Ubisoft i guess explained how the Templars were able to have control on the 13 coloniesThis is before the American Revolution and how it was thanks to Shay Cormacs work but then Connor comes later on and ignites the American revolution.Now the question is is it worth it?Well to be honest from all the AC games i have played i wouldnt recommend to an AC fan since its just a better AC3 but with the AC4 gameplay. You do get to enjoy some couple of moments with Haytham Kenway whos fcking hilarious but or else if you hate it AC3, ACRogue is just a better AC in North Amrica.For new AC fans out hereJust start with AC or AC2 to get the AC vibesClimbing walls, assassinating Templars, Ancient civilization historyif you want to play an AC game in North America, I definetly suggest AC Rogue.
