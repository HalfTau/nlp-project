its way to underrated the story is short it lakes content and reuses alot from Black Flag but your what is basicly the best DLC that is its own game but you can never have to much Black Flag the story kicks starts alot of things like Unity and 3 i just want Shay to fight Connor or Arno seeing as there storys where heavily affected by him
