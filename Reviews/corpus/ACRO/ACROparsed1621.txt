Good storyGood ChararctersFunny Naval GameplayNice OptimizationThis game shows you templars arent the bad guys.They are fighting for the things they believe its true.I personally loved being a templar and an assasin hunter.SHAY S AWESOMEThe transformation of an assasin to a templar is well handled in the scenerio.The story is a bit short.ts fighting mechanics are exact same with ac4 black flag which  dont like.This is probably one of the best ac game  have ever played despite the short scenerio and unchanged fighting mechanics.
