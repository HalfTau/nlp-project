This game is an amazing game to the Franchise of Assassins Creed. Assassins Creed 2 is my favorite but this one perfected many things about assassins Creed. The story line is shorter but that is a good thing because that means you dont play the same mission over and over.The missions make you feel like you are actually there. Anyways I rate this a 9/10
