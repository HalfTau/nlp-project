FINALLY!! A story that is worth while mentioning in this polarizing franchise. Rogue manages to tell a story about an Irishman that decides one day hey  the assassins! They can be aholes for the majority of the time. Lemme join the Templars. Interestingly enough, it works.... and it works well.Fighting assassins is a lot harder than fighting templars and thats what completely shifts the game mechanics compared to previous entries. Story hasnt been this interesting since maybe Brotherhood. Gameplay is the same as Black Flag with a few minor improvements but still the same. Music is great. Shay is great. Only things I disliked was just how uninteresting the setting was and how poorly textured everything was. It was optimized fine for how simple the engine is but the textures looked like dough compared to Black Flag.Overall, this was a good experience. I had minimal expectations for this game but it proved to be better than both Unity and Syndicate.8/10 would sail into Halifax again
