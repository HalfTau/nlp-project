Really enjoyed this episode of AC. The Templar perspective was quite refreshing, and was something entirely new than the loveydovey goodguy brotherhood of assassins. The choice between both orders felt profound, do you want freedom which includes  the risk of anarchy, or order with allround opression? I would recommend this game to anybody who reads this, it was a bit dull at first SPOILER whilst still being an assassin, but thereafter the game really grew on me.P.S I shot a guy in the head with a puckle gun from 1 meter distance, great times!
