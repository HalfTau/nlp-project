I wish I could put an asterisk with my No as I wish to say that if youve played AC3, AC4, and Freedom Cry then I would say get Rogue  otherwise if your looking to play an older AC game from the past generation I would avoid Rogue.The game feels rushed to meet the release of Unity that came out at the same time  I found both the story and the game itself to be disjointed. For instance the game uses mechanics from AC4 and textures and models from AC3 so it does not feel original and most of the off the beaten path  feel generic to the point you wont remember any of them. Further the game felt more glitchy compared to past AC games, with great examples like a Man OWar disappearing when I moved up to board it, or crew on my ship on more than one occasion flying off, and so on. I normally expect a few weird things to occur in an open world game, but in Rogue it felt testing may not have had enough time to iron things out.Still the biggest sin I have against the game is that the main character does not feel like a real person  he feels like some sort of one demension villian from a movie or saturday morning cartoon. He and other characters do not act like rational humanbeings throughout the game as it feels like they are being forced to make irrational decisions to fit a broken narrative.All the negatives aside, I must repeat it has the same mechanics as AC4, so youll get more of the same, but AC4  AC3 are better storywise and gameplay so I just cannot recommend Rogue when players have those at their disposal. If nothing else if you have finished AC 3  4 I would recommend AC Freedom Cry over Rogue as it shares the same mechanics as AC4, and even though it is a shorter story than Rogue the story of Adwal is stronger and more belivable than Shay.
