Honestly, this might be my favorite Assassins Creed game. I was actually a big fan of Revelations I liked seeing the end to Altair and Ezios chapter in the same game, and I really liked Constantinople setting, despite the reviews and this game rivals that. I think the story of why Shay chooses to revolt and turn evil is very well explained with the scene that unfolds in Libson. I did feel that more backstory for those who associates with would have helped. The constant assassins trying to attack you seems annoying, but it actually makes sense from a story point of view, I just may have handled it differently how the mechanics work.The good things from Black Flag remain, yet the New York setting is superior to any of those in Black Flag IMO. This game almost feels like a 2nd attempt at the American Revolution era, and an improvement, over the dissapointing AC III.Glad i played this game, wish I didnt wait so long.
