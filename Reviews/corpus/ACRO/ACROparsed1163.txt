i think its underrated. It was overshadowed by unity despite it being a better game IMO. It falls short of black flag, theres no doubt. To me it feels like a cross between black flag and III. its the gameplay of black flag with the atmosphere of III. The story is alright so far, better than IV for sure, but pales in comparison to the ezio trilogy. It was worth what I got it for during the holiday sale. If youre a fan of the series, you might wanna pick it up. It sits firmly in the middle of the series as far as gameplay and story go.
