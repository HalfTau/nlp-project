If you like Assassing Creed 3 and its prequel Black Flags then you will enjoy Rogue, as its very similar in both combat and Gameplay. While I do enjoy this game, I cant say its better than Assassins Creed 4 Black Flags though it is more enjoyable than AC 3 and alot more than Unity. If your a fan of the franchies, then you should certainly try this one, but I suppose its worth a skip.But still one of the better Assassins creed game, easily top 5.
