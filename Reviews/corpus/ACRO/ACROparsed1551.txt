If you liked Assassins creed Black Flag, you will SURELY like this game because is as good and better.  What I really like about this game is the good playability it has. Yes, sometimes the character its a bit clumsy, for example, when you jump to something, but thats just easily managed.  The storie is very good, the quests are well designed, not too hard not too easy, the fighting in the sea is as great as it was with Black Flag. The learning curve is almost non existing because its very simple to walk, fight, jump, etc. Its a great game for people who likes open worlds like Grand Thef Auto, Skyrim, Obliion, and not so open like Dishonored, and the Batman saga although some of those are open worlds. I really recommended, its very good and entertaining.  the only con I would have is the times when you exit the game and are in your office, I didnt like it in Black Flag and I didnt like it in here. When I played Unity, I thought they had learned, but no, here are the same boring tasks, but at least, they pass very quickly.
