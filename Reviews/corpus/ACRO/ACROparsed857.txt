And yet another Assassins Creed. So far Im about 10h into the story and heres what I can say up to this point. First of all it feels and plays like a mixture between ACIII and ACIV. The start of the game is a little odd. You get thrown into the story almost without any background to the characters, even yourself and up to the point where you get to Lisabon the story itself is pretty lame. After that the story turns out to be quite exiting and compelling with a plot twist you dont want to miss. So my conclusion is Wait until you get to Lisabon and then start to enjoy a very good Assassins Creed game.9/10
