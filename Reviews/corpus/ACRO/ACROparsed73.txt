ProsThis game is absolutely brilliant! !The storyline of this game is amazing, I would be able to replay the campaign loads of times and I wouldnt get bored.The graphics are actually quite good.It is one of the lesser known AC games but it should be one of the most popular as it is better than the majority of AC games.The games combat is niceConsTheir is a couple of bugs in game like sometimes visuals wouldt load and sound wouldnt work in some fights, that for me was very annoying.The voice actor for Shay Patrick Cormac, in my opinion was awful. Im Irish and Ive heard plenty of different Irish accents and Shays voice is awfulThis is one of the best AC games but one of the lesser knowns and honestly thats quite sad...8.5/10
