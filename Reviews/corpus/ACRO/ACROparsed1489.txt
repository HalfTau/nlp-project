Higly recommended for AC fans. If you loved Black Flag, you will love this one even more. Gameplay is somewhat similar to Black Flag, that includes hunting, crafting, being a pirate, upgrading your ship, combat, collectibles, taverns, etc. However, there is more than that. There are new additions to the games which makes the game pretty much awesome to play, I am telling that from what I have encountered so far, but there could be more interesting things to do in the game. You can even hunt polar bears now, and they have added more animals you can hunt. But, thats only the minor upgrade to the game, there are other nice additions as well.At first, the gameplay looks like another Black Flag with different environment settings, but after hanging on to it for a while, the game turned out to be pretty good with a good story line to follow. Nice graphics and minor neglictible glitches. If you have second thoughts about buying this game, dont, go ahead and get this one and enjoy the game.GG.
