I liked the fact Rogue focuses more on the templar side of of the story. What motivates them, what their take is on what the Assasins are up to. Naval Combat makes a reappearance in Rogue with all same mechanics. As Shay you are a templar who is trained in the ways of the assasins,  much like if you follow the franchise a Kenway we know coughHaytham Kenway.A good play with special Assasin Interception side missions with of course legendary ship battles and a great many collectibles.In short Rouge isnt entirely its own game, because it has a lot of things Borrowed from previous installments, but it is an enjoyment to play. And that is still a game worth playing.
