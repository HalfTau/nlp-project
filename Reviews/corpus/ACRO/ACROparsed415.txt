I finally have the game after years ago being a PS3 and Xbox 360 exclusive. But this version frequently crashes. Its a random chance that ac.exe stopped working... error and stuff. I tried to look for solutions and nothing works for me and I failed in my refund request because I pass the playtime limit.Anyway, I can take the positive side. As far as I could play, it seems to be a good Black Flags sequel. It was wonderful to relive the naval fights and explore the map while scavenging ship wrecks, chest, and stuff.Its a shame that I cant play this game properly after years, but I cant do nothing else.
