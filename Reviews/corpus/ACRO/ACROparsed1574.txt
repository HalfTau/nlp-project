Its like playing Black Flag 2.0 as a Templar, but thats not a bad thing. Its everything you would expect from an Assassins Creed game. The only things i would complain about is that you cannot crouch unlike Unity, making stealth an afterthought. Also there are a few bugs, parkour can be a bit janky at times and AI can teleport and glitch through structures. Multiplayer and coop are disturbingly absent, but the singleplayer more than makes up for it.
