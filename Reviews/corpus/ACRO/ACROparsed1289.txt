I have played two hours and I am hooked at this game because of its story telling. People must be right when they say this game has good story! As for performance, the game runs at solid 60fps on highest with gtx 970. However, I would prefer there was option for 120hz or 144hz refresh rate. I saw some animation glitches when fighting minor bugs.Will update the review later again.
