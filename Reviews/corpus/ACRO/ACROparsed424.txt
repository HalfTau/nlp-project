This Assasins Creed game is recommended to those who like Assassins Creed IV Black Flag.Same combat,naval battles, except thethe story you get to experience the Templars side of the conflict with Assassins.I like the snowy environment and weather effects.I really enjoyed Black Flag and this builds on to after the events of Black Flag story.If you want to see what happens after Black Flag then this game will help you see,also it leads to begginging of Assassins Creed Unity.I recommend for those who want a continuation of Assassins Creed Black Flag.
