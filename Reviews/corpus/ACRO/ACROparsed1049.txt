This game is essentially a sort of second take on AC4 Black Flag. This game runs on the same engine, uses many of the same assets, and uses the same Abstergo office building in the present day plot. This game similairly revolves around a lot of ship combat, which also uses the same mechanics from AC4. If you liked AC4 youd almost certainly enjoy this game, although it isnt quite as good.Because of the clear lack of effort put into this game, I simply cant reccomend it. Personally I got this game when it was on sale, at which point it was sort of worth the reduced price.
