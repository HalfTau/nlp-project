TLDR Good game. Worth picking up if you enjoyed Black Flag and fancy some moreI feel Rogue was a bit overlooked given it was released around the same time as Unity. Like Black Flag, Rogue carries on with the pirate theme this time taking the setting to the New York area and North Atlantic. As I enjoyed all the pirate related stuff from BF I really enjoyed more of it which Rogue has plenty of. It also improves a bit on BF with new weapons such as the really useful dart gun and less annoying missions like the eavesdropping ones from BF.The story is also pretty good with the main character Shay, who starts off as an Assassin, turning his back on the Order and joining the Templars. Its actually quite refreshing to get the Templars perspective and the game is better for that.Only downsides is some of the voice acting. Shay is supposed to have an Irish accent but what we get is an Oirish accent on par with Tom Cruises effort in Far and Away. Its brutal. Another character seems to go between Scottish and Russian. Its hard to take the story seriously at times when you have this unintended comedy.But that aside Rogue is a great entry to the series and it didnt get as much attention as it deserved.If you enjoyed Black Flag then Rogue is well worth a try.
