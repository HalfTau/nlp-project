Assassins Creed Black Flag 1.5The major game critics are off by a long shot, this game is actually great.Prosjust like Black Flag if it aint broke, dont fix itliterally combines BF and AC3play as Templar instead of Assassingorgeous gameactually quite bigsets up Unity nicelygameplay still stands, with some minor touches to make things differentConslittle character development. Usually Id brush this off but this issue was so major in the game that it detracted from the overall experience.the plot doesnt feel like it goes anywhere.8/10. Its a bloody good time.
