TLDR Main story is short and predictable, but it is definitely worth the buy.Only 2 hours in, and this game is great. The mechanics are very similar to Assassins Creed IV, and it plays well on my build, maintaining 60 fps on ultra.Do yourself a favor. Buy and play AC III and AC IV, then buy this game instead of AC Unity.8/10 would turn templar again.Edit 12 hours in. Game is still great.9/10 would continue to templar further.Edit 2 Okay, I have finally finished the game. The concept is very interesting. It lets you see the side of the AC universe from the Templars view. The ending is very preditable and let climactic than the other AC games, but overall it was a good experience. Im glad I picked this game up, and I will continue to open all the chests and fragments until I get to 100.One thing that did bother be about this game was the weapon variety. The airgun is cool, as it comes with darts and grenade, both with different kinds that you can load into your weapon. However, the darts are a simple one person shot, while grenades are an AOE kind of shot. It was kind of sad to see that this huge potential of a new weapon was shortcut with an AOE and single target option, but it still was fun to experiment with it.Despite the games main story being fairly short, it was still extremely fun and it held my attention. Overall, this game is a 8/10, would turn templar and collect the metric  of collectables again.
