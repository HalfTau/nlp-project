I use to say that this was the third best AC game, behind 4 and 2 of course. Though after having played it again I have to say that I was completely wrong, this is the best AC game. Of course it has the handful of glitches you find in every AC game, this one offers a handful of new mechanics, a slightly more interesting story, and the ship combat. 9/10 for pirates
