This is the most solid Assassins Creed since AC2. 10/10I feel bad for AC Rogue as I think a lot of gamers got caught up in the AC Unity snafoo to take the time to notice how brilliant of a game this is. It NEVER crashed, NEVER stuttered, NEVER glitched and NEVER dropped frames. I actually believe that it is the most solid and technically sound game in the franchise at this point. It appears to be built upon the same engine as Black Flag, but unlike BF it never felt like it was ready to break apart at any second. It is incredibly refined and looks great.I am a sucker for stories like this but I was hooked immediatly. It isnt exposition driven and as a result you come to share an empathy with Shay as events unfold. You see things from his point of view In this case from the side of the templars and it makes him very relatable as his actions seem JUSTIFIED. I dig it. If I had to pick a fault with the game, it would be that with the franchise itself. Simply put AC games are getting HUGE in terms of the game world and to prolong the experience devs are craming in as many collectables as possible. I understand the reasons behind it open world, forces exploration ect... but it is just at the point where it has NOTHING to do with the story and is simply distracting. It is beyond filler content and if they could tone it down somewhat or give me a reason to 100 everything, I feel Ubisoft should go for it!Do I reccommend this game? Yes. A huge resounding yes. It is pretty, technically sound and very enjoyable. In fact, the church mission in Lisbon delivered probably my favourite assassins creed experience to date! Go team!
