I think people tend to overrate Rogue because Unity, released at the same time, was such ashow. But really, when you get down to it, Rogue is just another Assassins Creed game. Its just........you know....its assassins creed.......At this point, why do I even hope for something good?One thing about Rogue that especially stands out to me is the voice acting. Heres a quizIs the voice actor for Shay1 not actually Irish2 actually Irish, but simpleminded?Answer hes Canadian, and its so, so obvious. I turned the voice volume down to 30 because I cant stand his stupid voice. Because of this, I sometimes dont hear the dialogue, but I dont feel like Im actually missing out on anything good.Ackk! Im Shay I want to be wild and free! I want to grow my horrid moustache long and sail naked into the sunset! I want to be in charge, Im the better murderer! The Man is Keeping us Down, Liam! ACKKKK!! !Shut the  up Shay. Stop driving the damned boat into icebergs.That being said, Id forgotten how fun ship combat could be. Same with sleeping/berserk darts. So. A couple good things.I can only play this game for 30 minutes at a time before I get bored/frustrated, so if I think of anything else, Ill edit this review. Otherwise, assume I got sick of struggling through this game and just gave up.
