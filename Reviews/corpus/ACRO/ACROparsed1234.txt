Game keeps crashing as soon as i start walking. Turns out that Ubisoft hasnt optimalised this game for the ati 300 series. If you have a graphicscard from those series you can only play this game with Envirement Detail at the lowest setting.I have now done my 1st steam refund and wont  buy anything from ubisoft again.
