As many have stated before me There is quiet a big simularity to AC4, when it comes to gameplay mechanics.Id argue there is a bit less focus on naval combat, then in AC4. However instead of the West Indies, with their Tropical Climate, you get two areas with a diffrent climate zone each to explore with your ship The river valley and the North Atlantic Id say both of these combined are a bit smaller than the carribean sea in AC4, but offer more variety in terms of visuals. When it comes to overall ammount of content, its a bit less than the before mentioned, but should still last for a good 12 hours. This is only following the main questline, without straying from the path to much by doing side activities. Id guess you can easily spend 4050 hours if you do all the side activities aswell.The gameplay remains the same for the most part, with a few exceptions For examples Enemy ships can now also attempt to enter your ship, instead of it only beeing possible the other way around. On land there are now assassins trying to hunt you down. This works simular to the multiplayer mode featured in previous AC games. In terms of gadgets, you get pretty much everything you got in AC4 with the addition of a grenade launcher that can fire 3 diffrent types of grenades. berserk, sleep, and standard frag grenades Other than that everything remains the same.For once the Story is actually beeing told from the opposite side The Templars. And puts a bit more light on the motives behind their actions. Rather than them just beeing the bad guys that want to control the world. Id say its a interesting story that fills the timeline of the ACUniverse with events between AC4 and AC3, aswell as ACU.So basicly I think if you like other AC Games, youll like this one. Its a good game, unlike that other spinoffgame Assassins Creed Liberation, which is really bad compared to all the other entries in the series.
