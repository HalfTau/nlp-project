pc using intel i76700k with amd radeon R9 390 8gb and 32gb ram, and the game looks great with max settings and runs at 60fps  10 hours of play time havent dropped below 57 frames, as for the game itself its just a AC 3 and 4 combined and reskinned but told form the templars perspective, which is great idea  we have played a lot as assassins now the games have got to a point where there just not fun anymore they should revisit time period and tell from templar perspective would be awesome.
