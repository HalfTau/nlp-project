Yes...A simple Yes for a great game... Alhtough not so many significant changes were made, compared to AC Black Flag engine, graphics, gameplay it IS a fine addition to the series, ending in an unexpected way. I played it twice through PS3,PC. After AC2 this has just become my favorite. It would be a good thing to continue Shays story. See, sometimes spinoffs come out even greater than major titles. Have Fun with it.
