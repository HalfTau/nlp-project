Im gonna start off by saying that my first AC game, and the only one ive played prior to this was AC4 Black Flag. I immensely enjoyed that game for the most part. When I sat down to play this game, it felt familliar. Almost too familliar.At times, Assassins Creed Rouge can feel like a bit of a rehash of AC4 in terms of its mechanics. It just feels simillar. However, that doesnt take away the quality of the game itself. All of the things that its utilizing from AC4 are good. The story is very interesting, and different. The main character Shay is an Assassin who betrays the creed turns to the Templars. The reason why he did this was very understandable if that makes sense. Now, the Abstergo Entertainment office work is, well, its there. Nothing too interesting, and on par with AC4s Abstergo segments. The ship mechanics are pretty much exactly the same as AC4, along with the combat and assassinations. If I had but one flaw with the game, it would be that the story felt a couple hours short. It felt like I beat the game fairly quickly, even while taking my time and getting stuck on missons.Overall, Assassins Creed Rouge is a great entry into the AC franchise. I highly reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise, or if youre just looking to play a really solid game.8.5/10
