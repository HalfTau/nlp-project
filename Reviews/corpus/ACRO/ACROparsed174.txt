So I got this game because it was widely discussed as more AC Black flag. I liked that game a lot. I dont like the rest of the AC series. I thought more Black Flag would be a hit. This game does have boat combat, but its a washed down version. The city improvement is a resource drain that doesnt feel like you accomplish anything. I was bored for most of the playthough but I wanted to see it through to see if maybe there was something else I was missing. I never found it.
