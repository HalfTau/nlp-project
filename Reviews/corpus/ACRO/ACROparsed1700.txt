What AC3 should have been. Basically, if AC3 and AC Black Flag had a baby, this would be it. The score is amazing and the optimization for PC is actually surprisingly well done for Ubisoft. Im ruinning max settings at 4k with my GTX 680 and averaging 60 fps. The Open world naval combat was my favorite thing about Black Flag, and Im glad they brought it to the frigid waters of the American North Atlantic. If your a fan of the series, Id definitely reccomend picking this title up, even if youre still weary over Unity and AC3.
