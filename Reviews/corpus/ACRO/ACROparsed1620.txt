Very simlar to Black Flag which for me is a good thing. Definatey not the prettiest game out but it is very passable and finally not an absolutely god awful port to pc. A few noticable thingsGraphicsPretty good lookingEasy to run on the highest settingsNo presets must manually set everythingFramne locked at 60 fps from what I can tell doesnt bother me, may bother others, and no I dont have vsync onGameplay/ combat is cut and paste from black flagNew activitieshunting feels a little better, animals are slightly more forgiving to movement easiernot broken I am looking at you unityStory Though I have not gotten farInteresting so far I want to continue playing, again looking at you UnityGreat main character, Shay is really coolfun crossover between games, achilles and adalwea make appearances in the first halfhour or soEngineGod damn Uplay manMSI afterburner and overlay can not be used in this game. If you want to track fps, have to use fraps, afterburner causes crashes. Took about a half hour to figure this out. If you have anything over like a 760 though you should be maxing at 60 fps anyway, so dont bother downloading fraps if you have a decent graphics card.Again game is easy to max and is unfortunately framelocked, but for comparrisson I runi5 3570k stockmsi gtx 970 100me8GB 2x4gb kingston hyperx Blumsi z77 mobo
