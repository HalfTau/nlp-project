assassins creed rogue gives a whole new perspective in the assassins creed universe, as a templar you will see the point of view from the other side you have been fighting so many years and in a way you start to like the templars, i personally found myself supporting the templars in this over the assassins and it left me thinking are the assassins really the good guys?combat wise its very good but its what you would expect from an assassins creed game same old.naval combat is pretty much a copy and paste of black flag but is still very fun so if you were a fan of black flag you will enjoy this.story wise i think its one of the best out of all the games in the franchise although it is shorter than the others aswell.Shay Patrick Cormac, the main character is very likable and has a good personality.i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the series.
