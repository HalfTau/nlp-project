One of the worst AC games ever. Its billed sort of like Black Flag 2, but its really more of a Black Flag beta. The animations are jerky and inaccurate, the voice acting is gratingly horrible, and the story makes next to no sense whatsoever. I really liked Black Flag, and I even liked AC 3, but this is just a really blatant cash grab. I think Unity was shaping up to be a POS and it mostly is, so Ubisoft panicked and cobbled this together to keep the cash flow coming in.Dont waste your time. I played this on console for about six hours, thought it might look  play smoother on PC, got it for next to nothing, and I still feel like I spent too much.
