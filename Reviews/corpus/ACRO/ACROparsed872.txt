Assassins Creed Rogue is a fairly short title with only 6 sequences, however the game makes up for that with lots of content and activities, an interesting albeit short storyline, gorgeous settings of Colonial New York, the Candaian Frontier and the North Atlantic,  a fantastic soundtrack and a perfect blend of features from the older A.C. titles such as gang strongholds as well as features from the newer titles the ship combat of AC4.The game isnt without issue, there are odd bugs and glitches and some of the free running is annoying when it doesnt work the way you want it to. But in comparison to a game it released alongside ACUnity the bugs that plague the game are very minor and dont affect gameplay significantly.In Conclusion, I would highly recommend this game as it provides a high quality and fun experience, despite its lack of length, Rogue makes up for that in Quality, over extensiveness.
