amazing game. it builds on black flags naval mechanics, and has unique and interesting enviroments. it adds a single huge city in replacement for black flags 3 small ones, and adds two naval maps, river valley and artic ocean. its really fun to expore and liberate towns from the french, and its great to finally have a game were i can explore canada. totaly recommend, an essential piece of ac lore, and one of the most interesting characters theve created since ezio.
