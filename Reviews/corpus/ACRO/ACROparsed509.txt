it was put together very sloppy. I went from black flag great game as the last AC game i played to Rogue, was dissapointed.  the story line was good though i didnt like the voice actor for shay but the enviroment that you run around in is messed up. visually it looks great, but you will get stuck in the most stupid places not able to move. also as you run, the things you are supposed to run up, acrossed, and along make you go in a direction you dont want to quite often.  story line great, visuals great, but game movement sucks in big ways that it will mess you up at the worst time ruining alot of hard work and effort you put into missions trying to stay stealthy.
