If you have played AC4, then this game is quite easy, because it has the same controls as Black Flag. The story is actually quite short, but when the story is over, you have a lot of playtime to do other things. In the story, Shay is an Assassin, but when a city is destroyed because of him, he joines the Templars. This gives you new enemies and new opportunities and new looks for your ship. I recommend this game, because there are almost no cons for this game. I personally didnt want to join the Templars, but when I saw what the intentions were of the Assassin Brotherhood, I actually wanted to be like Edward Kenway. I gave the look of the Jackdaw to my ship and killed everyone.
