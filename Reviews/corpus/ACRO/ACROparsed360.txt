For me , this game even better than Assassin Creed 4 in term of story and gameplay. I know it doesnt have lot of changes from the ac4 engine but i do like the way it is a further improvement. I bought it from steam sale and it is definitely worth it. Come on... i mean ac4 freedom cry dlc is like 14.99 and this is only 15.99? The story is kind of short but it is very intense. Assassin creed game mission is like all copy and paste in some way so a short mission story sounds good to me. I have played it once on console and now just replay it for the second time to complete all the challenges and exploring cities. I am not going to comment on the detail on shay story...9/10For someone want their games look even better , i recommend a sweetfx for ac rogue
