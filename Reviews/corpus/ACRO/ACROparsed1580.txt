This game is pretty good to play.One thing that really impressed me was the performance. I mean, AC4 runs way below this one in framerate, and I cant find an answer to that I still dont have a freagin power master gamer pc, so I felt quite the difference running this game, compared to AC4, both on low settings. Its way more optimized, I guess.I cant compare its storyline with Unitys, since I still havent bought it yet, but, as a piece of software released to the public, this is, by far, the best between them. Rogue has its share of bugs, as we unfortunately are starting to expect from a Ubioft game, but at least it doesnt have creepy faces, right?...Worth it
