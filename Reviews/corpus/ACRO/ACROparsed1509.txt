well i finally finished this game.. total individual play time via 1 playthrough 47hrs. this is to achieving 100 completion.. well, i guess i should be honest, probably gonna be 4850 hrs, but only because EPIC Legendary Ship and the Naval Campaign isnt finished, but EVERYTHING ELSE is complete.Yes, there are irritating bugs and glitches on this game, but to go as far as i have, youd need to expect that.. the native totems are one of them, another is DONT shoot the ships outside of Anticosti late in the game, cause youll have to start the whole sequence over again because of the glitch it causes.. cant finish the mission, in other words..Yes, i HIGHLY recommend this game! VERY fun! i forewarn you, however, when you get to the EPIC Legendary Ship, get ready to lose the first couple times..
