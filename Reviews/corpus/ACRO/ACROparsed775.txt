Not a very long game, took me about 16h to complete would take more if I cared about achievements, 100 and stuff. However, it has a great plot and its a great game! Ive played Black Flag as well and at first was told that it was basically the same game. It sure has a lot of similarities, specially because of the time both games are set. But I really liked this story and think it complements greatly Black Flag.Now Im off to play Unity and then Syndicate.
