7/10If players are interested what happened to Desmonds father, then pick up this game. The story is brief and linear. Free roaming in this game is not recommended only because the lack of people in certain areas of the city. I havent experienced that many glitches or bugs, only rarely encountered a few during cutscenes. Overall, it is a game worth half its current price.
