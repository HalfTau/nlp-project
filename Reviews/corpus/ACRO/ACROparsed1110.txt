Its certainly not one of the best games in the series. It lacks the in depth story telling from AC1 through Revelations. All the gameplay mechanics are still there. Im not much of a fan of the ship game play as it feel tedious to me. none of the missions really stood out to me either. The game took me about 2 months to finish as it failed to keep me interested enough to play it through in a short amount of time. Being a fan of the series I forced myself to keep coming back to it incase theres anything important story wise for any future games. The ending also sucked and came about what felt very abruptly. It didnt even really feel like achieved any particular goal by the end of the game.Edit After starting Unity, I see why it ended where it did. It still didnt really feel like the ending was much of an end goal though. Its basically a prequel to Unity showing some events leading up to where Unity starts. Doesnt change my opinion on the game much thoughIf youre a fan of the series it may be worth picking up for what little story continuation it offers but otherwise I wouldnt bother or get it on sale.
