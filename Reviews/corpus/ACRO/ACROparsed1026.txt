It has very very immersive graphics when theyre at max. The story is very good, it contains old Assasins Creed games places/persons and its one of the best Assasins Creed games i just love at first sight. The story mode also explains alot of the earlyer Assasins Creed Games And its just spectacular the story mode. One of the best top ten games i ever have played!
