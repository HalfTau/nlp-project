An alright game in the Assassins Creed series.Not much can be said about this one other than its what you are used to. It plays in the Northern Atlantic, River Valley and New York and has a bit of intrigue with you playing as an actual Templar for the largest part of the game. The controls can be a bit dodgy with Shay not quite listening at times or grabbing hold of the wrong things since it does not have quite the control options as with Unity, it also looks worse and unfortunately the cities and towns are much less alive with worse architecture and less historical information than Unity.Ship combat does return, but unfortunately it is painfully easy with all but the last legendary battle being quite easy to go through. You are never truly in danger and Shay can easily take anyone on without a sweat, thus the game runs the risk of getting quite boring with the repetitive and bland ship combat and melee combat. It is unfortunate then that Ubisoft has not taken a better look at some of the games where ship combat is done better, such as Sea Dogs II Also going under the name of Pirates of the Carribbean even though it has nothing to do with that which has much more interesting and challenging combat. Which, by the by, you might want to install New Horizons for if that peaked your interest. Its actually a must.But it is another Assassin creed game, the setting may interest for some time or perhaps the ship combat grips you despite the flaws. The story is decently interesting with you playing as a Templar and overall it is an okay game but not a great one either. Average but enjoyable. It will keep you busy with the things you are used to. If you have the computer for it I do suggest Unity as a better alternative. Id give this game a 6 or 7 out of 10
