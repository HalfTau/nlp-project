Combination of swordfights, smoking muksets, naval battles, sneaky assassin business, gang/turf management and, of course, hunting for treasures in every nook  cranny. The story takes a different turn unlike any other Assassins Creed game.Some complain that its short. 100  playthrough took me 68 hours. More than enough entertainment in my books.
