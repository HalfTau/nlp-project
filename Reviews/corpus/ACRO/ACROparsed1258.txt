Too much water 10/10  IGNI love the water in this game, this may be the best water ive experienced in a game, and not just how it looks but how the waves and sea move around and how it affects your ship, best water ever.Black Flag was the first Assassins Creed i actually wanted to play in the series that i went and played the first one and the second one and half of brotherhood before i gave up and just watched the cut scenes up to Black Flag on youtube. The first is ok but really hard towards the end, seriously that one has some frustrating sword combat, which is amazing considering the cakewalk the combat become in all subsequent games. The second one has the most rounded and fulfilling story and gameplay.Then after that one Ubisoft fcked the modern story sections where you played as Desmond. Im glad i didnt bother playing revelations or 3. Black Flag was the only game before Rogue that i actually really enjoyed and that i didnt have to force myself to play, and that is mainly due to it being a pirate game first and an Assassins Creed game second.Rogue is now my favourite Creed game, it has slightly more refined ship to ship combat than Black Flag, and they added smoke effects after you fire your cannons, so you cant see sht in front of you, which forces you to use tactics and change position rather than just sit in one spot firing your cannon balls. It also has mainly wintery enivronments as opposed to Black Flags tropical ones.The other cool thing is that this is the first Creed game that has your character join the Templars, so you see most of the game from their point of view which is really cool. There is also one part that without spoiling it caught me completely off guard, i actually cant remember the last time a game had an event happen that genuinely surprised me and was also fcking awesome.If you have never played a Creed game before then start with Black Flag and then this one. These two games still have all the building climbing and assassinations of the other games, but also when you get bored of doing that you can sail around blowing ships out of the water and harpooning sharks and killer whales to your hearts content.
