Its Black Flag 1.5, which means its good overall but really just an extension of Black Flag using all the same art and mechanics.The world is huge but mostly unused, the story takes place in a small part of it leaving the rest to collectable hell with no compelling reason to explore and collect it all. Achievements or any other Steam integration might have helped a little but Ubisoft rather add their Uplay garbage instead.You play as a Templar most of the game but it doesnt change up the formula much, for some reason the Assassins start behaving just like the Templars used to with big visible forts and such. Its a little weird and a missed opportunity gameplaywise. There are a couple bones thrown in like being hunted by hidden assassins but that really just serves to fill your ear with creepy and annoying whispering and doesnt add much.The story is really good but way too short. It seems like they cut a lot of it or it just wasnt fully worked out, I wanted to see more but it just rushes you through. It might be the most interesting story in the whole series about the series itself, it pulls a lot of pieces together and for that you should play it if you are into it.Otherwise this is just an overpriced bit of standalone DLC and I was mostly dissapointed given the hidden gem status this game has. If you really like the Templar vs. Assassin story in the series by all means play it or watch it on Youtube. I dont recommend it though because it costs too much for what it is, dont pay more than 15 for it.
