A sequel to AC3 and AC4 and a prequel to Unity, Rogue takes the Black Flag high seas adventure and gameplay style and runs with it, streamlining almost all problems out and adding some new elements to the AC series. If you were bored towards the end of BF and wonder if starting what is essentially BF2 will keep you interested, wonder no more as it should suffice. This is no DLC or add on, it is a fully fledged AC game with at least 40 hours of gameplay. There are two giant open sea maps to explore and an update to AC3s New York area. Theres dozens and dozens of small coastal towns, green foresty areas with hunting challenges all pretty easy unfortunately ice fields, ice bergs, forts to conquer, whaling from BF is back, no underwater areas this time though, or at least that ive seen so far. The voice acting is top notch, apart from the hilariously bad performance of your first mate. The guy sounds like hes taking the The fact that the game is a port of the 360/ps3 version and not a port of a xbox1 game like BF was, means that certain graphical elements are left out. It still looks great though for the most part, though no where near what Unity represented graphically. Highly recommended AC game. 9/10
