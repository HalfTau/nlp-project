Assassins Creed Rogue is great fun and a great pass time, it has an extraordinary plot and storyline, especially when playing as one of the Knights Templar, Ubisoft made a great comeback after Black Flags character underdevelopment, Shay Patric Cormac has a great motivation against a corrupt Creed. I highly recommend Rogue to anyone that loves a good story.
