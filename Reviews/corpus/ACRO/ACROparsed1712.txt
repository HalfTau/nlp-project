An amazing game for me personally. The reason I say this is that I have only played fully AC1 to Revelations  a little bit of blackflag. I have heard from others that there isnt too much new content when compared to AC3 and Unity but if you havnt played those then this is just a fantastic game. The description of the story in this one doesnt do it credit. I expected some decent plot about a betrayed assassin who decides he wants revenge, the story is so much better than that though and it only makes playing as a templar more vivid and complex. So if you wish to play this game and you havnt played the recent ones fully, 10 hours or so into one or two should be fine then I recomend this game. If you have played every recent game, then I suggest you check out the content a bit more to see how much is genuinely new before picking up but the story is still worth it.
