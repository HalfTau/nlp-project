Awesome game. Love the see it through the eyes of a templar aspect. Also it mixes elements from AC3 and Black Flag which is neat. Im only roughly 1/3 of the way done though but Im already loving the game. Ive only noticed two bugs and experienced no crashes. Bug 1 was a dead body flew 2 stories into the air and crash landed. The second is a deck hand glitched off the ship during a battle and fell into the water and died lol. Spoiler I like the going Rogue aspect in this one but I side with the assassins in all the games. This one though I lean twords the templars. Not because of the point of view. but because the Assassins in this game kinda act like jackasses.
