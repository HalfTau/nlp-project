i love this game. if the assassins didnt go rogue themselves shay wouldnt have become their wrost enemy.i dont want to give away to much of the plot for ppl that are new. but this game is a good one it is worth it.you definitely get the feel that your a badass. and you finally get some of that missing story befor connors life.all the diffrent prespectivs of the kenway family. as far as playing the game well nothing serous as unity inany way. it plays normal as it should. 60 fps all the time.
