SPOILER ALERTIts a shame that this game doesnt depict the war between Assassins and Templars as one of an ideological nature. Instead, it is the Assassins who now go about irresponsibly with pieces of Eden whereas the Templars ought to stop this from continuing, which reduces the story to a shallow battle of good vs. evil. The only difference is that the Templars are now represented as the good guys, repairing the society that has been destroyed by Assassinfinanced gang practices. If the point of this game was to show that the Assassins Creed has its issues, whereas the Templar order also makes some credible points, they could and should have done this better. The story suffers from a serious lack of depth. There is no real ideological reason for Shay the main character to switch sides, just a methodological one. This seems to be a highly insufficient reason to do so. Furthermore, Shays anger towards Achilles seems to be highly misplaced. He gets unreasonably angry at him because of a mistake, not a wrongdoing. This makes his reason for breaking with the Assassins an emotional, immature one, not a rational one. Hell, he didnt even decide to really discuss the matter with Achilles before attempting to entirely sabotage the brotherhoods progress.That being said, the gameplay heavily relies on Black Flag, but thats allright by me. It works fine, and I primarily play Assassins Creed games because of the narrative anyway. Also, although not very credible, it is pretty badass to play as a Templar, which explains the many hours I have put into it. I principally do not recommend this game though, because I was really hoping for a proper experience from the Templar point of view.
