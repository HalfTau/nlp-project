If you loved Black Flag you surely will love this. Freeroam aspect is alright, but more loading screens than Black Flag. Combat is very similar to Black Flag but the ship battle has been tweaked a little bit. The game takes you to different places to New York and the pacific ocean you travel as Shay Patrick Cormac once an Assassin in training now a fearsome Assassin hunter. But this time around you travel with your ship the Morrigan. I wont say anything to spoil, but if you loved Black Flag this is a must have.
