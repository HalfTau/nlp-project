Is this really a Ubisoft game? !The optimization is superb because my five year old PC with two R9 280X AMD GPU. Note Ubisoft hates AMD GPUs for some reason, that most of their recent game releases arent very optimized for most AMD hardware could handle a stable 60FPS at 1080p at the maximum settings. Although the gameplay feels a bit like a Black Flag rehash, the story seems very interesting.
