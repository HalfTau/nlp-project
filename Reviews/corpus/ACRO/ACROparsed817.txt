At this moment in time, I have all the recommended specs for Rouge, but after I completed the prologue, it will instantly crash no matter the changes I make, you know what that means... ing UPlay. No, no, no, you dont Uplay...you UCrash line every other dumbeddown console ports at have been on that platform for the last two years. How Zombi port is more compatible than this, I have no idea.I have played this game on PS3,and the plot is much better than the garbage that was AC Unity. But as of this review, unless you figured out the crash that is on this port, this game gets my score of Burn. It is not worth a buy.
