Assassins Creed Rogue ACR has turned into one of my favorite Assassins Creed AC games of the series.  Set between the opening acts of ACIII and Unity ACU, the curtain opens to find Assassin Shay Cormic struggling between obedience to his betters and following his conscience.  This story ties into the events of ACIII, Black Flag ACBF, Freedom Cry ACFC, and ACU in a way that no other game has yet done, and it does it with remarkable success.  While a step back from the fancy shmancy graphics, details, and crowds in ACU, Rogue suffers from none of the many bugs that its sister game did, and its seemless gameplay combined with Shays compelling story certainly make this game very much worth picking up.POSITIVESMore of the duel naval/land action and side quests that made ACBF such an interesting game.Compelling new characters, and a few more chapters with some old favorites.Largely bug free, relying and improving upon the mechanics developed in ACBFNEUTRALIt felt sometimes like a huge ACBF DLC due to the similarities in game play.CONSThere are only 7 sequences as opposed to the amount that we have come to expect from AC games.  That said, this did not necessarily feel like a short game  there is plenty to do  but I do wish it had been longer.
