Really great game that rounds off the America series of AC games. Has all the elements of AC3 and ACBF which made them great. Parkour lines are great and controls seem to be more responsive than previous games. Great epilogue to the Kenway story, and a fantastic prologue to Arno in AC Unity. Ties the games together very well.
