Ill add more as I play more, but initial impressions areGraphics on character models, some buildings/ships, are pretty good. Environment, trees, foliage and grass all look like early ps3/360 type stuff and this is maxed at 1440p. That is a bit disapointing because alot of the game is in these environements and hiding in shrubs that look like paper pop ups. Good thing the a good chunk of the game is played in the water as well, which looks great. The icey conditions add something new to the mix.So far the gameplay is same old same old. Fun if you like it. Parkour still messes up and causes frustration... But thats also same old same old.First edit few hours in. Same ol same ol with the missions. The story is good enough and the environment is pretty varied and is actually growing on me graphically. If you are a big Assassins creed fan, I recommend, if not, wait until a sale.Actually, everyone just wait until a sale.It runs so much smoother than past games. I have an i5 3570k and amd 290 and 8gb ram with a 1440p monitor. Not one hickup maxed. Although it is behind Black Flag and Unity graphically.
