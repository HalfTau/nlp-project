8/10 may play againI personally have always loved tha AC series. My favourite of course being most peoples, Assassins Creed 4, or better known as Black flag. The whole pirate theme amazed me, not only wiht the great gameplay, but visuals as well. So when I bought this game I personally was expecting the same, and I wont lie, playing as a templar really does change the gameplay, but in all honesty, the game felt a bit short. But other than that it was great, with again stunning visuals, the fighting and seeing how a new assassin/templar fought and the loose link between black flag and rogue. But who am I to judge? Its your own thoughts that count really.
