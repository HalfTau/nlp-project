This is a great addition to the Assassins Creed group of games.  It piggy backs off the awesome Black Flag with the mix of sea battles and city life.  But I feel that the levelling of this game is much better.  The resources are harder to get and I felt like I was looking for more resources than just Metal in this game.  In Black Flag by the time you had accumulated the necessary amount of Metal then you also had enough of everything else.  That is not the case in this gmae.The story feels right and the mix from the other games of the period is spot on.  Its good to get some back story about what happened to the Assassins before Connor comes along.  Its also great to play as the Templars.There are new challenges like taking over the Gangs in New York as well as the icebergs in the water.  One of the features I found really changed my game play was having people stalking me.  Whenever you hear the whispering you start taking way more care.Even though the graphics might be considered last year, the game play certainly makes up for this.  Its one of those games that there is always just one more activity to finish before you exit.  Oh and one more and one more ... Its 3am how did that happen.This is a must for all Assassin Creed fans.
