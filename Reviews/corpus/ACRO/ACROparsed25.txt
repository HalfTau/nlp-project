short Review.You like Assassins Creed and love the Assassins Guild ?, you like hunting Templars and kill them ?well then prepare to be the Templar beeing hunted I so far just played 4 yours but im definetly going to get more time in it.its an awesome game from a great games series but instead of playing the Assassin like always you can see what the other side had to offer.Maybe the Templar arent the bad ones in this conflinct i can say this game is its money worth and if you like Assassins Creed and wanted to see the otherside for once then buy this game and prepare for an fun and hard time, you wont regret it.
