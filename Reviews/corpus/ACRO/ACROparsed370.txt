Its a solid game, but it isnt really worth full price. Id suggest getting it during a sale. The core gameplay is lifted from the series previous installment, Assassins Creed Black Flag, so theres little change in that area except for a few minor additions like the Seven Years War setting with a templar protagonist. The story sounds intriguing, but the whole moral complexity thing isnt all that well developed. The modern day storyline is moved forward just an inch, with its faceless protagonist still walking around server rooms.Im a little surprised that this is a standalone game, since its improvements and/or changes on the previous game are so minor that it feels more like a DLC. The game takes 5 hours less to beat than the other main titles but has 5 more than Freedom Cry, Black Flags actual DLC.I played this after Unity, so I was in for a bit of an emotional surprise, but now I think it is more enjoyable to follow this order despite the disparity in gameplay between the two.
