What a wonderful game! Lisbon destruction was awesome, see Adewale in his old age, seeing Haythem...this is a MUST game to play after gaming AC3 and AC4....i would recommend this game, its wonderful and im still enjoying it! Cant believe how well it ties in AC3, AC4 and Unity....this game is a MUST to play in the storyline....
