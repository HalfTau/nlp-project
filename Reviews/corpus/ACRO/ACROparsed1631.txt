The single fact that this game is optimized amazingly well for PC is worth the full price.Ive played nearly every Assassins Creed game for PC and somehow Ubisoft listened to the customers technical issues on previous games, fixed them, and then released this masterpiece. It blows all previous AC PC games on a technical level out of the water no pun intended and thats no exaggeration.If youre a fan of Assassins Creed and want to have a seamless experience, this is a mustbuy.
