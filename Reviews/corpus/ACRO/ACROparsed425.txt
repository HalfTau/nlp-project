Very Meh.ProsShip battles are really fun just like in Black FlagThe blow gun and grenade launcher are coolConsHorrible console graphics.Story is ok but there is no reason at all to hunt, craft, upgrade anything, visit any extra location, or do anything other than fast travel to the main missions. Its a Ubisoft game so theres a thousand points on the map and a ton of worthless things to collect that you never will.If youre a big AC fan and want to play them all I would recommend this for 510.
