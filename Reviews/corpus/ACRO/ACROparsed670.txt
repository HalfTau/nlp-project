Im done with Uplay games.... I cant stand having to play around with their proprietary crap store app... I bought this game on Steam and all I should have to do to play the damn game is hit play....thats it.Ive returned one Uplay game due to this issue and have two other games I just deleted because I dont want to waste my time whenever I want to play by being required to go back and repeatedly relink my Steam account to my Uplay account...Uplay sucks....thats why I use Steam....Uplay will never be as good as Steam...they need to give it up and just make games.
