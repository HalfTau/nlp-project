My favourite addition to the series so far. 8.5/10It takes everything that was good about ACIV and expands on it.The graphics are excellent, and the game still runs smoother than ACIV.The Storyline is amazing. Shay is actually a really good character, as good as Edward.The Puckle Gun is great.You get to experience a justified reason as to why the Assassins are the bad guys at this point in the story, that doesnt make Shays defection appear forced.Seeing old characters makes it tiein really well to the rest of the series, better than any of the other games.The only downside I can think of, is that it is a bit short. But perhaps if it were any longer it might take away from the game.Overall, worth every penny you spend.
