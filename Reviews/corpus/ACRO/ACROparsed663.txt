One of the best AC games in the series, despite using similar mechanics from AC3 and AC4 Black Flag. Shay Cormac is such an interesting character and it really allows the player to understand more of the Templar goals, as it lets you play as a Templar for the majority of the game. Unfortunately, the story is a little short, definitely shorter than its predecessors.ProsGreat graphics, no different to AC3 and AC4 Black FlagGreat optimization, always running on 60 fps unlike Black FlagVery Strong Storyline with an interesting protagonistAllows us to see characters from previous games e.g. Haytham, Adewale, Achilles, etc.ConsShort StorylineOverall, a definitely must have if you enjoyed the rest of the Kenway Saga of AC, links directly to Assassins Creed Unity at the end of the game so I recommend playing this game first.
