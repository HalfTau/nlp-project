First Black Flag was awsome. Second AC III was crap. That said, AC Rogue does 180 degrees and turns back to AC III mixing some of Black Flags good things but with little effect. The story takes place a few years before AC III, and, its painfull. The plot is so annoying that since the 1st hour all you want to do is get to the finish line and end your suffering. Despite being only a month since i started AC I it seems a lifetime ago that i played the likes of AC II and AC Brotherhood . Those were masterpieces, but this? ...this is just rushing through the main story and hope not to get ebola in the process.I sure hope AC Unity is better / road2origins
