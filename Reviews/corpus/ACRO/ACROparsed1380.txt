a good game ,like ac 3 but better ,and like ac4 but set in more cold places .more of the same puzzles from but ac game mentioned cave painting , totem pole thing ,fort conquest both types .a good combo of the games ,but ... the plot is short ,though good ,links ac3,4 and unity in a good way . relys alot on you doing your own thing for the game to be good .its more of the same with ac but i like that anyway
