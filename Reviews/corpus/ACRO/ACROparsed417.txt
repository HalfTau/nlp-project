Hey, if youre wondering if AC Rogue is worth it I might be able to help.Before anything Id like to state that this is my opinion but Ill try to remain neutral despite my personal likes.Ill go in depth in some points but if you want the TLDR version just read the last lines.So what is it? Another AC with boats?... Well... Yes... But with templars and a new story!Heres a pros and cons from my experiencePros Great and enjoyable naval fights and commands in general. Various customization options Great lore and really catchy story. Loads of exploration Enjoyable stealth and agressive playstyles. Lots of collectablesCons No online mode Only one ship available After completing the main quests the game feels repetitive. Some bugs.So, in my opinion its a great game, a 7/10 with really rich storytelling and amazing naval system. I feel a bit biased since Ive always dreamt about a game that gave us the power to sail and wreck havoc in the seas like a true pirate and even tho Assassins Creed Black Flag captured that essence this game feels new.Also being a loregeek the plot was well done and immersive in terms of giving you some insight into the templar side of the AC universe. Theres a lot of exploring and side quests to do and this can be a good thing or a bad thing. I do enjoying hunting down every last piece of content but thats me. Once the main questline is done youre left with side objectives that drag you from random place to random place with not much else to do. With such an amazing system Id like to see some online action but theres none at all so dont count on that.Would I recommend it? Yes! Its a great game, a 7/10 even if youre not an AC fan but you are into naval fights and exploring, theres no online mode tho, but its okay since theres so much to do and the lore is very catchy.
