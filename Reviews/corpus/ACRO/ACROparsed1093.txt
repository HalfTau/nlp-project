If you liked Black Flag youll like Rogue. Lots of fantastic sea battles along with classic Assassins Creed story line. Like Black Flag you have the interesting side mission content with Abstergo Enterprises which was good.It can get monotonous hunting for all the resources you require for crafting, but the alternative is that you could just buy them.Did have a few issues with game crashing, but after lowering some of the environment graphics settings it worked fine.Highly recommend this game if you like others in the franchise.
