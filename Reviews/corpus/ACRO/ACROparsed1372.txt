This is an excellent entry to the AC franchise.They have improved everything 4 did well ship combat is faster and more dynamic, parkour has been slightly improved, you can skip the boringfleet combat.The story is really, REALLY good, it happens before and after AC3, and is the catalyst for Unity, right at the end.Performance is surprisingly GREAT, althought it is gaphically inferior to AC4, in my system it never went below 60 fps Vsynch on.
