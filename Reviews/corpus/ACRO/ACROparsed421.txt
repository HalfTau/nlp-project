Despite my positive reccomendation of this game, I fear that Ubisoft made a mistake with this one. It was essentially a copy and paste of Black Flag, which sounds like it would be a good idea, and it would be a good idea, however, some stuff was changed that made the controls and the AI messed up. Ubisoft wouldve done better to literally copy and paste the technology of Black Flag into this game, and just write a new story with some new models and animations.However, if you can look past the weird controls and awkward AI, this is a very good game, improving some of the things we thought were perfect with Black Flag... somehow.
