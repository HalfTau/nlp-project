with some new gameplay additions like the antiassassination activities and renovating local infrastructure for increased income. Story is not grandioseand has nice templar point of view on the conflict.I loved it! I wanted to kill all the assassins just as much as Shay.Short and impressionable story aside, Im going to find the people who put Black Flag levels of collectiblesin this incredibly short AC game, and Im going to choke them with my bare hands until they understand what they did wrong. Im going to go through post game credits and find them. So you better run, whoever you are, because you owe my  OCD a sincere fcking apology and I intent to collect. Im a completionist through and through and even I was disoriented by this game. If you thought collecting uncharted animus fragments and treasure chests in Black Flag was a chore wait till you get a load of this game. Fcking Ubisoft, man.
