Took me about 10 hours to finish the main story plus all side quests and about 50 hours to get 100 plus all bonus stuff that isnt included in the 100 like achievments and challenges.Imho it is one of the better AC titles after Brotherhood, which is my absolute favourite.They might as well could have called that part Black Flag 2 or sell it as an AddOn, because there is no new main feature to the game.Still, it was really fun playing and worth the money especially for 12 on sale
