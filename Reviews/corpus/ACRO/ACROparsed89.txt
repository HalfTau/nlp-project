If youve played previous AC games, Rogue plays like Black Flag in an AC3 setting. As usual for AC games, the plot is nothing too memorable, although playing a templar instead of an assassin offers a nice change of perspective.  There are very few tailing missions, which is a godsend!At the end of the day, what can you say  its an Assassins Creed game in the good and the bad. If youve completed Black Flag, played through Freedom Cry and still want more, you could do worse than spend a bit of time on Rogue. Whether or not thats a good thing, its a fairly short game. I completed the main plot in 12 hrs or so  and thats including a bit of side questing.
