Creed Rogue stars an Irish anarchistturneddictatorship sympathizer named Shay ??? on his quest to get fannyblasted over a single town collapsing and ing exploding in on itself into the next dimension after the US constitution or some artifact or something was activated without prior knowledge of what activating it would actually do to the area because the assassins are very smart. Shay of course is devastated that maybe 1000 people died, totally dwarfing any future mass genocides that would take millions of Jews or Stalins rule causing many Russian people to start eating their fellow countrymen out of desperation, so he decides the best course of action is to abandon his former beliefs and role in life to join a bunch of people that twirl their moustaches while dancing on the graves of their enemies, their enemies children, and the family dog.The game, being a Ubisoft title, features collectibles that do nothing, money youll have way too much of, crafting youll finish doing within 5 hours and waitI cant say it isnt optimized because it honestly runs well for me better than AC4 for sure. It also has an Irish main character. He talks funny, so its all good, but I find the fact he sounded like he was drunk when he had his breakdown over 1000 people dying or something what a  God thats like nothing compared to me not getting the SUV I wanted moooooooom to be rather culturally insensitive.1000 people/10
