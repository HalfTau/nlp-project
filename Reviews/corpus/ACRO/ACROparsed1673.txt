I know lots of people didint like Unity, and that Rogue supposably should be the better of the two. I just have to disagree, Unity was defenetly a better and more detailed game than this. Rogue dosent make me want to invest more in Assassins Creed. Even small things like how the exterior and the interior of the buildings dosent correspond really disappoints me.Having just played Unity I also feel the lack of customization. Like putting togeather different pieces of armor with different stats on, with individual looks and being able to choose what kind of weapon I want to use.Running and climbing animation feel inferior to Unity. And I feel very little incentive to do side objectives aside, both in reward and the fact that they lack story debth.It is, and feels like a game for console.
