After black flag, this feels like more of the same, with even more extraneous distractions.. the things that made sense as a pirate dont make as much sense here, but youre still sacking towns and stuff. The real world segments are also more of the same.Anyhoo, its still enjoyable, even though it feels a bit tired.
