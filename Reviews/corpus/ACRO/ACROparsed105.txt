While the game runs and plays brilliantly I cant give a thumbs up cause of the game breaking glitch with one of the missions. It fails to complete therefore you cannot progress with the story so youre kinda sitting in limbo. Ubisoft arent any bloody help so avoid buying this. Stick to Black Flag and skip through to Unity
