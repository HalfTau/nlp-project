Not as good as i thought it would be. Had a great start, but begins to fall off and become more boring after Shay turns to the templars. Im really fed up with sailing and honestly think there was too much of it in this game. It felt kinda milked. Even tho it still had enjoyable moments and new enjoyable mechanics so i will recommend this.
