Like any other game/new entry to a series, this game has both its pros and cons, but thankfully in this case Id say its got more positives than it does negatives.Huge, lovely looking open world.Generally good amount of content I.e., lots of sidequests, new weapons like the dart gun/grenade launcher, etc,.Characters are generally well done. Shay as the lead stands out of course.Good end to the American Saga. This game does an alright job in my book of wrapping up the whole American Saga of previous games such as AC III, IV Black Flag  Freedom Cry. It also serves as an entry to the next game, Unity.Occasional Bugs. Not half as many as Unity but there is the odd one that can occur which may disrupt your gameplay.Campaign length. This is pretty much the only major flaw this game has. The overall campaign of just doing main missions is very short, feeling rushed even.If your the type of person who plays the AC games purely for the main campaign/story, and you dont care in the slightest about sidequests  objectives, you may be disappointed.At any rate you definitely wont want to get the Digital Deluxe Edition and just stick with the standard version because the Deluxe Digital Edition wont be worth it for you.Personally I think that its a pity this game was overshadowed by its doomed to fail companion release Unity, seeming as its significantly better than its France based brother.This game does have its flaws like its disappointingly short campaign, which makes me question whether paying the full 30 price for the game was truly worth it, and of course there is the odd bug here and there but fear not, its not as ill faded as Unity was in that regard.I also sort of wish this game had been delayed for awhile longer, perhaps so they could have extended the main campaign so it isnt as short as what you might expect in a DLC for example.But other than those issues, its a solid entry in the AC Franchise, and as far as Im concerned, its highlight of the series in my book.Skip Unity. Get this instead.
