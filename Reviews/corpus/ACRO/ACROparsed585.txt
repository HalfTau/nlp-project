Im surprised that game has such a good rating. It should be a Black Flag DLC... the story is useless in the main AC whole story, the abstergo Montreal is flavorless far from Black Flag amazing immersion, and the side stories, well there are none. If you are a great fan of collectible items though you might greatly enjoy this game because this is the only way you wont finish it super quickly.The atmosphere is cold and lifeless I know this is great north America but Im also talking about all the characters, and that game bring nothing new.Had it been a Black Flag DLC with according price, I would say thats a nice DLC. As a standalone, thats a pale Black Flag. Clearly that game is just an easymoney shot.Maybe its worth it at 10.
