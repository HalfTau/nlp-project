First off I havent played an Assassins Creed game since 3, but the idea of playing as a Templar intrigued me. The game is overall really fun. The naval battles are not nearly as annoying as AC3. There is stil a lttle bit of real life missions. The combat is pretty easy. Overall the storyline is pretty short 6 sequences, each with 5 missions. I didnt go and complete every side activity or get all of the collectibles becasue I dont care for that stuff. If you did all the side stuff then you could easily play the game for a much longer time. I liked the main character, and I would like to see more game sabout him, but whatever.
