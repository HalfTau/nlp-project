Gameplay fantastic as black flag. Typical assassins creed with a mix of naval warfare. They added and enhanced many things from black flag.Story The story is quite weird on this one but very interesting. You need to play this AC to be able to clearly understand the next AC games.Graphics Unfortunately they failed to render the graphics as AC black flag and unity. Typical old gen graphics with a huge lack of polygons. Luckily the game is working on DX11 which improve a lot of things but the overall, characters, animals, the blurry sea etc, feels old gen. After all this game is an old gen console port.
