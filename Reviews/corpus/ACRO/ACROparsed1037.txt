I recommend this game. Assassins Creed Rogue isnt my alltime favorite AC game that honor goes to Black Flag, but it makes for an excellent runnerup. Very solid gameplay, rich in story content, and a view into the Templar order that Ive only gotten a chance to see in AC3s prologue makes for a very entertaining and satisfying experience.There are bugs, of course, and sometimes I end up yelling at the screen because of the stupid stuff it does, but from what Ive read its nowhere near as buggy or bothersome as its twin sibling Unity, which unfortunately I dont have a copy of and wont, either, unless it goes on sale for a ridiculously low price in the future. Its a lastgen game, and was released on the same day as Unity, and of course since Ubi spent all their time focusing on Unity, Rogue feels more like a filler game than a fullon setup. But as someone who cut her AC teeth on such a filler game Revelations, I feel that Rogue is good enough to stand on its own as a major title.So like I said, great game, very close secondplace for best in the series in my opinion second only to Black Flag, with solid gameplay and a great story that gives a unique look at the enemy faction, the Templar Order. I highly recommend Assassins Creed Rogue. It is a very enjoyable game.
