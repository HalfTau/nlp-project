I was wondering how Ubisoft could ruin this branch of AC.AC Rouge put in a nutshell Interesting story and voice acting. Recycled AC Black Flag Same sidemissions to repeat over and over. Nothing new. How to make a game from 2013 look better than a DLC from 2015 on PC? Well done! Bad PC port. Pop Ins all over the place on Maxed settings. Not worth the price paid for. Tripple DRM? Steam  UPlay  Windows? Best feature of this fullpriced DLC.AC Black Flag for 5 is still the better game two years later.Is it just Milking the cow or bad marketing?
