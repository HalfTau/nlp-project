In short Assassins Creed 2015 Good Version.As a long timeCreed fan, Ive been with the series through its ups and its downs, and this game really is a return to greatness for the series. Many people, myself included, have noted that the Assassins Creed series has been loosing its way for some time now, what with the continuing focus on pimping historical figures and the general weakening of the stealth focus, to the point that Black Flag was only fun while on the ship and not while being an assassin, but trust me that this game brings the stealthystabby fun back into the fore.Firstly, though, do note that the game starts off poorly, the first few hours being a dull, colourbynumbers entry into the series filled with boring wooden characters and a plot that cant really be taken seriously. Then, without wishing to spoil anything, you do something and something big happens, and at that point the game throws of its shackles and springs into glorious incandescence as it outshines anything the series has done for years by this point. Indeed, after  the first few dull missions, followed by the big event and its follow up, I remember thinking to myself, Now what right does this game have to suddenly rock?After the big change, though, suddenly youre playing the stealthiest Assassins Creed game ever, having to actually put forth planning to sneak about and get to your target without notice, and the game goes ing electric the moment the counterassassination spyvsspy mechanic kicks in. On the whole, this is probably the best the series has been since II, and it outright eclipses that game in many ways.That said, its not perfect. Its a bit buggy at times to the point that I almost failled a mission because a guy clipped into my ship, although he died anyways so no biggy and the game seems to have been built mostly out of recycled resources. As well, for all the awesomeness of it and the greatness of its story after the Big Thing, its story is still rather short, at least ten hours shorter than it should have been, especially considdering the sheer size of its map the entire sandbox being larger than some of the past games combined.I have a theory about this game. My theory is that this is actually the game the devs wanted to make after Black Flag, that they put forth all this effort into putting together new mechanics and the deepest story the series has had ever, that they started making the game intending it to be the next great entry in the series as a glorious return to form, and then a corporate higherup walked in when they were halfway done and dragged most of the team away to create Unity poor choice, leaving the remaining team to try and piece this game together.In summation its my favorite AC game, but it could have been better.
