Rogue has the most interesting story of any recent Assassins Creed game. Its fascinated by its own history, and introduces a level of ambiguity which changes how we look at the formerly simple conflict between Assassins and Templars. So its all the more disappointing theres so little to do while the story is being told the upgrade economys pointless and most of the tasks are quite trivial. Story aside, so much of Rogue feels redundant, repetitive, and ultimately in need of reinvention.
