Exceeded my expectation.I think AC Rogue has the advantages and fun of AC3 and AC4 combined to be the proper successor of the series. It could be a simple replication with just a few functional upgrades, which would have ended up great disappointment.Pros I enjoyed the wild nature of North America in nice graphics, the best BGM of all AC series, and the story connected to the predecessors.Cons Hunt, harpoon, and naval battle are somewhat simplified. It makes sense considering the different environment, situation, and dramatic configurations from those of AC3 and 4, but its true that the fun is also limited.
