If you liked AC IV Black Flag then youll like this as they behave very similar. The story actually makes sense which is nice and the choices made by the character are sense and have a nice payoff. The settings are varried between North America and the North Atlantic giving some variety which I appreciated. The property management system of Brotherhood is back which adds time and things to do. There is a ton to do in the game alongside the mainstory. I completed the main story and some side objectives in just over 20 hours.The game takes place during a time where well known historical figures are alive but are not shoved down your throat like they were in ACIII which is great. There are ties that connect between this, ACIII, and Black Flag which is also nice.Solid 9/10 and well worth your time if you enjoy the AC series.
