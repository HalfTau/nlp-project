With only 6 sequences its very short.  Its a good game, I would just recommend different Assassin Creeds.  I personally really enjoyed the game as the first Assassins Creed I played.  I recently finished Assassins Creed 2, and I prefer that over this.  If you have a console, you can get the Ezio collection pretty cheap, I would definently recommend it.
