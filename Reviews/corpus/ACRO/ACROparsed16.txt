Its AC4 Black Flag that TELLS you youre a Templar, while you play the same old assassin you always have done.My negativity comes from having played most of the franchise. In this game in particular, we had a chance to turn the narrative on its head, actually make a case for WHY the Templars want to maintain strict control, and play around with novel mechanics unique to the Templar faction. Such an amazing opportunity to add some real richness to the franchise, and its basically just a knockoff of Black Flag.
