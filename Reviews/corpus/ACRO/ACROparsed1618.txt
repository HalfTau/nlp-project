If only Ubisoft had further refined this tried and tested formula for their next gen game rather than released Unity 3/4 done, who knows what would of happened.  Anyways, Rogue is a further refined version of Black Flag, with a fun, gorgeous, and expanded naval section and the same Creed land based stealth weve grown to love or hate. For me, as one who loves the classic AC experience and adored what AC3 and BF did with the Naval parts, this game is the true nextgen sequel in place of Unity. While Rogue visuals arent quite as detailed on land as Unity, the sea and ships are stunning.  And while Rogue doesnt let you crank up the visuals like Black Flag did to show off its lush jungles, in exchange, you get a vastly smoother experience. Black Flag was very difficult to keep running at 3045fps without the aid of 3rd party drivers and while I cant speak for Unitys PC counterpart, I doubt it eclipsed 30fps on console or PC in its first few months. Rogue, on the other hand has not dropped below 59fps in my 20 hours so far i5 4690k, gtx970 and the few visual options it does offer do make look very pretty indeed.In short, if youre a fan of Black Flag and are looking for its true successor, then look no further..
