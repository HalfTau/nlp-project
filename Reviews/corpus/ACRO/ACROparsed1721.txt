This game combines some of the best aspecs of Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag in terms of the naval battles, ship upgrades without having to dive anymore.. thank god along with a much healthier dose of the regular AC stuff... hunting is still in the game and has been overhauled to be much more interesting, plus the chases for shanties and the like arent nearly as hard as they were in AC4.They really listened to everyone and created an amazing game that runs smooth as silk.
