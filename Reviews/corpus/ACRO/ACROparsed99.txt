I always likes the Assassins Creed series. Even though some of them might not be good, Id still enjoy them, and AC Rogue is the same but also different. It feels great to be a Templar for once, and its way harder. Sometimes, there are Assassins in your area, and youll have to kill them using your eagle vision. Being a Templar is awesome for one game. This game is for me one of the best AC games because youre playing a templar and the story is something Id expect if an AC game was like this, but its still enjoyable. The only thing that makes me still a little bit dissapointed was that it has the interface of AC Black Flag one of my favorite games of all time because Black Flag was my first game of AC that I dindt really like honestly. It also has the ship mechanics, which was the best part of Black Flag, and its the same here. AC Rogue is a damn good game. Its good that theres a game where you can paly as a templar for once.
