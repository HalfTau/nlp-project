I actually bought this game on sale and was really excited for it, but immediately had to get a refund because I needed to use Uplay in order to even use it. Whats the problem? Uplay wasnt working for 2 days straight and wasnt even able to even open the damn game. Ubisoft better get theirtogether, cause Id like to use alot of their products but cant cause of their  software.
