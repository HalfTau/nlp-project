If you enjoyed Black Flag and and wanted to get more naval combat then this game is for you. I got this game several months after Unity, which I played once and it crashed my system. I returned Unity and decided to take a break from Assassins Creed for a while but kept seeing advertisment for this game. So after a while I buckled and bought this game and I have to say that I was not disapointed. This game built on everything that was great about Black Flag and put more on top. While some feature of Black Flag are not included, being able to weild four pistols and being able to dive for treasure, it honestly didnt drag down the expirence. I logged about 49 hours on this game so far, I finished the story in about 35 hours, taking my time going for upgrades and becoming slightly obssed with the fleet missions. However the two most disapointing aspects of this game I would have to say is the way that you are yanked out of the Animus, ruining the immmersion. Secondly the fact that this time around outfits are disapointing and require you to make all this effort with slight benifits. However if you are looking for a good Assassins Creed game to sink your teeth in, I would recomend this highly. For those who are into 100 for cool rewards I would temper your expectations.Overall Score9.5/10
