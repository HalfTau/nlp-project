The first AC I have played on PC. Like the ship combat system and how you can detect other Assasins .The story is okay, telling me more about how Shay turns away form Assassins and becomes a Templar would be a plus. Its hard to see Shay ends his friends and mentors lives.Lots of collectibles which requires some time and a little efforts to get 100. The player can manage their own fleet and complete the trade routes to unlock features in the game. This is quite timeconsuming if you have finished the main campaign, especially when you have to wait for 2 hours as your ships travel across the oceans.I think the gameplay and the difficulties are a little bit oversimplified when the player can just control Shay, run into the enemies, and kill them all. You dont have to be an Assasin. Maybe Ubisoft does this on purpose to accomodate different play styles xD
