TLDR Low effort AI, gameplay is a scavenger hunting chore, story is incredibly short. As of completing ASC 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, Black Flag, and now Rogue... It fixes a lot of problems in Black Flag but lacks the kind of depth to truly enjoy the 100 completion rateThat being said, if you enjoy finding collectibles there is roughly 400 of them across the world to grab PExcuse me one second, I need to vent somethingNOBODY CARES ABOUT THE GOD DAMNED MOTHER ING CIRCLEJERK COMPANY SECTIONS. HOLY . Every single game. They roll in and  up the gameplay for easily 20 to 30 minutes each. For the love of god make them skipableAnyways, after venting is over, the game is only about 20 missions or so long. It has a few fixes up from Black Flag so if you havent played Black Flag before I would suggest running with this instead unless you care about the overarching story. However, most of the gameplay consists of a couple of story missions like 5, the rest of the story missions are just introductions to the various time sinks around the world which, while quite a large one, is mostly consistent of the same few setpieces over and over again. Littered with the same positioned collectables, completing the game fully is more of a chore than an experience. The only fun parts are the games you make for yourself on the inbetween consisting of stabbing guards in various manners, which is just as possible in the previous ASCreed games as in this one
