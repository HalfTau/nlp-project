I much better entry to the series than I was expecting. I thought it would be a shorter game, like Liberation, to placate those of us who were sad to be turning in our silly naval hats for french breeches. Not only was I entirely wrong about the length it is, in fact, a full game, but I was surprised by how quickly I was able to get on board with killing some assassins. Shay proved to be a somewhat deeper character than some, with conflicting emotions regarding duty to a cause and desire to build a better life for himself and those he cares for, which made the premise easier to get behind. They did a much better job than some of the titles in the series of making all the allies and enemies a little more wellrounded, instead of sneering villains, like they used to be way back in the beginning. Plus, its always nice to see Hatham again.
