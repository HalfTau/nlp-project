Assasins creed rogue.. where to begin. This game is my favorite AND at the same time most hated ac game of the franchise. Rogue showed me that even some of the asasins creeds morals are to be questioned. anyway i absolutely loved this game even with its few flaws, some including, very short main campaign length, shays voice is absolutely annoying, and not enough side objectives. that being said the story was great, the game is a filler between ac3 and ac4 aswell as a prologue to ac unity. the unique weapons u got were very fun and were kinda op at times haha. hunting asasins never felt so good even though they are tought ie they can stealth in brush, more alert than regular ai, use smoke and pistols too well. the game is also the most optimized video game on pc to date, becasue it was intended for old consoles unlike unity which were made for the new console generation. everything was perfect though if you count out shays annoying as voice, short story however it left me confused as to which side i rather like now, assasins or templars. imagine this, would u want donald trumptemplars running the country or having a purge anarchy libertarianism type government where everyone is free to do their own willthink about it carefully....i recommend the game but dont expect to be playing it for too long
