My favourite AC game was black flag. I thought that theres not going to be a new black flag game. boom , and i get this one. The game is fun, its mixed together with Edward Kennways son and the future of his son. The graphics are nice, the story is amazing and the game is just nice, so i totally recommend it, 3
