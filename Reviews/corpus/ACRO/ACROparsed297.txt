To be honest I only bought this game becuase it was on sale. The game is very similar to AC Black Flag howver it doesntt have the same good graphics. The story is mediocre but it has its moments. It was a fresh idea to see an assasin revert to a Templar especially since this time you actually start with the assasins faction in the story unlike Haytham kenway.Also seeing old characters we love from different assasins creed games was a nice touch reminding us how the stories sometime actually meet at some point in time. Be warned though, the graphics is something to yearn for, which is sad that they didnt up the graphics for PC.
