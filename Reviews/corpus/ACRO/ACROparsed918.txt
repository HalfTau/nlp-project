basically aversion of black flagthere is no fast walk so you can keep up with crowds without being caught, no crouching to sneak around and reduce your visibility, for some stupid reason to quickfire stuff is now Y instead of just tapping the aim buttonthey did take a step in the right direction when they brought back pistols and made the bad guys wear wrong prescription glasses, also they brought back that cool look at enemies in eagle mode to mark them permanently thing, and even if it is just a crap version of black flag, it is still better than unity, and even if shay is a bit of an he is a lovable character and he is so nice to most.my biggest problem with this game is the story, no spoilers that you cant get from the name but basically shay kills everyone he knows for no other reason than he is a sped and doesnt know how to say wait, please listen, let me show you how dangerous this isTLDR it is the shortest assass creed game I have ever played and it is decent, dunno if it is worth it though
