Its good...I did hate what did did with present time.. it somehow got worse than in Black Flag that was worse than in games before and it felt like past story was quite dull get on boat, find target, kill him, find out that it was just a bait, reapeat and I didnt quite get why we are not desynced for killing innocent anymore from story its obvious that no matter if he is Assassin or Templar he tries to seve innocent. Some features were improved since Black Flag but I think that Black Flag was better overally. Game is also bugged as hell.But!I once again enjoyed story told by collectibles, legendary battles and other aspcets as well. Black Flag was better, but this is good game as well. completed on 100
