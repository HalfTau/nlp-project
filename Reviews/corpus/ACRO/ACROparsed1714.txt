I have played just about 45 hours at the time of writing this and this is a damn fine optimised port of the ACR game released on PS3/x360 last November. I was waiting for this game to come to PC as they announced this at the time  of the console release so I was busy playing AC Unity and other games on PS4.This PC version contains the bonus DLC deluxe edition so is well worth the purchase. That is, if you want to play it now, if not pick it in a sale in a year or so. Ubisoft have returned to that style of naval combat with a typical assassins creed style ala  ACBlack Flag. I have yet to join the templars so I am intrigued at how the story will play out,A very well done port, nice polished graphics which run in 1080p at 60fps fully optimised with nice controllable gameplay. Recommended 10/10
