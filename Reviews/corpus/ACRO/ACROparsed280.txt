This was really good, you finally get to play as Templar, and expirience the universe from the other side.In previous games you may have gotten the impression the assassins were the good guys and the templars the bad guys, this game blurres the lines, are the templars really bad? are the assassins really good? Is there even such a thing as good vs. evil?Gameplay wize its allot like black flag.
