So radion r9 200 series, everything on ultra, same with unity and the game runs perfectly.. but then i do enough mission quests and i get sucked out to the abstergo office  ugh  and then its like someone disconnected my video card, it just dies, works fine if i get to a cinimatic, but it will literallty have a frozen screen for 25 mins before letting me move a little more, really frustrating.... is there a fix or some settitng i can turn waaayy down to make the office a lag free one ?? same happens2 me but even when running on normal settings turn down res fixes but sad they dont fix ac is getting worse 2 run on pc with every newer ac that comes out but only ac other ubsoft game seem aright  and all other games. other wise i think it a  good game sim to black flag witch i like
