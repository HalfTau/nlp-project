Well first of all Shay doesnt become ruthless and merciless assassin hunter, but slowly he defects from his believes and  his code alas one thing remains  Protecting innocents.He still has attachments to his old creed, but no mercy  Thats what I liked most As for gameplay It is nearly similar with Black Flag and Freedom Cry in addition few different mechanics, enhanced eagle vision to see stalker assassins and gatlinggun on your ship  best for boarding you will see, coolest bitz ever .The most interesting part is unlike AC3 you dont review how templar order establish but the opposite. You flashback to your assassin days and then you will become a Templar. You will hunt familiar faces including Adewale.Story takes place before AC3 story is good. Gameplay is good, no bugs or glitches encountered only a few that doesnt even need to mention.So overall except for the stupid gang leaders who can detect you miles away and cant be fought 1 on 1 you can only assasinate them in any way so no fist fight game is 9/10.So definetely RECOMMENDED. Check DLCs also they help alot.
