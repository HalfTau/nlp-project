Another AC game came to an end. This one takes place between AC4 and AC3 timeline wise. The game is very similar to AC4 but with AC3 graphics and therefore performance. 60 fps all the way. Story is not the typical AC either. You play Shay, an assassin turned templar who fills in the story gaps between AC4 and 3. Also it bridges the games to AC 5. Was quite small though and youd think that it was a DLC for AC 4 than a stand alone title...
