So Assassins Creed has been one of my all time favorite game franchises. Ive played every single game so far and have loved every one of them dont get me wrong, some installments are weaker than others such as AC Revelations and AC 3 but I still enjoyed them nonetheless. I played Unity and heavily enjoyed it, despite what everyone has said about its technical problems. But I loved it and so I ended up preordering this game. I then played through it and I must say, this game blows some of the previous games out of the water because of its rather darker storyline and the insane amount of stuff to do in the world, surpassing even Black Flags scope of activities and side stuff. It really is an absolute shame that this game will be passed on by most gamers for 3 reasons. 1. Its a last gen game and everyone is more interested in next gen tech and gaming. 2. Unitys bad reputation has turned many people off from the series which is really unfortunate because theyll miss out on this amazing iteration in the series. and 3. Simply because its a AAA title. This game is an amazing tie in to AC 3, AC4, and Unity. I would say that this game is pretty perfect on all cylinders. My only real complaint is that the campaign is probably the shortest campaign yet in the franchise, comprised of only 6 sequences. But it makes up for it with the amount of stuff you can do outside of the story. I would easily say this game is a 10/10, will play again.
