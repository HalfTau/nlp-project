initial rating 6/10actual worth 30ProsAssassin Creed through and through.animus, time jumps, good story,lots of collectibles, classic rooftop running,naval battels from Black Flag....Cons lips out of sync,mouths sometimes do not move.listening to speach with them just staring...or obviously talking A LOT but no sound... wtf!?!? animations can be rough at times... dated. graphics MUST set to MAXIMUM...OR , be prepared for 1990 nintendo landscapes.seriously, if not at max there is no vegitation or detail. controls rough ... its a port and not made for PC....overall enjoying the story and naval combat.with all settings maxed it is good enoughand a fun return to the Black Flag world just dont expect Black Flag...lacks the quality in ALL aspects to be compared.Black Flag was superior in every way.
