I have no words for ubisoft.. 60 FPS on ultra settings? Great story that reminds me of good old AC 2, Revelations? This really doesnt seems like game from new ubisoft does it? But its actually true.. this game was released the same day as unity was, but unity was just as piece of crap, which wasnt even working well, and you were lucky if you got 30 FPS on LOW. But here it is completely different. As i said, 60 FPS on ultra was a great shock for me, since i have played AC IV right before and i hardly got 1520 FPS on ultra. Then the story was great, playing as a templar is just fun, and it is showing us why main character Shay went rogue very good. Only con for me is that the story was short.. 810 hours.. However, thats the only thing i can point out. It was totally worth 30 i have put into it. Cheers//EDIT Played twice now, but i still think that i would like to play again later.
