Overall the same gameplay as all of the other Assasins Creed games, so you know what to expect. I like the overall game play of the series so that is good. Audio and graphics are quite good, up to the same standards as all the others. My only complaint would be the plot is a bit hard to follow sometimes and the ending is a bit anticlimatic. At the end I was left thinking, is this it?The sea battles and exploration are quite good. One thing i missed from Blackflag is the undersea diving in the diving bell. Here there are shipwrecks but they are on land. So i was dissapointed in that.Technically, the game doesnt run on ultra widescreen even though the menu has that as a choice. My screen is 3440x1440. I was able to get it to run though with some hastle by downloading a fix from the WSGF, wide screen gamers forum. It worked pretty well. I did have to sometimes change the settings back to 1920x1080 in the settings ini file before booting the game because it would crash. Then you go into settings once its running and set it back to 3440x1440. The game otherwise seem ok as far as optimization goes. I only had about 2 crashes on it.Overall, this is a must have if you are an Assasins Creed fan. If you are not a big fan then I think you could sklp this one. THe story fits quite well into all of the other game titles. Toward the final scene you actaully walk by a little boy and girl. In one of the AC games you play as the boy when he is grown up and the girl is a major character too. Kinda neat how all of the characters are interconnected. There are other relations too that run deep, dont want to ruin it.
