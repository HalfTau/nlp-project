Played oni5 4690kGTX 97016GB DDR3 1920  1080pI have been a big AC fan since the first game and therefore I wanted to like this game  I was expecting to like this game.So its a real shame that I didnt enjoy my brief time spent in ACR at all. I absolutely loved Black Flag   after Unity being such a flop and hearing good things about this, I decided to pick it up. More Black Flag I thought  yay! However, from the moment I started playing I got very bad texture flickering. After a quick google search I found it was to do with Nvidia drivers and rolling back which Im not prepared to do would fix the problem. Disabling VSync also worked, however I now witnessed horrific screen tearing. This really subtracted from the experience for me and seemed to remind me more of the fact that this game is last gen. Added to this were numerous other graphical glitches invisible enemies, low res houses etc... that I wouldnt have minded if they had been distributed over the entire course of the game. For them to occur so frequently in the first hour however...... well I wasnt filled with that sense of awe Id had when playing Black Flag. Shame. I was dissapointed with the setting the snow just didnt cut it in the same way that the Carribean did but thats just personal preference. The story seemed promising so far but the voice acting let it down. Combat seemed bland and buggy sound effects at the wrong time, enemies randomly stopping/running into each other. Sigh.Sadly, not what this AC fan was looking for.
