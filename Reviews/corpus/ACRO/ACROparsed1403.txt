I enjoyed the parkour, assassinations, combat, storyline, and ship battles. Some things I didnt like were little things such as not being able to access money on the enemy ship by swinging across a rope and killing everyone, and of course, the glitches climbing up a tree while your head is in it, etc.. Overall, Id say this was a fun game to play and would give it a 7/10, and would recommend to pick it up if it is on sale.
