Good story, great compliment to Black Flag, and good connection between the AC games that take place in the colonies versus revolutionized Europe.They added some fixes to some annoyances in Black Flag, but they also aded new annoyances, so ultimately its not any different qualitatively.Of coures it suffers from the traditional Ubisoft glitches, I had a couple CTDs, and the occasional glitch in game with enemies not spawning properly and whatnot. For the price, its well worth it!
