After spending some time fully finishing the game I can say that this is not the best Assassin game.You have exactly the same ship and all upgrades for it are the same. This time, however, you are at the time of America Seven Year war.Developers did add some minor changes so I guess I should talk about them. Instead of only forts, you haveas well which are forts on land. Theres also an only land locationwhich has a new enemy type spy.Theres also change in the sea location. There are icebergs which will damage your ship until you upgrade it but you can destroy them with your cannons.Finally last bit of negative, buildings have poor textures and look horible even on max settings and you and your enemies can stuck in textures easily especially near mountains. The only way to get out is to restart your game either by restarting the whole game or theres a new option now you can exit to Abstergos office at any time and that will solve the issue too.Generally, this is an average game, I would say 4.5/10. I would still recommend but get it only if you really want to play because the first hour is really boring and if its on sale.
