AC Rogue definitely has the best story among all the AC games. It puts you in a position where you get to see the side of both the assassins and the templars. If youve played AC Unity or AC3, this game will make sense of the events that happened there.If you are an AC fan this is a must buy 9/10 not a full 10 because of the bugs and glitches youll encounter, however, the story will make up for it
