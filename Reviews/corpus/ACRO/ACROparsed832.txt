Im a huge fanboy of ac. and this review is my opinion.Ac Rogue follows Shay Patrick Cormac on his journey. He starts as an assassin. But when something happend he left the brotherhood. To become a templar knight.StoryThe story is only 6 sequences long. So dont suspect to play the story for more than about 15 hours. The story is pretty good and would have been a perfect prolouge to ac 3. It explains a lot. Why achillies is the only assassin. And why the templars could get so big in America.gameplay The gameplay is almost the same as ac 4 bf. Its  just ac 4 but then with small new feutures. So if you hated ac 4 you should not buy this game for its gameplay. However i think hat both ac4 and rogue have amazing gameplay.graphics It came out in 2014. The same day as ac unity on consoles.In januari 2015 it was ported to pc. So dont suspect a great looking game. However, its not bad. Just not fantastic.Verdict if you loved ac 4 you MUST buy this one. It has an truly HUGE open world! If you disliked ac 4, DONT BUY THIS!I would reccomend this to everyone who likes ac and espacialy ac 4!
