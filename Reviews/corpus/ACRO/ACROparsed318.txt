I absolutely love this rogue. This was my first AC game to play. I remember how i didnt understand things about assassins creed cus this wasnt the first game that was made. And I love how he switches to the templars. the story is great. and haythem is in here which makes everything so much better cus hes the most badass templar. I dont understand why people can be so negative on this game, its great! theyre probably the kind of fans that only play what they want, and dont appreciate ubisofts work. I do. Even though this isnt the best ac game in the franchise its definitely very high on the list. Thumbs up from me.
