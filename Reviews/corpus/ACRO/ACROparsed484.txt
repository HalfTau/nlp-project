One of the better games in the Assassins Creed series. The story is wonderful and provides an interesting Templar perspective. However, the story is very short I took onethird of the time to play this compared to my time playing Unity.The game has multiple references to other Assassins Creed games. Fans of the series would love these. Characters from other Assassins Creed games are introduced at multiple points during the storyline.Gameplay is very similar to Black Flag. The game runs very smooth even on weaker PCs, but it feels obvious that the game was designed for lastgen consoles. The naval combat is improved slightly and I felt that the ships also handle well compared to Black Flag. The Naval Campaign returns in this and has around 33 missions. Ive played only 5, and it feels easier compared to Black Flag you can easily get 100 success probability even on small schooners if they are repaired at least for beginning missions. It can provide good amounts of money and rare items.The game gets fast boring after completing the story. Acquiring gang HQs are interesting and have a Uplay Action which would give you Uplay Units where you have to acquire all 16 HQs.I felt that I would not like it as it is Templar focused, but the storyline is pretty interesting. Do give it a shot if youre on the fence for this reason. Its good to play the villian once in a while.
