I just finished the game in one day. All i can say is that it is quite short and yet it has so much potential to create more plot twist but Ubisoft ended it there, BUT do not get discouraged by the story length. As i said that it has so much potential i mean it as it is so GOOD.The game might be short on the story but exploring is so big, there is tons to do even after you finished the main story. You can do some quests or search for some pieces of keys to unlock a certain type of armour.With all that aside now i can finally say that this game is far beyond my own expectations and yes i rode the hype train of this game before and never had a chance to play until now and still disapointed of what it has become.10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND.
