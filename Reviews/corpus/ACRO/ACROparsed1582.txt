Finished up ACRouge and had a good time playing the most recent chapter on PC of.It was a bit rough going from Unitys beautiful city and refined parkour, especially the downward run move, to go back to what is essentially Black Flag 1.5 set in a colder climate.The story is young Assassin blah blah now Templar but basically the same. While the space angel thing was toned down once again Thank You!, it was still a big thing in the end, just like Black Flag, and especially also when you were suddenly transported back to Abstergo HQ in Canada where you then lost the ability to move faster than a snails pace. Going by what Unity has shown, this will hopefully be the last time we are seeing the present day setting and thank the higher powers for that.The main mission is considerably shorter than both Black Flag and Unity, but there are a lot of settlements and places to explore on the two maps used for sailing.Here is a list of the elements reused from the earlier gamesA few good and bad points Carry and hide bodies functionality is back Settlements, warehouses and what have you on the River/Sea maps are great side missions Grenade launcher is a fun weapon Too many timer based missions Hunting is 99 filler as most high level animals are only available at 1 or 2 locations, and only show up one at a time. Youll end up buying materials for most craftable items.
