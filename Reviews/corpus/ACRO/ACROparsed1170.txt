ACC.EXE HAS STOPPED WORKINGI can play for about fifteen minutes before this crashes the game completely for me, and NONE of the possible fixes I could find online or think to try myself there are literally over a dozen I tried have even helped in the slightest. I have a brand new gaming computer thats fairly decent, too, so its not like its an issue with an old rig. I can run Witcher 3 on Ultra with no issues whatsoever.To boot, all this troubleshooting just to play the game for more than half a mission has racked me more than the 2 hours max that Steam allows for a refund. Im even more upset that I received this as a preChristmas gift, bought at full price, and then bought myself the extra content at full price, and wont be getting a refund for myself OR my gifter. I specifically put Rogue on my Wishlist INSTEAD of Unity because of all the issues Unity has had!The game is excellent when it stays up, very fun to play. But with the current state of the crashes, the fact that SO many people seem to be having this problem as well and Ubisoft has not helped anyone with this problem since theyre now moved on to Syndicate, I cannot stress that if youre thinking of buying this DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.AgainDO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS MAY NOT EVEN WORK FOR YOU.10/10 Would not recommend to anyone with these ridiculous crashes.
