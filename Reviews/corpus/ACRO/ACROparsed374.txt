At first, i thought the this game was just for the ps3/xbox 360 community had something to consolidate them since they wouldnt be able to play AC Unity. But as i played, i saw the importance of the game, for all the recente and future games. The game links the story of AC III, AC IV, and AC Unity in a perfect way, and explains lots of things. The only problem is the Shay is an . When he discover that his Assassin Master is making wrong decisions, he quit the brotherhood and go work with templars, instead of looking for another Assassin Master to work with and show that Achilles did not know what him was doing. He just dropped and went crawling for the templars. But this dont make the game bad. Its very good. Its AC IV with less things to do. And the final mission, who links with AC Unity start, was an amazing thing.
