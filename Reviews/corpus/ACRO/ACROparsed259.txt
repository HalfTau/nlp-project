At first , i thought this game is just merely a standalone dlc for assassins creed 4. But i was wrong , so goddamn wrong! This game can be considered the AC5 imo, think about it , its continuing the story of AC3 and AC4 , which connected all of the lines from other ACs game, and its good as well. The world is huge in it own way, sure its cant be compared to the fourth one since AC4 is already known as the biggest AC game in the series. So much to explore, and hidden dungeons here and there, just like AC4 though. Buy it! Its worth your money!
