Because my bad experience in assassin creed unity, i felt unconfortable to buy this game in first time in prepurchase but since i discovered it was launched for console before when unity was launched to pc and console, i felt in this time, ubisoft wont let me down again in bugs and graphics. and they doesnt. the game in ultra graphics is very good. My first hours playing still no frozing, no lagging and no bugs. The open world seems like assassin 3  black flag this one is after both, but some stuffs like BF graphics seems the same but better and some enviroments and history will remmember AC 3. What can i say after have all AC franchise? Awesome! nice engine and graphics and sounds! even having my local language to hear, i choose to hear english  my local in subtitles. why? syncronization in voices are better. and i dont like my local languages in games. only in game interface. for now, 9/10 for everything, but can change after play more time so lets see what wait for me and anothers players. some peoples complained about critical error playing but till now, no problems, even pressing alt  tab and opening brownser.
