 the self rightous assassins and their sneakytactics.If you feel the same way as I do, and enjoyed The Black Flag, then this game is probably for you!Almost every seafighting mechanic is the same with TBF but in here you have modified cannon shots like the explosive one and so on. Seas are not at all as bright and calm as it was in the Carribbean, which makes you kinda gloomy after sometime. The cold setting has brought some new sea features such as ice breaking and icebergs which are a pain in thewhen fighting off the enemy ships.Storyline is pretty short for a standalone game which is like 6 sequences or so. Also in my opinion the whole from assassin to Templar conversion is just too long. Might as well pop 23 missions with a good explanatory cutscene and let us fly the colours.It feels genuinely good to hunt assassins down, as a person who has finished all the AC franchise games some more than one, I always hated the assassins and their own self centered understanding of truth and freedom. In the end they are just some antipatic murderers who did not know what they were messing with. Meanwhile good guy Templars are just calculating, thinking, designing and keeping the order and peace. You will get to agree to that as you play along and see assassins and their cuntness. So yeah...All and all there are some minor bugs and glitches, I had to reload saves like 23 times because the guy I was supposed to kill was non existent and so on but it is a Ubisoft game so you already know what you are signing up for.As in performance it runs pretty smooth for a console port.As conclusion 8/10. Nothing extra new or special with the AC series but I hope to see a sequel to this one as playing as the Templars was pretty refreshing and badass. Get it while you can.
