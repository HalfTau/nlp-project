As the first Assassins Creed game I have played, I can say that I am impressed. The story is interesting, Its cool how historical events and people are placed into the characters life during the game. Rogues story was interesting, unfortunately it is really short. As a downside to the game I can see how some people might think that this game is repetitive to others such as Black flag and AC 3. I havent played these but know enough about the gameplay and content to understand that there are quite a few similarities between them that players might not like to see. Some of the content, including the sailing, is very closely related to previous Assassins Creeds. Despite this though, I would definitely recommend this game.
