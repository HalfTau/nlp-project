This game is quite something. The idea behind the story is great, the story itself is short and really flat. The new reagions and the new ways to conquer new territory are fun and well done.If youre like me and you want to gather all bonus stuff, chests, etc the time you spend on this game will be like 10  story and 90 running/sailing arround searching stuff its okay though.Compared to Black Flag I had way more bugs, like 6 gamefreeze/crash and 2 times i glitched threw the floor dying slowly in the cold water....Overall I believe its a good game and definitly a must have for fans. Its basicly a big DLC to Black Flag
