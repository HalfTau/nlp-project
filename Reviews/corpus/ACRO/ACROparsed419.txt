ProsStorylineI had a great grudge against Shay a few years ago, when this game came out. This was due to the drastic change from the Assassins pointofview to a more advanced Templar Knight pathway. I thought the game was going to a disappointment, but I was wrong. I was very wrong! This game shows you a path of the Templar, Shay Patrick Cormac. This game shows you how the Assassins can be wrong and how the Templars can be correct to their aim. To find freedom and peace, without chaos. But due to mostlikely eternal war between the two groups, chaos cannot be avoided. This game shows how a careless Assassin can become such a caring Templar. I recommend you play this game, the story line of the game is absolutely intriguing!Rating out of 10? I will give it an 8 out of 10.ConsBizarre ingame glitches such asAssassination targets standing upright, even though they have been killed.Beserk darts stuttering enemies constantlyBut these are minor problems, other than these issues, I really recommend this game to people who want a diferent view on Assassins Creed.
