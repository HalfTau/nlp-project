One of the best AC games in the series, despite using similar mechanics from AC3 and AC4 Black Flag. Shay Cormac is such an interesting character and it really allows the player to understand more of the Templar goals, as it lets you play as a Templar for the majority of the game. Unfortunately, the story is a little short, definitely shorter than its predecessors.
