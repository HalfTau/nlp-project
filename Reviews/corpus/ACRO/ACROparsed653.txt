First, I want to say I think this game gets a bad rep because of how much its like Black Flags. I think that in that regard, Ubisoft made the right call, taking the benefits of Black Flags and fixing it with a better story and a more relatable character. And removing those stupid proximity missions. However, in their attempts to make the game different, they took away from some of the fun everthing is northern and cold, and the shanties arent pirate shanties anymore. All in all, I think it was a successful attempt to fix the errors of IV, but i think they would have been better off creating a single game that combined the aspects of these 2. Alas, hindsight is 20/20.
