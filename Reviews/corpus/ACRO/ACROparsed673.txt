A worthy sequel to Black Flag. If you enjoyed the pirate loop gameplay of Black Flag this is more of it, but this time instead of the sweltering tropics youre in the snowy North Atlantic coast, the Hudson River Valley, and New York City. The maps are chock full of the usual trademark Ubisoft open world busywork arguably to pad the short story but this time around you get to see the other side of things by playing a Templar. Graphically it looks about as good as it can on the aged engine before the one Unity uses came out, but it runs very, very smoothly.Some interesting changes include being boarded by the enemy and ramming is sort of an ability now. Instead of just sailing toward a ship you can use the ram and your ship will charge at great speed, sort of like El Impoluto did to to you in Black Flag. The burning oil is also nice and more fun to use than Black Flags explosive barrels. Shanties of course return but sometimes the game just loves to throw wind gusts at you so many times which cancels the singing, a minor annoyance. Instead of Black Flags blowpipe you get an air rifle of sorts that provides the same function of darts as well as a grenade launcher with things like exploding gas grenades that can berserk a crowd of guards, or just use shrapnel grenades. In the end, much like Black Flag, the games leaves you wishing Ubisoft would have just committed to making the premise of these two games into their own series sans the Assassins Creed plot and universe.As we all know with Ubisoft games comes Uplay, so as usual before installing this game, make sure you download Uplay from the Uplay site first and foremost and get it completely updated, make an account, an optionally link it to Steam if you havent already. Then just leave it open and install the game as your normally would and it should do everything for you. If you have played the other AC games on Uplay you get some additional unlocks like Altair and Ezio outfits.
