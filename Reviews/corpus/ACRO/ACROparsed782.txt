I love this game very much! The story is an interesting take on the assassins tale and the combat is very entertaining. A person can get lost in time once they sit down to play this game. I feel as if it is overshadowed by AC4 and other more wellknown games in the franchise. This type of storytelling needs to be the standard for Ubisoft. Please support this game, it deserves it!
