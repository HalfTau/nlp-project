Rogue was a nice change of pace storywise, finally get to see the real purpose of the templars, and actually makes you wonder whats going on with the assassins order, having played all the time as an assassin you always thought you were going for the greater good, but have you?Performance wise, it is a port of the last AC game from previous generation consoles, it looks alright and performs surprisingly fine, locked at 60fps.This title is definitely one of the better ones, its easier to get into storywise if you havent played or arent interested in the whole series.
