finished the game and it was great, just starting to play again for the 2nd time and playing black flag at same time which is very much the same same sort of game which i like....got unity also which ive played afew hour of and its very diffrent again to the other two so cant wait to get stuck into that soon.Rogue to me is a follow on from blag flag which puts the wrongs in black flag right and then some, so give it a try its well worth the money now its dropped abit.
