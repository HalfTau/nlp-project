Takes the good from ACIV and from ACIII and sucsessfully combines them together. Whilst it may have a striking resemblance to ACIV, it adds plenty more to do in the huge Consisting of 3 separate maps world. Sadly, being designed for lastgen, it does limit the graphics capability, but the other elements overwhelm this lone flaw. Enjoy ACIII and/or ACIV? If so, this is a must have.
