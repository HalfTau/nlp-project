I liked this game more when it was called Assasins Creed IV Black Flag. Although being a gorgeous piece of eye candy to look at, nothing is new under the sun in the North Atlantic. They changed up a few weapons on the ships, a few different animations here and there, and TADA! NEW ASSASSINS CREED! If you really enjoyed BF, youll get more of the same in BF2. Which isnt necessarily a bad thing, it just gets old. A few really well done set pieces tie together this game, clearly designed with a drag and drop method of level design. I would personally give this game maybe a 7 out of 10 at best.In Assassins Creed IV Black Flag 2, youll assume the Role of Assassin Cormac, on a quest for revenge and booty. When teenagers with an absurd amount of attitude steal Assassin Cormacs manuscript, it is up to you to solve the mystery to save the world!Pros1. If you like Assassins Creed, nothing is broken. Its the same as the last 4 games.2. The game is pretty3. Ship combat is really well done4. Fun set piecesCons1. Bugs. Just.... bugs2. Its a new Assassins Creed with no fixes to the same wacky glitches thatll have you bursting at the seems with laughter3. REHASHED SHANTIES from Black Flag4. REHASHED SCORE from Black Flag5. Voice Actors phoned it in the whole time, or were people they pulled out of the break room in the office.6. Combat is lazily simple, its only challenging if you get a rimjob during fight scenes.
