Much like IV, a questionable Assassins Creed title, but an interesting exploration game. The story feels too condensed, and the climax of the game occurs during the transition from Assassin to Templar, which is fairly early on. The rest of the game flatlines. Most of it feels like a rehash of IV you might as well just play that game instead. The best part about Rogue as a whole is how Shay is constantly questioning the motives of the Assassins and Templars, right vs wrong, good vs evil, something we havent quite seen since the first Assassins Creed. Shay kills characters that feel like theyre supposed to be important, but theyre unintersting I care even less about the modernday story, more annoying computer hacking puzzles Stalkers are an interesting concept, but quickly become an annoyance Collectables yield unworthy rewards for all the hours spent getting them More of the same side missions and islands a lot of boring repetition Good balance between exploration on land and naval gameplay Assassins vs Templars, good vs evil conceptI dont recommend this game. There are better Assassins Creed games out there, like IV and any of the games before III.
