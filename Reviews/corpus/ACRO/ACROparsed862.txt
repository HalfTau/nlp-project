This is my review for Assassins Creed Rogue. I Hope you find it helpful.The ProsHuge open world, i mean HUGE.Smooth Navel CombatDozens of animals to huntLots of unique islands to exploreWell written campaignAmazing Graphics For a last gen gameThe ConsSometimes clunky animationsFairly frequent glitchesAwkward silences during campaignThe VerdictAssassins Creed Rogue is a joy to play. You can explore a vast open world, you can hunt lots of creatures, you can enjoy well done navel combat, you can discover dozens of unique islands to explore, or you can just cause havok in one of the many cities. Although there are some bugs, most of them can be overlooked. That is why im rating Assassins Creed Rogue a 8.7/10
