You get to put down the acrobatic anarchists and join the Templars.Its a nice change of pace from the player in white who hunts ebil knights story. Puts a different perspective on things, the game runs off of the assassins creed III engine with a bit of updating and optimizations, bringing back old characters and filling in some holes, i hope that we get to see more of shay and his assassin cleaving ways.May the father of understanding guide us.
