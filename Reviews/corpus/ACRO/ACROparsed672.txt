A wholly singular experience mottled by Uplay and a few directional glitches. Everything good from Black Flag and as far as I can recall, nothing bad. In fact, Id go so far as to say that if you have neither games, buy this one and dont even bother with Black Flag. Is Black Flag an amazing game? Yes. Is this game better, gameplaywise, yes. Black Flag got us started on this particular AC gameplay, Rogue perfected it. I played Black Flag twice as long, but mostly because all the cool things in Rogue came from Black Flag first and so I knew them all thoroughly.A big con is still the crafting system. Every island that claims it has a certain type of animals never seems to spawn them. And crafting ammunition is tedious and onedartbyonedart. What a waste.A big pro is naval battles seem better than ever. Even with a brig, a step down from Edward Kenways Frigate, being super tricked out has never felt so advantagious. Amazing pitched battles and enemies boarding your ship will really put you in the moment.Story ended quicker than I liked but mostly because I didnt do all the side quests. Definitely the most fresh approach to an AC game since they started the franchise. More than worth it on sale. Loads of content.
