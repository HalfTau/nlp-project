The game itself was awesome, the story was exciting and interesting kept me wanting to come back to it. The combat felt good, both the melee and the boat types. An odd thing to complain about, but the end credits. 10 minutes of my life waiting while they list every single person in every company who had any part at all in making the game/making the sandwhiches for the people who made the game among other things. Sure you can just leave it to run and go get a drink or something, but hidden there in the middle is a cutscene. After that is just more and more names so feel free to leave it to run
