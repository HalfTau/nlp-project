Im far from the first reviewer to point it out, but this is Black Flag 2. You get your ship even earlier, in fact. Im not sure why this one hasnt received much fanfare, but if you wanted more AC4 and less ACUnity, this is your answer.Theres still those annoying, trundling fetch quests  but without the ability to run, curse them  set in the present, but so far, Ive just muted them and obliged the TrundleMaster my name for the little dot that tells me where to go when I havent listened to the painful exposition and, well, at least its been brief. None at all would be best, but I suppose we must keep our expectations reasonable.
