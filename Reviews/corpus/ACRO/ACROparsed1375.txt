A heartwarming story and a touchy one about an Irish assassin who turns into a templar once he learns how wicked the brotherhood really is.If you want a different AC storyline game, this is the one.Its well optimized and naval combat is alot better than in Black Flag.Shay Cormac is by far the most interesting character in AC series, after Ezio and Arno.Definetly buy this game if you love AC games! In fact its better than Unity.
