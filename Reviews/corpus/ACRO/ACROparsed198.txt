Pretty sweet game, although the story was a little short, albeit was not meant to be the star on release since Unity came out during the same month and this one was designed to release only for the previous consoles. However, it is VERY important to the Assassins Creed storyline as it ties in AC3, Black Flag, and Unity. Environments were pretty cool.I did not encounter any major issues with the game as it ran pretty well. It was much better than I had expected considering Unity released the same month.
