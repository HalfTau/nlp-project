If you played one Assssins Creed game, you played them all. With Black Flag and Rogue beeing a tiny bit different, in a good way. I most of the titles minus sindicate and Unity, despite getting Unity for free and Rogue is the only one where I wasnt bored with the crapload of side activites that made me drop the title altogether.What I want to say, this is a bit of a fresh thing, as opposed to all the other games in the franchise.Also, dont get it if you are a completionist and need everything that shows up to be completed, as those games will make you go insane.Im on the line wether to even recommend this title or not, but if anything, I think this is the one of the lot worth checking out.Also optimized fairly well, It runs at 60 fps in 4k res/DSR.
