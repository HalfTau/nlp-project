Considering this was Ubisofts last Xbox 360 game, it was a good one to go out on.I really liked the story. Not as good as Black Flag, but definitely ranks up there. Characters are memorable, and locations are cool. The rifle disappointed me, however, because I longed for an Assassins Creed game where a rifle was an actual usable weapon that you carried, but it was only an air rifle. No worries though, it proves useful in the game.Something that struck out to me the most was the expanded naval combat. That was one thing in Black Flag that everyone, including me, absolutely loved. The inclusion of breakable ice and iceburgs was a really awesome thing to put in.Assassins Creed Rogue uses the same engine as Assasins Creed IV Black Flag, so if you experienced any clipping or bugs in that, youre bound to experience the same here, but thankfully none are gamebreaking.Shay is a greatTemplar and all, but whoever did his voice was horrible. The narration from Shay sounded like his voice actor was trying too hard, and his accent was portrayed terribly.Overall, its a great game. It has its flaws, but its perks and pros outweigh it.
