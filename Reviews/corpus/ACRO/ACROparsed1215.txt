I enyojed playing this alot more than AC Unity.Its like AC 4 Black Flag in a lot of ways and they managed to keep the fun aspects from it.If you start a new game then you cant buy certain items or start some of the side quests, but they are still there in the shops/map Instead of popping up overtime as you progress. when you try to buy something that you cant it just says that you havent gotten far enough in the games story.Its a shame that Unitys bad rep at launch dragged this game down with it.
