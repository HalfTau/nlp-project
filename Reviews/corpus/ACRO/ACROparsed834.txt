This game is not very good. The combat is horridyou can just feel how outdated it is, the parkour mechanics are still clumsy, a good portion of the moveslike counters, etc. are exactly the same as Black Flag. The naval combat is almost identitcal to Black Flag. Even though my computer is more than capable of running this game on the highest settings, it is choppy a lot of the time and during the cutscenes the picture jumps. I get there will be similarities, but this just feels like Black Flag with a story that is decent at best set in a different area. I am a huge fan of this franchise, but this game in my opinion is just not good enough to be enjoyable for very long. It makes me want to play Black Flag more than anything else to be honest.
