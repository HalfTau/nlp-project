After ACIII and Black Flag, Kenway saga is ongoing in this game but this time you are playing templar Shay. After playing all ac series, i need to accept to playing templar is more fascinating and enjoyable. Shay is hunting them and taking vengeance. Main menu theme soundtrack is awesome. Legendary ship battless are amazing and templar outfits more charismatic and stylish. I was planning to start tu unity after complete black flag but i saw in the market. There will be sale again, Rogue and unity packet at low price. Dont miss it. This game is looking like snack between black flag and unity. Give it a chance. Dont try to finish it quickly. Shays story will take you away and maybe at the end of game, you will be hater of assasins and become most dangerous templar. There is a huge three different maps. Its wonderful feeling and eye show at sunset traveling with your ship throught to ice mountains. Buy it in sale if you can, you will not be regret for this
