I gotta say WOW seriously, a game where you get top play on the Templars side.  That was something I wouldnt expect from Assassins Creed.  I for one thought it was awesome, to see from the perspective of the Assassins mortal enemies.  Im also happy that they kept elements from its predecessor in terms of naval combat, which ultimatley made Assassins Creed IV such a success.  This is one of the better AC games in the series and if you can nab it during a deal, do it.  I guarantee you will not be dissapointed.
