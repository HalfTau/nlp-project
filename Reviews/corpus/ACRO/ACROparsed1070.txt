This game is actually quite good.Its pretty much AC 4 with a new set of Paint and a few minor changes, some for the better, some for the worse.The Story is surprisingly interesting and somewhat well written.Seriously, the marketing for this game was horrible and if you thinkTheyre just trying to make it edgy so that little 13 year olds buy it youd be wrong.You play Shay whos supposed to become a fullfledged Assassin, but certain events happen which make him doubt that what hes doing is really for the good of humanity...This Game is what AC3 in my eyes should and could have been, a view into the Assassins lifelong enemies, the Templar Order. A view that tells us what circumstances can lead a man into becoming a Templar, what drives him to kill people who hed actually cared for and why we should stop thinking that theres only Good and Evil and no middleground.TLDR AC4 with other locations, better Story and minor changes.If you can pick it up during a sale itll definetly be worth your time and money.
