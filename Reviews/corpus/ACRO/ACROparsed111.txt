Its fine, but...God does it get repetitive after a while.I dont know if it has to do with the pacing, the way that the game introduces its missions, and side activities, or if it simply has to do with the fact that the game fails in creating the illusion of diversity whilst keeping the player repeating the same actions, over, and over again.After a while its as if all just blends together, and I just couldnt stand it after a while.It does have some brillant moments tho, for starters, I love the combat system in this game, I understand completely why some people always held Assassins Creed combat, as a whole, as one of the biggest issues in the series, but I always enjoy it, even if it was trivial at that.All you do its counter, watch an entretaining animation of the player murdering in a brutal way your enemies, and then you can chain those executions together.It incorporates several different elements of all the other Assassins Creed, and I enjoy that, I dont remember if the air rifle was ever present in any of the past entries in the franchise tho, so maybe thats new.Essentially, its a silent rifle that allows you to shoot darts that produce different effects to your enemies, its quite enjoyable to put a soldier to sleep, only to wake him up with a massive stomp in his stomach.Brutal, but enjoyabe, quite fun.However the flow of the combat, and exploration gets...Burst by the incredibly annoying sailing that you need to repeat, wherever you go to.It would be understandable to have a multitude of activities that you can complete while sailing, but besides being able to pick up certain things, and attacking other ships, there really isnt that much to do, which I resent, because it can get quite boring to just sail across the seas, at first it was quite relaxing, eventually it just became jarring.I ended up fast travelling to most of the places I needed to go to for this.Then the other issue that I have its in regards to the multitude of objectives, upgrades, and crafting, mechanics, and systems, that the developers incorporated in the game.I cant tell you how redundant, and unnecessary this are, in the hours that ive spended in this game ive yet to use any of the crafting systems, or even the act of just hunting animals around islands, I used it once during the tutorial mission, after that another time, and that was it.Theres just no incentive whatsoever to keep you doing this things, its as if you can carry just enough to get you through your journey, without pinning you against any real challenges, or situations in which you need to use any of those particular type of upgrades.Then there are the upgrades of the ship, and of your equipment, with the equiment, being the weapons that you can carry, like the pistols, and your trusty knife, and sword.Probably the last one of which its among the simplest to obtain, given you only need money, which you can get in a multitude of ways, with the ones from the ship being tedious to get, for the simple reason besides money you also need materials that you can find whilst attacking other ships.Which are hard to come by...To me, its as if Ubisoft has this checklist for every game, it is insane to me that just because say, something like the crafting system, worked wonders in Far Cry, they add it to this game.But they do it in such a blunt, and dumb way, to me is as if they took that system, and stapled it on top of their actual idea of the game they wanted to make.When this game is its own game, then it shines, and it provide me with an experience that I can relate only to the unique, and very special one I had with Assassins Creed 2, but for the most part, sadly, it suffers from a lot of the syndromes that current Ubisoft titles have...When I started this review I planned to recommend the game, and in a way I do, frankly if I could vote in a mixed way, I would, but since I cant, and really, in retrospective, the negative aspects of the game seem to be the ones that resonate the most.I have to lean to not recommend it...If anything, do buy it, but on a deep, deep discount.The story is fantastic, and maybe the one in years, that has truly surprised me, the turn at the end of sequence 2, and at the start of 3, was presented, and handled, masterfully.Really the only negative thing about the narrative for me, where the completely unnecessary and annoying Animus sequences, I really dont understand where that aspect of this games lies anymore, of whats trying to tell me, if anything at all, to me its a completely unnecessary slog in an otherwise fantastic story.
