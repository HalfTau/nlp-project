Its... more Assassins Creed 4. The gameplay is solid. I had fun with it, and now Im completing the optional content and having fun with that.But the whole betray the Assassins and fight them angle thats unique to Rogue is just... terrible.I know that the  Assassins Creed games were never particularly philosophically deep, but... goddamn. This is the game in which you really needed to figure out what Templars and Assassins stand for beyond the most superficial possible cliches, find out how they differ from each other. And theres absolutely nothing there.Also, fighting Assassins just isnt the least bit interesting. They are nothing more than reskinned Jaegers / Captains from previous games. They run away in circles, while farting out gas bombs and bullets. I hesitate to say so, but the QTE battles of previous games, or spot the counter to this guy were actually better. I had exactlyAssassin ship board me, and I was fairly thorough about exploring the sea. Also, the plot is actually terribly low stakes.So just about everything good about the game can be summarized as more of Black Flag.Also, the game is fairly glitchy, but thats pretty much expected ofCreedEdit  The protagonist s bland as . I just finished the game, and the only character trait I can recall is his insistence on spouting IMAKEMYOWNLUCK at every opportunity.Editx2  Wrote this review having finished the main missions. I wanted to find out which settlements the game actual made you visit over the course of the game, and its like 1/10th of the total locations.
