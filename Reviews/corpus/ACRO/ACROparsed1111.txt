i had difficulty getting throught the game activation due to the uplay installer. i manage to get it up and running after going to the uplay website and download the uplay pc and boom! im able to activate and play it soon after that. my advice to those who have issues with it, dont panic. try downloading the latest UPLAY PC at their website and see how it goes from there.
