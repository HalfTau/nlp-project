Gameplay same as Black Flag, at least, for sequence one. The game, after sequence one, begins to open up, and while Shays mechanics are the sameexcept for a gas mask, which makes him immune to smoke bombs if you pull it on time but no more diving segments. However, heres what makes the game unique You are a templar, so, now, instead of fighting the Templar guardsDont worry, normal guards are still there and you can fight them, you fight the assassins. Fitting of how the assassins have always worked, they will hide and take cover to stay out of shays sight. Get too close, and they perform an assassination, effectively taking out half your health, then run awayLike the Stalkers in ACR. But, since they are now trained enemies, dont think you can chase them and just stab them, no, that is how you die. Instead, shoot them.But, better off, you can use your eagle vision to search them out and kill them. You can approach their hiding spot and just stab themthough you have to be quick for that, or shoot them. But, if you arent fast and out of ammo, shay has several options for getting them out of cover. I havent played too far into the game, but this is a unique change in gameplay, intercepting assassinations and others of the such.
