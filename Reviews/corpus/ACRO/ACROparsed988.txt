This game was great then out of nowhere, the game ended. By far the shortest game I have ever played but this game is basically just a glorified black flag. And I love black flag.Pros Great graphicsInteresting storyCool charactersNice gameplayCons the game is so short, half of my 12 hour time played was just free roam and leveling up my character assuming the game would get hard, I was wrong.Easiest assassins creed I have ever played.No use in ship upgradingNo use in character upgradeAnd takes less than a day to beat8/10 just for the great New York free roam and new economy system and salary
