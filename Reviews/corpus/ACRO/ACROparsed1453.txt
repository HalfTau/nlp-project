Can honestly say, this is by far the most interesting and engagingCreed since Ezio doing his silly walk.I havent played 3 or 4, but I can certainly say by looking at footage this game gives a very condensed and efficient experience that would be comparable to either/both of those games.Although the full price may be a bit much for some people as of this, 40, even I feel like I pretty much did evertying I had the stamina for 90 unlock, all treasure, setllements, animus shards, etc. Didnt manage the 100 sync on misssions or viking stuff. However I did manage to get it for a bit cheaper and feel the experince was worth it.
