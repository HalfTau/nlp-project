Even though Ive played over 30 hours and finished the main story, I just cannot recommend this game to anybody except maybe people like me on a mission to play through all the Assassins Creed games in order to date.Maybe its because I just played the other two sailing/pirate games that it copies all its assets from, Im just burned out on this storyline.But what I think for me was the feeling it was just a lifeless empty shell of a story designed by a team of too many people who could not agree on what makes a fun assassins creed game.They just recycled too many old gameplay items from the previous games, and did a bad job stringing them together in this compilation of old assests. They never did a good job of making you as a player feel invovled in the story or give you any motivation to explore and search the map for new and exciting treasures. It just was all flat.So in summary, I just cannot recommend you wasting your time with this one unless like I said you really want to try them all out and get them on sale like I did. Its not a horrible game, just dissapointing.Also I have to say the parkour aspect of the game was really bad here, it felt the worst in the series for your character running up the wall instead of going through the door, jumping the wrong way off something, sitting on a chest instead of opening it, freezing while climbing up a wall instead of moving up, etc. Something was just off and ruined the smooth flow of the usual AC parkour. It felt like it was very unpolished and missing something.
