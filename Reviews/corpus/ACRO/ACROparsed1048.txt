One of the best AC games. AC 2, 3 and 4 combined. Alternate style of story.Probably one of the best Assassins Creed games I have ever played. Completely looked over by people, due to the reason being a sort of side game being released at the same time as the next gen Unity. This game combines the enviroment of 3, the gameplay of 4, and the music of 2. The storyline is great as well, as you play as a templar rather than an assassin. Well, you technically play as an Assassin who moved towards the templars due to the main character seeing that the Assassins were quite thirsty for freedom. Meaning theyd do anything for it.
