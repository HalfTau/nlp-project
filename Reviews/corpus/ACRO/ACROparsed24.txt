Oh dear... After playing black flag which was superb, I really hoped this was going to be a more polished iteration of the game, instead I was just thrown headfirst into the confusing story without any kind of background, straight into my ship which I didnt feel I even remotely earned or deserved... the main protagonist is very weak in regards storyline, and even looks and plays weak compared to all the other assassins creed characters I have played before.This really feels like a black flag copy designed with the bare minimum of interest and progression and just comes across as a quick money grab to keep the AC fans occupied until the next version...Check the online reviews before buying it, I wish I had, I might have saved some money for this feeble game, shame on you guys at UBI youthe bed on this one
