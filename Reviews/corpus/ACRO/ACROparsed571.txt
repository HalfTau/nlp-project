The only Assassins Creed where you get to play as a Templar. That should be reason enough to play this, but there is a story dynamic here that needs to be seen. For the first time the Assassins arent the force of good most other games portray them to be. After playing this Im convinced the Assassins and Templars need each other to balance them out.From a gameplay standpoint its essentially a Black Flag thats got several new additions that make things a lot of fun. Its very short, but sweet.
