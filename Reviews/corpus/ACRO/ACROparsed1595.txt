Just finished this game for the first time. At first I was a bit displeased with it. But now that Im familiar with the new mechanics and Items, I absolutely love this game. Its so much better then Unity and Im so thankful that they decided to bring it to PC. Speaking of which, its a flawless PC port, and thats a rarity these days amongst Unisoft games.I consider Black Flag to be the best Assassins Creed to date, so naturally rogue is a close second.9.5/10Will spend countless more hours replaying this game.
