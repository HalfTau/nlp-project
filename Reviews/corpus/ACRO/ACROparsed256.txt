Is ok, no buy recommendation.I skipped all cutscenes I could and didnt watched the others but I guess the story is pretty standart.I came for the gameplay and its like Black Flag 1.1 so nothing to see here, if you want more of Black Flags gameplay just play Black Flag.It also locks a lot of upgrades behind story progression and the first third is basically a tutorial.
