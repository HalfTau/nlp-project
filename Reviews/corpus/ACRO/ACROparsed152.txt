The performance is just an insult. The 60 fps lock? And basically my GPU and CPU are idling all the time.Black Flag was a good game, this seems like a failed copy of it.After playing the game I can say that the story was ok. But the game runs on rails. All the climbing and fighting is so automated and easy that it doesnt really feel like an achievement to finish a mission or anything else. And on top of that there is just too much unused content that is in no way tied to the main story. Sure you can hunt animals or capture forts but in the end the game is so easy that you really dont need to do any of that.
