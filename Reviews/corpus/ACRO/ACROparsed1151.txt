ProsGood storyGood new naval features/settlementsThe world was very good especially new york, more interesting than black flag.Cons Story was too short More buggy than black flag no pirates. Really REALLY anoying first mate.Conclusion.I would pick it up for cheap on a sale if you liked black flag for under 5. Very silmilar to black flag but just not as good
