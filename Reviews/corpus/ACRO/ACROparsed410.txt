Not a bad game to pick up on sale if you enjoyed Black Flag and want something that is more of the same with a few tweaks, the story was alright but didnt feel as special as some other AC games, especially Black Flag, by the time I was done I felt as sick of I make my own luck. as I was of arrow in the knee and stole your sweetroll in Skyrim.In terms of game balance as it was in Black Flag so it is in Rogue, the various poison darts can completely dominate the majority of challenges the game puts in your path. Berserk darts allow for methodical zero combat clearing of ridiculous numbers of enemies, and this time youre limited to two pistols. Speaking of pistols, to get what seemed to be some of the better pistols in the game you have to collect all of an item in the real world / abstergo portions of the game, but these can only be accessed towards the very end of the story, rendering them a little pointless.Similarly the better swords are locked behind the naval campaign which is a slow steady plod of waiting half an hour then starting the next mission then waiting slightly longer to start the next etc and ultimately is pretty unrewarding since the primary rewards are money. Money is absolutely no issue in this game once you pass the point where you access the bank and renovations, in fact I wasted money deliberately by buying the vast majority of the animal items I needed for crafting and still never felt a lack of it, meanwhile I was scrounging for basic materials for ship upgrades and wishing I could just buy them to diminish my ridiculous fortune of tens of thousands of british pounds in the 1700s, likely equating to millions in modern terms.The ending felt a bit rushed, we get the final abstergo sequence, a short story ending which is a bit dull and pedestrian by the standards of the rest of the game, and then credits roll and roll, and roll, and roll if you let them, lot of people worked on this game before youre dumped back on a dock to freeroam and finish collecting things for achievements if you so wish.Overall it is good, but not great.
