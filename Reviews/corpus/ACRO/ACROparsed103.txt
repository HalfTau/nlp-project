Whilst painfully short, Rogue is a great example of the AC Canon being read in such a way that blends both the Assassin and Templar stories, and makes you question truly who is right and who is wrong.The story bridges the gaps between Black Flag and III, respectively before and during the American Civil war. Its very interesting to see how the characters developed, and with the obvious set up to Unity. It is slightly rushed at the beginning, Shay could have used more time to develop his motivations but its enjoyable nevertheless.Essentially Black Flag 2.0, the gameplay mechanics such as naval combat, warehouse raids, hunting etc are carried over with a few new additions. These additions are fun, but I personally would have preferred a longer main story arc as sometimes the map screen is full to bursting with collectibles.I am an unashamed fan boy of the series, but not a fan of the direction it has headed. Rogue is what the series could have been heading towards, with the creative department, not the financial department, leading the helm.
