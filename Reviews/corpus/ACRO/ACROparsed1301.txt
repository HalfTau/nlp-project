I actually expected more of this game. Sure, its a good game, dont get me wrong. But it felt like the game couldve been so much better. The main quests felt a little bit... dull? I kind of expected a short movie when you kill one of the main characters instead of just shooting them in the head or assassinating them by just stabbing them in the back.Ive finished the main quests. Well, the only thing to do now is to kill random guards, explore the world, and upgrade your ship and such. Not worth it. Feels like wasting time.Combat is awesome though and the story was okay...
