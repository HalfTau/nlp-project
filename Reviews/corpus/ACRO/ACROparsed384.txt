Was AC4 lite basically. Was really fun and had a lot of new things that werent in other AC games but overall it was still mostly just AC4. The biggest addtion in my opinion was letting you fight assassins and having to keep an eye out for em. Assassins as enemies in an assassins creed game was actually really unique and fun and I hope they make another game where you play as a templar but more modern because id love that mechanic/enemy to be expanded upon.
