I played Rogue right after Assassins Creed III, both were awesome, and the stories compliment eachother greatly. If you havent played either, id recommend both in that orderRogue was a great mix of AC3 and Black Flag, most peoples favorites. Shay isnt anywhere near as likeable as past characters, but then again hes a filthy templar.
