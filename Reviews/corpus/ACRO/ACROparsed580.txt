Basically a Story Expansion on ACIVBlack Flag. AC Rogue is a surprisingly fun and entertaining, albiet short game.For the cheap price its at its a good little piece of AC to play if your PC cant run the awfully optimized ACU or ACS.The protagonist is likeable, similarly to Edward Kenway, also similar to Edward Kenway is the fact the game pretty much copied and pasted the mechanics of ACIV and replaced some things with new although pretty much identical features.Overall, this is a nice game for the price, but dont expect too much in the way of a long storyline, or innovative and new gameplay.
