Just another Assassins Creed game with bunch of sailing, jumping on roofs and killing people. The plot makes surprisingly a little more sense than in previous games, revenge plots are always decent because you want to kill all of those s, the same in Assassins Creed 2, and finally you get to murder the assassins. Since they started to profile like commies, I wanted to kill them and now I got the chance, templars are just little bit more cool. Runs like a charm on PC. All in all, much better game then Unity or Syndicate.
