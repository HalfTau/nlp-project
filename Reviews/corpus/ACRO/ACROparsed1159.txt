So 1 thing first, Im a huge AC 4 fan and this is a second version of it with improvement. combat is nice I guess, not special or anything. The map is big and upgrading your ship takes a while. It took me, Im a good gamer master if you ask me, 14 hours first time. Optimization is good, probably the best optimized game by Ubisoft but ofcourse this game look The reason why I dont recommend is is the story. It totally sucked and let me tell you why no spoilers In the beginning its interresting but it wanders off very quickly. Youll need to play it yourself but I will tell you, you will regret putting the hours in it. Its plane and stupid. My rating is still positive but keep in mind I didnt like it.6/10
