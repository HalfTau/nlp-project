One of my favorite Assasins Creed games ever made. I bought this orginally on PS3, played the hell out of it and bought it again on the Thanksgiving sale thats how much I like it.Playing as a Templer is an upgrade on just an Assassin that you play as in Black Flag as you get access to development of buildings similar to AC 2 which helps with getting money and giving you less grinding to do you only need to grind for resourses mainly metal and even that is easier in Rogue. It wont be long until you have more money then you know what to do with you get so much.Everything is an upgrade on 4 from bigger maps to better Shanties with the exception of Ledgendary battles I thought where better in 4 as the 3 battles in Rogue theyre much easier and the ships themselves didnt really trigger any emotion like the first one. The exception is epic legendary battle unlocked after you beat the first 3 which took me ages to beat on PS3 luckily I beat it first go on PCI really hope they make a sequal to this at some point. Love getting around in the ships and gives us a break from city life that most of the series has been.
