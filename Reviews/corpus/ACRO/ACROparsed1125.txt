My favourite would be Assassins Creed Rogue because it allows you to play from a completely new perspective, the Templars. Simple put, i like the Templars from all the Assassin Creed games. The Templars are resembled as evil but in this episode they are protectors of the people from the vicious ways of the Creed. I enjoy all the Templar aspects of this game including the outfits, maps, secrets and the members of the secret Order.
