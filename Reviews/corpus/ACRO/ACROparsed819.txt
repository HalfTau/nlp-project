If you like Assassins Creed then youll like this game. It makes you think a lot about what it means to be an Assassin and what it means to be a Templar.Only issue i have with the game is that its very ship focused. Granted i know thats just a product of the era and the game wouldve been way more boring without the ships but i feel like there isnt as much free running to do.
