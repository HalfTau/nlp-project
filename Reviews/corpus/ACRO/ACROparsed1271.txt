Not quite as engaging storywise as Black Flag, but its still interesting to see the Templar side of things. Better optimized than Black Flag, though that may be because theres less content, its a port from lastgen consoles, etc. Unfortunately the main protagonist has a boring personality.Still recommended if you liked Black Flag, because youll probably like this.
