This is an awesome game and i really like it. Here are the pros and cons                                                                                                             PROS  Has an amazing storyline and it really sucked me in to the story.                                                                                                                     The characters are really awesome and well made.                                                                                                                                                                            It has a really cool twist in the story and at the end there is a little hint concerning AC Unity try to find it play, the beginning of Unity and see if you can find it. The combat is really fluid and just Assassins Creed 4. You get some cool new weapons too. The ship shanties are very catchy.CONS It does rely heavily on sailing and some of the ship missions are frustrating. The credits are LONG Some of the missions are VERY FRUSTRATING so if you are a beginner at Assassins Creed DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME FIRST PLAY ASSASSINS CREED 1.So as you can see this isnt the perfect game but it is well close to there.
