Its pretty okay. If youve played all the other Assassins Creed games, and you want more of the same, then its worth playing. Dont expect anything new from the series though. Theres familiar weapons, familiar combat, a weak story.. Consider it to be a standalone expansion, and buy it on sale at a price you think matches that.
