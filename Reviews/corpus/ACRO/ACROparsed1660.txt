This is the type of game we should have gotten when AC3 came along.Graphics are nothing to awe at, It is very much a console port, and its very clear at times, even at max settings though it does have its moments and Is by no means ugly.Optimized really well for a change, even better than Black Flag For me, anyway.Story is a nice change, and the mix of both old and newish AC game mechanics work fine.All in all, a nice step back In the right dirrection.
