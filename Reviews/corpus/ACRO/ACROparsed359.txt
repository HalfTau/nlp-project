Ill be the first to admit that I smashed through this game as quickly as possible just to get the story done. I didnt even attempt to collect everything or 100 the game. I did enjoy what I did see though. I would get this next time its on a sale for anyone thts on the fence as Im sure thats what I did.Graphics were good. Story was good. Controls were good though did have some problems in places.
