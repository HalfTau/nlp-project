More Assassins creed...If we consider the game in itself, it is actually pretty good it is everything AC III should have been, with some help from AC IV. However, it does not exist outside of its franchise, and all the cool stuff that would have made AC III a good game and that made AC IV a decent game is already familiar, and this game made no effort in renovating the gameplay.The beginning of the US were mildly interesting in AC III pirates were awesome in AC IV ships were something new in both however, they were cool because they were something different. Now, they feel like something seen again and again. When you expect to play an assassin and actually spend most of your time attacking ships, it gets old pretty soon. However, you cannot completely skip this part either, because without a powerful ship you cannot go on with the story.All of this said, the story is definitely better than its immediate predecessors, and if you liked Black Flag you will love this too. I still feel like recommeding it because it is a good Assassins Creed, but as a game in general it has many traits of a missed opportunity.
