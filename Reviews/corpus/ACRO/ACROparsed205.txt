So I missed this game when it first came out and I got it in a pack with several other AC games. If you enjoy the sailing in Black Flag then this game is basically more of that. Shorter than BF, and I found a couple of bugs involving movement Like my character trying to jump up the same bit of wall over and over again but overall its a good game and if you can get it cheap I would recommend it.
