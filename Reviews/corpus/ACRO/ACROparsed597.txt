This game is essentially Black Flag 2.0. If you liked Black Flag like I did and this is at least 15 off, I highly recommend it. The engine is the same, and a lot actually all except 1 that I can think of of the mechanics were kept. As such, Rogue doesnt bring anything new gameplay wise except the grenades and the air rifle, which are pretty neat. However, its still a good game that wraps up the North American chapter of the series nicely.Pros  Naval combat was kept from AC4, with the addition of a ram dash.Protagonist is more interesting at least IMO than previous AC heroes.Storywise, there are nice hints to other AC titles, like AC4, and a clever easter egg to the beginning of AC Liberation.Combat feels fluid, controls are well optimized.Sword and dagger combo replace the ol sword from past AC titles, bringing a breath of fresh air to combat.New feature  Assassins HQ, which are a nice addition to the franchiseNew feature  Stalkers, who use assassin tactics that can give you the ol onetwo if youre not paying attention.Cons  Older target hardware is evident  Rogue doesnt look bad at all, but the animations are somewhat clunky.Story feels a bit rushed particularly towards the end.Dialogue writing is completely telegraphed and breaks away from Edward Kenways pirate swagger in AC4.The game doesnt really give you an incentive to explore the world  most of the story missions are in the same few places, so you can fast travel through most of the story.TLDR  This game is halfway between a new game and a Black Flag DLC. Buy it if you have the money and / or if you liked Black Flag. 8/10
