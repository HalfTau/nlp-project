Great game! I dont understand all the mixed reviews on this game not on steam. Great story for any AC fan, and bridges the gap between AC 3 and Black Flag. My only real 2 negatives would be the story is way too short, half of what a normal AC game is, and they didnt change enough of the naval combat from black flag. If your deciding whether to get this or Unity definetly buy this. Unity was by far the worst AC game.
