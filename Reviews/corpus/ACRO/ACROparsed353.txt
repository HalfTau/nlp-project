Hello all! ACR is an excellent game and definitely radical in its story. I actually liked being the templar. The game flips the script on the assassins in a revealing way. For the first time in the series I actually didnt like the assassins. Story telling was that good! In the end, it really was up to you to decide if you were evil/good based on your perception of the overall story plot. I LOVED THAT! Game mechanics was pretty standard which I prefer. Decently large world with an endgamelegendary ship battles. Enjoy!
