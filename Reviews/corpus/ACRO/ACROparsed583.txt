Imagine Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, make it twenty times better gameplay wise and story wise, and you have an amazing Assassins Creed game.Thats exactly what this game is.This game was highly underrated because of AC Unity having a close release date to it, but I must protest that this is one of the best AC games I have ever played. Not only does it add many new gameplay elements, it also has a rich story that ties in perfectly with Unity and shows and references Black Flag and AC III characters multiple times ingame, and made me cry. Maybe because Im a baby, I dont know. Honestly this game changed my whole perspective on templars and now Im not sure which side I support. I cant say too much because I dont want to give you spoilers, but I highly recommend you check this game out. Its worth it.10/10 would turn on the brotherhood again
