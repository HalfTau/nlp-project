Few years old now but still looks great to my eyes and runs at 60 with fullsettings on a midlow end machine i53350/Nvidia GTX960. As for the gameplay, its essentially AC4Black Flag dressed in AC3s North American colonial clothes. Very enjoyable, but probably not something to play immediatelyt after AC4 else you might find it a bit samey. Deffo worth a buy in a Steam sale.
