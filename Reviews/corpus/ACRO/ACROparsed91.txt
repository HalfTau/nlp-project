Does some right things, for the wrong reasons.As a pirate, you couldnt stabber random strangers up. This made little to no sense. As a heartful young man, who converted to templars from assassins, because assassins happened to kill a bounch of innocents to then be able to stabber random innocents up... also makes little to no sense.Assassins creed Rogue seems to be the game where they took all the criticisms about previous games story, ability... etc. And put them all together. Its a bit like a wishlist of things for people whove played previouscreed games, and felt something was missing or unjustly removed. Sadly, it doesnt always make sense put together.Ive been less inclined to to 100 this thing than previous games, but it might actually be due to the sheer content. There are a LOT of things to do.If I could level one criticism, its that theres an unbearably annoying trilling/almostwhistle sound in sound effects in new york, becasue of which Ive disabled effects. But thats a minor point.Overall, Id still highly recommend it. Its a fresh take in thecreed universe, that does good world building, and gives the players what they wanted.PS This game has one of my favourite quotes ever concerning Melanie in a nasal, high pitch and sped up voice Super chipper overachiever
