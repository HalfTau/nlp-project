Im 15 Hours into the game, and havent come close to finishing the 4th sequence. The game struggles with some pacing problems, but when I can go do whatever I want, Its a beautiful game. My other main concern is that when there was alot going on, I had a very noticeable lag, and I died a few times. Its an awesome game otherwise, and is a must play for AC Hardcores or casuals
