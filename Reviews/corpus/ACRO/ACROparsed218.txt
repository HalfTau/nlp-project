Yet another recycled ubisoft idea. Its so tedious, boring and repetitive that was struggling every minute of it. Rogue reminds me of a mobile phone game, upgrade ship, find million collectibles, repeat. The game has become even clunkier as well. Purchased on a sale and still regret it, dont make the same mistake as i did.
