ASSASSINS CREED ROGUE is not a typical AC and trust me when I am saying this, for the price a really worthwhile experience.As far as connections to AC3 and AC4 Black Flag  Freedom Cry go many old friends are present in this game so I would suggest playing those ones before this title.The graphics are on the standart of AC4 Black Flag and dont differ very much, the soundtrack however is mostly fresh and partly a mixup from AC3 and AC4, and does perfectly underline the events in the game.The mechanics are based on AC4, but some animations got reworked.There is also much new content which doesnt appear in AC4 and kind of reminds of the gang mechanics in AC6 Syndicate which is awesome.Storywise its an awesome expirience especially if you played the mentioned parts, with many unexpected turns and a very well portrayed protagonist.After you are done playing this game I would suggest playing on with ASSASSINS CREED 5 UNITY as the ending of AC Rogue directly ties up to this game, and you even see the protagonist of AC5 in a young stage.So I am done playing this game to 91 completion after 30 hours and to sum all up it has been an extreme pleasure, especially for me a series fan.
