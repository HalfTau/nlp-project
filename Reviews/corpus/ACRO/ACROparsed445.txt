Itll scratch that Assasins Creed itch.I enjoyed playing from the the Templars point of view, the story does a good job of justifying the main characters motivations for turning against the Brotherhood and serves as a prequel to both AC3 and AC Unity. There isnt much in the way of content I played close to 20 hours, half of which was me messing around trying to improve my character and get cool armor, but its worth picking up on sale.
