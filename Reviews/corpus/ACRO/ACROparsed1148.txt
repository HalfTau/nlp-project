THIS is what AC3 SHOULD have been. Good stealth, fun sea battles. lots of things to do, an interesting world to explore, a wonderfully fresh story and perspective, and the story ties in with Unity and AC3. If you are an AC fan, or you were disappointed in AC3, then I seriously recommend picking this up. It is a good step in the right direction and I really enjoyed it. The only real problem I have with it is the ridiculous amount of arbitrary collectables that litter the world.All in all, 30 is a good price for the content it offers so go get it.
