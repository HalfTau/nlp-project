AC Rogue is one of the best Assassins Creed ever made in my opinion. Even though its mechanics are basically taken from Black Flag and tweaked a little, this game truly feels original. The Story is fresh, Shay is a lovely character with a believable story, and the game is very well optimized for PC. Also, ive had only 1 gamebreaking bug in my entire playthrough. I recommend it to everybody!
