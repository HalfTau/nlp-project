Assassins Creed Rogue is what Assassins Creed Unity should have been ... a wonderful game.Short VersionStoryline  9.5 / 10Storyline Length  8 / 10Side Missions  10 / 10Complexity  10 / 10Graphic  9 / 10Sound / Music  10 / 10Overall  9,5 / 10Long VersionI am a pretty hardcore Assassins Creed fan, having played every single Release of the Francise and enjoyed it quite a lot. After Assassins Creed Unity however I was almost about to quit. Almost ... because thankfully I gave Assassins Creed Rogue a chance. And it didnt dissappoint !The old trusty BlackFlag Engine did every well.And yes, Id rather have a working fluent x1 engine, than seeing a 10 FPS flirring shadows and waterreflections nextgen engine.They have added a lot of new content and zones to the game so it is not all all feeling like you would be playing BlackFlag 1.1 ... you are rather playing BlackFlag 2.0If you liked ACBF you will love ACR
