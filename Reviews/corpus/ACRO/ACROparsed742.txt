This game is an obvious economic repackaging of the main mechanics of AC4 Black Flag and AC3, and features a lot of the classic Ubisoft tropes and carries over many details from AC4, such as almost identical combat.That said, what is added is the most cohesive Assassins Creed game since II, or at least Brotherhood. The wide sprawling naval and land areas are absolutely full of not only boring collectibles, but interesting activities, that stay interesting far longer than youd expect.They obviously took the oppurtunity of developing a secondrate AAA sequel alongside AC Unity to experiment with the mechanics and formula that has defined AC for a long time, the reversal of roles as a Templar opposed to Assassins means being stalked by Assassins, having to prevent them carrying out Assassinations a reverse of mission types such as in Revelations and helping the British fight the French the Ten Years war is the backdrop to the story as it is technically a prequel to AC3.Slight changes in the way you do normal mundane Ubisoft open world collection chores means its a less tedious for a while, and the additions to sailing, mainly the ice breaker ram and the ability of enemy ships to ram and board you makes the naval part of the game feel very different whilst the regular gameplay loop of firing cannons repositioning and firing remains exactly the same.Its my opinion that the executive figures of Ubisoft will always demand the focus of their developers be on the graphical aspect of their games above all else focus groups aside, graphical fidelity is visual and extremely easy to sell as a major plus in an otherwise mediocre program, but AC Rogue is a window into what would happen if the developers of these games were given some freedom. Turns out it wouldnt be bad.
