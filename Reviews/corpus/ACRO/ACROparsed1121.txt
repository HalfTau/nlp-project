this game is one of the best hidden gems of recent memory. Overshadowed by the boring bug fest unity,this is game for people who loved assassins creed 4 and just want more, with a litlle AC3 thrown in the good bits of that game.the game isnt perfect hacking, or rather fixing, PCs in the modern day part of the game isnt very good. but at least its a far cry pun intended from those godawful glyths of AC2. the entire modern day plot is a bit rushed and the dialogue is a bit sloppy amoung the NPCs i think we have a modern day equivelent to i used to be an adventurer like you, but then i took an arrow in the knee.We have never before in this series had a proper look at the other side of the Assassin/Templar coin. this is definately worth your time.
