Assassins Creed Rogue, or a better yet, Black Flag 2 by no means a bad thing, is one of the better Assassins Creed games since they became a yearly event. It reuses a lot of Black Flags assets but, this isnt unexpected, they use the same engine and do many of the same things. If you enjoyed Blackflag which if you like Assassins Creed or Pirate Games, you did.Now, lets address the issues Its essentially Blackflag with a different story, not very many new things are introduced.Theres this one chase sequence that is very easy to  up, and end up chasing them around New York forever.The same occasional thing where youre looking just barely the wrong way and Shay spazzes out and wont move.The Good fun Naughty Bits  The story is good, its a perspective you dont usually see from these games. You get the Rope Dart really early on, it will become your best friend, I honestly didnt know it could do so much when I played Blackflag You get an Ice Ram. It rams through Ice. Its a fun time. You get to be an Irish man who makes his own luck, fresh every morning, like in olden times.All in all. If you like Asscred gams, buy this one. It actually runs, unlike unity, from what Ive heard. Its more of Blackflag, and is actually a really solid link between the high seas of Black Flag, and the gangs of Syndicate. You see more of Haytham Kenway, seeing as the game spans from 1750ish to 1776, its his term as Grand Master of the Templars. Your first mate is a cartoon character, the second one, after you get into the meat of the game. All in all, really solid Assassins Creed title, if its on sale, get it.
