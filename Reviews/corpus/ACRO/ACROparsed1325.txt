This game is amazing. Though before buying it I thought it was a copy and paste of AC4 and AC3, it still is, and it has only decent gameplay. combat is choppy. But the story makes up for it, the story is probably the best part of it, it seems kinda of odd playing as a Assassin turned Templer. But it is amazing story, fitting in all the missing pieces of the past Assassins Creeds So if you are unsure of buying this game get it!! But not the DLC 7 dollars for 10 min of bonus content nuh uh.
