Assassins Creed Rogue, is a good game despite of the flaws. I finish the game in 21 hours with sidetracking for the side missions and collectibles. If you focus on the main mission alone, you could finish it in 1012 hours its way much shorter than the previous ACPro Naval battle is good. Smoother than Black Flag Good song while traveling with ship Ok story, the ending is will cover some parts of the next AC UnityCons Short, too short. AC IV has more story missions than this game. Too many collectibles, typical Ubis lack of creativity open world game, if you have OCD, buying this game is a bad idea. Apparently there is no lip sync in this game.If you are a fan or just like naval battle, get this game when its on sale. Dont buy it on full price, cause its not worth that much, you dont want to pay 60 bucks for a game about collectibles arent you?
