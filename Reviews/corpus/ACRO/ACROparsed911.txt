Perhaps my favourite installment in the franchise. Rogue is the first AC game to finally offer an in universe Templar perspective, giving the player a different viewpoint into the the realm of AC and an opportunity to consider the motivations of a group that is typically portrayed as a mob of clandestine sycophants hellbent on ruining the lives of the poor schumcks outside their clique. Although some of the plot and dialogue are a little wearisome I find this to be the case with ninety percent of video games , the main story arc is engaging and brings a fresh take to the typical AC narrative. First impressions of the game were solid as well just about anything beats playing through the first twenty minutes to halfhour of a game as a prepubescent goofing around in bushes or stealling things... While the gameplay is virtually identical to Black Flag, I didnt mind too much having to learn new keybindings for every bloody game pun intended they release gets a little wearisome. Additionally, since its set in North America, the boreal landscape is a pleasant deviation from Black Flags lush West Indies, while still retaining a good sense of adventure. Most of the gear is the same, with a few minor exceptions, and I personally feel the available outfits and the ship design are infinitely preferable to BF. I recommend it most to diehard fans of the series, but I believe most people would be able to get something out of Rogue, provided they arent bored by playing a game overly similar to its predecessors.
