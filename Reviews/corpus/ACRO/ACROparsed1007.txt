After replaying Black flag once again, I decided it was about time to try one of the other Assassins Creed games.And what better game to do so than with Rogue. Its very similar to Black flag, pretty much everything is the same, except for the story and items.The game is beautiful! With white mountains and green fjords almost makes you feel like a viking sailing around.And with the map being so huge there is alot of exploring to do. Specially when the main storyline made you only go to like 1/3 of the places ? !The only real disappointment was that the storyline was a little boring compaired to black flag, and it was SHORT. Like completed in under 9 hours short.BUT if you are like me and love black flag, you should really give Rogue a go.7/10
