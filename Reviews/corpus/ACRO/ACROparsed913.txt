Surprisingly longer than I expected twss. If you liked the ship battles and shanties of Black Flag then you will enjoy this game. It doesnt really add a whole lot to the overall story outside of the animus, but who knows how theyll tie it in later. I actually played a little of Unity before this, and I love how they tied these two games together in the ending of Rogue.
