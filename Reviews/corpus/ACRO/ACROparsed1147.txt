I picked Rogue up during a Steam sale when it was 66 off, because I felt really let down by Unity. At first I didnt want to give the Assassins Creed franchise another shot, but Id heard good things about Rogue and seeing it was a year old already and quite a bargain I thought to myself, why the hell not. So I bought it and I dont regret it.You play as a templar this time, which is pretty interesting, though it took me a while to get along with that  I always really liked the assassins and betraying them felt kinda... awful. But I started to grow fond of Shay Comac, hes a bit of an idiot, but likeable. The story, too, is quite interesting  at least while youre in the animus. I never really cared much for the stuff you do at Abstergo.What I really enjoyed in Rogue was the map you got. They gave you all kinds of stuff to explore you get New York City, the rich landscapes of the Riverlands and the icy cold North Atlantic with a lot of bad weather, fish to hunt and ships to board. Ive loved Black Flag for its marine missions, and I wasnt let down by Rogue on that. I spent so much time on the water, because it just felt pretty damn good.However, Rogue, like any other of the latest Assassins Creed games though I havent played Syndicate, is just that an Assassins Creed game. Its not really all that different. The only thing that makes it stand out from the others is the afore mentioned fact that youre a templar now. Ergo you have assassins following you like all the time which got annoying pretty soon, they arent hard to find or to kill, but theres just so many of them, it bored me.Rogue isnt as special as itd like to be, but still worth playing if youve liked previous AC games. They could have made the templarthing more interesting, but its still a nice game to spend your time on, especially if youre into sailing and discovering.
