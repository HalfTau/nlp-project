I was a huge assassins creed fan from the beginning and throughout ezios trilogy, AC 3 dissapointed me no original gameplay and the story was more of the same with minimal character growth. AC IV I enjoyed for its gameplay and I liked the roughishness of the character, the story was still boring. Hearing AC unity and the ones that followed whould be abandon the ship fighting and focus on more do good heros made me lose interest in the series as a whole. Then I saw this, gave it a shot and wow. It combines everything good from the series up to this point, including the ship combat, and has the best character arch in of them all. It even made me want to give the other titles byond this one a shot.
