I would like to tell that this game is good and interesting, but not for me. Basically, i have just finished the Black Flag and this is like small step brother. I can not find it amusing, i do not know why. Just the North America, just the Morrigan in front of Jackdaw, just the Shay in front of Edward. Maybe if you could try this first, then maybe...
