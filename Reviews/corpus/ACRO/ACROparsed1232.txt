I originally played Assassins Creed Rouge on Xbox 360, and decided to pick up the steam version to see if it is any good.Assassins Creed Rouge originally came out only for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, so the graphics wont be spectacular. However, they still look good. They are improved from the 360/PS3 versions and the game runs at 60fps on my  laptop with an Intel GPU, and there are plenty of PC options to customize, so the PC port is good.To sum up the gameplay quickly, it is basicly a big expansion to Assassins Creed IV. All of the elements from IV return and are either the same, or improved in some way. A few new minor mechanics are here too, but there isnt enough to say it doesnt fell like an expansion., so a new mechanic where assassins hunt you is here. They dress up as citizens and when they attack you, they take off a huge chunk of your health, so you better watch out for them. The platforming can be a bit clunky, but other than that, its a great game.After you finish the 15 hour or so long story mode, you can explore the open world, which has tons of different side activities. Overall, you can probably get about 30 or so hours out of this game.8/10
