I have played this game on PC for enough time to say that it is almost exactly on par with the console version. Not to say thats a bad thing. I bought it out of nostalgia and have been enjoying it instead of even modern games like Battlefield 1 and CoD Black Ops 3 and even the newer two Assassins Creeds on Xbox One. The only real advantage to this game on PC i see really is the better texture quality and higher frame rate. Im playing on a last generation two year old ASUS ROG laptop which i purchased for college and Ive rarely encountered frame drops or animation failures. The story ironically is one of my favorites in the AC universe as it delves into points furthered in the books that the Assassins and Templars are simply two sides of one destiny, so of course I loved the replay, and the added bonus of the kickstart by getting the special eddition helped. In short, on PC the game plays wonderfully with only occasional frame rate drops and minor glitches that often right themselves after a minute or two.
