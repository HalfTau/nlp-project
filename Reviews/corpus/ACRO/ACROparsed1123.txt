What people need to know abou this gameIs the story good?Kind of.. i am biased since i like the assassin gamestory plot so far.. but,.in this series the assassins went LOCO and are developing Quimical weapons of mass destruction O.oThe templars are too nice during the story..and the current day templars are total psychopaths with their do this or DIE mentality the weird part is that their actions seem logic on paperGameplayPro They maintained the movements mechanics as other assassins creed.what they changes was that  instead of bombs, now  we have  a grenade launcher to launch the small area bombs no more tossing, and the darts are sent by an silent air rifle The naval part of the game is the same as Assassins creed 4 blackflag, we can aim faster  so boats go down much faster There is a lot to do besides the main story  no way to get bored con the hidden assassins new mechanic they present in this game hinders us a lot.. we hear whispers when we are near them and use the special sense to detect their location .. but we have to be close to detect them.if we dont kill them when moving around they come at us and try to kill us.They still didnt gave the option to skip the clips after taking over the boats is the only thing i got tired of.The taverns are closed and unless someone posted a video how to unlock it we wouldnt get it.. because the main story doesnt explain how to find the thugs we have to beat them to unlock the taverns.PerformanceThe game runs smoothly at 60/61 frames and  i didnt have any freezes YAYFinal ThoughtsThere is waaaay to much to do in sidequests and hidden areas to finish in less than at least a couple of months .. and i personally am more story driven than the sidequests unless they improve my gameplayI recomend this game for all the assassins creed fans but warn you that you will hate the assassins in this game
