Assassins Creed 3.5  Walking SimulatorPros Good storyline, but falls short during some moments Great soundtrack Visuals are better than ACIII Big open world, but a little too big Ending connects ACIII and AC UnityCons UNSKIPPABLE ING CREDITS Controls are similar to ACIII, slow and wonky, but satisfyingOverall, not a huge improvement from ACIII but still a good game.Story is very well done, but the soundtrack is the one that really shines, 8.5/10
