Oh Ubisoft. You left us with a bad taste in our mouths and you have finally delivered use some mouthwash to get theout o my mouth that was Assassins Creed Unity. Anyways alhough I do really like this game, I cang help but feel like this is just AC4 the expansion pack. Yes this game runs buttery smooth on most decent machines, but the graphics are nowhere near as good as AC4 and thats because this game was made specificaly for inferior hardware like PS3 and XBOX 360, which are extremely outdated. Thats why at a 49.99 price point its just not a very good deal. This game should have at least been 10 cheaper. But ultimately I am giving it a thumbs up beacause Im always up for playing more AC4.
