Im not sure why, but this game is a buggy mess on my PC. Graphical popins so bad that I cant see objectives, objects or even characters that Im supposed to be following until Im right on top of them, and sometimes not even then. Im not sure why my computer is so buggy when others arent, and Im running a fairly new setup only a couple of months old 4GB Geforce 970, with 16GB of ram and a 4 GHZ Intel Processor. Maybe Itll work for you, but it sure didnt for me.
