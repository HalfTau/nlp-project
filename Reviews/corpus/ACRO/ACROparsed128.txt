I loved Black Flag, although it was more like a Pirates of the Carribbean game than an Assassins Creed game.This game is the sequel of that in terms its still far from what Id expect from an AC game.There is no challange in climbing parts, nor in fights, you just run through the map and you can kill anybody without any hassle. The only challanges Ive come accross was due to the clunky controls and bugs when the character does something totally different than Ive expected. Also, there was a few gratuitous frame drops here and there.If you want a Black Flag 2, its your game. If you want some stealth game like AC2, its not.
