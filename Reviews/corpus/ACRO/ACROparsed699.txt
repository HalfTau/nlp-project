Great game but seems more like a sequel from Black Flag. Graphics are still amazing as usual for the Assassins Creed games. Have played and beaten black flag and cant wait to beat this one too. Got this game on the steam sale from the Thanksgiving/Black Friday 2016 sale. Also, got Black Flag, Rogue, Syndicate, and Unity. Have played and beaten Unity on console but want to see how the game is on PC.
