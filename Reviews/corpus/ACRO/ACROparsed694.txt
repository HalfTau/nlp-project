With is a weak, barely earned thumbs up. I have always had a problem with boatsassins creed 4 not because its a bad game to play, but instead of feeling like im playing as Edward the assassin, im playing as a boat. The only thing I did in BC4 is upgrade my boat to battle bigger boats to get more loot to upgrade my boat. It seemed I never played as an assassin, but a boat, so i call Assassins creed 4, Boatsassins creed 4. but enough about BC4...in the short time i have played Rouge, i found it to be similar to BC4, but with a bit more assassin part, but then again i just got into the game so who knows. its a refreshing change not being an assassin as it gives new light on the issues of the creed. the boat battles, like BC4, are fun but get repetitive after a while. im looking forward to completing the game and i hope it has a little less boat and more assassin. i still think that these boatcentric AC games should have been given a new IP instead of leaching off AC
