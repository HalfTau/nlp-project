Bought AC IV, AC Freedom Cry and AC II via Steam might buy AC I on Steam to complete the collection. About the game.. Honestly this is the best perhaps final? version of Black Flag.They have the cloud working on this, more variation in enviorments.A lot of bugs from AC IV are fixed. No multiplayer tough but that doesnt really matter. Ive played Unity MP on my uncles Box and I found everyone who worked with me only got in my way.Less pistols I kind of like it. and no dual swords I didnt really care for a sword extra but it seemed like it bothered some people.Youre a Templar.Still working at Abstergo IndustriesThe combat is the same as AC IV and you can kill civvies again while this is both fun and  a pain But if you kill enough of them 3 Bounty Hunters will come for you.I rate this a 8/10 overall game and as an AC game Ill have to give it a 7/10.
