Game runs like  on UltraWide Screen 219 3440x 1440.Gonna have to play it on my lappy...Update to follow...Managed to make it work on my laptop. I can play full screen, 2560 x 1440 without much issues.However, with the upcoming AC Rogue Remaster, might as well wait that one with complete support for modern PC. Ill think that up!For now, I cant recommend this game for ultrawide monitor usage. If you play on other resolutions and monitors, you could consider it!Again, Im sure we could wait just two more months for the Remaster?We shall see...
