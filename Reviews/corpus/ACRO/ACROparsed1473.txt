Ive always loved the assassins creed games. But unity was a downfall. Then they decided to release rogue to computer i was pretty suprised and started waiting for the game for so long i waited i bought it i played it i enjoyed it never regret that i bought it. In my opinion its the second best ac game. Black flag is still my favorite but if you have played black flag, you should buy rogue and after rogue if you really want to get unity get it but be prepared you will be sad after you wasted 50euros to a game that is full of buggs and doesnt run on your computer
