Mechanically and in terms of its main character, AC Rogue is one of my favorites in the series. Shays story arc is remarkably good, and further dilutes the good versus evil mentality of the other games by presenting both the Assassins and the Templars in a more sobering light. Its also a very good game to boot, built on the bones of Black Flag without many changes to that formula. There are some grating story parts  the Abstergo stuff is wildly unnecessary and just drags the whole thing down, as it does in almost every AC game, and theres a buildup to a conclusion that just lacks the emphatic punch the developers wanted.Overall, though, I think its up there with Brotherhood and Black Flag as one of my favorites in the series. Definitely worth a shot if youre looking for an open world fix without having to shell out the full price of a new AC game.
