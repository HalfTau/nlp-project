Felt like a watered down BF. With much less graphic options, and essentially a copypaste map from BF, Rogue wasnt all I thought it would be. The story was great although a little short, but it takes a different route to all the other AC games. Upgrading your ship was cool, although I would of liked to see your ship grow in size as you upgrade.Combat is much faster than Unity/Syndicate, which is quite fun if you switch between the games.7.5/10
