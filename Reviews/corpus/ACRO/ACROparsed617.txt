Ok, in this age of Steam sales, I must say, this is the first game I have finished in YEARS.AC3 on Xbox Damn kids deleted my save, wasnt about to go back in time there. Time is whiskey!AC Black Flag Uplay took some kind of and didnt save any of my progress I am in Japan, something happened about a year ago where they consolidated uned themselves? matters not, lost 50 percent of my save on Black Flag, and didnt want to go back!Then I discover this gem in a Steam Holiday bundle....I am a mature man and havent had a game keep me up till 330 to the point that my wife isoff at me the following day like this for YEARS.Oh a fort, oh damn, some chests, oh, is that an Indian village? !Open world rules the day. Just wish I would have ed off from the main quest more. Wont make that mistake with AC Syndicate also in the bundle ..Cant recommend this game enough, worth every penny!
