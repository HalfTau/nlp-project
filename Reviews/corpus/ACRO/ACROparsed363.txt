This is an amazing game, in my honest opinion. Out of ignorance, I said some pretty harsh things about the game when it was first announced. But I really shouldnt have. This is going into my top 5 favorite AC games of all time, believe it or not. This was the underdog game this year, but Ubisoft has shown us that the Templars arent truly the bad guys neither are the Assassins, which makes for an amazing, heart wrenching story.This is quite possibly the best AC storyline since AC2. Shay Patrick Cormac is such an awesome, badass, realistic protagonist. Definitely one of my favorites.This truly is a beautiful game. 12/10
