7.5/10After they realised that Unity was a BIG mistake, they did the opposite. Good game with Black Flag style. I like it. Good story sad sometimes, new places to explore good work with the new york, AWESOME new legendary ship, it was sooo good to finally see it sink after that long time of destroying the ship and your keyboard and nice outfits except the military one, sorry, but its just horrible.I recommend this game to everyone, but rather play the Black Flag before this, the story wont make much sense to you if you wont play Black Flag. One more thing  this shouldnt be the first assassins creed game you want to play, the story wouldnt make any sense to you
