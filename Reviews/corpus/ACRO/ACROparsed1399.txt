Black flag was better. Get used to that because its gonna be the focus of the following...As you may know Rogue follows the exploits of a assasin turned templar. Some have complained that the whole Templars are bad guys angle gets skewed here. Well first off its been stated numerous times that both factions want the same thing but go about it in dramatically different ways. That stills holds true here.Gameplay wise the game feels like Black flag 1.5, this should be a good thing and for alot of parts it is, theyve done their usual polish on this and that, streamlined a few features and added some fun new gameplay elementsThere are alot of visual adders that make the game feel cool too, like excessive powder smoke when you fire your cannons in quick succession its neat.but unfortunately alot of the cons still outweigh these positives.The game for the most part runs well, minimal drops in frame rate, occational pop in but only at farther distances and aside from the odd glitch things run well. During the animus adventures.When you get into the real world it all goes to Yes sadly the modern day office simulator is still in full effect and its more boring then ever. Couple that with some horrible coding where your frames will drop into the single digits on a regular basis and youll want to escape back into the animus asap.Another problem is the story, it starts out good enough with your eventiual turn to the templars but after that it really slows down and becomes dull.I blame most of this on the characters in the game, Shay himself is a dull transparent character with no real interesting features other than a accent youll quickly grow tired of.The rest of the supporting cast are just as dull unfortunately and fail to really suck you in at any point in the game unlike black flag and its larger than life characters.Ship battles feel tedious rather than exiting and you never get a urge to go out plundering, likely because you arent a pirate in this game.Even the legendary battles arent entertaining, in black flag you were up against steep odds fighting incredible ships of legend, in this...not so much. It just feels dull or frustrating.In the end just go get black flag, its a better game, with a better story and has better characters and virutally the same gameplay with more appealing scenes and battles.
