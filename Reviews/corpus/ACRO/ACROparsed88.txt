For people who dont know, Rogue came after AC4 but it was designed specifically for last gen consoles, so the PC version doesnt have the next gen bells and whistles that AC4 had. It also runs a lot better.If you had to choose between the two, just based on design, AC4 wins hands down. Unfortunatly, AC4 is a butt plug of a port, so Rogue isnt a bad compromise for PC users. Its basically the same game mechanically.This game comes from the ACIII school of american history sodomization. Its just plain stupid. It borders on offensive considering this is a company that comes from a place that thinks crawdads are a delicacy. Its so bad you would think Hideo Kojima wrote this game. Shame!Evie is a character in this game.
