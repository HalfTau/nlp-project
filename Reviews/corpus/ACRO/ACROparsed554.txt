Good AC game. Its basically Black Flag 2. I prefer the Black Flag story, but this one has a really good one too. The UI is basically the same, with some minor improvements. Rogue feels a little shorter than AC 3 and Black Flag, but not a big deal. If you liked Black Flag, you will like this one too.
