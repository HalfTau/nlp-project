How can they have screwed up AC4? Its the same game!Nuisance bugs all around make this a forgettable entry in AC.You can brute force your way through to the end, but overall the game was annoying half the time.Story not too bad, but the game is shotty and rushed. Interface is clunky and rough really? craft one item at a time?Definitely needs polishing to be decent.Also, I needed to figure out how to skip the end credits hold space bar for 3 seconds, it doesnt tell you that was exceptionally annoying.
