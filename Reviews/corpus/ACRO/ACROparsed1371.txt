Before you read my review for this game, keep in mind therell be spoilers so DONT read if you want to avoid it, thank you.Really worth the moneysince this is my first AC game to getShay is a really interesting character and I love playing as himReally loved how the story wentGot this game on my laptopwhich I got it a year ago and probably getting older now running this game on 30fps on low graphics but some are on high which I thought was amazingCombatStealth are great as any other AC game.SPOILER ALERTYou have your own boata lot of people say that Rogue is a copy of black flag, since this is my first AC game I cant say anything since I dont know anything about Black flagOutfits and weaponsSoundtracks and main theme of the game are pretty niceSomething that annoyed a lot of people in the AC Rogue trailer or game poster you can see Shay wearing a badlooking templar outfit with a hood, sadly it isnt even in the game so please Ubisoft dont post something that wont be in the game.Really small bugs however this wont effect the game example killing an enemy with a pistol then instead of dying he stands upWhat I really love about the game is how it connects Rogue with Unity, Dont continue reading if you want to avoid spoilersSPOILER ALERTOther than that this game is worth getting, however would suggest waiting for a sale or something, Cant wait to get Unity now.
