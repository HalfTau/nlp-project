One of the best Assassins Creed ever played...While the graphics are not the best the truth is not bad.A pretty good optimization and in my 50 hours of game I have not found more than 2 bugs.As far as history is not as monotonous as we used to. Although its nothing out of the ordinaryThe environment is similar to Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, naval exploration etc.If you liked Black Flag 100 recommended.
