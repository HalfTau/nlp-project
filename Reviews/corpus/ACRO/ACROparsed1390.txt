Not one of the best AC games by a long shot.Most of what is technical is very well done, the graphics, the bug free gameplay and environment, the cinematics and so on.But Theres very little creativity, as in most recent games.The open world always has nice ideas in these games, but particularly in this one was very little developped. You get money fast if you do what you need to but just as quicly, you have nothing left to spending it on.Collecting the swords, pillars and such just gets you an outfit.The out of Animus story is none existent and only thing you do there just like in blag flag is hack computers to collect  and read messages.Once you maxed your ship, theres no point in fighting anymore, and so not only is there any point in having money because you have nothing to spend it on, but also there is no point in getting ressources either..Some of the memories are painfully annoying.All in all its a nice story with interactive elements which will appeal to any kid or maybe teenager, but theres simply no depth in it to make interesting.Oh, and if I hear someone say I make my one luck one more facking time, I may bang my head violently against the wall, our hero literally says that in every single memory....I dont recommend this game, though I like the AC series particularly the early ones you can skip this one without missing anything at all.
