Honestly I love assassins creed black flag and rogue shows the same type of exploration in this game, with the awesome side activities for you to do and unlock some decent to badass looking outfits,weapons, and pistol sets that you must have  and as for the gameplay its just like black flag but with more added features to the animations, combat system, and everything you loved about black flag but modified. Ubisoft made an awesome game and when I heard this came out on PC I preordered it instant and it was worth it with the DLC content and Uplay items as well. So if your a major assassin creed fan and want something fresh for your collection then this game is for you.
