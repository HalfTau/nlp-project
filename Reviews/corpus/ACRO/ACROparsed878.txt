Assassins creed RogueThere are no spoilersOkay so here we go this game was a difficult one to make other people may say no its not its built of the same engine as assassins creed 4 you stoopid welll no not like that as in the story was particularly hard to create and henseforth short. Now it being short isnt actually a bad thing because its short and sweet plain and simple. But the reason it was difficult to make is because they made it after Edward Kenway But before Conner Kenway and doing that is hard because conner is only edwards grandson making the time between that kind of hard to make but still pulled through.Allright you play as Shay Cormac an assassin who discovers he doesnt belong in the assassins reason i will not give because its a spoiler and long story short starts working for the templars. Now shay is equipped with his standard hidden blades, a cutlas and a smaller sword, two pistols, rope darts, and his very special rifle now in the trailer its an actual gun but in game its a dart gun bassically kind of dumb but it gets good range so kind of creative, and last but not least Shays vessle The Morrigan not quite a frigate but not a brig either. Its just a bit smaller than the jackdaw and honestly not the best name either i mean Jackdaw sounds rigid sounds like a good name for a ship but Morrigan MOREIGAN gross.in conclusion though the story being short is kind of a negative but its the only one that i havePreformanceOkay this game runs like a dream you dont actually need a high tech pc to run this i have an intel i3 dual core with 2.8 GHz and 4gb of ram and i was running this on ultra at 5553 frames a second not bad at all. Speaking of graphics the game looks beutiful, it looks amazing.ConclusionWith this game being just a little too short brings this game down But they really didnt have a lot of space since this game was both a sequel and a prequel. And even being short this game is amazing its like a breath of fresh air so many side things that you can do too. The only other negative is the price its a bit too much. So yes i reccomend this game only if its on sale though.Big Daddy
