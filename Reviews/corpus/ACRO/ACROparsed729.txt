I really enjoyed this game. In my opinion, this was better than Unity. Unity took until the endgame to actually grow on me, but this gripped me right from the start.The ship battles from AC IV were a nice touch, now set in the Atlantic Ocean, with colder climes and freezing waters, and it was interesting to fight alongside the British against the French in the colonies. My only complaint is the lack of actual sidemissions, as the closest you get to that are the Assassin Interceptions which is just basically killing targets to defend someone before the timer ran out, nothing like the narrative based experiences you had in the older games such as Brotherhood with the mercenaries, courtesans and thieves guilds, for example. The main story could also have used some beefing up at only 6 sequences its rather skimpy, fortunately theres plenty of exploring to do and youll spend a great deal of time collecting resources to upgrade your sloop.All in all, a very enjoyable game, and Id hope to see a fullfledged Templar AC game in the future.
