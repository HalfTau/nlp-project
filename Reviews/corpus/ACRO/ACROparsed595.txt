This game takes a little while to get into. Its boring and feels unpolished for the first few hours but after you power through those, it gets more interesting and brings more to the table. Rogue brings back many mechanics from Black Flag such as player ship battles and customization, crafting, and map control and improves them slightly for quality of life like skipping those tedious naval fleet battles.Its not the best or most polished Assassins Creed game, but its worth picking up for cheap and playing through the story and collecting and exploring little extras.
