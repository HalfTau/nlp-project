If you got the Full DLC Pack, you will understand that there are no point of getting it unless you need lots of help.Love this series of Assassins Creed game. Not much but did add some few old version into the new version. Like the plots but kinda gotten lost from the first part of the story. I mean the very first part of it but the rest is alright for me.
