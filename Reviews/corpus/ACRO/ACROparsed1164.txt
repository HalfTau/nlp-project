A true gem of the Asssassins Creed Series. Story takes place after the events of Black Flag but before Assassins Creed 3 and sets the stage for Assassins Creed Unity. Most importantly it allows you to see things as a Templar for a change. As I write this review Im currently playing Unity, the first of the next gen Assassins Creed titles and to be honest Rogue is the superior game thus far.
