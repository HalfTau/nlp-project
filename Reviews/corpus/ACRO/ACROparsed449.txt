Ok so great game, awesome followup to what was to date my favourite AC game, Black Flag. Get this game and play it.Just dont play it all the way to the end.Stop when you do the last core reset and it says, if you go back to your animus now, nothing will be the same. Just stop there.Why?Well you get about 5 more minutes of game play then credits that go FOREVER!!! Great that there are a lot of people involved in this game but honestly, I dont want to sit here and watch ALL their names go by, 10 mins and counting right now as I write this.
