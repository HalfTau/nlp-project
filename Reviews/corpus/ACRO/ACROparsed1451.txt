A pleasant surprise. Its refreshed the Black Flag experience and taken out the things that made it feel a bit dragged out, its a shame the graphics arent quite up to modern day standards and this should have reflected a bit more in the price. I picked it up in the sale for about 26, that price was perfect as the storyline is great and the gameplay kept me interested far more than Black Flags.Im actually getting bored and tired of the Assasins storyline since they killed off Desmond Miles the balancing between modern/historical has been dramatically killed off and would rather play as a Templar in more of the games or at least have the option to branch out that way. We need something where you can play between both the modern and old in the same style, I would love to be an assassin/templar in a modern setting.
