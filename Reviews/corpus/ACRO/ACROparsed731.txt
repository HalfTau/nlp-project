The best anti hero i have ever played, Shay Cormac sheds a new light on both the sides of the historical conflict.This game portrays the series long heroes, the assassins to be not as perfect as everyone thought they are and gives the templars a facelift. This twist in the tale paves the way for more intense plot in the upcoming titles.Compared to its predecessorwith the same engine, assassins creed black flag, it is easier to gather upgrades and equipment for your ship and the ocean battles are far better in this one.With a lot of historically renowned people included in the plot, combined with continuous twists and betrayals, this is now my favorite nonezio assassins creed from the entire series!
