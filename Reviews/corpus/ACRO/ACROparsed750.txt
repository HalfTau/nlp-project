First impression BADThe controles are locked to controller, even if that controller is a joystick. the game doesnt care and will not allow anyone to tell it overwise. manually editing the configuration files doesnt work the game resets the file. Making the file read only have no effect.Unpluging the joystick reveales the next problem the mouse is inverted on the x axis.... someone was clearly drunk when they made the control scheme.My first impression of the game should have been better, looking at the early story, but 30 minutes of fighting the game for control ruins the mood
