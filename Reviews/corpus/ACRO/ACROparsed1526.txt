Udontplay strikes again.Bought the game, was really hyped, then i tried launching it, havent even gotten to see the Main menu. Why you ask? because ACC.exe HAS STOPPED WORKING. Yes ive tried troubleshooting it, tried all known hotfixes i could think of, including multiple reinstalls, Verifying game crashes, checking to see if software is interfering, or seeing if my drivers were out of date, after 2 days of ripping my hair out of my head, congratulations UPLAY, You win, i dont get to play, and you made 50.00 off me. Done with you.
