After playing for a short while, and after how much I enjoyed Unity Rogue feels really old and clunky, especially with the ability to crouch missing. Its definitely not as beautiful as Unity being based on older technology but hopefully the plot will be as good as everyone suggests, because so far Im really not impressed  and the voice acting is the worst of the entire series.
