One of the best assassins creed series after black flag. what I like about Rouge is you will get to see the perspective on both side but in the end, the opinion are ours to make. The mechanics are pretty much same with black flag such as boarding a ship, attacking the fort and for the first time, enemy can kill you in one shot. It frustrating but somehow it makes you think you need to use other alternatives way to achive goals. The main character have his own goals, not following other creed and that makes it more powerful in story. Lastly, I do recommend this game after you finish Black flag and AC3 since you will recognize some key character of other AC series, but even you dont have played it, you still can enjoy the story and other side activities in the game.
