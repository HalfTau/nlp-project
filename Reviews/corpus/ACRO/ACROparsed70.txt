Is this game glorified AC Black Flag DLC? Yes, yes it is. However, its still really fun and Id say it can stand alone pretty well. This game was a bone thrown to people on previous gen consoles so they could get their yearly fill of Assassins Creed, therefore its pretty half Ill save you some time, dont bother with any collectables, theres hardly any reward apart from maybe the satisfaction of 100 the game. It is genuinely hilarious to me that Unity was meant to be the massive new gen innovative AC game and this half copy and pasted piece ofcompletely blew it out of the water enjoymentwise. Is this game well put togther? Not in the ing slightest. Is it fun and worth the money? Yeah. I dont think Ill ever get tired of being a ing pirate, this really gets any longing you had left after Black Flag. Perhaps dont play this directly after Black Flag or else it may become slightly repetitve.
