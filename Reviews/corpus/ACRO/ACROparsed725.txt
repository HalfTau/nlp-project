Why do poeple not like Rogue? This is a great game! If you liked Black Flag, youll like this. If you like to rank the Assassins Creed games on how good they are, and we all know there are some really good ones and really bad ones, this is easily my 4th favorite one with Brotherhood, Black Flag and AC2 as 3, 2, and 1. Not to mention, Ive played through every AC game from the first one to this one.Pros Same engine and UI as Black Flag, but the graphics are actually OPTIMIZED for PC. No more 15 FPS like most people on PC get in Black Flag. I didnt have to turn down graphics or screen resolution and I still run this game at 3045 FPS, without any extremely high end PC. Play as a friggin Templar! After playing as an Assassin in EVERY OTHER GAME, finally I get to play as a Templar, which so far has so much more appeal to it. Unfortunately though, I have to back the darned British... Cool story bro Good weapons Good DLCs Cool manor/fort/house/thing to keep all your goodies Plunder and get treasures just like Black Flag, but in more Northern areas of the world Final chapter that the Kenways appear And more...Cons The Templars back the British... darn redcoats... /
