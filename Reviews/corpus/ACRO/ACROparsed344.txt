Crashes before it even gets to title screen. Dont waste your money on it or your time trying to get it to work. And Im using a new pc with all the requirements and its windows 10. So do not bother with. Also dont bother writing to Ubisoft. They know their games dont work for pc players and they dont do a darn thing about it. When you write them they give a crappy reply that doesnt help fix your problem, they dont reply again, and they also dont follow their own rules on how long before they reply to the innital message. So yeah. Dont waste your time and consider yourself lucky if it works for you.
