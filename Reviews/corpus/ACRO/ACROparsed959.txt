As a fan of AC4, I came into this game wanting more of the same, and thats pretty much exactly what I got.In essence, its the same game with a different story that puts an interesting perspective on the entire franchise.The biggest problem here though is the limits of the port, it was designed for the XBox 360 and PS3, so the graphics are a bit below what you would expect, fortunately this game at least runs extremely smooth  on mid tier computers.The other gripe is that its clearly buggier than AC4, and a few glitches and collision issues can ruin your experience, though its still nowhere near as bad as Unity or Syndicite.While the game adds very little in terms of variety, its enough to keep you playing, and overall the tried and true stealth is still great fun despite how easy it is.Bottom line, If you enjoyed AC4, youll enjoy this, maybe not quite as much but its better than freedom cry.
