Im not going to make a huge review even thought this game deserve it. On the short note Rogue ends the American Saga and opens the Unity game, even if the story is between Black Flag and AC III. Its a good game, the first one where you play as a templar. You find yourself spending some 10 hours only on the main story but there are a lot of things to do, so even on full price its worth.
