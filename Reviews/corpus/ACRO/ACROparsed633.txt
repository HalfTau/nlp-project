I think this is the most underrated game in the AssassinS Creed series.The story is fcking amazing in my opinion.Its intresting and it ties together with AssassinS Creed 4,3 and Unity in a great way.The graphics do look like AC3s but I dont mind, some assets are also reused from AC3 and 4.If I would say anything negative about the game that actually matters to me, that would basically be that the Naval Campaign is too long and some of the Shanties are straight up aweful.
