PC PERFORMANCEBy far the best optimized ASSASSINS CREED game, after the clusterf that was Unity and Blackflag terrible ports... screen tearing is here in the game and can be fixed by applying a triple buffer through the nvdia control panel. I prefer not to use the ingame Vsync because in creates MASSIVE!! input lag...GAMEPLAY/STORYGameplay is the same as blackflag .. not that much variation not a bad thing... the definitive AC experience per say.I didnt like how i spent most of the time on my ship travelling kinda got repetitive after awhileStory possibly the one of the strongest in the series... give it a shot
