I had a lot of fun with Rogue, not quite as much as I did with Black Flag, but it was solid. The ending was a letdown, but Im sure Assassins Creed fans are used to that. BF and Rogue are the only AC games that Ive played and will probably ever play until they make something a little more original. Not the greatest stealth game, but the open world was very much alive and as vibrant as ever.Most of this game is recycled from Black Flag, but still held its own pretty well. Its not some uber version of BF like a lot of these reviews imply. Its better in some ways and worse in others.BetterFaster shipMore variety, the open world is split into 3 minimapsMoney is super easy to come by thanks to your Templar status.Graphics are more beautiful than ever.Many more sidemissions with more variety than BF.Getting boarded by enemy ships is intense and chaotic. I loved it.WorseCormic annoyingly grabbing everything in sight when you free run is much worse than Kenways.Much buggier than BF, lots of stupid little glitches a mission was kind of ruined by a glitch, even though I got to complete itParts of the scenery that LOOK accessable, are not. This was kind of frustrating.
