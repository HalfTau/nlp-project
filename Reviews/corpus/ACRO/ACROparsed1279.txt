This is in my opinion the BEST Assassins Creed game that I have ever played and its completely under shadowed by Unity, and is flat out stunning and amazing in every way you can think of but even though it is great just like every other game it does have some flaws but lets start with the positives, and for those that think this game is a exspansion pack to Black Flag goyourselfYou play as Shay Cormic a faithful Assassin until the brotherhood does something unspeakable that uses him and 1,000s of other innocent people, it strikes his morales so hard that he goes apart from everything that he used to believe in, as he slowly makes his incline into a Templar he starts to doubt if hes doing the right thing to his friends and what he used to believe but in the end he knows whats best and doesnt stop until he stops the extremist like group of the Assassins with the best ending EVER!!! seen in the franchise including, New York, The River Valley, and The North Atlantic all of which look amazingand in my opinion my favorite Assassin/Templar in the franchise such as assassin contracts, you end up intercepting a pigeon by quietly sneaking up on it once grabbed you read the contract and then you must kill all of the assassins before they kill the Templar not just this but there are other missions which are opposite from the other creed games with probably up to 150 hours and more including enemy ships boarding you, Gang HQs, and more including Rams, rapid fire puckle guns, and more Old characters from previous Assassins Creed games including Adwele, Achilles, Haythm Kenway, Benjamin Franklin and 1 I cant mention beat the campaign and youll know  and sorry for butchering those xD Ive never had even one crash and thats saying something becuase Im honestly running on a system thats nowhere near the best with lots of hours on this game it has ran almost perfectly and so smooth unlike Black Flag in which I had to turn off every graphics option and it still doesnt work smoothly, Ive also heard that Rogue had the best launch for any Creed game on steam yes finally its about time that one Assassins Creed game has got it right, there is no more tailing missions in the game except for one ship one which is pretty quick and easy, but yes thats one great chip off my and your shoulder Though a great campaign it was short as its 6 sequences compared to Black Flag that has 13 and could have been longer or Shay that much to progress/finish though campaign though single player can be great enough for some for the great but short campaign that we got a new DLC campaign wouldnt hurt and the current DLC is mostly collectibles After campaign there is so much to do though you dont have as big as motivation to do so unlike Flag unless your a perfectionist throughout the game assassins will hide in bushes, hay, rooftops, crowds, doors and more, and try to kill you just like you do to Templars in other games yet this feature is overdone and discourges exploring New York as there are around about ever corner which gets very annoying The basic outfit in which Shay is seen is his Templar outfit which is the best costume in the game sadly with all DLC added but when you got to Conflict zones he pulls on/down a hood in which he doesnt have so it just looks stupid This game is still amazing yet it does sadly feel like its trying to do what Black Flag already did as I mean that theres still lots of new cool features but not enough to make it stand out which is maybe part of the reason that this game is underestimated, but it needed even more new features then it added to the series And my biggest issue/frustration with the game was when you have to Kill Hope, that was the most frustrating B.S Mission Ive ever had to do it was extremely difficult and if done wrong can go on endlessly which idk why all Ubisoft games do this its about time Ubisoft no one actually likes this hit and you know itThis game is flat out AMAZING and well worth its of 30 or 40 in my case and is one hell of a steal if bought on sale, and is just so fun to play, though it does have some Cons as ever game does, once you finish the campaign the ending to me was so good it changed my thoughts on the game 100 and had me freaking out, it has lots of content with or without DLC to give you tons of more hours and you still wont come near to finishing it, and once you finish this game trust me youll be rooting for the Templars for a long time, all in all Id have to give this game a 9.4/10 and I usually dont give anything that high, so make to add this game to your wishlist or cart RIGHT NOW!!! This is a must have for any Assassins Creed fan or anyone that lives!!!!!! !
