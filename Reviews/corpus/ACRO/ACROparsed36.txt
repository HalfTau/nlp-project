I previously said that ACBrotherhood was the best game in the Assassins Creed series, and while that still might be true, this one comes in at a close second.A lot have people have said that this is a Black Flag reskin, and thats probably at least partially true, but I definitely got a lot more enjoyment out of this game than I did out of Black Flag. The environments and locations of Black Flag got very samey and boring after a while, and I felt no real incentive to fully upgrade my ship or complete the silly Kenways Fleet stuff although I did do all of those things and more eventually. Rogue actually varies its environment quite a bit, going from the crowded streets of prerevolutionary New York to the sprawling delta of the River Valley area to the frigid, icebergfilled, freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Since I find environment to be very crucial to the atmosphere and overall feel of an AC game, this game definitely scores more points with me in that category.The remastered version is coming out in March, so if you can wait for that, definitely pick it up when it comes out. Otherwise, get this version on sale and you can be pretty sure you wont regret it assuming you liked the other AC games.
