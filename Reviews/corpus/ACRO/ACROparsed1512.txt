A.K.A. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag Irish Edition. Its literally the Black Flag engine copied over and slightly modified, but with entirely less tedious ship travel. I 100 this game, and I genuinely enjoyed the experience. The story was pretty decent, but not nearly as good as some of the other AC games, but it did tie together AC3s and Unitys story which was a pretty nice touch to make up for the fairly dry overall story. Depending on your skill, you will either be hunted by assassins or be the assassin hunter, which is a very appreciated touch to the general idea of being a deserter of the assassin brotherhood, and the game made the creed of the assassins actually appear fairly unappealing, which leads into questions that never otherwise were apparent in any of the other games. With all that being said, its a decent addition to the series if youre a pretty big Assassins Creed fan.
