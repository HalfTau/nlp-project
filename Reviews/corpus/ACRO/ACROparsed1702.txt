Im bias when it comes to the AC franchise, I fell in love with the first one and have been a fan ever since. I have to say this installment really tickles me in a special way! It gives the feel of AC 3 and Black Flag and touches base with both in a really good way.The highlight to me was, getting a ship almost out of the box. That was something I really enjoyed about 3 and Black Flag, but it seemed a bit stifled in 3 and narrow in Black Flag. With Rogue, they opened the doors wide from the first moment and let the player run free with the ship. In Black Flag there was one map to explore and sandbox in, it was fun and I loced it, but it felt narrow. This installment Im only on act 3 and have 2 full maps to explore and conquer and New york for those times I want to play on the ground. Trust when I say New York is nothing to sneeze at either, giant sandbox to run and do side quests as well as main missions.One down sie so far I have found, in this version there are these hidden people in New York and elsewhere. It may be fun for some to have to walk around in eagle vision trying to find them and kill them before they get the drop on you, but for me it is a real headache.Just one small issue in an otherwise wonderful game. Thumbs way up!
