I was amazed I missed this gem. I have been disappointed with unity and while Syndicate was entertaining it didnt have the same oomph as earlier titles in the series. When I discovered I had somehow missed a game in this series and tried this out, I was happily surprised and glad I hadnt given up all hope on Assassins Creed.Definitely worth a playthrough if you are a fan of the series.
