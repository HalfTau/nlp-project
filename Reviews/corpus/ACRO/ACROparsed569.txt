Such an underestimated and underrated game!Launched at the same time as Unity and completely swamped by its marketing, youd think it wouldnt be very good as you might have missed that it was actually launched. Its a mix of AC3 and Black Flag with a story from Team Templar POV. IMO its one of the best AC games.Its a pity Ubisoft didnt launch it for Next Gen consoles as well. A lot of people will be missing out.Well worth the money!
