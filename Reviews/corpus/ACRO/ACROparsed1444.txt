Considering Ubisofts recent track record AC Unity, Watch Dogs, The Divison, the quality of this port surprised me. It looks like the delay was actually used well. The game runs perfectly fine with no performance problems.The game itself is also pretty great. Its got the most interesting story in the last couple of Assassins Creed games, and it works to tie together AC3, AC4, and Unity, and does a good job doing that. The game has a perfect mix of AC4s open world ocean and standard AC gameplay, rather than focusing mostly on the naval side like in 4. I wouldnt necessarily pay 60 dollars for it I got it for 30 in the Summer Sale, but overall AC Rogue was a very pleasant surprise.Still wait for reviews before you buy Syndicate later this year though. You never know how that port will be. It can be like Valkyria Chronicles, but it can also end up like Arkham Knight.
