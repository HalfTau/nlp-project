3When I can get the game to actually run without crashing it isnt bad. Problem is that sometimes it will take 3 or 4 crashes before it will run smoothly on Windows 10. Only way I have been able to get it to run is by running it in windows 7 compatability mode and administrator. Works sometimes and doesnt work sometimes. As long as this problem has been reported to UBISOFT you would think they would fix it. While it is sheap on Steam, still not worth the cost to put up with the agarvation.
