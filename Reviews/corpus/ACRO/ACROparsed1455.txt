This game was one of the most enjoyable games Ive ever played. It took me on a voyage to the historic origins of the USA through a political struggle over the new world. Big battles, false flag operations, deception, espionage and conspiracy... this game has it all. And everything wrapped in beautiful graphics and sound creating a believable colonial environment with strong characters and a wild landscape. You will meet historic persons like George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, you will visit great places like Lissabon and Paris. For me this is the best Assassins Creed so far.
