The BEST Assassins Creed game in the series.Based on 51 hours gameplay and 92 Sync.Pro Storyline in both time lines with plenty of the details the driven character who has tired of the creeds t seeing only chaos and ruins with it Playing as a Templar Well designed missions and the logical requirement for the 100 Sync the graphic looks like stuck in between AC3 and AC4, pretty OK considering the size of the maps old, moviestyle, fast combat system petting the animals huge amount of the different activities all possible side activities from AC3,  AC4,  AC4FC Haythem is back and alive.Cons I make my own luck  really? The classic Anvils legacy bugs with the animation, etc killing the animals for the craft North Atlantic map is too small, better to add 23 more space of the sea in between the lands.Verdict Yes, take it and play. The best thing in the series after AC2.
