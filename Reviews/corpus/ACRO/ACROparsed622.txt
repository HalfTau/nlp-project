I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Assassins Creed series, more specifically anyone who enjoyed Assassins Creed 4, because Rogue is basially more of that but better. For the first time ever, you get to play as a Templar and get to hunt down Assassins. It plays just the same as AC4, but with some added features to make the game feel fresh and different.
