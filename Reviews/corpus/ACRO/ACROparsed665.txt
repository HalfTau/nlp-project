A great game, it does a fantastic job of showing how the conflict between assassins and templars isnt so black and white.Pros Great Story Likeable main character Has the ship combat from Black Flag on a smaller scale Cool new weapons the beserk darts are a blast to use on enemiesCons A little on the short side Around 56 hours if you only do the main campaign Dated visuals was made for last gen Big world but not a whole lot of side missions compared to other entries in the franchiseDespite its drawbacks, its very easy to enjoy this game, I hope they make more games from the templars perspective if they continue the series in the future!
