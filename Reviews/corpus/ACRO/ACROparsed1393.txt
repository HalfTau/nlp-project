Holy smokes this game is friggin gorgeous on PC.  I played a little on PS3 and this game looks just as good as AC4  Unity does as they refer to next gen gaming graphics.AC Rogue also runs quite smoothly, so that is a plus.The storyline is OK, not the best but that doesnt really matter to me.  If I want a good story Ill read a book or watch a movie.  Or better yet even create one myself and post it to redtube or Xhamster
