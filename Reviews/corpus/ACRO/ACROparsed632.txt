Broad scope its Black Flag reskinned FPS parts as a employee of Abstergo, ship upgrading, armor and item crafting, and item collecting.  Obviously not a bad thing for those who consider the Black Flag the series best.The story is short and a novelty at best.  Assuming the role of a Templar is what makes the story engaging, not the writing.  The game will be engaging for those who are invested in the series overall story and compulsive need to collect everything and 100 each location.  nd ties up the Assassin Creed III and IV story line.As previously stated the game is short, about 4 to 6 hours.  The game can be substantialy extended by collecting each item and 100ing each location.  100 sync provides minimal addition to storyline, fleshes out things already known at best.Highly recommeneded for those who loved Black Flag.Recommended for those invested in the series over arching story as this game ends where Unity begins.
