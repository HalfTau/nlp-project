I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a great story. Amazing game.This game is very well optimized unlike Assassins Creed Unity. I get more fps than I did with Black Flag.Unfortunately there IS some texture popins and you can usually tell that the game is a console port, hence the lack of graphics options No TXAA or MSAA, only FXAA, no Physx support, no SLI support BUT the graphics are very decent nonetheless when cranked up.The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, best soundtrack in an Assassins Creed game in my opinion.The only thing I didnt like about the game is that its too short. Everything else, the gameplay, missions, soundtrack, mechanics, graphics etc are all perfect.
