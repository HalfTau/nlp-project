If you liked Assassins Creed 4 then you should like this. It is more of the same. I did not feel compelled to do all of the side stuff this time around... but the main story kept me interested until the end. The story is not very long and you will need to upgrade your boat in order to complete the main story missions. This took me about 1012 hours.
