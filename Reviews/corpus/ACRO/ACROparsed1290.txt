WEll it had potential but how can it fudge up things that worked in Black Flag? Shay likes to jump in stupid places, cant climb some things, others you can.Glitchy as promised.....Shopping menus dont work properly, some items do not appare properly when selected, cant see the stats or cost...for every item pretty much this has happened...great..oh and even crafting....If youre new to AC at this point. Buy Blag Flag, then you dont need this one. Howcan they get it wrong after something so right.Ugh, I got Unity on offer, now Im REALLY not looking forward to that.
