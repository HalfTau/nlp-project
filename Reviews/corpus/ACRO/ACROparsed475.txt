Assassins Creed Rogue was a great game with reasonably good character development. It did not get the fame it deseverved due it releasing on the exact same day as Assassins Creed Unity. The game wasnt as much of a failure as Unity but did still have some bugs and glitches here and there but thats what they get for releasing two games in one year.Pros Differant take on the side your on Your a Templar in this gameThe feels of AC Black FlagImproved combat system compared to black flagGood story plot could have been better if they put more effort inYou can understand Shays point of view for why he is no longer an AssassinLarge mapSPOILER  The game ties in with Unity not in a very big way but still pretty neatThe graphics are ok but it makes it easy to run and enjoyGame didnt crash a single time im on windows 10ConsStill buggy still an easily playable gameSome underdeveloped characters that deserved more of a back storyToo short of a campaign would take 12 hours to finish the main storylineToo many collectibles a little bit lazy there ubisoftDo I recommend this? Yes. It is a great game that is definetely worth the 22.95 au. The game has a good plot but to get the full potential out you gotta play some side missions aswell. There are still bugs but they most of them arent noticable and dont effect you horribly.
