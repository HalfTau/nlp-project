I dont know why some people say that this is a copy of Black Flag because its the opposite of Black Flag story wise. Controls are beautiful they use the exact same mechanics as Black Flag which is good. Also I havent seen 1 glitch yet I dont know why some people hate this game because I love assassinating the assassins.
