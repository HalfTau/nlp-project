One of the best Assassins Creed games to date. A compelling, focused story, charcters worth a damn and a whole bunch of new weapons that I used frequently and never resorted to spamming one of them. Runs incredibly well, looks only slightly worse than Black Flag and gets 60 fps three different setups I used to play this game. I ran this game on intergrated graphics once on medium setting, 720p and got 60 fps. And the ending was perfect and wrapped up everything that needed to be. What other Assassins Creed games aspire to be.9.5/10  Amazing
