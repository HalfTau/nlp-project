I am sorry but i dont sare the majority oppinion on this one... I love the francise played every single game in it but this game just feels like i was playing assassins creed 3 and 4 mushed together there was some new enyoable elements as taking down headqarters and doing interception missions but that is it for a whole new instalement it just felt like a small dlcto being a templar side i was still an assassin that call himself a templar lore addition was nice i liked the story and the ending but i had enough of edward kenway way too much naval gameplay for not being a pirateThe whole game just felt out of place but that is just my opinion
