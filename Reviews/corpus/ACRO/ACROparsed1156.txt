Spoiler freeIts a good game.  Its nice having the story told from the bad guys perspective, but it doesnt make them look like the bad guys.  The biggest jerk in the AC series, Achilles, gets whats coming to him  explains why he becomes such a degenerate donothing weener in AC3.It plays exactly like Black Flag, so I wasnt interested in doing all the side quests and extra stuff as its basically a rehash of AC4.  Even some of the shanty songs are the same.  I didnt spend much time upgrading everything since it was made from the same game, and as a result, the game is pretty short.  The main story, while good, is extremely short.  If youre not doing all the extra sidequests, be prepared for a short game.The restHaytham Kenway has still done nothing wrong and this further proves that Connor shouldve sided with Daddy in AC3 over that worthless turd Achilles.  Shay is a good guy, doing good things, for the bad guys and quite possibly, the wrong reasons.  Despite him being right and Achilles being wrong, Achilles still doesnt learn humility at the end of the game and calls him out for a lack of respect which just about made me yell oh  off you waste of life.I hated Achilles in AC3 and hes an even worse character in this game on purpose though and while I know Connor did the right thing  sided with the good guys in AC3, it made me mad that he did it so hastily and they never explored what it wouldve been like if he had sided with Haytham instead.  Granted this takes place 20 years prior to Connor undoing all of the Templars stuff in America, but it was a nice story to explore.  I like the ending that ribbons over to the beginning of AC Unity.  Too bad I dont have the computer to handle that game yet.Final verdict 8.5/10More consistent story than Black Flag, even if its on the same engine.Ezio  Shay  Altair  Haytham  Edward  50 feet of dog turds  Connor
