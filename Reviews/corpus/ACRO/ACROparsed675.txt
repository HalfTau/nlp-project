It sure felt great to get back on board that ship again!The question of whos right and whos wrong between the assassins and templars is something Ive been thinking about since right around Revelations when Ezio was about to kill Manuel Palaiologos. Some of his arguments sounded pretty reasonable and I didnt think he deserved being called a monster for it. All in all whos to say who is right and who is wrong. Maybe theyre both right in their own ways.In Rogue you actually get to see how the other half lives and I found it equally sympathetic as the assassin side in several respects. I found it quite interesting and I hope to see more of this in the future.The game itself is a bit rough and plays more like an expansion pack to Black Flag rather  than an actual full game.
