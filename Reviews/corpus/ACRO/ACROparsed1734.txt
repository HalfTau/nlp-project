Awsome Game, Amazing Port for PC, nice graphic.I would say this is with Black Flag the best AC Game they made for now. Game looks very nice and it run smooth on Highes Settings. Never played any Ubisoft Games with so an amazing Port like this game has.To be honest, AC Rogue is one of the best Ports I played for a long time, I only now 2 big Games who have a good port on Relase and that was Metal Gear Solid and Dragon Ball.If you loved Black Flag this game is a must have, sailing works better now then ever and it looks sooooo amazing. Also the ship handling works better, at least with gamepad. Im not playing with mouse and keyboard.ProGraphicController works perfect xbox360StoryMusicHuntingSailing and water fights with other ships and towersA lot of upgrades for weapon and your shipOld fight System I didnt liked the Unity combatYou can find a lot of treatures, sounds for your ship and other thingsAnimals looks niceWhen you try to swim in alaska or where you have snow and ice you lose healthContrawill be addet when i found some contras
