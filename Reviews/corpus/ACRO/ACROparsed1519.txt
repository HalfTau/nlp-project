Is Assassins Creed Rogue another title where you stab, sneak and kill your way to defeat the  Templars?NO!In Assassins Creed Rogue you play a turncoat called Shay Mcormack, who has sided with templar order. Youll cut your way through the historical setting of the seven years war! The Assassin can run, but they cant hide as you have the ability to  detect assassins in hiding.Old patterns  are done but in a different  form making playing  from the side of a templar a fresh look at the series with already well established mechanics.It bloody runs well too and it should do  as well, its the third game where they used assets from previous games with practically the same graphical settings, models etc guess third time is the charm.
