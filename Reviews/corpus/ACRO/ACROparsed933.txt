This is my favorite Assassins Creed game. Ive played AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4 Black Flag, the latter used to be my favorite before this one came out.The Good The ship battles improve on Black Flags The story is interesting It was a nice break to play as the Templars. Sure theyre aristrocratic jerks, but those Assassins and their reckless behavior will destroy the world according to this game, anyway The graphics are impressive The Lite RPG system is well balanced. Powering up your ship, pacifying cities by taking over bases, and improving your personal armaments is fun. If you grind, the latter levels will be easier because your ship will be extremely powerful. If you dont grind, those levels will probably be harder Being constantly hunted  instead of hunting, like in every other AC game  by Assassins while in cities is a new and really fun mechanicThe Bad The player controls, as usual. Be sure and run halfway up every tree and wall you see The final levels turn in Super Mario platforming, as ususal Level repetition, as usualBasically, the Bad is its an AC game with all the inherent clunkiness that implies. But its a great AC game! It just may turn you into a Templar.
