AC Rogue is an enjoyable game. It does have some flaws in gameplay and the story is quite short in comparison to other AC releases, but it has one of the most interesting narratives in the series. SPOILERS Documenting an assassins mistrust in the assassin order and thus becoming a templar. I also think the game should have been perfected with more time or released as a massive expansion to Black Flag. But all things considered, this is a solid game.
