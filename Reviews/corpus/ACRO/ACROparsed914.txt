This is Black Flag 2.0.This is a worthy successor to one of the best games of the franchise.Rogue is described as many things a cheap lowerend alternative to Ubisofts attempt to pander to both generations of consoles, a short story set in between games in a similar manner to Freedom Cry or Liberation, a simple sidestory given better quality through asset and game mechanic reuse.Its kind of all of those things, and also none of them. Yes, it was slid under the rug when Unity was first released, but it ended up being more critically acclaimed for better story and gameplay. Yes, it does reuse assets from Black Flag, but the assets are used in ways that seem new and interesting, and the change in scenery really does make this game work. Finally, it is true that it is rather short for an Assassins Creed game  less than eight chapters long  but the Kenway Saga that it concludes makes it more than worth it.In conclusion, if you dont mind the familiar tinge from Black Flag, Rogue is an excellent all rounded Assassins Creed game, and is definitely worth the price.
