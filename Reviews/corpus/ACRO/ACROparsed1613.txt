Disappointing, to say the least. As someone who has played every AC game minus the portable/tablet games, I would actually rank this one the lowest.To me it feels like a glorified expansion for AC4. It recycles all the mechanics from AC4, with a few minor tweaks, and calls it a new game. As someone who has played a lot of AC3 and 4, there was really nothing new here, and I found it rather boring. Even the story, which is mainly what I was interesting in checking out, was a waste. The characters are all twodimensional, and the protagonists motivations are paperthin. Sure, this has become standard for AC at this point, but still sad to see the wasted potential here. All the interesting stuff is actually hidden away in Templar letters that you must seek out as side objectives. And to top it off, Spoiler Alert! I was not happy to have to kill Adewale. Wasnt worth it! End SpoilerThis should have been a 2030 standalone expansion to AC4. As such, I recommend to anyone still debating buying it to just wait for a good sale on it. Rogue is a game that was clearly made on a shorter timeline with a smaller budget, and to do that they simply recycled assets and ideas from previous Assassins Creeds, cut the story short, and generally put out a subpar experience.And I think Im in the minority in saying this, but I had much more fun with Unity and I would recommend spending your money there instead.
