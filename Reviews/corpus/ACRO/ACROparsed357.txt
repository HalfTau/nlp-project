40 hours of exploring and mindlessly collecting collectibles. By the time I write this review Im already completed 100 of what the game offered. Main story is short6 Sequences but yet very interesting with lot of memorable momments. New mechanincs added to the game such as Gas Mask and Grenade Launcher and tons of new activities around the world. Definitely not worth it for 19.99, recommend to pick up this game on sale !
