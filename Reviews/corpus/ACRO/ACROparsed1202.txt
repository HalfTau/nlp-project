Assassins Creed Rogue launched on last gen consoles Xbox 360 and PS3 alongside Assassins Creed Unity For the Next Gen consoles and while Unity took all of the fame and glory, being a next gen title. The masterpiece, Rogue was left in the shadows. This game is AMAZING. Its as fantastic as Assassins Creed 4 No doubt because it has the fantastic sailing mechanic, alongside many of AC4s mechanics. The protagonist is interesting, so are the other characters. Even for a last gen game, its still pretty and the performance is great Ive encountered a good solid framerate, only sharply dropping once or twice for me for no more then a few seconds. What dissapoints me is that this game was left behind and not focused on, while Unity, a buggy, poor mess got all of the attention.As per usual for Ubisoft games though, its got that annoying Uplay stuff which is utterly annoying. Ubisoft really should scrap it. Still, it doesnt affect the game as much once its initially launched.As someone whos played all of the Assassins Creed games, Rogue stands strong as one of my favorite games in the series Very slightly behind AC4 Black Flag and I strongly recommend that anyone who enjoyed any of the Assassins Creed games should get it.
