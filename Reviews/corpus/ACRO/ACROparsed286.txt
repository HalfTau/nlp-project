This is the shortest assassin creed story gameplay i ever played i completed this game less then 6 hours go straight on main mission skip all other mission but to me is good because i dont want waste my time on same boring mission again and again like kill him or kill her,I  like the time setting, the era of colonialism and seafarer adventures, the sea battled is amazing i like the atmosphere its take my imagination away and the boarding battle ability in this series is cool.i like being templar a guy with redcross in my outfit.. i always wonder can we get next AC series that we can choose to become templar or assassin like RPG .Will continue playing again until all port and fortress is mine DConclusion  This series is must have
