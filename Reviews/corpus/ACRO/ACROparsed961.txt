Pros1 No stupid tailing missions and the like, each main story mission is fun.2 Good characters, while some I wish had seen some more screen time, we will adress that in cons. The main protaganist, Shay, develops and chaneges a lot throught the story, questioning his path the entire way.3Good ship combat, taken straight from AC4 Black flag, this combat feels a lot deadlier in these northern climates, as ice bergs and the new addition of burning oil spices up naval combat.4Good modern story, you are still a random researcher for Abstergo, but you actually have an impact this time, helping the templars dimoralize the assasins with Shays story.5Ties into AC 3, 4, and Unity. This game is the ultimate branch between these games, with a young Achillies from AC 3, and old Adewale from AC 4, and a special apperance from Arnos father, who is in Unity.6Great graphics, Ubisoft really pulled off the rugged north of Vinland and the Gulf of St.Lawrence7Playes very well into the actual historical events of the 7 years war or the French and Indian war here in Merica, you see many prominant figures, including James Cook, George Washington and more.Cons1New York from AC 3 is ported straight over, and shows the lack of dev time avalible due to Unity.2Short, if I had not 100 the game, I could have done the main story in about 6 hours.3Characters needed more time, Characters you meet who end up dying, you are supposed to feel somthing, but you met most of them for five minutes at the beggining of the game, and then again at the end.4The switch to Templar is way to fast, Shay goes from a Assassin to Templar in the first act of the game, so about 1 hour. I think he should have been with the creed a bit more to show why he left and to develop the other assasins.5Collectibles, it wouldnt be an Ubisoft game without hundreds of random collectibles all over the map for some stupid outfit you will never wear.6The hacking mini game in the real world, very tedious and boringly easy, or very hard.OverallA good game that could have been better, if given more dev time. If Ubisoft hadnt put out two AC games in one year and just focused on Rogue then Unity, most of my cons would have been addressed. I would say pick it up if you enjoy AC games, the naval combat of AC 4 or 3, or want to see how a developer can pull of the frozen north well. Otherwise, pick this game up on sale.
