A wonderful sister game to Assassins Creed Black Flag. Has a story that actually grips you and pulls you into a side that you rarely ever get to see. Has a rather short amount of story sequances but they pack quite a punch and dont over extend their welcome. 20 is a bit much for this game though so it would be rather well spent on Black Flag but still consider getting this game when on sale.
