Great game, Lags a bit during cutsenes but I manage to handle it. The graphics are smooth, yet alone this is an old game. Great game for assassins creed fans who are looking for something new. Also great for newbies to the franchise, the game mechnics are simple. easy to handle. This is my opinion, but if you prefer to play this with a ps4 controller you can. just start  in big picture mode and the buttons are as the same as the ps3 and ps4. only a few are changed. you can also change the controller button layout if you want. Overrall I give this Game a 8/10.
