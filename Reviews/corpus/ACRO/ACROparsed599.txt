The Gameplay is good , because it is basically ac4 albeit smaller, but the game is buggy as hell. The biggest issue I face is when unpausing the game will get stuck on the intermediate screen. The ship will sometime freeze during storms and there are many points on beaches where the game will crash if you step inside a small area.
