Assassins Creed Rogue is one of my favorite AC games. AC Rogue is a much better version of AC Blackflag due to the fact that it has improved ship on ship combat, the graphics of this game are amazing and since  they split the map into three different parts, your computer doesnt have to work as hard to run this game, unlike Blackflag.  Even though this game has a shorter story than most AC games, the gameplay makes up for it in the long run. I rate 20/10 for this game.
