Its like an expansion pack to Black Flag.Same graphics, same engine, same mechanics, same combat, same everything.But, with new zones, collectibles, story, activitiy types, items and a new character.You get to see the earlier lives of storyline characters from previous Assassins Creeds such as Achilles.With that said the story line itself takes place about 40 years after Assassins Creed Black Flag and about 20 years before Assassins Creed 3If youre deciding between Unity and Rogue, after playing both Id reccomend Rogue.The story is a lot more interesting, theres more to do, and theres more diversity in the game itself given that you can sail from frozen lands, to sunny beaches to large towns whereas in Unity youre locked in a boring town with no freedom to leave except to go to another boring town thats just as similar.The only downside is that the  story is slightly shorter than Unitys, graphics are lastgen good for older/weaker PCs, and it doesnt have any of the new convient features that were added in Unity being able to freerunup or freerundown.
