Enjoyed Black Flag but this seems like a shortened, generally downgraded, and glitchier version of the same thing. The story is the only redeeming feature and its still pretty meh, and short of course.But yeah maybe if you like AC games its worth an on sale purchase to whittle away some time, but Im not even sure about that. Thats how I felt about the game anyway.
