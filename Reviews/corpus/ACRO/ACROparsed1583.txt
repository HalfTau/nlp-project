This is my review on assassins creed rogueIf you want to buy this game then I recomend you do because I have been playing this since the realease and I have been loving it.StoryThe story is good but is short for other assassins creed games with a total of 6 sequences but the majority of missions are good quality and solid. The character Shay Cormack was an assassin with high expectations and was sent on an inportant mission that goes horribly wrong leading to a chain of events that put Shay into the templar order.But the doesnt make him a ruthless killer as through the story he hasnt got any full aligences with the templars e.g when you are sent to kill a friend from the assassins Shay will be all I dont know if I can do this spoiler he does and he says it didnt have to be this way.Overall Shay Is a great charecter and only die hard assassins creed fans will hate him only because he is just a templar.GameplayIf you liked black flag you will love this game. The naval combat is back with a few tweeks like leaving a trail of burning oil on water, rapid fire swivels now called puckle guns but dont worry they still sweetspot and a more offensive front weapon called carronades.Their is one problem I have now this could just be my computor but when boarding a man oh war or frigate I get quite a frame drop which can be a bit annoying but it could just be me DThe combat is the same as black flag, nuff saidOvarall good controls and if you think the naval combat controls are terrible your just bad at the naval combat. BContent This game has a okay ammount of enjoyable content and you will get rewarded as most stuff can get you a really good outfit or weapon OR ship decorations.Ovarall good ammount of content p.s I didnt want to spoil the types of side missions there are just so you get more excited. VerdictPros Good story, Great Protagonist and Quality contentCons Short story, Frame rate drops while boarding a ship and NO LEGACY OUTFITS PLS MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR UK AND OTHER PLACES THAT DONT HAVE THEM, thank you Ovarall 8.5/10If you want ubisoft to get to work on the legacy outs fits error please retweet this disscussion to them
