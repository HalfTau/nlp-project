Take a cool story concept of playing a Templar, and then copy and paste everything from Assassins Creed Black Flag, with less polish. This is what Rogue is. The side missions and other content beyond the main storyline are weaker, and the game is noticeably more buggy and unstable than Black Flag. The game is not bad, but for me it is just wasted potential! 09/10
