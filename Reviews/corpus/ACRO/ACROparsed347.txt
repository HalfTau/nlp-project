Probably my favorite AC game to date. The story is interesting due to the fact that you play as an assassin turned templar, who is hell bent on revenge and his lust to save the world from the assassins. Shay Cormac is the second best protagonist in the AC series just because he is interesting and opens new doors in the series future from the templar perspective. As for the gameplay, its just cut and paste like the other AC games wait for counter, and kill, thats it. 100 recommend if you are looking for something different in the AC series or just a great game with a jaw dropping story.
