Assassins Creed 4 was an excellent game my personal favorite of the franchise and Rogue is really just 4 with a new Story and new characters. Personally I enjoyed the new point of view of the Templars, Ubisofts attempt to get you to question the morality of both sides. Some may not enjoy this game if they want something new from the franchise, but if you want more of AC 4 then I believe that this game is for you.
