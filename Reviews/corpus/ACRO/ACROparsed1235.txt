The best AC of them all. Combines the very best of AC 3 and Black Flag while at the same time allowing you to play as a Templar  FINALLY! It lacks the length of Black Flag and swag from Unity  but it makes up for it without any doubt by its special enemy types alone. Such as stalkers and assassins at dens and alike.
