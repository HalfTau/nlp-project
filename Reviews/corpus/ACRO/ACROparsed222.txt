First time playing Rogue, graphics are stunning. I played Black Flag before and I really enjoyed the jungle environment.I Still have to catch on whales, shark, beavers. I dont know if its possible to dive like Black Flag. Graphically its superior.Ezio big cathedrals and dungeon still rock on, I must say, but definetlely this is a very nice sequel to BF and pushes the gameplay next to nonlinear style perfection. Big deal on Deluxe pack. Before Origin everyone have to play this at least for the hike to sink a Mano0War during a thunderstorm using just eleven cannons!Only negative is the shadows greys must be updated. I like the 4/10 Brightness settings for an Ultra HDR experience, otherwise blacks are not black. Especially on the skin of people, they seem too dark at 4, but otherwise the game looks washed out more than 4.
