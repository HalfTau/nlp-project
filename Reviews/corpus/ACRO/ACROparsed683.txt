This game has amazing gameplay and new features that make it great for a sandbox experience. However the reason why Im not recommending it, is because the story and characters are so underwhemling I cant take the game seriously. The idea behind this game is amazing. An assassin turning to the templars and killing them. Its something we saw and experienced in Assassins Creed 3. However we see the turn for him is...easy. he turns into a templar quickly and without serious thought to reprocussions. He was raised to hate templars and we see our main character turning to them instantly? It feels like I was robbed of a fluid storyline. I pushed this off to continue playing anyway. The gameplay was fun and I couldnt wait to see how far they would go. Turns out not far at all. The game is about six hours long and ends without any real personal change on my part. Usually with assassins creed games I feel like Ive grown with the character. At the end of this one I feel the lingering thought of Thats it? and so is my experience with the game. The main character doesnt have all that much substance, I dont see enough of the templars and their plots. And the assassins seem like cookie cutter villains that pretend to be heros but it still doesnt work. You cant just make the good guys the bad guys in such a rushed way like they did here.Id say dont get it. Go for another assassins creed game. This one is worth a watch but not worth your money. If you do want to see more of it. Check out the 20 dollar version. Dont bother with deluxe. But I recommend waiting for a sale if you value well spent money.
