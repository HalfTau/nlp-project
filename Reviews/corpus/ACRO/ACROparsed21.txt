Feels more like a dlc than a full story. First off, the story is very short if focus on doing it, then sidequests later. Istill think its a good game, but there are so many better ones out there than this one. If its on sale I would reccomend it for sure. Probably the worst thing to this is the storys ending.SPOILER!!!!!!! !The way that Liam dies pisses me off and feels like an afterthought.
