AC Rogue is a stripped down version of Black Flag, a much shorter game which is why it gets a 7 and not an 8 or 9, with a few unique little twists that still make it worthwhile. In addition to the ship upgrades and battles, looting warehouses and conquering forts/gang HQs are a different experience. It offers a few things reminiscent of previous AC versions.For example, lightning assassin strikes like in Revelations, the usual search for items to unlock a native and Templar outfit, renovating buildings to get income like in AC II, Brotherhood and Unity, etc. My least favorite activity were the assassin interventions, it was the same thing over and over and way too frantic. Unlocking the computers at the Abstergo office was much easier. I did miss the underwater exploration with the beautiful color offered by Black Flag.Overall, I think its an OK Assassins Creed game, but it certainly does not take the place of AC II or Black Flag. I didnt think I could side with the Templars but the reason for doing so was valid. However, the main plot, in my opinion, is weak, and just not captivating. There was not a great buildup to the ending. There are times when the camera movements are very wonky such as in the bar fights to unlock taverns and in defending the ship. Using the pucklegun is awkward. The scenery is not as pretty as in Black Flag, but the icebergs are a new twist. Its interesting enough to buy the game although when it goes on sale it would be a much better value.I enjoy replaying great AC games, and have played AC II, Brotherhood and Black Flag numerous times. Will I replay Rogue? Like Unity, which also had a weak plot and other problems, not likely for quite some time. Im still loyal to the AC franchise though, and I hope we get another epic one like AC II, Brotherhood and Black Flag and yes, even Revelations, which offered a great plot.
