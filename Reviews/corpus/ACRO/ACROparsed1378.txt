Rouge is legitimately one of, if not THE, best game in the series. Aside from the graphics and a rather lackluster port, the game improves upon everything that was good about the amazing AC Black Flag plus just does all things incredible fo the series.You play as a Templar and see that theyre not the cliche bad guys per se.It delves into the lore of series even further and if youve played the other ones first, youll truly love this game.If you liked AC Black Flag, buy this game... its as simple as that.
