Best Assassins Creed IV Black flag standalone DLC.Seriosly though, there is nothing new, the game looks the same, feels the same. They didnt even bother changing fighting animations so fighting with a sword and dagger looks awkward as Shay uses dagger as Edward used a second sword. Lazy production, 40 quid is only worth if you are a big fan. Ubisoft seem to exploit us, as now I feel like I have to thank them for optimizing game well, which is their job anyway.I am dissapointed in Ubisoft. They tried new generation of consoles with AC Unity, but the fact that they were unable to produce a good quality game, but managed to get this one fairly OK, shows that they are not ready for next gen. They cannot handle it yet. After months AC Unity is still unplayable. AC Rogue is good enough though, for 20, not more.
