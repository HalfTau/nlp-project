Im honestly very confused to as why this wasnt this last years main Assassins Creed game. Now, Im not saying that Unity was a bad game, but it was very dissappointing, It is much better now that they patched it and got rid of the companion app and initiates. However the story is still pretty bad for it, when in Rogue the story is great.In Unity I barely got to know any of the main characters, aside from Arno, Elise, and Bellec. However in Rogue you get to see characters that you met in prior games, but also new, fun characters. Also you gotta love the naval combat.Another thing that was wrong with Unitys story was how it was arranged. That Bellec fight shouldnt have been in the middle of the game, but at the end, and shouldve had it be a subplot in which he was killing members of the Creed and Arno was trying to uncover the mystery. In Rogue, though, they aranged it perfectly, from being an assassin in the beginning, becoming a Templar in the middle, and finally at the end finding out what was up with those messed up memories.This game did much more to further the Assassins Creed story in a whole than Unity did, in my opinion. Also it wrapped up the Kenway games. I felt this game shouldve been the main one.
