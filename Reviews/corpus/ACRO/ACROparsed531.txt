Fun mix between AC 3 and AC 4It has the colonial american setting of 3 and the naval gameplay of 4 although I personally enjoyed the caribbean more than the north atlantic. The protaganist, shay cormac, becomes a templar early on which is the first for the series besides being able to play haythem at the beginning of 3. He is one of the more interesting protagaonists of the series and its nice to see shades of grey between the templars and assassins. Most of the naval combat is optional and there is not a lot of it during the story missions and sequences. Like most recent assassins creed games or at least this trilogy of colonial american assassins creed games, the nonstory activities are most fun and the game is at its best when you are not doing the same tailing or following an npc missions. I would recommend this game if you really love black flag like I do and want to have a jolly good time sailing the seas.
