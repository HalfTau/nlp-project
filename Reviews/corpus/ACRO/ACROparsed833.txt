Im sure at this point we all have an idea of what Assassins Creed is and if youre thinking of playing Rogue it definitely wouldnt make sense to start at this point in the series.  As such, Ill make this short, sweet, and specific to Assassins Creed Rogue without referencing the series standards and avoiding any spoilers.Rogue is easily my favorite entry in the series.  Shay Patric Cormack, the protagonist, is a fantastic, deep, wellwritten character that I found that I could really empathize with.  Unlike previous titles, you see this story from the opposite side, the side of the Templars as opposed to that of the Assassin Brotherhood.  The characters around you, on both sides, are realistic and enjoyable and youll also cross paths with several series fan favorites during the course of the story.  My only complaint is that it was rather short, I completed it in about ten hours, though, I was mostly doing the main quest line and only doing side quests when I encountered them on my way between missions.I highly recommend this game to fans of Assassins Creed as it really is a fantastic game that I was very impressed with.  The game mechanics were spot on, the characters were great, and the story was truly unique, brining an inspired take on the universe that outdid any other in the series in my opinion.  If you enjoyed any of the series, this one really is a mustplay.
