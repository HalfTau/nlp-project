Rogue is very similar to the excellent Black Flag. However, it does not bring much new to the table and personally I preferred the tropical setting of the Caribbean. I have been a long time AC fan and a player of all the Ubisoft open world titles. Some of their tried and true mechanics towers, chases, contracts, etc are starting to get old. It is definitely not worth it at full price, but it is a fun distraction if found on sale.
