Very interesting game, it was the first time I ever played an Assasins Creed game and it feels really good. Iam now thinking of waiting to get the newer releases after this experience. It isnt too  hard and it feels a bit linear on some occasions but the open world experience can relax you away from that feeling, aswell as the possibility of being able to build your character and your pirate ship. The sea battles are really interesting, you can capture enemy ships and fortresses.
