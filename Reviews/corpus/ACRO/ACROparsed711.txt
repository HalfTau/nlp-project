If you liked the Naval Combat gameplay of Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, youll love this game. Not only does it have the same feel of that game, but it tells the story of Shay Cormac, an Assassin turned Templar, and you get to see the story from his point of view and makes you question whose side is the good side. I totally loved the moral dilemma that the character faced, and in turn, I faced it myself. Pick the game up on a sale, and you wont be disappointed.
