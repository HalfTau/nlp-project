Play it! Runs very smooth, and much more approachable than Unity.One of the most playable AC games in a while. Very few bugs havent hit any yet. What I really like, though, is the main character. Ill come out and say my favorite AC character is Haytham, because he has conviction. Its what made Ezio awesome and Connor kind of meh for his lack of it. These characters believe in something and stop at nothing to achieve it, but they also use their brains. Playing a Templar is also a lot of fun, since they tend to be more than the usual two dimensional angryman characters we get with the Assassins. I hope to see more games like this one, perhaps a bit longer, from Ubisoft in the future!
