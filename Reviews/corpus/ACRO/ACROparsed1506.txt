So far pretty good although it feels like DLC for black flag Navy combat is great and alot of things to find and do I still have alot of things to do  I love how it can or does change you mind about that side you are and make you question Are the assassins really the good guysAlso the main character Shay does have a good reason to go Rogue and join the Templars SPOLIER ALERTHe is sent on a mission to get a peice of eden but as soon as he gets it, it disappears from his hands and the city well you see. And If you look how long I have playe dthis I am barely near finishing it. Also I have only had this for 2 days that and how many hours I have already put into this that says that its addictive. Even though it says 28 hours in past 2 weeks I have had it for 2 days. Also minus about 810 because I left it on overnight but still addictive. Of cause there is glishes the same I have seen in AC2 and some new from AC3 that still need fixing. Overall so far its been a blast
