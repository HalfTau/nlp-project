Perhaps the best story in the Assassins Creed series, especially when comparing it to AC 3 and AC 4. The gameplay is very similar to AC 4, but theres some cool extras such as an air gun with which you can fire both darts and grenades. Furthermore whilst the setting in River Valley and New York is familiar, the new locations and missions in the North Atlantic bring a new level of epic to the series. The soundtrack is simply stunning, never more so than when entangled in a massive naval battle and it was in general a very nice game to play!
