I think this review is contain a spoiler.The game is based from Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, with same HUD style and improved gameplay. When you play as a Templar and you are being hunted by an Assassins, you must be careful not to be assassinated. You also has to take down the Assassin or Gang HQ. The killing of the Assassin or Gang is not simple killing, you have to use the sense in eagle vision mode, because the leader is hiding just like you when you play in other Assassins Creed game. The gang leader also can assassinate you too so you must aware with counter.New Weapon. Air Rifle, it can shoot darts Berserk, sleep, and firework dart and launching a grenade Berserk, sleep, and shrapnel grenade.The Fighting style is same as Assassins Creed IV but you are using Sword and knife for main weapon beside dual hidden blades, but it has new combo when two people trying to hit you and you counter it.Different kind of ship. Different weapon between ACIV and ACR, when ACIV has swivel gun, ACR has puckle gun it is more fun IMO. When ACIV has chain cannon, ACR has Carronade cannon. Fire Barrels replaced with oil barrel so you can burn the seaThe Story is great, this game can make you open your minds about the Assassins and the Templars. It also connected with AC III, AC IV, and AC Unity. some says it connected to watch dogs too but i didnt play the game so i cannot confirm it.The Graphic are better than ACIV in my opinion. It also can pass 60 FPS with same PC specification.But it has some bugs, when 5 bounty hunter try to chase me they got stuck in a pit in mine shaft. I gaves me advantage to put them into berserk using berserk grenade.Another bug is when i am doing some Assassin interferention mission, i try to assassinate the assassin while that assassin was crouching on the graveyard, suddenly my character elevated very high, then i fall and synchronized.Last, this game is better than ACUI give it 8/10 because of bugs D
