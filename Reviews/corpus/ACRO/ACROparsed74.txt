ProsAmazing storylineexplains ac3 story and unityirish assassindecent controlsshort but sweetuses aspects of ac4 and ac3ConsSome bugs here and therefew bad voice actors but arent a huge problemgraphics are old gen standardOverall i loved the game i favourited it over unity because of how much the story intrigued me, assassin to templar ? sign me up the trailers got me hooked on this game and ubisoft gave us what we wanted a view on the other side, the story was short but sweet and was very well presented and featured some of the characters from previous games and future games which was cool i would highly recommend this game to any assassins creed fan!9/10
