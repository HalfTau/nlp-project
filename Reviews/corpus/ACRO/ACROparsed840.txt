Gameplay is a bit too similar, taking almost everything out of III and Black Flag Even animation but the story of Shay is probably the best story line for a character in the AC series since AC 2, it is a bit short but is still really good. Overall the gameplay isnt THAT good but makes up for the story that is a bit short, if Ubisoft had spent more money, time and resourses on this title instead of UNITY then it would have been the best since AC 2
