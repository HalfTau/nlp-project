Assassins Creed 4.5 basically, but  thats not a bad thing at all. Very enjoyable and entertaining story where you get to play as the bad guys. I was hoping to see Connor in this game Hes one of my favorite assassins. Unpopular opinion, I know. but only a very brief mention of him. I absolutely love how this game connects with Unity at the end, pretty clever. I had way more fun with this than I did with Unity the first time I played it Im giving Unity a second shot and I like it way more and around the same amount of fun I had with Syndicate which I enjoyed a lot. Very solid entry and worthwhile entry in the series. Worth the money.
