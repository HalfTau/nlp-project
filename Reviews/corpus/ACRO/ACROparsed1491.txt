If you liked ACIV Black Flag, chances are youll like Rogue. Naval combat makes a reappearance, except instead of sailing the wideopen West Indies you find yourself in the narrow rivers or glacierridden waters of Northern North America. Additionally, Rogues onland missions are actually interesting, unlike Black Flag where every other mission was go tail that guy.That said, Rogue still feels kinda like more of the same. I enjoyed it, but dont expect a wholely innovative experience.
