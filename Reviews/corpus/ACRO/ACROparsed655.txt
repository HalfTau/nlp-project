This is a mix of AC3  Black flag. Story happens few decades before AC3 and the ending is right where Unity starts, so it fill some gaps. Unfortunately, it was pretty predictable and short. I hopped to get at least a little mission in the city of Quebec or maybe even Montreal Ubisofts home city but Lisbone and Paris were chosen instead. The combat is the same from Back Flag and its really getting old and clumsy if you compare to Shadow of Mordor. It just feel like they wanted to pump one last game from that engine to squeeze every last dollars they could.Id recommend only for big AC fans. This one is  average compared to others.
