Advertised that you would be able to play with the outfits of other assassins, like Altair, Ezio, Connor and Edward Kenway, but you dont recieve them. Ive been in contact with ubisoft for over a week to unlock the clothing, at first they said Sorry, you dont own the necessary games But I did, and had more than an hour of playtime on both. After sending multiple pictures proving I owned and have played the games, they replied again with Oh, it looks like the website that we use to take care of that is no longer operational, well send this up to the development team. That was 5 days ago, I still have not heard anything.
