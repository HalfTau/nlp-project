This game was stunning to play. Even though it was short it had a very good story connecting to Unity. Most of the stuff is similar to Assassins Creed IV and the soundtrack is absolutely great. Even after finishing the game there are many activities that you can do in the outside world. And naval battles are awesome. I think this game deserves an 8/10
