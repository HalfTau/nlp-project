One of the best AC ive ever played. Shows perfectly the difference between peace and freedom. Besides it shows that with great Power comes great Responsibility and sometimes power corrupts.Besides the story was good as the story from REVELATIONS.ill rate it 9,5/10 because the rifle couldnt fire bullets
