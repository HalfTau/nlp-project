Basically Assassins Creed 3 but you play as a Templar.If we look at the history of ALL of the Assassins Creed games, well see that out of all the protaginists main characters Shay is the strongest. He is able to kill countless assassins and slaughter a few master assassins while the Assassins just kill officials who have barely seen a sword.
