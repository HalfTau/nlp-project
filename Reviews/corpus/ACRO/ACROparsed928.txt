A decent game, well worth the full price. I played for about 37 hours until I finished the main story and did about 40 of the collectables, forts, and gang quarters. Going to be finishing off the rest now, while brutally murdering the red coats in a huge variety of ways.With the recommendation put forward, now is the time for me to nitpick and complainThat said, none of the above felt like they were gamebreaking issues and theres plenty of content in the game that doesnt have those problems. So I did enjoy and do recommend this game.
