YES!good storygood charactersgood performancegood everything!this game wins everything QQLets love it together.UPDATEOkay so it took me nice 13 hours to finish the game with main story only. Pretty decent, short but very good.Because I care mainly about playability of the game and its story Im giving it 9/10 for both Shays and present time storyline and 8/10 for playability because common old AC bugs still strike, like infinite loading screen, getting stuck, fall out of the map etc.
