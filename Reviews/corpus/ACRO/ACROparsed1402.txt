This game is for Assassins Creed 3 and 4 Black Flag, what Revenge of the Sith III is for the Star Wars saga!It fills up alot of empty holes in the history between Connor Assassins Creed 3 and Edward Kenway Black Flag. If you are a fan of the Assassins Creed series and a lover of history, you will also get a funny relation with for example Benjamin Franklin, and a young George Washington. Im not done with story yet, but I can tell from my experiences, that It fill the gab between an already open world from Black Flag, chances for upgrading your ship, sailing around the North Atlantic, and take a trip around the stunning views around The Hudson River Valley.There is still some old bugs from AC Black Flag, but as the story continues, you will allow yourself to miss them and fulfill your dreams of being a pirate. But as such it could be a BIG, HUGE, ENORMOUS DLC for Assassins Creed 4.BUT, this time we arent going to miss The Dark Side of the force, as we step into the shoes of an assassins turning against The Brotherhood!DO NOT MISS THIS! ITS A SPECIAL ONE.
