After recently playing Unity and being extremely disappointed. Im pleased to say Rogue has been amazing so far! Great fresh story line, indepth real world story line outside of the animus as opposed to Unitys bland nothingness and naval combat is back!Alot of good parts from AC 3  Black Flag seem to have made it into this game along with having an interesting Main character in Shay, hes not a French Ezio Cough Arno Cough Im really enjoying Rogue. Cant wait to finish it this week.Way better than Unity.
