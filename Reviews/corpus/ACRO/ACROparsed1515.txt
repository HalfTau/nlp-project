Ubisoft did a great job with this one and I was so happy to see reoccurring characters from other games like haythum adawale and akillies, I am disopointed that they didnt even add new fighting animations they just took the same animations from black flag, the story was very interesting and the air rifle is beast. over all this game boosted my faith in the assassins creed franchise and I needed a boost, especially after unity
