Ive been a long time fan of the Assassins Creed franchise and was a bit disappointed with how Unity was released. I was hoping we would get the chance to get ACRogue on PC a lot sooner to fill the void, but weve got it now and... its a mess.The game is decent looking, locked to 60fps, and not optimized for SLI Not that it even maxes out one of my GTX680 Classys. Maybe its just nostalgia, but I think even AC3 looked better than this game. Yes I know it was released on Xbox360 and PS3, but thats no excuse to have black characters with white hands. Talk about being lazy.Anyways, its a pretty fun game and a lot like a cross between AC3 and ACBlack Flag  Piratey goodness mixed with some decent land areas. Hopefully theyll fix a few of the minor visual problems soon.
