The first Assassins Creed game I bought for PC was Assassins Creed Freedom cry. Being a long time fan of the series on console Id yet to play it so it was cheap and...well...it was the worst optimised game ive owned since Jalopy, and ACFC was a title made by long standing developers in the industry.So I was massively dubious about buying another Assassins Creed game, I didnt want to spend money on a laggy piece of crap. However, I very suprised to find that this game runs like a dream on my system intel 4460 3.2, GTX750ti 2GB, 8GB RAM. I whacked everything on maximum as per my habit of finding the middle ground of what looks good and runs well only to find it ran at a near constant 60 with Vsynch on, dipping to 52 fps for a split second once.Plot wise, as of writing this review I just started it but I will update when im done. Looks alright though. People on the fence about buying it need to know it runs pretty well first and foremost.
