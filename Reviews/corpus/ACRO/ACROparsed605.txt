Even though AC Syndicate is marvelous, beautiful and has a fantastic gameplay, this is my favorite Assassins Creed Game.You get more of the Kenway familiy, more of Achilles and a strong matchup for Connor even though they never meet.If you like AC 3 and you want more adventures on sea buy this game. It will stimulate your brain like non other AC Game.templararebetterthantheassins
