This was the first Assassins Creed game that really dissappointed me. It was basicaly AC Black Flag with a new skin. The scenery was identical, the gameplay had nothing new, you did simmilar missions all over again, it felt like a copypaste of Black Flag. I just wanted to rush trought it so I dont miss any story details, of which there were very very few...
