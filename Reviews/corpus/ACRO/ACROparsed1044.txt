AC rogue is one of the best games I have ever played.  The gaming experience is great and you can basically do whatever you want to do whether its attacking an enemy ship and boarding it or renovating a building.  There are many great weapons, skins for Shay, and costomizations you can make to your ship.  You can upgrade Shay to make him stronger and able to hold more weapons.  Graphics are awesome.  I would definitely rate this game up
