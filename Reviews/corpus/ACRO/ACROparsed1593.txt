This game is one of the best games ive played all year and is better than the next generation game we have currently I definetly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the games from 1 to 4 its definetly worth the money. Getting the deluxe edition is very much worth the extra 10 and is a blast. The game is good with controller support but even better with the keyboard controls coming from someone who has just started with keyboard controls. The game is not something I had interest in in the beginning but easily got into it in an instant.
