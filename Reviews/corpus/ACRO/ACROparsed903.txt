I usually like the Assassins creed games but this one was just terrible. I was told that this was better than AC 4 in everyway except story but thats just completely wrong, this is the worst AC ive played.Graphics Looks worse than AC 4, but still has some framerate problems, not too big of an issue. Buggy resolution settings is a huge problem though, 2560x1080p doesnt work right along with other unusual resolutions.Ac 4 might not have the best graphics but at least it is vibrant and has color, Rogue has nulled colors and looks bland.Menu Mouse hardly ever works, extremely buggy and annoying.Gameplay Same as AC4 pretty much. Ship combat is still pretty enjoyable.Overall This is a skip for sure
