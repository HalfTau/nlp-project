With many AC fans being disappointed in the next generation AC Unity I have not yet played Unity, Rogue in my opinion is a solid large expansion to AC 3 and Black. But the game is still plagued with the usual bad A.I and took a step back with taking away some of the creative puzzles that I enjoyed from previous AC games. With a creative story that gives you different perspectives of the Templars and the Assassins, this story shows that Ubisoft still knows how to make creative adventures that will keep you playing Although the plot does get predictable towards the end . Also it is cool to see some of my favorite characters from AC 3 and Black Flag make a return to the series. While I do have to say that there are some new weapons and combat mechanics Grenade Launcher, Being Boarded by ships, New Ship Weapons that make the game more fun, Rogue is more of a mix of AC 3 and Black Flag. If you did not enjoy those two games, do not buy Rogue. But if you enjoyed any one of the two, I recommend Rogue as your AC game this year since there is not one coming out the year 2016. Just remember that this game is way shorter than previous AC games. If you are new to the franchise, I recommend starting out with Black Flag or some of the earlier non ship games Brotherhood,AC 2 to find your preference.7.5/10Recommended for AC 3 and Black Flag fans
