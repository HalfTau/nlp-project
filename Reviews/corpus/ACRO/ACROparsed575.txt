This game is full of bugs.Even if you didnt play Black Flag, which is a more polished, solid version of Rogue, youll have a hard time getting over the multiple bugs found in the game. Ennemies falling through structures and terrain including key ennemies you need to kill to complete a mission, spontaneously exploding or vanishing ships and a lot more puzzling, gameplay altering moments that simply make you scratch your head in disbelief.At some point, about halfway through the story, I couldnt take it anymore. I needed to kill a sniper to complete the overtaking of a fort. Red dot was there, floating over a phantom sniper that was not. Had to start over the mission. This was the last straw at which point I uninstalled this dud.Do yourself a favor, play Black Flag instead of this halfcompleted mess or if you already did, stay away altogether. This game feels like Ubisoft had unrealistic deadlines for their developers, forcing them to cut corners to an unacceptable extent. Even without the bugs, youre not missing out if youve played Black Flag. There is nothing new or exciting about Rogue, not even better graphics.Many thumbs down.
