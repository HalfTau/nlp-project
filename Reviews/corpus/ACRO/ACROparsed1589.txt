What I liked about AC Rogue? The story. Its all about perspective, anyone can be a villain or a hero based on their choices.What I didnt like about AC Rogue? It was short, compared to other Assassins Creed games. There are six sequences with some short bonus memories for Shay. The extra missions outside of the main story, well it just didnt feel as organically designed as Black Flag. There is quite a bit of travel back and forth, and navigation in the River Valleys is really annoying. Theres more side activities than I think actual story  but dont get me wrong. The story is just great.
