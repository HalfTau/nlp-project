Too much wilderness in ACIII, too much sailing in ACIVBF. This one combines a reasonable amount of both sailing and wilderness and throws in a fair sized city NY to boot. Plays on the strengths of the two previous games without stooping to repeating the faults in them. Also the protagonist actually has a likeable personality. Technically AC Rogue is a cut and paste job of older game mechanics, but much more balanced. Plus ice bergs and aurora borealis. This is the best AC right after the Ezio trilogy.
