Great game so far, I have not finished it, its been great with everything it runs smooth most of the time and the story is great... but i do have to say there are issues with the graphics at times and the subtitles dont seem to always match up with the character mouth movement in cutscenes, becasue of this it makes the game a little less enjoyable but besides those  things I love the game and am looking forward to finishing it!!
