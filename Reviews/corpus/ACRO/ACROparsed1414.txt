Great game, campaign is very short but the story is great. The gameplay is Black Flag with a bit of polish, so dont expect a whole new experience. Pirating Privateering, technically is as fun as ever and the Morrigan has enough of its own flair to make it feel unique compared to the Jackdaw or the Experto Crede.The outfits are also really good looking in this game. Even better than the ones in Black Flag.My biggest issue with the game is that its inundated with meaningless collectibles. Less chests/Animus fragments and more unique weapons and outfits pls. My only other complaint is that theres a lot of good looking swords in the game, but they all have terrible stats even the ones you get from completing side quests. You can buy one of the best swords in the game from the getgo for about 18k, which isnt much if you board a lot of ships or save up money in Shays bank, and basically make obtaining any other sword meaningless with the exception of Altairs.Anyway, if you loved Black Flag and want more of the same, Rogue is certainly worth checking out.
