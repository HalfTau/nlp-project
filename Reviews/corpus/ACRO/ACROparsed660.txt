If youve just beaten Black Flag, I would suggest playing this game next just so you can play on familiar controls. Everything is exactly as it is from Black Flag, except for a different map, new characters, new weapons and optional missions Which are actually enjoyable, such as the assassin hunts. The story was actually interesting for me and the main character, Shay Patrick Cormac, is an interesting and likable character who has gone rogue from the assassin brotherhood, but with good motive. The game is a little short, with only six sequences in total and the occasion modern day gameplay of walking around Abstergo Entertainment, which is exactly as it is from Black Flag but with some minor differences, but if youre like me and venture to each new location and get all the collectibles, Shay upgrades and ship upgrades, youll be spending an enjoyable amount of hours with this game. All in all, great game.
