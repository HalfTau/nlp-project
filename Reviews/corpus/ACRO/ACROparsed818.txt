I have played the Assassins creeds Franchasise from day one and Tbh if they made this a little more in depth this would have been the best by far imo if i had to rate this out of 10 i would give it a 8.5/10It had a great story made me think what is actually happeneing in the series then the ending Bam! Mind blown it had very good mechanics and is very well optimized I give it a 8.5/10 because it lacked Story it was only 7 Sequences and There was maybe 23 missions a sequence tops
