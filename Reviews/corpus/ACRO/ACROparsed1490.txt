Robust at first but it gets me exited, every mission is quite challanging but you will find it beautyfull and dont let me tell a thing about the landscapes... because they are majestic. A great game, a great story, even a bigger impact.The end though, the end stole a tear of me. The whole game is related to the others and this tells me that the next game will finally get rid of the old Desmond story and hit us with something new.
