So, basically, AC Rogue is what AC III would be like if it was running on Black Flags tech engine and if it wasnt nave  all in all that sounds promising and it is. The show starts off as expected, with your character in the Assassin brotherhood and, predictably, disillusioned and turning to the Templars. From there on start a, regrettably short, campaign of an interesting story, that manages to portray the Templar Order from inside with a neutrality that was missing in the series. You do get to see the other side and you do get to see their point of view.The Templar Order is stripped of its demonic cloak and is seen as a collection of individuals, many quite honourable and interesting hail to thee Haytham Kenway which simply have a different point of view to the world than the brotherhood.Having played the game after Unity, I did immediately get the feeling of a step back in a technological level  the engine is lagging far behind that of Unity. The key aspects of what you saw in Black Flag are there, so everything is familiar even the setting  a reminder of AC III. This is both good and bad, as you get that familiar tingling you got in Black Flag, however, the North Atlantic is not the Caribbean, so some of that magic is missing and additionally, you have seen it all before  so there is a weariness factor included.Sadly, there is a mismatch between the shortness of the main storyline and the overabundance of extra content, making the game seem almost like an item collection game. This is not enough to ruin the game though, and if for nothing else, just to see the other side of the story for once, Rogue is worth your cheese.
