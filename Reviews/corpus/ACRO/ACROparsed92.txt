This game is Black Flag set in a different location. While I enjoyed it, it does literally nothing new. Because of this, it felt pretty subpar to AssFlag  everything was new in the first pirate game, but this is essentially the same game set in colder water with worse accents and a weak story. It is enjoyable playing as the Templars for once, but really it makes little difference.Ive been away from AC games for 3 years now, and when I decided to continue with the saga, I was pleased to find that Rogue was another Black Flag game I loved the ship combat in Black Flag, and Id forgotten what the hell was going on in the overarching story, so I figured this would be a good one to get back in to it all.Ok so its not really a 3star game, I did enjoy it. But it loses marks for doing nothing new, and for all of the bugs I encountered, along with some pretty wonky controls, bad voice acting, poor facial animations and texture popins as well as being limited to 60fps. I failed several missions because Shay jumped out of a bush and yelled SURPRISE! instead of stabbing them in the back. Ubisoft seem to have pretty much abandoned the overarching story this time. I spent a total of about 10 minutes out of my animus walking around fixing servers, and it had little to no impact on the game or story. Some of the bugs were pretty funny though My first assassin target was invincible. I got him alone, tried to stab him. I couldnt. I hit him with a bomb and a sword, nothing. Shot him twice  no effect. Then he saw me and I failed the mission. Catch the fleeing gang member  caught him halfway through the scripted encounter, the game wouldnt let me touch him so we both stood there looking at each other for a few seconds until I had to let him run away again After disabling Chevaliers ship and boarding it to assassinate him, a member of my crew grabbed him and used him as a human shield to avoid getting shot, which triggered the cut scene. Never laid a finger on him.Completed in 25 hours
