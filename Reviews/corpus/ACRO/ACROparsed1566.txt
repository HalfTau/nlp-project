This is the best AC since years beside AC Black Flag AC 1 was the best!The Characters are emotional and convincingly , the story has alot changes ,the graphic is hilarious and the shipfights are like in black flag goodThe only thing that realy sucks are this abstergo sequences...they are boring  and mindless...However the game itself is the money worth and a symbol that ubisoft are goodin producing games  If they want !!! , lets hope that AC Victory gets the same quality!! !Well...the potencial for a good game is given !9/10
