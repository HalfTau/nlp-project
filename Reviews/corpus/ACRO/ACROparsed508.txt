If you loved Black Flag, you will probably enjoy Rogue. Just note that Rogue was released to cover fans of the series who hadnt switched to nextgen platforms. Needless to say, this game is short, and does not have as much to do as in Black Flag. However, there are certain flairs that are not in Black Flag of which I enjoyed. The graphics and overall gameplay is pretty much identical to Black Flag. In fact, they did a lot of copypasting. There is one fort in the first few sequences that you have to infiltrate which is a nearexact copy of the fort in Havana Black Flag city.Unfortunately, I have had a number of performance issues with this game. There are more bugs than in Black Flag. One nasty one that keeps popping up for me I try to take over a gang territory and as soon as I kill the captain, the game freezes and force closes.If you have to choose between Black Flag and Rogue, get Black Flag. If you want more like Black Flag, but have completed everything in that game, try out Rogue.
