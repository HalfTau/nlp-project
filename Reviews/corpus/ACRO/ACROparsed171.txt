I absolutely LOVED Assassins Creed Black Flag, beating the game straight through and wishing there was more. So I got Rogue because it seemed to almost be a sequel of Black Flag  the mechanics of the game looked pretty similar and the era its set in is almost the same. The problem is, this game isnt as good as Black Flag.1. The stalkers are so annoying. You might be minding your own business, trying to explore the world you are in and enjoy the open world, and these stupid annoying hags jump out and stab you. It drops your health down and it has the annoying side effect of getting soldiers to notice you and start attacking you. It doesnt matter if youre running, walking, whatever  the stalkers can jump out and get you at any time. And you have to constantly hear their stupid whispering. If it was once in a while, ok, but they come out and get you constantly. Its ruining the game for me. My favorite thing about Black Flag was just running around and exploring and I cant do that anymore.2. This game is really buggy. Ill be attacking a soldier who is frozen and doesnt appear to die. Bodies will disappear. Ill need to press the interact button several times before it works. Its almost as if they rushed this game out or something. I cant remember a single bug in Black Flag.3. This is actually not unique to Rogue and Black Flag had this problem too, but the modern day stuff in the office is BORING and only serves to pull you our of the story. Walking around an office doesnt make for a fun game.I wish instead of buying this game, I just got the expansion for Black Flag. This sucks.
