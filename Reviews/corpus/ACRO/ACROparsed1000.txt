I have been a fan of most of the series for a long time now.  This is by far the worst creed game yet, and it isnt because the content is lacking.  The game is full of constant bugs that just crap all over the immersion.  Like 2 shopkeepers spawning on top of each other, or having certain main quest characters that you have to kill bug out and freeze frame in place.  I have had menus bug out and crash for no reason as well.  Hell the only reason I wrote this review is because I just completed the hare hunting quest and as the achievement popped up in my face it insto crashed to my desktop so ya......The game is very buggy, which is pathetic considering how long ago it was released.
