I came into this game to get two things A More pirate/naval action and aesthetic, and B to take a look at the AC lore from the Templars side.Alas, this game feels like an AC IV Black Flag knockoff, or at most a DLC. The campaign is very short  took me around 15 hours to complete, characters and story are bland and not engaging in the slightest. Even the side characters in AC IV were more fleshed out than this. Side activities and exploration are no longer incentivized. Hunting down assassins popping up throughout the cities quickly starts to grind, and their sneak attacks always leave you with 1 HP, and plenty of time to fight back or chase them.The only redeeming feature of this game is its attempt to show the perspective of the Templars side, which was way overdue. In the last 10 minutes the game also sloppily ties the American arc to the AC Unity.In the end Id say anyones better off playing AC IV Black Flag than this.
