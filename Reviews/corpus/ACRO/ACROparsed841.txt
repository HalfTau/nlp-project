One of the more enjoyable entries in the Assassins Creed franchise, Rogue breaks little new ground, but stills manages to be entertaining. The story flips perspectives, showing us someone who sides with the Templars over the Assassins, as well as the negative aspects of the Brotherhoods activities. Combat is fun, fluid, and makes you feel like a badass. Unlike other recent entries in the series, the game runs rather smoothly, with few hiccups and without crashes or low frame rates, though the graphics are nothing particularily special. In short, long live the Templar Order!
