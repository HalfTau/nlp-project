The game is a standard AC game. I like the pirate parts, gameplay feels like an extension of Black Flag. The game shuts down randomly ACC.exe has stopped working. This problem is common. I got the game on sale for 10 and still would not recommend, as this issue occurs so often that I can not play for 15 minutes straight.
