Since Assassins Creed Rogue has been released, I always had reservations about playing as a Templar.It felt like a betrayal of sorts.But the lack of other games to play and purchasing the game with discount led me to what was an amazing experience.I loved Black Flag, and being able to revisit those moments of seafaring was very rewarding.It is true that you play as the enemy, but you connect with the character and understand what led him to switch sides.Finishing the game at 100 completion is a challenge, but I definitely recommend it as the game is just beautiful, even in these now outdated graphics.And that ending, connecting with other games...No spoilers, but it is really well made.You should try it, even if you are not a big fan of the Assassins Creed franchise.
