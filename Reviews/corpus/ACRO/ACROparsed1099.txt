this game is phenominal, the charecter, shay cormac is the most complex one in the series, betrays his brotherhood because an event i shall not spoil that kills innocent people. The inner conflict in him is amazing, as well as the presentation. The ship controls are improved from black flag and parkour feels smooth as silk. Rogue also turns you to the templar porint of view, rather than the creeds porint of view, and after playing I wanted to side with the templars more than the assassins because they seemed to have a much more noble cause as oppose to simply freedom.
