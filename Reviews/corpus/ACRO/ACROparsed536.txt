If you like AC 4, youll love this game.  The game play is very similar and enhanced to some extent...more shantis, ship upgrades, crafting, hunting, minigames, etc.  But IMO the storyline is not nearly as intriguing, maybe its just me and my interest in 18th century pirates.  But NE Canada and New York prerevolutionary war just seems like a dull time and place in history for me.  But I have to emphasize...the gameplay and the character you play as, is exceptional.  If youre an assassins creed fan, you have to play this game...it helps to play Assassins creed 3 and 4 before you play this game.
