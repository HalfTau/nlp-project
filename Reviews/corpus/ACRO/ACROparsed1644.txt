Despite this game being low key,  I can say I had more fun playing this than I did with black flag, and although Ive not yet played it, it is a damn sight better than unity. And that includes the fact that a lot of the naval gameplay is recycled from black flag. This game is good, and is what should have been the game that they endorsed the  out of. Buy this game!
