At first, I liked this game the new game mechanics were cool, the return of Subject Six was intruiging, I wanted to explore the plot and master the hookblade... but then I started exploring the environment.The city of Constantinople is a boring, drab, brown place that would fit in well in a generic African village level, in a generiic FPS. Almost immediately, I began to miss the beauty and majesty of italy I even missed the underground sections in the Followers of Romulus sections. I slowly lost the desire to touch the game again, and it will probably never be touched a second time. It is condemned to an enternal purgatory, from which I shall never lift it.Cheers!Camolot
