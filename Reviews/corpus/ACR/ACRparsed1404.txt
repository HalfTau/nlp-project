The story of Revelations depends very strongly on knowing who Altair, Ezio, and Desmond are already, and how they got to where they are now, so play the games in order. That said, Revelations offers some neat new gameplay elements on top of the excellent AC formula, at the risk of becoming slightly bloated which has me excited for AC3s fresh start. Like its predecessors, it packs tons of detail into its environments, and tells you tons about the history of its primary city. More importantly, though, it provides great expansions and satisfying conclusions to the stories of Altair and Ezio, leaving the series fully free to explore new assassins and work on Desmonds story.Full review here
