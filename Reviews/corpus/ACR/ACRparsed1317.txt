Revelations again comes off the heels of its predecessor Brotherhood and improves on many things from it. The hookblade is easily the greatest addition, improving climbing speed, maneuverability and gameplay. Other new additions such as bombs are all woven into the storyline very well and make sense. More compelling characters, fantastic music, and visuals, along with a nice change of scenery from Italy, are all welcome.I would only say that it lacks a really detestable villain, like Brotherhood had, and not quite as many interesting supporting characters, however, still entertaining. Even the tower defense minigame is strange in this series, but fun. All in all its a fantastic adventure with challenges and goals, with some clever and satisfying revelations, both to Ezio and Desmond.Well recommended for if you enjoyed AC2 / Brotherhood. Wouldnt recommend it to new players of the series however. Thats about it.
