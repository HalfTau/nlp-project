Revelation is what one could call a fine end to a good character. Thats the main point of this game and i would say you should only play this for the story for some of Ezios last days.Gameplay is almost the exact same as they have been in the previous games maybe tweeked the climbing style or how you controll Ezio but nothing much different. Other than making bombs but honestly who used them outside of where they had to for the story?Graphics for those that care so much for it should be in for a good ride, the graphics are good for its age not to much and not to little, its fine where it is.Is it a good game, i would say so but as i wrote earlier you should play this only for the story if anything, the gameplay offers almost nothing new just some tweeks here and there.
