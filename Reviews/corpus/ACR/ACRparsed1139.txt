I really LOVED AC2 and Brotherhood. I spent hours just watching the cities and landmarks, enjoying the cutscenes like a movie. Revelations had some big shoes to fill and Iwasn t dissapointed.PROS Istambul is as beautiful as Firenze, Rome or Venice, but in its own way so it does not get old. Gameplay is already very proved and polished. Not too much to say about it, same old with a few tweaks. Solid story and interesting NPCs help make some proved mechanics still fun to play. Even sidequests usually are connected with the main story. Ezzio is getting old. Hegets tired, his back hurts and the young ladies dont pay him the attention they used to. But even that is something he does with charm. Tower Defense minigames are fun to play, but dont happen often finished the game with twoCONS A few too many weapons and tools that arent really useful The crossbow made the knives obsolete crafting bombs can be fun, but make no real difference no real use for parachutes, handgun or poison. Desmond missions are not fun at all.
