Ive been pretty harsh on the Assassins Creed games before 3 including Brotherhood but this game really is amazing so far. Ive not beaten it quite yet at the time of this posting but I thought Ive played enough to give it a thumbs up. The issue with the controls that AC 2 engine games suffer from isnt nearly that noticable and you can start to do some cool attack moves. Sure, its no where near 3s level but its a huge step towards it. The character is more interesting than he was in Brotherhood and I think the storyline is better too. Props to them for this game, I recommend it.
