Its a little more of the same from previous entries.The hook is a nice addition but the map was reduced to one town and horses were removed  both of which made this game seem much smaller than Brotherhood.Den defense and Mediterranean defense were kinda meh and required more attention than they deserved.  Den defense is forced and is required way too frequently until you build up your assasins enough and then it just disappears altogether.  Mediterranean defense required WAY too much attention to maintain a hold on a region.  It became way too distracting especially for a completionist like me.If it werent for previous entries this would be an excellent game in and of itself and definitely worth recommending.  If youve played previous entries you know what youre in store for.I havent spent any time on multiplayer but I imagine its as fun as Brotherhood. I just got burnt out on playing Brotherhood so I moved on to other games before giving this one a try.
