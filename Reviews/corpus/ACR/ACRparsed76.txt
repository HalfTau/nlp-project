UPDATE so after digging in the forums I actually maged to fix the bug and it works now. so now i can enjoy it. I love RevelationsAlright to start off let me just say that I actually love Revelations, personally its my favorite, I played it back in the ps3 and I wanted to relive some of those memories. so when I saw it on sale I said why not. I already ran into two problems and I havent even played no more than like 2. there is a bug that doent let me move at all. just keeps stuttering and I havent gone no more than like five feet from the first interation. so that by itself is literally gamebreaking. The second thingn is i Bought the deluxe version but the steam keys dont work so it doesnt let me redeem the content that I purchased. I tried to see if it worked with the ubi store too and nothing. Until this get fxed or I learn to fix it im going to leave it negativeOVERVIEWBug wont let me move more than five feet, so I can not play. Steam keys are not working so i can not get my deluxe content Besides that I know its a great game if it worked
