First i have to say this game is for everyone that played all other ACs before!If you did that then Revelations is just a glorious end of Ezio  Altairs story...! !The storytelling is just one of the best i ever saw in a video game.. the game mechanics got polished and the graphics feel even nicer then before, and the city has definatly its charme...Imho one of the best game stories ever ! Get them all if you can and start them in the correct order!Thumbs Up!
