An awesome conclusion to the Ezio trilogy! Where Assassins Creed Brotherhood failed as a sequel, Assassins Creed Revelations succeeded. The game starts with a breath of fresh air as you explore animus island and play as an older, more dangerous Ezio Auditore. Various bombs, parachutes, and a hook blade are now at your disposal making missions a lot more interesting and fun. This Assassins Creed game comes with a few upgrades and leaves behind past mistakes. Although this game still wreaks of bugs and glitches that do become annoying... You dont want to miss one of the best storylines yet.
