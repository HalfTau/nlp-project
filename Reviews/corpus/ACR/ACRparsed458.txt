This game would be worth it simply for its unique setting, and how beautifully it is realized. Constantinople and Byzantine history are personal favorites of mine, so being able to explore the city as it was at the turn of the 16th century is a real treat. Completing Ezio and Altairs stories was a poignent and satisfying experience that began with the original Assassins Creed years prior. The Desmond stuff is tolerable, like usual, but not obnoxious or particularly in the way, not like usual. If you played AC2, and maybe Brotherhood, and then lost steam for the franchise, go ahead and finish Ezios story with Revelations. Its a great ending. I wish I could say the same for Desmonds story concluion in AC3, but thats a review for another game!
