As in the previous titles, Revelations is a nice continuation of the series, but the flaws in the franchise begin to pop out. The storytelling is stilted and generic as always, leaving the player wanting something in the way of literary ingeunity. The graphics department has truly outdone itself, with this being one of the bestlooking games of its generation. One major problem with Revelations is that the size of Constantinople seems dwarfed by Rome from Brotherhood, despite the fact of it being 3x the size at the times the game take place. The campaign is also noticeably shorter and playtime is likewise surprisingly shortened. Overall, it maintains the great aspects of the franchise but seems to have taken a step backward rather than forward.
