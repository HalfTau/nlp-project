This is what I was expecting when I played Brotherhood. A call back to the first game, a decent look at the theme of aging with relation to the protagonist, and a sense of progress for the series. Unfortunately since Brotherhood was lacking these important qualities but brought everything else to the table, Revelations comes across as a retread which is a shame.Thankfully, this game puts the story of Ezio and Altair to a satisfying conclusion and even manages to develop the character of Desmond Miles somewhat. At the very least, the game has set itself up for a solid arc in the third game.Multiplayer here is...hard to discuss. On one hand, significant improvements have been made to the mechanics of how abilities and movement works in this game but  the game glitches a worrying amount of time. Additionally, the contract system is poorly designed, for example I once recieved the 1st place player I was his only pursuer but I recieved three pursuers while I was ranked 4th or 6th.
