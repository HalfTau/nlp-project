Another expansion for Assassins Creed 2. Visit the mighty Constantinople and help Ezio to revive and discover the secrets of the final days of Altair. The city is the pretties, more colorful and interesting of all the Assassins Creed places, and the mix of Arabic, Persian and Western style feels great. The rest of the game is basically the same as the previous ones.
