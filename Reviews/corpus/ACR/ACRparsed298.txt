Out of the Assassins Creed games Ive played so far 2, Brotherhood  Revelations, this one was probably my favorite.I especially found the mini games and side quests slightly more interesting than in the previous ones, though they are probably still not one of ACs greatest assets.Constantinople is absolutely beautiful and the story remains interesting. If you liked the previous AC games, youll like this one as well.
