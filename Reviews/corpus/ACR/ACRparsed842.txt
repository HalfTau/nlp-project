Battles trap you to much still. Sanctums are a bit better, Yussaf would have been a better character to run with than Ezio again, really every character is better as a 1 game character. Better without the Glyphs, although I think Ezio is best as a older seasoned guy. At least Miles doesnt look too much like a distant ancestor either. An interesting esoterric back drop. Good for the price.
