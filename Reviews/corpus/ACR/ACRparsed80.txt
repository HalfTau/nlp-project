This chapter of Assassins Creed is one of the best I have played. Soundtrack was brilliantly composed by the legendary Jesper Kyd, with collaboration of Lorne Balfe. Instruments was used perfectly to fit in with Turkish atmosphere. Especially Galata Tower. I absolutely like the storyline and curious to find out more on whats going on next. However I just dont like how repetitive Assassins Creed is. As in copy paste gameplay mechanics like destroy towers just like in previous chapter  Assassins Creed Brotherhood.
