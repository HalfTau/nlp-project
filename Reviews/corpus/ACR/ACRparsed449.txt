While I have some mixed feelings about the game, Its a kind of a closure to the Ezio trilogy.In terms of gameplay, ripoff with minor changes.In terms of plotline, the game had an unexpected plotline, for the good and for the bad.In terms of Graphics, the game is colourful in contrast to previous games, and even following games
