Not a very memorable Assassins Creedmy opinion, the series started to fall apart with Brotherhood, and has only declined since then, with minor improvements. The story is relatively dumbed down and a lot less interesting than the first one or especially 2 even Brotherhood managed to resurrect some of the interest of the first two. Considering all of that, its still relatively fun, but theres nothing new here besides the lackluster battle sequences where you basically play tower defense with Templar Dota 2 Creeps...I will be honest that I havent played the whole thing, but it really lost me when I saw how the story has really declined into Assassins  good and Templars  bad, oh and Ezio is tougher than Chuck Norris on stilts and steroids. 6/10.
