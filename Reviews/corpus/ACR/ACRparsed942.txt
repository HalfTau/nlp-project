Still carries Ezios charisma, which really helps to make the game but, compared to Brotherhood, Constantinople is from from the beauty of Rome. All in all, a pretty good game with the same old mechanics and some interesting new additions and revelations, no pun intended, story wise. It has been fun Ezio, but its goodbye.
