Absolutely terrible experience. I wish I could rate this game based off of its content. However, seemingly irrelevant programs have rendered me unable to start and actually play the game.After downloading the game itself, I have to download some ttass program called Uplay so that these s can track my progress for some dumbass reason. But guess what  uplay never works and always crashes everytime i try to open it. Therefore, the game never turns on and I am never able to play it.Im rating this right now without even playing the game , because GAME OWNERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THEIR ING GAMES WITHOUT ANY ING STUPIDASS PROBLEMS. Get yourtogether ubisoft.
