I love this game, it improves upon brotherhood. Also the Altair revelation in this game keeps you looking for more keys to find out more of what happened to Altair after the end of the original Assassins Creed. Before playing however you must Remove the Collision effects from the installation folder. There are videos on Youtube on how to do this and its pretty straight forward. Otherwise the Collision Bug in the Original install makes the game almost unplayable. So do this before starting your adventure. Ezzio Auditore awaits.
