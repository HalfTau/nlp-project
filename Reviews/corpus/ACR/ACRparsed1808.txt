I love the writing in this franchise and the way they finished with the stories of both Ezio and Altair only furthers my appreciation. Just like Brotherhood there is a new big city, new characters and new features with around 2030 hours single player game time not including all the fun side missions and 100 synchronization challenges. Multiplayer still feels unique and is still going strong with a few upgrades implemented although they still need a text chat, perk balance and lighting that hits the thick players running around on rooftops. If youve played the other AC games you know what to expect by now and if you havent then go buy the first Assassins Creed because Revelations feels like a season finale.
