Feels like an assassins creed. so i do recommend it.but it definitely has more bugs and crashes than the previous titles.the crashes at certain cutscenes could be solved by temporarily setting the cpu affinity to 1 core/threadand the problem with the texture flickering can be solved by deleting systemdetection.dll out of the game folder
