That is one of the first several games of Assassins Creed game series so this game has less gameplay details and worse graphics than other games of this serie which came after than this one. But this game is still well enough. The place is stanbul, biggest city and the capital of Ottoman Empire and the time is government years of Beyazt II. The best  detail for me as a Turkish Turkish voice details and without that our people seems like Arabic, that this game shows our culture. Nice game, I advice everyone.Graphics 75/100Gameplay 65/100Scenario88/100Details 93/100General 80/100
