The weakest of all AC titles, almost no revelations at all.It only concludes the story of Ezio/Altair which was epic, but the game is very short, the tower defense missions are horrible, you have to go back once in a while to defend towers from being attacked over and over again..The gameplay remains the same like the previous installments, which is good, the music is excellent as always and the story is the best thing in this game, but this sequel wont tell you much..The MP is quite fun and original, but very frustrating sometimes.My Rating 8/10
