I played AC1 AC Brother hood and this game....For Revelations Im sad to say that I would give this a 310...Yes it is a fun game but only until you have burnt threw the story.Once the Story is done..The game quickly turns from a game to a chore as I spent Hours doing nothing but buying everything.the Desmonds Journy back story...yea that was a waste of time as it has you running threw the program in FP mode just traveling around a maze while he explains his lifes story.BORING...I swear other then the main story this game reaks of time waster.Wouldent play it a 2nd time.
