A decent addition to the Assassins Creed franchise. Its not amazing as a standalone game, but as part of the series, it does well to further some of the enjoyable gameplay elements found in the previous games. As usual the game is beautifully crafted, exploring the cities is very rewarding and the plot stays interesting.
