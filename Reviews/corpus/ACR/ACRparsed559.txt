After 20 hours I beat the main quest, this games main story is incredibly short.  I did many other things in those 20 hours besides the main quest, it just feels so short and almost like it was suppose to be part of the previous brotherhood game.  Same assassins dens, saving villagers, cities needing conquering, etc.  with the addition of bomb making. The bomb making can be fun, but you normal figure out which ones you always want in you pocket and keep those around.I say its worth a few bucks, but nothing more.  Its a good step in the story, but nothing more, its the equivalent of a halflife episode we have all been hoping for in terms of length.  Good, but I wanted a little more.
