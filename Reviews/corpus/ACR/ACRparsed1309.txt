Im a big lover of the Assassins Creed series. Black Flag is my favorite followed by Revelations. The thing which I have about Revelations is it is a GTA feel.There is no fast travel so your next task is 5/10 mins free run away  Free running is BRILIANT! but when you have played 15 hours and would like to continue with the storey its boring...Like GTA  You finish a task/mission, You run 5 mins to the next one. Your task is to collect and deliver anI wanna plunder and pillage! Just like AC4 Black Flag!ROLL ON UNITY!
