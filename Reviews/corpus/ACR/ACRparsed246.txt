This one surprised me. I didnt expect it to become my favourite thus far in the series. I really enjoyed playing old Ezio. Great story and reflection on the Ezio trilogy. If I had to name one thing I like the most in the AC Revelations I couldnt decide between the beautiful city of Istanbul or the hookblade.
