The Ezio Trilogy is amazing. Assassins Creed Revelations is the best one yet. The gameplay is basically the same, but now there are bombs and tactical defense of assassins dens. As usual, the environment looks realistic and buoyant Constantinople is the prettiest city Ubisoft developed so far. This is one of the games that pay most attention to storytelling, if you like plotcentered games, the AC series is the way to go.9.5/10
