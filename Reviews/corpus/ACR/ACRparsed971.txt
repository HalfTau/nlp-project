Man, people give this game but it is so much better than Brotherhood. The story is really compelling, Constantinople is a nice change from Italian cities, and old man Ezio is THE BEST. He is so brutal, and raw, his fighting style is better than ever. Probably my second favourite AC after Black Flag. The story is short, but the desire to own all of Constantinople will make you keep playing until you are lord of all. Happy gaming!
