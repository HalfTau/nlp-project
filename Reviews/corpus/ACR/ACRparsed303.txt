Back from when Assassin Creed games had a climbing system more complex then a onebutton automatic. With things like timing, skill and freedom imagine! You can jump diagonally!!!11. And a story! And a real world part that wasnt an annoying and soulless collection of stupid mini games! Good times these. In hindsight the last real Assassins Creed! And Revelations is the second best for me after AC 2. Played both several times.The way Revelations combines the story lines of AC1 and 2 and of Altair and Ezio, and brings it to an magical moments! conclusion, is just beautiful and very well made and written. Compare this to the story of Syndicate liberate 30 parts of the city  The End. It shows that the UbiFormula isnt bad IF you build a proper game into it.All further Episodes had their various problems, but with AC2 and Revelations i have literally nothing to complain about. Except Uplay of course. With the best game Ubisoft ever made AC2 they also introduced AlwaysOn DRM. Man i hate these guys for the way they treat customers...! The list of Ubisoft annoyances is endless.... and still grows.Anyway Both games have aged extremely well. Revelations still looks amazing. Only the lod in fardistance views show the age a bit.Had a massive stuttering graphics bug, apparently common under Win10. Running the game as Administrator solved the problem. Also out of the box 219 support.
