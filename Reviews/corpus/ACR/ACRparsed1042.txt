Despite the weird glitches and sometimes shoddy character design, this game comes through as probably the best one in the series. It really opens up the story from the Assassins Creed universe to a huge, detailed, fleshed out universe which is the best immersive experience I may have ever had in a video game. Sometimes I get mad at some of the weird mechanics and bad design, but overall it is a good game.
