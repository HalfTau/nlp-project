Assassins Creed Revelations is the 3rd entry into the Ezio saga and again sees Ezio, an exiled Florentine noble thrust into a world of deep intrigue, this time in Istanbul/Constantinople with a plot between Sultan and Basileus with a helping hand from his Eastern assassin brothers.The plot is of course split between present day Desmond Miles and the fun portions of the game. Yes, Desmond is a silly mechanic but theyve gone this far so they may as well finish it.The Turk assassins teach Ezio the ways of the HookBlade, allowing him to rapidly climb tall structures and use ziplines seamlessly. This contributed to the traversal in Revelations being the best in the series at the time of release.The inanimus story is good, the gameplay is the same fantastic beast that the series always delivers and the HookBlade really introduces a fun kick to the formula, would I recommend this game to a friend? Absolutely.
