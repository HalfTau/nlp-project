WORST OR BEST ASSASSINS CREED EVER?Lets keep this simple. Im a big AC fan. I love this saga and the enjoyment has been great trough all this years. Amazing tech and an inmmersive story is all I ask from a game. I think AC1 is the best respect for the pionner, please. 2 place ACIV a refreshing surprise. 3 place ACII of course 4 place ACBrotherhood  a lot of good gameplay in this one, long and satisfying 5 place ACIII kinda like this one, my first AC in a long time when I returned to gaming and I havent played yet ACUnity and ACSyndicate. And I feel ACRevelations as the worst. The graphics feel dated, the level design is questionable and I am not really enjoying it. Playing this game is like working, you do it for those juicy Ubisoft credits.PeaceEDIT Ok people. Ive been playing more, and Im starting to appreciate the good old AC sensations in this one. Its good, all of them are amazing. I dont even have PC yet for Unity. Yeah, Im poor working all day in Spain. But it is fine, games, as movies, get better when old.EDIT Im playing even more. At 91.84 I can tell you Im enjoying it. Im understanding deeper revelations about the AC game mechanic. There also a lot of multiplayer to conquer. Sometimes its empty but people still gather to play sometimes.
