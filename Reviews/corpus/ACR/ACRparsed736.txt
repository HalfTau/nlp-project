A great end to the story of Ezio Auditore. Revelations continues to work on the ideas of Brotherhood, but makes some welcome introductions, such as the bombs, the hookblade and the Mediterranean War. Besides, this game is tied strongly to the first Assassins Creed game and Altairs story.All in all, one of the best games in the series.
