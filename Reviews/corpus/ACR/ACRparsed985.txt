Ok I am tired of saying Another Great Game from the Assassins Creed series but Ezio is still kicking somein his elderliness.Around 25 hrs of game play with some sidemissions.What I like  Great Story, Open World, controls could be a little bit better but doesnt break the experience.Worth buying, preferable on Sale considering the games age but you wont regret neverthless...
