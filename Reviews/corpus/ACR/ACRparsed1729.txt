Revelations is a bit of a bittersweet experience. On the one hand the game offers up a lot more answers and insight into the story arcs of Ezio Auditore, Altair Ibn LaAhad, Desmond Miles and the struggle between Templar and Assassin but at the same time the entire thing feels like its tied together very loosely.Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood featured Ezio Auditore struggling against the Italian Templars first as a means for personal revenge and then as a true Assassin fighting against tyranny. With the shift to Constantinople both Ezio and the player feel like complete outsiders with no real stake in the budding conflict between Ahmet and Selim over the Sultanate. The entire expereince is even ironically summed up at the end of the game when Ezio is told to leave and never return  leaving any and all of the players victories and failures feeling hollow.To make matters worse Revelations is the first installment in the series to really not bring anything new and groundbreaking to the franchise. The biggest additions are the hookblade and the bomb making but both of these things feel like they were just added out of necessity rather than as interesting and enjoyable features.The most outlandish of the new features however is Desmonds Journey and later the Lost Archive DLC. Seperate from the main game, these portions have you navigate puzzles and obstacles from a firstperson view while learning more about Desmond Miles and Clay Kaczmarek Subject 16. While the concept is interesting it just feels out of place and as a result kind of unnecessary.The multiplayer however did see some improvements  namely the introduction of Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes as well as the ability for players to customize their characters clothing and weapons.Overall I believe Revelations real issue stems from the fact that its trying to cover too many bases at the same time. Attempting to tie up loose ends between mutiple characters spread out over different time periods and games, moving the main modern day story arc along, AND giving the player a new location with a new historical storyline and characters proves to be too much for Ubisoft to stuff into a 25 hour title and in Revelations case it definitely shows.
