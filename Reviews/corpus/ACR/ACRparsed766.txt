Ill keep this short. Its a good game. Your last real chance to play the series as Ezio. I dont personally think its as strong as the older ones but its still very solid. It plays fine and I have not had any significant issues with UPlay. I really like the online but, being an older game, its not played very much really. The graphics are good. The story is good. The environment is good. I dont think its quite as immersive as the older games set in Italy but its still good. Im not a fan of the minigame at all but I do like the game they carried over where you train and recruit assassins.
