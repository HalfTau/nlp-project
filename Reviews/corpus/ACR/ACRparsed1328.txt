This at the time was by far the nicest looking AC game. The game takes you back to the lands of the first game as Ezio and at times you also find yourself playing briefly as Altar. The game reveals more about the two Assassins stories whilst not even slightly advancing the story outside the animus at all. The game as with most AC sequels is prettier to look at and has more fluid controls I also feel that this game has a lot of good atmosphere and some great characters. Apart from what Ive already said the game is just more of the same and a further improvement of past titles.10/15  More AC, but without any story progression outside of the animus.
