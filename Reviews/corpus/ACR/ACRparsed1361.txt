AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. I am literally unable to run it due to the DRM complaining about my CD key even though I have never run it before on any other. It seems Ubisoft tries their hardest to make all their games as difficult as possible or even outright impossible to run. Save yourself a mountain of hassle and buy a game that just plays without all this unnecessary DRM nonsense that you dont even need because Im running it through steam anyway youd think theyd be authentication enough.
