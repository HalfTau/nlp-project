Where do I start? Short story Just go replay Brotherhood and watch the important cutscenes for Revelations online.Long story This game adds nothing new or worthwhile to the franchise. Sure there are a few new mechanics, like assassin training and custom bomb creation, but I feel like those are just minor tweaks to the Brotherhood formula. Even though those were somewhat useful, they still added a bunch stuff that wasnt, like the tower defense sequences,Its like ordering an ice cream sundae, something you know and love, and the server tells you that youre getting the new and improved sundae thats totally better then the regular old sundae. So you give it a shot and from the outside it looks like they just added a couple sprinkles on top and called it new, but then you dig in and realize theres Brussels sprouts in it. Now dont get me wrong, some people like Brussels sproutsincluding me, it can be good if its prepared properly. but theybelong in ice cream, let alone a sundae.Revelations also drags out Ezios story making it longer than it needed to be, and they left out one of his most memorable and important moments, his death. No, no, no, they reservedfor an animated short for a spinoff game. I love Ezios character, hes a badass, but lets be honest, we all know he needs to die at some point in order for Desmonds story to exist. Revelations couldve had a beautiful beginning and end as we followed his beginnings, we also see his end. I feel like that was stolen from us.I had high hopes for Revelations, but unfortunately it did not deliver. What it did deliver is a boring and mediocre addition to the Assassins Creed franchise. I want to restore hope in the franchise, hopefully its not too late for me. I heard 3 wasnt that bad, and the spinoff games have pretty decent reviews. Who knows. One thing I do know, is that I wont be replaying this installment anytime soon.
