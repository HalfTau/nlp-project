The final works of Ezio are memorable indeed. From his birth, we have seen this man age and become an elder. A process you in the beginning feel quite a bit.There is a beginning section where you are wounded and need medicine, limiting your climbing abilities and forcing you to make do with what you have, which are haystacks. A nice way to get people gradually reacquainted with how you do things in the AC series.Constantinople is now your playground. Everything you could do in Rome, can now be done there, and more. The Hookblade serves as an additional climbing method. Whereas in Brotherhood, you could leap and grab hold of a normally unreachable spot, you can now use this technique to climb even faster by launch yourself a second time. A rush to do several times in succession, though for some reason it still functions perfectly for dual assassinations.Bombs can be put together now as well, allowing you to carry three types. To distract, to kill and for tactical purposes. For every type, you can put together several ingredients with different effects befitting their purpose. Distracting bombs will usually distract guards and such, while lethal bombs will kill in various ways. Tactical bombs can range from smoke bombs, to bombs that drop fake coins to lure a crowd of people, and much much more.Whlie an excellent game, I cant say that youll be able to fully appreciate the game and story if you havent played its predecessors.If you have been following the AC storyline, youll enjoy the progress of Ezio and the hidden history of Altar. Especially the latters closure is a potentially emotional one.A worthy end to a storyline focussed on an Italian Assassin. Up to the next one!
