Seems really dumbed down relying more heavily on their not so good combat instead of any intriguing puzzles. Tells you when to use eagle vision too often. Im only amused by the free roaming and the plot, but find myself missing the puzzles and other rich elements that were in 2 and 3. I would NOT recomend paying the full price of this game.edit Why did this get changed to recommended??
