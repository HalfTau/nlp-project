I have played nearly every assassins creed since the one. I did not get this one when it came out because i was busy with life and as being the 4th in the enzio series i assumed it would not be all that good. I was wrong to not buy it and I was wrong that it would bad.What i dont understand is why in all of the following assassins creeds dont have the same control structure that this one does. The two most notable things i found were that there are two kinds of running, you hold down your right click to run, which is different but it works because if you want to actually climb up anything or jump onto something you have to also click space along with holding down your right click. This makes it so that my assassin doesnt just jump on a random box im running buy or decide to climb a wall when im just running buy it, its a perfect yet simple fix to a problem im STILL RUNNING INTO IN ROUGUE! How is it that a solution to this problem was found and not used in any creed after.The other control based thing that sets this apart is that you have to subtly move your mouse to select the person you want to counter attack. In almost every other creed you press counter attack to win all fights, its easy, too easy for a game that boasts a good combat system, in revelations when im in a fight with 5 or 6 guys, its actually difficult to switch my selection and its incredibly satisfying to be able to select over the correct person and counter attack them. Much more satisfying then if i had just pressed my E button and won the fight.Overall great game, best controls of any Assassins Creed game i have played.
