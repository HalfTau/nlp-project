2 assassins, one destiny. Another entry in Assassisns Creed series with good innovations and storytelling. Revelations shows us final moments of Ezio Auditore as he travels to Constantinople where he must find keys to sacred chamber in Masyaf where assassisins were born. While gameplay stays same like past 2 games only new thing we get is bomb crafting. You can find various elements to craft different bombs for different situations. Buy new armor upgrades, different weapons,, upgrading shops, training your assassins and sending them to other cities all same from past game but better. As you progress you also can play as Altair to see what happens before and after events of first game. Multiplayer is great in its own way, different missions to play very fun to enjoy with friends. Overall best game of series, but short.
