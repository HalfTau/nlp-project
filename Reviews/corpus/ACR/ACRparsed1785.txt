A step back in playability that adds a plethora of new mechanics, has boring, immersionbreaking but optional tutorials, and then gives you little chance to experiement with the few combinations that are consistently successful. Good for the last twenty minutes as Sixteen and Desmond carry an otherwise lackluster plot continuation.
