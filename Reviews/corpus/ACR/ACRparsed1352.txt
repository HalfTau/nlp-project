Loved this game way more than Brotherhood. To this point in the series I would rank this game just behind Assassins Creed II. It seems as though all the extra missions that were thrown into Brotherhood have been toned down. I found myself wanting to liberate towers and open all the shops because it seemed like there were less of them this go around. The Ezio/Altair stories were tied in together nicely and at the end of the game seemed to satisfy the conclusions to their story. On the other side of the story though, the Desmond portion was confusing before and even more confusing at the end. Overall though, I highly recommend this game along with the second one.
