The final chapter in the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, to date at least.Revelations is a fun romp through Istanbul that helps to tie up not only Ezios story but also wraps up the story of Altar IbnLaAhad as well as sets up the Desmond Miles story for its final Chapter in ACIII.I really enjoy the Assassins Creed franchise and this game was just as fun as the others, Ill miss Ezio, but Im also looking forward to the next game and its new character!If you havent played this game yet or the others then I highly recommend checking it out!
