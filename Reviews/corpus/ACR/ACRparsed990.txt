great story. If you want to enjoy the game 100, you got to know whats going on, so i recommend playing ac 2 and ac brotherhood before playing it. sometimes the controlls feel a bit awkward especially while freerunning. After you finish the story, you can play the desmond missions and multiplayer. the desmond missions are pretty entertaining, but multiplayer is less enjoyable and gets a bit boring after a while. besidfe that its a awesome game and definetely recommend if youre a fan of ac. 8/10
