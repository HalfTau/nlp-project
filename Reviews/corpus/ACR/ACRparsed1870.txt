The last chapter in the Ezio Trilogy, Assassins Creed Revelations ACR concludes the stories of Altar ibn LaAhad and Ezio Auditore da Firenze creatively binding the two together providing a satisfying ending. ACR streamlines the action and breaks up the tediousness of climbing by combining elements from the past games and by introducing the hookblade. The game also features Desmond Sequences that are a unique form of firstperson platforming missions, but are served as unlockable levels. It should be noted that three downloadable content packs are available Ancestors Character Pack, Mediterranean Traveler Map Pack and The Lost Archive. The Lost Archive is a singleplayer expansion to the rather monotonous Desmond Sequences.
