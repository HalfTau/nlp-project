My favourite Assassins Creed Game.Pros Awesome inovations, like hookblade. Improved aspects from pervious games. Best openworld game ever. Most less annoying and most fun parkour missions where you look for artifacts. Uplay seems fun and it has cool unlocks, but I hope they will stick with steam as well.Cons Sometimes horrible controls Ezio tries to walk fast and he accidently steals money, citizens alert guards, and open conflict begins, mission fails.Might be updated.
