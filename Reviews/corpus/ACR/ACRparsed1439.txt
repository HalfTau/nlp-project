This is the 4th episode of the AC franchise, and in my opinion it is up to the expectations, but just no more than that.From the storyline point of view it doesnt push the story that far after Brotherhood, but gives many insights on some side stories, like the role of Lucy Stillman in the big picture, thanks especially to the DLC.In the main story about Ezio there arent particular improvements sinceBrotherhood. In some situation you have just the impression that its all a repetition of what happened in Rome.From a gameplay point of view, I found some improvements very interesting, other simply terrible. I liked very much all the city conquest feature, and also the siege parts. Also the bomb vrafting was interesting, and the new moves, like the use of ziplines. What i really didnt like were the animus sessions, that were in most cases just boring from a gameplay point of view, whilst they gave some interesting insights about the story or even annoying. It was a pain for me getting all the achievements, the impress Warren Vidic in particular was a nightmare.The multyplayer section is enjoyable. Personally the only game mode I like enough is the deathmach, finding the other ones mildly boring, especially at this stage, with 2 chapters went out after ACR, with the volume of player restricted only to some hardcore gamers.Overall, this game is a must play only for the fans of the saga that I am!, while new player should probably start from the first chapter, or even as I read in the reviews jump directly to the Black Flag chapter.
