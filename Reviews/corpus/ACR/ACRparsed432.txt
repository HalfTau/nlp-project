85/100Last part of the EzioStory.. a bit Assassins Creed 2.960 hours if you collect everything, max Assassins, go for 75 SynchroPROgreat Gfxgood Story lots of CinematicsFun to play and exploreJumping all over the place is real funhuge WeaponVariety esp. thanks to Hookblade/Crossbow/BombsCONsome bugs,a few almost gamebreaking second half feels rushed chapter 6Altair parts lack any depth Multiplayer is utter crapNo Endless Mode sad, since you cant enjoy your weapons any longerSUMMARY Enjoy the time, when Assassin Creed was a great franchise AC2  AC2 Brotherhoodand not totally centered around a mass market and MainstreamMultiplayer crap! !Unity flopped, and Syndicate is just a modernized Unity with slightly lower tec specs and gfx, so it runs smoothly on consoles now  lol DAnd while Uplay is just annoying, the real prob is UBISOFT trying to get rich with DLCs and Micropayment in any game they did
