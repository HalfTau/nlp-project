GIMMICKS GALORE!As with most AC games, random stupid elements get thrown in for added value. Theyre awful, and horrid to crawl through. Youll never want something to be over faster than the tower defense gamemodes thrown in for what feels like lastminute attempts to save face in this mediocre expansion.The story of subject 16 is finally resolved, and bridges some gaps between ACII and ACIII. Not a necessary buy, but a good one to experience the whole series.Multiplayer doesnt add much, if anything, besides skins.
