I would say the only really good thing about this game is the story, and it serves as a good conclusion to the ezio trilogy in that regards, but the main missions are really repetitive and get old fast. If youre really just interested in the story than watch a no commentary walkthrough on youtube. Otherwise I would say play brotherhood or II.
