Its AC. Recruit, assinate. lead, fight. Whats not to like. It has its flaws but combat is satisfying and fun. Start a fight, take their weapon and beat them to death with it,drop it, then on to the next. Oddly satisfying listening to the crowds OOOOOOs and AWWWWWs when you get the good shot in.The game doesnt have the annoying climb/jump puzzles of AC2Looks great. Runs smooth on my 7yr old system with a GTX650 1gb card.If you are an AC fan definatly pick this one up. Got mine on sale at a  bargin price. Even better. Only one question. WTF is the Animus for? Its my third AC game 2,3 and revelations and i still dont know WTF its for. Accessing memories I know. What happened someone loose their car keys? Something about Templars and a shiney apple. Yada yada yada. Why cant it just be a game about Assanins fighting the Templars. Why add silly conspiricy stuff that absolutely impossible. Templars today? Running the World? Impossible.
