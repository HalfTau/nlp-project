Unplayable!  This game is so bugged I cant even play it.  It gliches out like crazy.  Ive had the game for a while.  Unfortunately, when I first bought the game and tried it then, it was working fine. I logged about 34 hours of gameplay and then havent returned to play it until now.   Im not sure what has changed or why it is very buggy. I doubt I can get a refund or a new game key from steam since I am over the time limits etc.  Its a shame because I was trying to get through all of the Creed games in chronological order and am afraid I might have to skip this one.  I would rather not have to buy a new one, but I guess 20 isnt too bad to pay for it on amazon.
