This title begins to bring to fore what an annoying littleDesmond is. Hes an infuriatingly normal everyman the player is supposed to relate to, which Im sure works if the player is himself a flat average college boy, not so much for anyone else. Despite this, the game continues the trend of steady improvement in the series, both because of the interesting, less explored milieu of Constantinople under Ottoman rule, and because it expands the previously flimsy recruitment and conquest mechanics. Side quests now feel more distinctive, instead of just old wine in new glasses. The game also introduces faster overall climbing mechanics, further improving the players ability to easily get around. The series still cant seem to rid itself of the needlessly contrived parkour puzzles where you always conveniently have exactly one path through which to advance.
