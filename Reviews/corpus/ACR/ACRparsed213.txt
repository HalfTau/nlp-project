Ive played this game through twice. Once on the XBox 360 and once on here. And I really enjoyed it both times. Visually the game looks great, very different from other games. Combat is, okay, its been better, and its been worse. It runs well on my 300 laptop which means basically anyone can run it. The story is also great, with flashbacks to Altair. Over all I really recommend this game!
