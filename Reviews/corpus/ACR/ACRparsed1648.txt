Assassins Creed Revelations is a great addition to the ever expanding and intriguing Assassin Creed series. At first look and play the game seems as usual and repetitive as the others. Revelations continues off with Ezio Auditore an assassin fighting to rebuild his brotherhood while trying to piece together some of the past history of the Assassin Brotherhood. On top of that he sparks up somewhat a romance with another main character. All in all the game deliver a very immersive gameplay, expanded its resources, and even added new locations. Although not the most gripping AC game so far it earned a place in the story by shedding more light on past events and developing Desomond Miles character for the future series.
