My favourite Assassins Creed game, no doubt, great story, good gameplay, YUSUF TAZIM, YUSUF TAZIM, YUSUF TAZIM! and of course the hook AND the blade.But sometime Ezio randomly jumps of building and kills himself when i just want him to climb or sometimes he jumps into the middle of a templar teritory and starts a battle and scares away the coward templars THAT I NEED TO KILL! !But still, a great game and I recommend you to buy it.sorry for my bad English
