Very great game. Has very good graphics, lots of action, and is such an amazing game alone. The Assassins Creed series is VERY good. Especially this game! I recommend this game to people who LOVE 3 parkour, action, sword fighting, and the Assassins Creed Series. I havent played much, but I have played enough to the point where I know its a great game. 11/10 IGN level mate.11/10  1110  11  3 3 sides in the illuminati triangle  441 because there is 1 day till school monday  3HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED!!!
