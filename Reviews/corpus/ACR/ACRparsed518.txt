Like Assassins Creed 2 and Assassins Creed Brotherhood this game is loads of fun and has kind of a nice story. The RPG Aspects of the game are great, plus the assassins guild leveling system and the constant income / town rebuilding system motivates a lot.Additional features include a tower defense game for districts fun the first time, strange anytime else, though, loads of secrets to be found and actual, real historical backgrouds for fictional and real persons and places.And, mind you, the Hidden Blade. And Bombs. And Parachutes. And Poison. And Trowing Knives. And Swords. And Guns. And Crossbows. And... Well, you get the idea If it kills people, its in this game
