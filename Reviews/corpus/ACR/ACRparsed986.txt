First of all I just want to say one thing. THIS IS THE WORST GAME IN THE SERIES, its way to short and not as nearly as good brotherhood and 2 but if you really love assassins creed and played 2 and brotherhood  and want to finish ezios story then by all means get it and play it my favorite thing about the game is the hookblade how didnt it carry over into the rest of the series.
