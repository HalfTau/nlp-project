An improvement over the previous titles in game mechanics, Assassins creed Revelations gives the player a satisfiying ending to the stories of its first two protagonists, Ezio Auditore and Altar IbnLaAhad. While the plot is a tad weaker than the other entries in the Desmod Story Arc, its characters are rich and vibrant and the conclusion makes up for any misgivings you might have. All in all, Revelations is a visually beautiful game with a soundtrack to match. In the end youll wish you could go back and experience it for the first time all over again.10/10 would assassinate again.
