For experienced AC players.Good one.But it seems that this one has not been tested sufficiently for some new features not interesting enough,like the hookblade,without which those effects it takes can also be reached through other methods.Bomb part is a bit of unreasonable and boring for the uneasy aiming and occupation of the secondary weapon key,however theres a too large challenge system and glitches in data records of the bombsIve contact UBI service executives,without an answers of correcting but suggesting that replaying.Some people may say that using bombs we can quickly deal with a big group of janissaries.But I prefer bare hands melee.Assassin recruit system are not improved but more inconvenient,recruits weapon types are predictable,but sometimes not,another glitch,maybe.The UI or maneuver system of Mediterranean arrangement of recruits are not easy to be used or noticed,for many players did not notice it and did not know of that there can be more than 12 recruits.Tower defense is a game,as a lonethe real gameplay,the tower defense comes to disturb the experiance of the players in the beginning part of the game walkthrough.People are firstly annoyed with it.But after most of the game features experianced and completed,players really want to play more about the tower defense,but was told thatyour assassin dens are managed by master assassin recruits,the templars can never get the chance to attack.If they really improve the tower defense system,I suggest that adding one option of it in some menu,like the Tyranny of King Washington in Assassins Creed 3,with a gameplay like Plants vs. Zombies.
