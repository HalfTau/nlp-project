Assassins Creed Revelations is a third person parkour/stealth game, and the third in the Assassins Creed II trilogy of games. While on the surface this game may seem similar to  indeed, even improved from its predecessors, the game suffers from a weak plot and repetitive gameplay relative to the previous games.StoryEzio Auditore is graying, but he hasnt slowed down yet. After travelling to the fortress of Altair, the assassin protagonist from the original Assassins Creed, in search of answers, he is confronted by a group of Templars who are searching for five keys that could open up Altairs vault and give them access to the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact left behind by Those Who Came Before that can reveal many secrets and control mens minds, among other things. Ezio must find the keys before them so that he can keep the artifact safe.Alas, this games plot is quite poor compared to the previous games the plot is motivated entirely by a collect the soup cans plot, where you try and collect the magical keys before the bad guys do. The cast is all new, with only Ezio appearing from the previous two Assassins Creed II games, and while there are flashbacks to Altairs life in the aftermath of the original Assassins Creed, having never played the first game, Im not sure to what extent some of the characters are carried over from that game.The biggest problem lies in the fact that the modernday plot  the entire reason that Desmond, the protagonist, is flashing back through his ancestors memories  takes an extreme back seat throughout the game. Desmond spends the entire game trapped in the machine that allows him to view his ancestors memories, and thus the metaplot comes to a screeching halt and the whole game feels like a pointless cashin, something which Ubisoft created to exploit AC II once more before finally releasing AC III. While the metaplot never consumed a huge fraction of the previous games, its absence here is very notciable, as Ezios story just isnt that interesting or highstakes, and none of the characters I encountered in Constantinople connected with me in any way. The whole conspiracy theory angle that the previous games had is almost entirely lost, with no real signs of said gigantic conspiracy appearing in the game, and without that whole aspect, the game is simply much less interesting.GameplayThe gameplay is virtually unchanged from the previous Assassins Creed II games. Ezio starts out with all his toys, and he only really gets a couple new ones  a hook that he can use to extend his reach while jumping, which is vaguely interesting for some platforming, and bombs, which have a variety of effects, but the main one is basically win fights even more ridiculously easily than before. There were a few acrobatic maneuvers added to close combat, but theyre mostly pretty worthless combat is extremely easy and I never even once had to use the new maneuvers to win or escape.The gameplay is still the same formula as the previous Assassins Creed II games you spend the whole game running through a city, climbing buildings and occasionally murdering people. The parkour is pretty smooth, but honestly has begun to wear a bit thin while it is neat being able to climb buildings, in the end it is mostly just following paths through the environment which mostly feel extremely straightforward and without much skill. Because Ezio does so much automatically, theres very little challenge in the platforming aspects of the game, and because Ezio is so good at instantly killing enemies  indeed, he can kill every enemy in the game with a single hit, and oftentimes, kill entire groups in this manner  theres very little challenge in combat. The main challenge of the game is sneaking around stealthily, and a few missions where you arent supposed to kill people, but even all of that is easily done within a couple tries.Consequently, the game as a whole feels extremely lightweight, and there isnt much of a sense of achievement in victory everything feels like it was handed to you on a silver platter, and the lack of challenge makes a lot of the game feel samey. A few underground tombs add some variety to the feel of the game, and a few of them felt pretty good, but in the end they really more or less boil down to running along the path and the game trying to make it look impressive, rather similar to the 3D Sonic games, but without the challenge. The missions can almost all be beaten very quickly, and most of the missions that cannot be beaten extremely quickly are because you have to run back and forth across the city. If you were just running through the main quest line, you could beat the entire game in under 10 hours.The main side quests in the game are just collect all the objects in the environment, and while there are maps to finding the items which you can purchase, actually grabbing all the items is completely unchallenging it is just tedious. Indeed, almost all of the challenges in the game are just tedious timewasters to make the game feel longer than it really is theres only a handful of sidequests, and of them, only two had any real weight to them, and both of them were additional Explore the ancient tomb type challenges, much like the ones in the main questline, except in different environments.As in the previous Assassins Creed game, you can recruit a bunch of sidekick assassins and send them on quests to go murder people to level up, or you can have them stick around and murder people for you while youre going around town, which makes the game even more of a joke. In the end, these sidequests are handled entirely textually and are very dull, just another time management/time waster that the game throws in to make things last longer.GraphicsThe game looks decent enough graphically the graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are serviceable enough and the primary characters are all reasonably distinctive. Alas, your sidekick assassins are entirely interchangeable and not terribly interesting looking, and the city itself, while pretty enough at first, quickly becomes a bland backdrop after running across it for the umpteenth time. The hidden assassin key locations break up the monotony a bit, but for most of the game, you see nothing but a bunch of samey buildings.Final SummaryAssassins Creed Revelations is a cashin on the Assassinss Creed II series of games, and is pretty much entirely worthless the game does nothing to further the metastory of the series, and Ezios story here is pretty bland. The gameplay is just more of the same from the previous games, with more of the same tedious time wasters to pretend like the game is longer than it is. Theres just not a whole lot here to recommend it is yet another ACII game, but despite the slight improvements in gameplay it is worth neither your time nor your money.
