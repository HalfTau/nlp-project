My first experience with an Assassins Creed game came from watching a friend of mine play it on his XBox 360. Hed finished the story so I didnt get what had happened. That was Brotherhood. Needless to say he never let me play it.Steam sale rolls around some years ago, Brotherhood and ACII are discounted so I get them both. ACII was the closest to the first AC and I loved its story. Brotherhood was the game I never got to play myself, and I enjoyed it but the story wasnt as hooking as 2s. I couldnt decide if I wanted to continue it.Im glad I did. Revelations takes the story of ACII, the combat and gameplay of Brotherhood, mixes in the sense that you can only get from a favorite TV show or movie series that this is the end of your favorite characters story, and sets it to cook until welldone. A lot of the reviews I saw for this game only focus on what it was missing so they were lower scored. Im gonna tell you what I got from this game, and you can decide if youll enjoy it.If you enjoyed ACIIs story and Brotherhoods gameplay, youre getting both with this game. Theres not much in terms of new things because it doesnt need those things. Revelations boasts a wonderfully crafted story that at the end will leave you cryingyes, I cried., the music helps with its somber lows and actionpaced highsthe main menus looping music had me fighting tears with the vocals, the gameplay has just enough new mixed with old to keep you glued to the controlleror keyboard, and its cast is at its finest.So any Ezio fans, do yourselves a favor and get this game. If you dont want to play it, look it up on Youtube to discover the end of the Auditore trilogy. But watching wont be the same as playing it.
