This is by far the best game of the series. the fact that you even looked this game up is reason enough to get your wallet out and buy this game. the game is wonderful and i promise you will enjoy it. the amazing mechanics, beautiful graphics and the new and amazing gameplay elements will satisfy any amer from grandma to turbo chad. this game is every true assassins creed fans wet dream. all the reviews that are negative are obvious trolls joking around and anyone who says they geniuenly dislike the game is a straight up lying piece of human garbage. they the type a excuse my french  that thinks legend of zelda and nintendo 64 is the best. what im trying to say is they are a fufufakegamer. they know deep down inside they loved every second of intense and interesting gameplay. 10/10 if this game was on sale i would wait for it to get off sale just so i could pay full price because anything less than full price for this game cant be real because the game is that good.
