I think Revelations was the most underwhelming game of the series in my opinion. Apart from the shift back to an oriental setting Constantinopole which is as excellently designed as always, the game is largely forgettable in terms of substance. There are a few great sequences where you get to play as an aging Altair rather than an aging Ezio but it almost feels as if the developers ran out of story for Ezio before they ran out of game time.Revelations was not great, in my opinion, but still good if by this point youre still with the series. Its more of the same, but mostly in a good way.
