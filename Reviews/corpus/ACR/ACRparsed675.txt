This is it Ezios last chapter, one final adventure on a quest thats been long, full of pain, death, frustration and many epic moments that we will remember forever, Il Mentore deserves at least, a time for himself.It is 1511, some years have passed after the events of AC Brotherhood and Ezio travels to Masyaf, where a castle, which once served as a base of operations for the Assassin Order during the High Middle Ages, is located, guided by some of his fathers letters stating that some wisdom of great value is hidden inside a library, Ezio begins a new adventure. Unfortunately, upon arrival Ezio is attacked by Byzantines, who have taken possession of the old fortress. On his little adventure Ezio learns something regarding the existence of some artifacts that will help him open this old library, the Templars have one of the keys, but 4 others remain hidden, on his journey, he learns about Niccol Polos journal, which will help Ezio to locate the rest of the keys, thus a new voyage takes him to the great city of Constantinople.New historical characters appear on this journey, such as Piri Reis, Manuel Palaeologos and Prince Suleiman, as for new characters that will help Ezio on his adventures, such Yusuf Tazim and Sofia Sartor, the latest being some sort of love interest in the beginning of the game and future wife of our hero. But that is not all, we can also play as Altar once more, by reexperiencing some episodes on his life every time we find a key, this aspect is great, it really takes you back in time to relive part of his story, his life as an Assassin, his family and what drove him to take over a weak and fractured order and revitalizing it and finally becoming a legend.I must say that Assassins Creed has always been solid when it comes to game mechanics, just some small details that do not overshadow the whole experience, on AC Revelations everything feels smoother and fast paced, controls have changed a little, but it is nothing serious, fighting feels more fluid and cohesive, we have multiple swords and small weapons at our disposal, as well as the gun and poison and the crossbow, with a new design. On this instalment, a set of bombs is introduced, bombs with various characteristics that would help us getting rid of enemies or just distracting them to fulfil our missions, but the shining star here is a new tool called hook blade, which will help us to freerun faster throughout the city, as well as to climb buildings and towers in a matter of seconds. Definitely, some minor aspects have changed and some other have been refined, kill streaks are easy to perform and you can kill enemies in seconds with no problems at all.We are also introduced to a new system, which is some sort of tower defense action, at some point on the game, you will have to face attacks on different zones of the city you have liberated, and this means the enemy will attack at random moments, even during missions, and you must act quickly or the place you have captured will be lost, consequently retaking it is part of the job, but if you play your cards well this new mechanic would not be a problem at all.The recruitment has also changed a bit, now every time you recruit a new member some sort of mini mission is triggered or sometimes is just defending citizens who will gladly join your cause, after you have some new members you can send them on various missions to defend or retake different cities, the assassins will now level up faster so once they reach the title of Assassin you can make them leaders of the different dens you have all over the city, by doing this a new mission or activity is triggered.The AC franchise has always delivered beautiful depicted cities and locations, this is not the exception, Constantinople is beautiful, massive and full of details, every building and tower show little elements which highlight the depth of the religion and cultural background of the city. Inscriptions are to be found on historical and important building and towers, some other places show the difference of the neighborhoods, weary and old architecture is present everywhere. Outstanding.On the other hand, the population and trading is massive, multiple stores and NPCs crowd the city with life, and side activities, one small detail is the NPC design, it is notorious that many of them repeated themselves, many characters looked the same, which makes you think that maybe somebody was lazy regarding this aspect, its nothing grave nonetheless.AC Revelations is great when it comes to sound effects, the sound of blades, the fire arms, all of the crowds conversations, everything is masterfully done, the voice acting is as always, superb, nothing bad to say about it, Ezio sounds mature and wise and all other voice actors have done a tremendous job on their roles, everyone is believable, top notch acting.The music has always been important for these games, this is why I have to say that the soundtrack for this game is splendid, it really captures the atmosphere of the city and every secret, from actionoriented music to more ambient sounds, all of it is perfect. At some points it really makes you feel the inevitable is about to come, the end of our journey along with Ezio, but at the same time a new beginning in his life, the music itself truly delivers a great impression.There is always something negative with these games, unfortunately, there are some new ideas that are a little rough around the edges, as mentioned before the tower defense system is really not the best, it feels unfinished and rushed, like out of place, not only due to the fact that is presented briefly but also for the way it decides to show up from time to time, there are points on the game which you are far away and it urges you to defend a certain den, it happens you are on the other side of the map and by the time you struggle to come back and defend it, the place is already lost or sometimes the systems triggers these new tasks while you are in the middle of another mission, of course the main missions are more important, so to speak you dont care much about the dens and continue with the story. I am sure it looks good on paper, but the idea was not implemented in the best way.Another new characteristic that seems like a new add on but tends to be forgettable after a couple of times is the bombs system, yes, it really looks great, all sort of bombs with different applications, but rarely practical, you can collect the ingredients or just buy them but in the end the tedious system is easily replaceable by the poison darts that far better than any kind of bomb, and also more fun and faster, overall, the bombs looked like a new great addition, however it was extremely overshadowed by the simplicity of other tools we can use to kill or distract enemies.AC Revelations is a great game with a fair ending to Ezios adventures, and a memorable travel back in time to relive some of Altars experiences, it is sad, yes, we have seen how Il Mentore was born, turned assassin, we have witnessed how he lost part of his family to treacherous enemies, we have seen how he has become a wiser man, how he has learnt to deal with his past and face the present and how all the suffering, nonetheless, has paid off.I must highlight the love interest for Ezio, his future wife was a great addition to the story, it feels like Sofia is an important part of the whole story, but at the same time she is not more essential than the story itself, it is subtle, yet significant and a likeable character.Assassins Creed Revelations is a must for every fan of the franchise!
