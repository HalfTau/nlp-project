The game itself feels great, the main story is really atmospheric and big, but Istanbul didnt feel as well mine as Rome was.In this case the Assassins are controlling the city and the templars have to fight for it... to do that you have the known leader killing and tower climbing stuff for attacking and for defending you do some towerdefense stuff.For me, I didnt really bother with the whole city stuff, I just recruited some assassins and went on with it.The story went on way more dramatic than I expected, I can only recommend it.Completion time about 12 hours.
