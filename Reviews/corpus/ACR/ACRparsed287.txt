Assassins Creed Revelations is, in my opinion, the best AC game of all time, the gameplay is extremely fun, and most importantly, you get the high jump back while climbing, one of my biggest problems with Brotherhood was that the high jump, something learned in 2, was removed,But was reintroduced into Revelations along with the extraordinary hookblade, another thing, ziplines, I absolutely loved using them, especially the zip line Assassination. When I finished the game I was extremely disappointed that it was over, Ill defenatly be replaying Revelations, as soon as I finish AC 1 and 3!
