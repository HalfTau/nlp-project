Assassins Creed Revelations is the last game that follows Ezio history. After Assassins Creed Brotherhood it was almost impossible to have a better game. Revelations doesnt have as good of a story, but sincerely I loved it. The graphics and gameplay are good. Twice the game glitched out and I had to restart the synchorization and this is very annoying. However, AC Revelations has fewer bugs than AC Brotherhood. Although the story is not as impressive as the AC Brotherhood, I liked the plot. Relive the moments of Altairs life was fantastic. I have not played AC I, so maybe that is why Ive enjoyed this point It was very cute to see Ezio in love. After many battles and missions I found that the moments with Sofia gave another dynamic to the game. I did not find the tombs honestly very difficult. I did not like that the story was passed in Turkey in Ottoman Empire, I think they could have chosen another country like France or Portugal muahahahRevelations was not a game made in a rush, in my opinion. It was an epic end to a fantastic story. I will have many memories of Ezio, the best character that AC ever had. Therefore, I recommend that you buy the game, it is very worth it! 10/10
