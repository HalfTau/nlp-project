Its alright, but taken as a whole, its probably my least favorite Assassins Creed game so far ACIII or portables not included. It suffers from feature creep  bombs seem like a silly improvement that will get little use, and the tower defense minigame is straight up dumb. The freerunning is the same as before, with no real changes. The metastory with Desmond is a nonstarter, fleshing out his backstory a tiny bit but not resolving the cliffhanger of ACBrotherhood at all.Overall recommendation its more of the same from the last games, except not quite as well executed. Give it a whirl if its on sale.
