Great way to end the Eziobased part of the series. The game was quite different from II and Brotherhood in that you go from Italy to Constantinople. It in a way feels like a revamped Assassins Creed I. If you havent played and Assassins Creed games prior to this, I suggest you start with I or II and work your way forward. II, Brotherhood, and Revalations telling the story of Ezio Auditore is phenomenal. I have heard that the game series starts going downhill after this game. I have not played them yet, but it would be pretty hard to beat the past three games in my opinion. Anyway, this is one of the best series in gaming, hands down a must have.
