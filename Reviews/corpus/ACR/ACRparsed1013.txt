Ubisoft clearly has forgotten to develop the gameplay after the succes of ACII. Revelations is exactly the same as Brotherhood, but in a different, far less interesting city. There is not as much to do, the mythology is completely absent, and most of the gameplay is just repeating the one thing over and over again. Revelations is more like ACI than II. The annoying bugs and the gameplay that by now is as rusty as a hundred year old cemetary gate from a bad horror movie, make Revelations into a mediocre game at best.
