Certainly an enjoyable game for fans of the series. It seems that the devs have taken to heart the things that bogged the previous games down a little and changed/removed them.Bombs are just a touch overpowered, but they do certainly help to fill a void in gameplay  although it feels like Ezio is turning into Batman with all his gadgets now.But yeah... good game, check it out.
