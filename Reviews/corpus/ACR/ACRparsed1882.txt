Ive only just started to play Revelations, I must say it has been good for the most part. There are a few things that urk me though, for one the character models for Desmond, Ezio and Altair Clay somewhat included. I loved the way the characters looked in Brotherhood, but now Desmond looks like Adam Sandler, Ezios head is more of a Gorilla shape/void of emotion, and the first thing I noticed about Altair is that his nose is bigger than his whole face. Speaking of Altair, the voice actor they used to replace him while I understand the change of accent seeing how he is in that type of area, I dont like the fact that Altairs voice is deeper. Another thing that sort of bothers me is the aspect that your Templar meter goes up everytime you renovate a location, I understand why they put this in considering youre building up in an area where they would be looking for brotherhood activity, but they could have at least implimented more than just bribing Heralds and killing witness.
