Not quite as good as Brotherhood, which I consider the AC masterpiece so far, but still very enjoyable. The bomb mechanic and shoehorned tower defense game are very unwelcome additions to the formula, but it advances the pseudo story and its great to hang out with Ezio once more. Dont spend too much money on the DLC.44hrs.technical glitch. I had some major stuttering with this game until I used a frame limiter to limit the frames to exactly 60fps.
