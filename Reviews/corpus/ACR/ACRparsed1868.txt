Despite enjoying the franchise up to now especially 2 and Brotherhood, I came into ACR with low expectations due to a lot the media claiming it was probably the worst in the series so far. That might actually be true, but this is still a good Assassins Creed game that should satisfy fans of the series. Just dont go into it thinking its going to be the high mark of the series, because its not. It also doesnt really live up to its name, as the story is still every bit as convoluted as it was before this entry.That said, if youve enjoyed all the AC offerings up to this point, youll likely enjoy this one as well.
