I cant recommend this game. The story is good and all, but the combat makes it next to impossible to to anything significant outside of the main story. Not all the fighting was bad, but the inability to dodge or counter the attacks of certain enemies, combined with not being able to run or climb during combat making it next to impossible to escape, ruined it.The control sceme was shifty. Some of the actions the game says you can do with certain keys are not possible. Furthermore, the jumping and climbing as weird. Sometimes when you are trying to climb up a wall, you will just jump backwards. And when trying to jump off roofs, Ezio will stumble at the edge several times before you actually jump. This makes getting down to the ground in a hurry pretty much undoableYou would probably enjoy this game if the freerome and free combat meaning you can pick a reasonable fight with most guards and the combatoriented side activities of the other titles in the franchise were not something you found yourself enjoying, unlike me.
