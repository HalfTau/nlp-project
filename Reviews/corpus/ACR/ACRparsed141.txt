Assassins Creed. One of the most interesting series of games I have ever seen in my entire life, and probably ever will. Revelations is probably my favorite out of The Ezio Trilogy, as its story and conclusion are beautifully well done. By the time you finish the game, you cant help but think of what will happen next. The hookblade is definetly a welcome improvement to the rather lackluster climbing system that features in all three previous games, but the climbing system still feels like a little bit of a chore. The bomb crafting, while very unique and interesting, feels pretty useless when compared to the arsenal of tools at the old assassins disposal. Do not play these games out of order, start from the beginning. Yeah, Im talking about AC1. Even though AC1 is EXTREMELY mediocre compared to the rest of the series, play it for the story. Play AC2. Play Brotherhood. Then play this. I guarantee that if you really take your time with each and every game and really get all you can out of each while still going in order, the fluidity of the story and the experience feels absolutely amazing. Honestly, the next game couldntve asked for a better base. Revelations and all of its predecessors will still hold a very, VERY special place in my heart, now and for many years to come. The story, the gameplay, everything. These games when played to their maximum potential feel amazingly satisfying. Words cant express how I felt after finishing the first four games.I absolutely, positively ADORE these games. They are all so well done and just... UGH! Again, cant express through words.Just... play all of the games in order and to their maximum potential. You will truly feel like you are a Master Assassin.Where other men blindly follow the truth, rememberNothing is true.Where other men are limited by morality or law, rememberEverything is permitted.We work in the dark, to serve the light.We are Assassins.Laa shaya waqiun moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine.
