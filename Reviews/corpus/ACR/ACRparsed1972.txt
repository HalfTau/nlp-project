Look, if youre buying or thinking of buying Assassins Creed Revelations, you probably loved AC2, and maybe even Brotherhood. Revelations is not those games. The singleplayer is like a cramped, rather poorly planed Venice, that you need a loading screen to see the other half of. The story isnt great, though some of the characters are. But if you liked ACBs multiplayer, this is a musthave. Improvements and refinements, new maps that all seem the same for the first few hours, and kind of are and just a better experience in general. THEY TOOK THE ING DOCTOR AWAY.
