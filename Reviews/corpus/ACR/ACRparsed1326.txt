Score 10/10Following Assassins Creed formula the game gives that feeling of parkour mixed with awesome combats that empowers yourself with the true meaning of Assassin. There is plenty to be done in the game as side quests and character evolution exploring the city, finding hidden secrets, increasing your assassin reputation, puzzle solving, arsenal collection and a new feature, bombs, just to mention a few.As far as the plot goes, it is an incredible wrapping up for the II episode and, unlike AC Brotherhood, all the action is focused on Ezio Auditore, which I really appreciated.Both graphics and audio are a little bit better than AC Brotherhood, but due to the immensity of the world do not expect to get the best out of the market.Overall, if you enjoyed the previous Assassins Creed II, this is a must. If you did not played the previous games of the franchise or the episode, I would recommend starting by the the first Assassins Creed II or, if youre coming from AC Black Flag or AC III and would like to deepen your knowledge of the word, start with Assassins Creed I, as the storyline will make much more sense.
