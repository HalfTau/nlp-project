Ive written many recommendations for the entire Assassins Creed franchise. Yet here I find myself at a loss for words. This is the one of those series, that just keeps getting better and better. I think I can count the amount of series that can boast that, on one hand. Revelations takes the amazing parts of Assassins Creed and adds a pinch of reality. You dont just run around aimlessly butchering stuff, you need to take up the mantle of being the Mentor for the entire brotherhood, you need to direct attacks, organize defense on a much larger scale than you used to, all while attempting to progress the story and learning your part in the grand scheme of things.
