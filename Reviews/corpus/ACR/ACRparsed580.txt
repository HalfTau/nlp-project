Ubisoft thought that the more mini games and weird ideas are in the game the better, but that is not the case. The bombs are simply stupid and the same can be said about tower defense like subquests, which I ignored all the time. Early 16th century Istanbul is beautiful thought and the game has the same good gameplay as others. Worth playing if you do not have enough Assassin Creed.
