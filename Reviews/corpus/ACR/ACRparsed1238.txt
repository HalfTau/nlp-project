Unless you care about Ezio, skip this game. Like AC Brotherhood, this was Ubisofts quick cashin before AC3.ProsSame old ACCombat is brutal and thoroughly enjoyableBomb craftingMultiplayer is always fun!Brings some sort of closure on Ezios and Altairs storyBeautiful and gorgeous city of GalataPlenty of collectables to keep you playing for a few more hoursConsSame old ACThe story....the ending sets up the story for AC3 but its ridiculous.Ezios story comes to an abrupt end and doesnt really feel like they finished anything unlike Atairs story where you find how he ended up.The same bugs that have been plaguing the series are STILL here! Ezio will jump to his death or enemies will spawn right in front of you for cheap deaths.Combat feels repetitive with no real depth. The kills arent all that different for each weapon either.The best part of the game is when you go to find the Masyaf keys in the crypts BUT there are only 5. Thats way too few compared to AC Brotherhood.Desmonds Journey side missions are so boring. Its a nice puzzle mission but it is way too simple.My overall opinion While this is a decent addition to the franchise, this game was an obvious attempt to milk money out of loyal fans. You can go into AC3 skipping both Brotherhood and Revelations as both arent important to the story. If you wanted more AC and want to try this out then go ahead. Just dont expect the next best thing. I give this game 7 Masyaf Keys out of 10.
