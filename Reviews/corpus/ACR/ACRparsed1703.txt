Revelations is the Fourth Installment of the Assassins Creed series.In Revelations, you pick up a bit afterwards where Brotherhood left off.If you havent played Brotherhood, beware of the lines below.Youve been warned.Since Ezio now has no enemies in Rome, and his Brotherhood keeps expanding, he  decided to learn more about the Assassins, and the best way to do it, would be to visit their birthplace, the Assassin Den of Masyaf.This is the last game that was played on the skin of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, in this game, he already has quite some age. It would be impossible for him to live much more afterwards. This game is the one that concludes his story.I have to say, the game was okay to me. Some people may not like it.Its set in Constantinople, wich is one of the largest cities that ever existed.Youve got alot of collectibles to find, and the story itself is great.You also have Multiplayer, wich is okay, but too focused on upon.Id say, good purchase, but get it on discount. Not on a full price.
