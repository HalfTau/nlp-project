The shadow war still continues on in the eyes of the public, but happily the series slightly returns to a more graymorality route. Granted, its returns to gray moralities is not by giving the Templar characters more noble causes per say, its more that Ezio does more things that can be contrued as villainous, bad means to an end.The story is better, the characters are better, the combat is just as fluid as Brotherhoods, the parkour is improved with the hook blade, and the game just overall feels good.However, the game is also the most linear Assassins Creed yet, and barring AC1, also features the least amount of side missions. The game does let you feel like a leader through being able to train your Assassin recruits and have them go after specific Templar targets targets you can play as in the multiplayer portion of the game.Desmonds section in the game is a strange, optional, firstperson puzzle game, its strangely fun, but there is no worthwhile freeroam section.90/100
