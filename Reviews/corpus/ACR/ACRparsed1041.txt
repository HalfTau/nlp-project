This game has been out for 4 years.  I have seen the reviews saying how terrible uPlay is. However, I said to myself Surely, after so many years of practice, Ubisoft would have this simple login/database interface working for everyone now... and so I installed the game to get it out of my to play queue.I am fairly used to being wrong. I have a woman in my life and she lets me know that periodically.  However, I expected to be right in this situation.  I was not which begs the question how does uPlay suck so bad.. and for so long.. one of the not so great mysteries of the world.What confounds me is how a company can take a game that would likely run with no issue in single player mode and insert what would appear to be a simple interface to login and validate your ownership of the game and have that secondary interface cause thousands of players to not be able to actually access the perfectly legitimate, paid for with hardearned cash game.  That is quite the antipiracy system.  Makes me sad inside..0/10 for making me spend my gaming time today attempting to debug uPlay instead of actually playing a single player game.. and then having to write this silly review griping about uPlay which truly has nothing to with the game itself.The masochist in me is going to insist I try to install this on my desktop machine instead of this gaming laptop.If I do get it to work there.. perhaps I will actually rate the game instead of this POS uPlay...Those considering purchasing Ubisoft games beware.
