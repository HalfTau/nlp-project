Amazing game, and my 3rd best AC game. I put waaay more hours into the xbox version so thought id drop a little review.Textures look great, combat is nice and swift Unless Unity, Ew. and Parkour is improved with the hookblade and parachutes!But this is a catch.... Thanks to booby soft you have to download their crappy Uplay to get it working, which unfortunately crashed many many times for me, told me my account information was wrong making me change my password countless times, and then they said my product key was wrong, wouldnt accept DLC keys either... It took my 2 day to get it to work, it was worth it in the end but just be warned.
