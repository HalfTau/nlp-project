Assassins creed revelations is an open word action game which is extremely popular for the parkour and its story.Ezios trilogy is my favourite of the series and i think that its worth for everyone to play it.Dont mind the graphics they are extremely good for the game.Revelations itself is very good and i absolutely recommend it.It took me 17hours and i only focused at story,so if you play it for first time,you ll probably spend around 2530hours so its worth the priceat sale 100.The main story is awesome it continues the 3rth part of ezios trilogy and its not dull.The sound is not disapointing and i really like the original songs from the older ac games.Things you can doyou can parkour in the whole city,do different type of side missions,create a crew of assassins,craft weapons/etc,help civilians,and much more things you can do.I truly believe that its worth to try assassins creed revelations and i strongly recommend it
