I had, but I did not see it.I had, but I did not know it.andI had, but I did not feel it...Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three.. and now, the twilight of my life, this understanding has passed into containment.,and Once so disposable, are the fuels that drive me forward.. and love, most especially, mio caro dear. For you, our children, our brothers and sisters. And for the vast and wonderful world that gave us life, and keeps us guessing. Endless affection, mio Sophia. Forever yours...
