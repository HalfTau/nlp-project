Another great AC title, gameplay stays basically the same from the previous two titles. It started kind of slow storywise but it surely picked up halfway through the game. Devs added a tower defense mini mode within the game, its mostly optional quests though. Story is basically about revelations, and gotta say the ending was very revealing. Think a combination of films Wanted Assassins and Knowing The revelation within the game. Very intense.
