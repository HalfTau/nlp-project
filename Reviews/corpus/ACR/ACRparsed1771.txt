The end of Ezios stabandjump adventures.While still a very polished game, its definitely the weakest of the AC2 series. The base game itself is fine, but bomb crafting is annoying, horse carriage driving is utterly stupid and the Tower Defense game is really bad except for the tutorial mission, you can avoid playing it.The good parts are a fun assassin meta game, almost no current world scenes and a beautiful city to run around in.Only play this if you cant get enough of Aassassins Creed and Ezio after finishing AC2 and Brotherhood.
