A good conclusion to the Ezio story arc of Assassins Creed. As refined as Brotherhood but lacking in content. Not as many side quests to do. The general story line is shorter than that of the previous 2. Having said that, it still does give you a good insight into Altair as well as Ezio. And good to see he finally hooks up with a chick, after having missed so many opportunities in the other games pStill a good game and especially worth it if youve played the previous two and want to see it to the end. If you havent played the previous two then highly recommend playing them first.
