When I read reviews prior to playing this, a good amount of them said that this game got right what Brotherhood got wrong. It actually just gets them more wrong. I play games to have fun, not to be told how much of a failure I am.You play as a senile old fart who miraculously pulls off a lot of things that even Desmond/the Animus has difficulty recreating, not great for gameplay when the directional controls are just as dodgy as the last game.I did get this game for its story and how that ties back into the central plot, but I cant say theres much else that makes this game worthwhile.
