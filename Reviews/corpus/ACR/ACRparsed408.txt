For some reason, this game has gotten alot offrom alot of users. I have played the first 5 games in the AC series and this one is right up there.I love the fact that is focuses on ONE CITY, which was one of the things I did not like about other AC games. The fact that there is also a big focus on the Assasins vs. Templar is a big bonus for me. Lots of players prefer games in the series with bigger focus on other aspects but for me the story of assasins vs templars is the reason I fell in love with the series to begin with.There are many inprovements to the AC brotherhood firstly the fighting sequences and climbing are alot smoother and the fact that they added Meditterrean Defense is something I really liked as well. The characters are very likeable and the way they tie the story of Altair Ezio and Desmond is F awesome imo.If you are a fan of a great story, awesome setting and crazy good characters I would say go for it! You wont regret it.
