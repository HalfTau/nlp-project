To be fair, Ive played alot of Assassin Creed games and I can feel that I do not follow the mainstream opinions on games. For starters I loved AC3 even though everyone says it was a disapointment, I really enjoyed it. Now getting back on topic, Assassin creed Revelations will forever hold a dear place in my heart and will forever be in my top 5 games in all time. It has great music but the music was not as amazing as in other games. The game play is really similar to the previous game but the hookblade is added and is a amazing feature that is unique only to this game. The storyline has to be one of the best Assassin Creed storylines I played. The map is kinda cramped but ehh what can you do am I right, you do with what you are given. The reason people get this game and why this game is ranked so high is not because of the hookblade or the new map or the same old mechanics, it is ranked so high because of its storyline. Its the final game of the Ezio trilogy and it provides the essential closure that every gamer craves and needs to basically needs to not die emotionally. If you are a highly commited fan, and have played the previous games before this game, this game is a must have for every single fan. You can get away with not having a game like Assassin Creed Liberations, but if you do not have Assassin Creed revelations it is like reading a book and not reading the conclusion, the ending. Also really good graphics.Fighting 7/10Missions 8/10weapons/amor unlockables 2/10city 6/10Storyline 10/10!!!!!!!!!Thank you for reading and I hope you guys find the same satisfaction I found in this game, have a wonderful day!
