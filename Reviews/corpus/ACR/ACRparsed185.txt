Its more of Brotherhood, which is the games biggest strength and biggest weakness.  If you play Revelations directly after Brotherhood youre going to get burned out, and if you allow some time before going from Brotherhood to Revelations its going to feel like the game hasnt gone anywhere because it hasnt.But Brotherhood was excellent, and Revelations continues to get right everything that game got right too, other than the addition of an aggravating base defense minigame that can happily mostly be ignored after being introduced.  Its more of Ezio, and Ezio is as charming as ever, and it does include some delightful jokes at his expense as the once dashing, handsome young noble finds himself being respectfully refered to as a dignified old man.The modern day storyline remains the same too, meaning if you enjoy it unlikely youll enjoy it here, and if you find it an exercise in frustration that drags you out of the actual fun of the game, youre going to feel the same way.  But if you liked Brotherhood, youll like this game too... just dont expect anything different.
