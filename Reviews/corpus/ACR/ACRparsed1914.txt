This Assassins Creed was amazing! I totally loved Revelations and how it brought you back and forth from the past and present in the game. It was a really indepth game. The world to explore is massive and there is so much detail in everything. The costumes of the characters were magnificent in color and style. The gameplay was fluid and extremely hard to put down. There is alot of extra stuff to complete which makes the game alot more fun then just playing the game straight through. If you do play the game straight through you will be surprised on how short it can be. There are only 9 sequences to complete. I would suggest playing the previous Creeds in this series before playing this one. The fighting is awesome and you can combine moves and kills with each swing of the sword. The online aspect is dead. The minor bugs in the game are quickly overlooked due to the great story and style this game has. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of series.
