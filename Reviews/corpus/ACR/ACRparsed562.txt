Great game, great plot, great graphics for a 2011 game. sucks you right in if you have never played AC before. Probably one of the best AC games made, love the open world and the way the you can interact with the NPC characters. Most of all Ezio Auditore. He has the best storyline i think that ive ever seen in AC. Shame that he only has two games thats hes in, and that all the other AC are mostly different Assassins. A must buy game, worth it.
