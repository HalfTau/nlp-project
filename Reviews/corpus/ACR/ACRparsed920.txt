Dear Ubisoft,I bought this game because of another Assassinss Creed game I played. I was sadly disappointed. The controls are not intuitive at all, space and right click to run? I spent more time watching than playing between loading and parts of the game that were happening whether I was participating or not. I removed this game after only a couple of hours. I will try another low cost assassins creed to see if I can find a better one.
