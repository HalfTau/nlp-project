The next entry in the Assassins Creed franchise after Assassins Creed Brotherhood is okay. The story present and past follows after the one of Assassins Creed Brotherhood. Its the finale to the Ezio trilogy and offers some good elements. The main city of Istanbul is very good, it is fun parcour around. The story is somewhat interesting, its not the seriess best by far. However, the story would be the only fresh thing in this game, as everything is like previously.The combat is the same since the first game Assassins Creed, with some minor changes making the game easier. The stealth is the same as Assassins Creed II. The visual/graphics really is the same as AC II/B. It doesnt have much content compared to the previous games, and is priced at the same price as the others.If you like the Assassins Creed franchise, then I recomend this game. If youre just curious about the series and want to get into it, I would recomend either Assassins Creed II or IV.
