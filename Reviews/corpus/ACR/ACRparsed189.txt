Now this is the game wich ALL fans always wanted. Ezio finally is a Master Assassin, full of wisdom. And realizes that his final mission is to complete Altairs fate and decipher the misterys of his anteccessor and so he goes after all the keys wich will show him Altairs life, that werent told before. The game shows us a Ezio determinated to find answers to questions wich havent even been asked. This is a like tha Logan 2017 movie, like Old Ezio. The game finally ends with the most beatuful scene of the encounter between Master and student, Altairs corpse and Ezio. Its amazing, and for me, this is the last Assassins Creed game. On my later reviews youll know why.The only bad thing here, is that they kept the killing spree ability, that again, made the whole game super easy.On the other hand, they added a crafting system for bombs, which was fantastic.
