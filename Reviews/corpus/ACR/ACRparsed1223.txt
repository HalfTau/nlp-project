Discovering the life of our mentore, Altair  Ezio is getting through everything, that stands in his way. One of the best Assassins Creed titles our there. If you get into the story, you will feel really well. After first playthrough, when finding Altair in his library, I felt chill going down my spine. It felt great, the story, graphics, controls, animations, everything. If you like storybased games or just like the idea of Assassins Order, at least give this game a try. It really deserves your attention. Vittoria agli Assassini!
