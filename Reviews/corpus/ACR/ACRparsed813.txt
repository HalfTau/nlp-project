Even though this is the most irrelevant Assassins Creed entirely main title wise, the gameplay is still fun as the previous titles. The Tower Defense is my favorite part. As one of the biggest fans of Assassins Creed and one of the most indepth about its lore, and being an exModerator on the AC wiki, I only recommend this game to someone who plays AC for the fun of it, even though its fetch quest simulator in a nutshell. The story is pretty bland, and the only thing we really find out is Ezios future. Thats it.You can literally play all the games except this one and not miss a thing except Desmond waking from his coma.
