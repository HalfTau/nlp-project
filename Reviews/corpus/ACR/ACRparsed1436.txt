Basically the same game as AC Brotherhood, except its set in Istanbul instead of Rome. Storywise it ties the protagonists from AC I and AC II together, and is a nice sendoff to both.Controls are again slightly better, but the new weapons mostly many types of grenades are not very compelling.Some new minigames are added a sort of tower defense for when assassin strongholds are detected by templars, and oddly a firstperson platformer for the Desmond sequences. The latter has a very cool, distinctive look and gives a lot of background on Desmond, but the gameplay is so far removed from what you expect from AC that I would have prefered that it had been a separate game. I think you can ignore it completely though.All in all a bit disjointed, but still very enjoyable.
