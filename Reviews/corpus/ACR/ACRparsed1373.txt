I personally am a very big fan of the assasins creed series and when i bought this game i was hoping it would be an epic ending to the story of our favorite italian assasin Ezio, however I was a bit dissapointed with the game. Being in the same city for so long which correct me if im wrong was called Constantinopole, was really a bore for me personally and i really thing they just dragged that part of the game out. It seemed that all the same colors really just ran into eachother creating a big blob of desert color. The actual gameplay reallyme off because you could be just climbing a building and then boom, Ezio just jumps off and you die and start for the last check point, this was a real downer for me. To generalize the gameplay was really rugged and i didnt feel like an assasin, i fealt more like an elephant that kept randomly jumping off buildings and tripping over my feet. All in all I still finished the game because really wanted to get the story and not just go to the next game and just be likeand I am not really the type of person to just look it up on the internet. But unless you are like me and want to experience the story I recomend to just look it up. If you read this I thank you for your time, any feed back or pointers would be great thanks.
