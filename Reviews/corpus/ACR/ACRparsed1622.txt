Its Assassins Creed. With Ottomans. Pretty fun. If you dont know what an AC game is by this point, then I recommend you start with AC2 and if the formula hasnt gotten old by the time you finish Broterhood, you can pick this one up too for more cool AC action. Constantinople and the Ottoman Empire are a pretty fascinating setting for it and all the Islamic architecture is cool as hell after two games of Italian renaissance stuff.
