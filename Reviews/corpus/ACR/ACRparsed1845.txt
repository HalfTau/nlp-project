Straight to the point. 7.5/10. Its Assassins Creed, if you liked the others, youll probably like this one. Which is both great and whats bad about this series. The game hasnt really changed the forumla much at all throughout the games, it just feels lazy to me. The game is still fun, its basically just the same thing as Call of Duty at a lesser extent at this point. I dont really know what else to say about it. Its worth it if youre a fan of the genre/series, but in my opinion its somewhat boring if youve been playing every single AC game since. Only major complaints are the PC controls are really odd at first, and the graphics are fairly ugly.
