All the good and bad parts of the rest of the series made it into ACR. Campy story, glitchy cutscenes, selfindulgent grandeur... its all here along with the classic stealth and freerunning action. Some big plot arcs finally get wrapped up, but for the most part the plot seems to crawl, and the game ends on yet another cliffhanger. The new bomb system is actually well implemented and surprisingly useful, but otherwise combat is pretty much the same. Points deducted for Ubisofts terrible proprietary Uplay launcher, and the mindnumbingly awful Desmond sidequests.  B
