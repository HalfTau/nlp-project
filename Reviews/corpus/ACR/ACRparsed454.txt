More AC....yay!  The problem is that its just that....more AC.  I love the franchise.  I love parkouring  my way up buildings that should be unscalable...I love droppimg down on enemies and cutting their throats...I love everything about the franchise...EXCEPT the hard fact that it hasnt progressed at all from the initial jump from AC1 to AC2.  Now, Im a firm believer in the notion that if it aint broke, dont fix it.  Assassins Creed has always been about climbing, jumping, leaping over obstacles that no mortal man could handle, and thats why I keep playing.  And I will keep on playing thru AC3 and all subsequent releases.  BUT the devs have GOT to add something else to the mix to keep it interesting.Bottom line...if you liked AC2, and Brotherhood, youll enjoy this release.  I liked it simply because its more of the same AC that I love.  But dont expect anything revolutionary here...its what you crave, but nothing more.
