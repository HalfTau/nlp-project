A very good game from a very good story line. I have been a fan of AC for a long time. I even liked the 1st game to much of everyones surprise. But this is a must play to see what has happened after brotherhood. The mechanics are similar, but you can do tower defense too but I didnt do more than one. I kept my meter to secret. Overal a good game, great characters, a twist at the end, and 30 hours of gameplay. Go and buy it before AC3 comes out.
