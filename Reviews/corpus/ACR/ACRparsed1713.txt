Single player story sucks...Lorewise doesnt really make any sense as you team up with opressors against the rebels! Huh? Whats wrong with Ubi?Too much praise to Ottomans as if they were  the best civilizations of all time...Yeah you read right! Suleiman is depicted as a good bloke too...yeah right P... I recommend it only for multiplayer which is fun...So 4/10
