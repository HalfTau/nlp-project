For me this is the worst of assassins creed that I have play. Map Is small than Roma . Story in my view I dont like Ottman Empire if I can choose I want to go help templar like a rogue ok that is all a joke. why this suck for me more than reason of map is the story is too shot why ubisoft didnt get brotherhood for the long story and cut this part of for making more story about altair.
