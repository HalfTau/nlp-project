Desmond Miles is your typical eighteen year old guy. He works at a bar selling cocktails named after secret societies and carries a blade under each arm. To afford such a lifestyle, he agrees quickly to the ToS of some bigname company and ends up captive in their massive crossshaped facility and informed that Christianity is not only a lie, muslims are going to kill everyone for their own good. To cover for this fault in logic, Desmond is then informed that nothing is true, everything is permitted, and then is flipped off and winked at by the nurse, who Desmond then kills. No answers are given for this course of events, and the creature Q from Star Trek is encountered next inside a miniture Tron island, where youre told to purchase the DLC. Meanwhile, theres a minigame involving Desmonds crazy uncle who runs across rooftops and stabs people while throwing money at courtesans which explains why hes everyones great uncle.
