See my previous Assassins Creed reccomendations. Combat is boring less bosses targets than previous iterations, bosses are no different than normal soldiers, many pointless sidequests, more options but no real reason to use one over another. Less interesting dungeon zones in this one, some minor perks to doing challenges, but really this game is no different than any of the previous games, mechanics wise. Climbing is less frustrating but thats just polish of the mechanic present in the last three games.The story was never all that amazing in these games, and this one reveals essentially nothing towards the overall arching story in the name of making more sequels. Overall, pretty much nothing interesting happened here and everything was forgettable. Considering its supposed to be the end of Ezios story, they couldve done better  Again, welcome to sequels.Multiplayer is enjoyable with some caveats, but it will probably die now that AC3 has been released. Cest la vie.
