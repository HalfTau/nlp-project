Well its assassins creed nothing really more to say.  If you have the money Id really say just skip this game although if your like me and can just play these games for hours on end for no apparent reason might as well pick it up.  Story line is good and is the end to the Ezio Alditori line, the 2 major features of this game are, taking place in istanbul not constantinople, and ezios new tool the hook blade.  Both are very fun but the hook blade is more or less a gimmick, and The map had buildings so close together there sadly wasnt able to put horses in.TLDR  Really just for fans of the series.  6.5/10
