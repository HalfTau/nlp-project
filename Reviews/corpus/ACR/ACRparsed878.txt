Aside from having to launch UPlay to play this game that I bought from Steam, the game is actually pretty solid. Its actually the best optimized AC game for the PC that Ive played. Which is sad because the last 2 AC games Black Flag and Unity are the worst optimized games for the PC. Revelations runs buttery smooth and its visually appealing. The gameplay is smooth as well. Its just too bad Black Flag the best game of all them in my opinion cant run as smoothly as this game even with an i7 4790K and a GTX 980 Ti  Black Flag and Unity run quite choppy  its just a sign of poor optimization for PC gamers. If you can get Revelations on sale, get it. Its worth it!
