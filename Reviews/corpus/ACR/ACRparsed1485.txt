Has some cool things over Brotherhood like keeping the Desmondto a minimum, the hookblade, expanding on Altair, bringing a nice end to Ezios story, and assassin missions but it has some really annoying story missions with forced stealth and the bank income resetting every time you play a mission is just dumb. Overall though its still a solid entry in the series and worth picking up.
