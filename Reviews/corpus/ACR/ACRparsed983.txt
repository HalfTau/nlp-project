This is the best AC game ever.  It has the fastest parkour hookblade and ziplines make it super convenient, its located in the best city ever yes, Istanbul is the best city ever and bombs.  Bombs are the bomb.  Also the story doesnt cut away to any lame real life crap, and the lame animus minigame is completely optional.  Ive beaten it twice on Xbox, going for a third on PC, so dont judge my hours.Also, the collections are books now instead of paintings, which actually are pretty dope because if youre into history this game recommends some pretty dope books.
