This was my first game in the AC series.Its fun, although I never finished it because I bought AC3 and that was so much better.Still had fun with this game, the combat is more detailed and challenging, it just feelt small, after I picked up AC3.I may still go back to it, after I finish Black Flag.. if I dont pick up Rogue or Unity right after...
