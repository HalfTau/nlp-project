Doing an AC marathon started at one, am currently on 3. This game was such a great game and i strongly recommend it to anyone that has played the 1st 1, 2 and BH. You can see how Ezio matured over the years and i trully enjoyed the 50 year old version of him. Ending was very good and a worthy ending to Ezios and Altairs story.
