Okay, its not AC II, its not Brotherhood, but its still a good game to play. The final game to feature Ezio Auditore as the main ancestor whose memories are explored might not be quite as good as its predecessors, but the journey to the Eastern side of the Mediterranian offers a wonderful experience never the less. Beware of a few plotholes and contradictions though, as well as a few bugs scattered throughout.The economy system is present once more, allowing you to revitalize Constantinople by opening shops, buying monuments and installing assassin dens throughout. The by the end of the game huge amounts of income this generates allow you to purchase a variety of nifty items and of course more of the above. New gameplay elements including the hookblade and craftable bombs allow the player to have more fun in the cities.Sadly enough there are also a lot of downsides to the game, the world is smaller, with most of the action taking place in Contantinople. There are also fewer things to do with the factions, theyre basically tools to use rather than that they feel... thought out, vibrant or whatever. The assassin den missions are fun, but repetitive, with little variation between them.Still, while not a dazzling gem, this game is still fun to play. Especially if you played the previous two installments and want to see what happened to Ezio.
