End of an era. Assassins Creed Revelations is probably one of the games in the Assassins Creed series i did not like the most. But this do not mean that i didnt like the game. Set in 1511 in Constantinople, this game follows the last story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, as he tries to find answers about Altair iben LaAhad, earlier master of the assassin order. The game had a pretty storyline, wich turned out to be Ezios last. The characters, music and setting really gave the city of Constantinople an uniqe touch and feeling, the same sloppy multiplayer retuned with not so many changes, something that were a bit disapointing. All in all it was a great game, and you have to play it if you want to play trough the Assassins Creed series, but dont expect this one to be the best of the franchise. 8.0/10 MaxzpyroP
