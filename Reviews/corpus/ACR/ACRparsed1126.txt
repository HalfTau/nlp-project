If you enjoyed all the AC games, its likely that you will enjoy this as well. But if you enjoyed only some of them, maybe you will not enjoy this game.AC Revelations takes some elements of AC Brotherhood, remove some of them like the horse, or Da Vincis War Machines and add some new elements tower defense minigame, creating bombs with different properties and a hook.I miss some of the removed elements, the new elements didnt translate very well into gameplay and overall, I felt this game very boring and repetitive, its one of the few games that mades me yawn the first AC also accomplished that.I think the reason its because all the game has the same aesthetic and its on the same city. Brotherhood was a great game and it was mostly in a single city, but in brotherhood had the Brutos Lairs that had very different aesthetics and gameplay, same with Da Vincis War Machines, and many missions of the main plot, and also, some parts of Rome felts very different.
