Assassins Creed Revelations is the third and final entry in Ezios trilogy, attempting to give a closure to both his and Altairs journey, all of this while pushing Desmonds story forward. A hefty promise, but the real question is, will it succeed?Its no easy task to juggle three main characters at once, but Ubisoft has done a remarkable, if incomplete, job. Theres no denying that Ezio and Altairs portions are handled extremely well, providing insight into both of the characters final days as the emblematic assassins they are, and getting to know what happened after the credits rolled in the first game of the series is an absolute delight, but the same sadly cant be said for Desmonds sections. Although its evident that the developers tried to take a different aproach to the familiar gameplay by giving it a first person treatment, the final product comes out as uninspiring and dull.  Nevertheless, the overall storyline more than makes up for it, and rounds up these characters on a high note.Fortunately, Ubisoft made absolutely no mistakes with regards to the audiovisual style, maintaining the excellent values proposed by both ACII and Brotherhood, and manages to set the bar even higher with sharper details and fantastic voice acting. The beautiful city of Constantinople takes center stage, a breath of fresh air just when Italy was beginning to feel a little stale at the end of the previous entry in the series, and cements the franchises reputation as one of the most stunning ones around.The gameplay aspect remains almost untouched compared to Ezios other adventures, but giving that it was superb in most of its aspects, that doesnt really count as a negative, although a little more innovation wouldnt harm, either. Notable additions to the formula include the trusty hookblade, which allows you to extend your reach and prevents you from falling to your death a regular in the series, an improved use of bombs which range from lethal to tactical and sneaky, and the ability to defend your captured dens via a towerdefenselike minigame which feels like un unnecesary step in the wrong direction, even though it can be fun the first few times.The multiplayer portion first introduced in Brotherhood makes a return, and even though it sports a few new flashy additions, doesnt provide enough content to keep you away from more complete online experiences for long. Its a nice complement to the main adventure for sure, but one which, if given a little more polish, would have been up there with the genre giants.Overall, the game is a considerable leap from the previous title, which felt rather disappointing and safe, and does enough things right to distance itself from it and stand high among the franchises best offerings, surpassed only by the magnificent Assassins Creed II.  It can only get better from here...Pros Beautiful open world crammed with things to do Breathtaking visual and audio design Engaging plot which overarchs two of the most loveable characters in gaming and brings them together like never before Long, varied campaign which tosses you in a variety of engaging scenariosCons Uninspired Desmond sections Engaging, yet shortlived multiplayer component Feels  somehow similar to previous entries No more Ezio and Altair Conclusion A fascinating adventure which closes the lid on one of the most gripping stories of modern gaming, Assassins Creed Revelations grabs hold of you and doesnt let go until you have seen everything it has to offer, and believe me, that is going to take some time, my friend.Grade 9.1 Amazing
