I liked it a lot. Dont understand why this game got so much hate  to me it was just as good as Brotherhood, if not better. Storyline is exciting, location is alright, graphics are great. Multiplayer needs more players but is a lot of fun. Only issue is optimization  at one point I had to disable 3 CPU threads to get past a checkpoint game crashed otherwise
