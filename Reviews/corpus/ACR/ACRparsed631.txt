If you think the older AC games were better, youll probably think this one has the most solid gameplay out of them. It takes everything from AC 1, 2, and Brotherhood and tries to focus on the good stuff while eliminating some of the more tedious elements. It also introduces a nifty secondary blade for the speediest parkouring yet and a crafting system for bombs that a lot of people overlook but it is nice to see developers still trying to create novel experiences. The story is also decent and it ties up the Altair and Ezio stories in a satisfying way while leaving a cool hook into AC 3.On top of that, theres an few optional first person platforming levels tossed in that give some of Desmonds backstory in a totally new way. And if you like that, theres a dlc that adds more of it that tells the backstory of subject 16 wihch I thought was pretty cool.And continuing from AC Brotherhood, theres even a multiplayer mode that seems pretty similar and is more fleshed out. Sadly, I think its even emptier than ACBs multiplayer and youll probably get rekt by Prestige level 12 players while trying to start out and learn everything.
