Cant say I really cared for this game, you could not pay me any less than 1,000 to play it againI am a college student, so my dignity is lower than usual. I was dragging my feet through the entire game, but I spent money on it so I made myself finish it. Dont bother with this one, but you should read up on the story line online. It does have a somewhat interesting story line, but the game is not worth the time and money.The one thing I did like that this game added was the hook, so you can jump farther and hook onto ziplines.
