In this game you play Desmond who continues to play out the role of an aging Assassin who is still trying to meet girls, outsource killing, expand his wealth and commercial intersts. Inevitably neither the Assassin or Desmond get the girl in the end which I believe is the revelation or maybe I missed the point.
