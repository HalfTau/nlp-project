ACR is a great game that finishes the story of both Altair and Ezio. Ezio is going to Constantinople and as he progress the story  SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! he relives some moments from Altairs live which made us understand the 1st game story. Also the ACR has a great story from its own. The only thing I dont like is that the gameplay is kinda similar to the ACBR, you rebuild the city and capture templar dens expect from Borgias towers. A great game 9.6/10
