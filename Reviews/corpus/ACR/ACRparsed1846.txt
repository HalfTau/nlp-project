For me this game falls in between Brotherhood and II, leaning more closely to II.  Knocks against it theyve changed the controls ever so slighttly between this one and the last two games just enough that youll die a couple of times in the heat of the moment because you fell back into old habits.  The writing is poor the first assassination made me wonder if the writeres even understood Ezios character.  New character models for Desmond and Ezio cant reaally figure out why Ubi decided to do this for the last game in the series, but by they time you start to get used to it, the game is over.  The minigames suck I dont care about a crappy tower defense, or a bombmaking game.Things it does right parkour, and killing.  Luckily, those two things are enough to make it worth it.
