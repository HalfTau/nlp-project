Good game, about 20 hrs worth of content. I was very pleased with how it tied and in my opinion how it closed off the intertwining histories of Ezio and Altair. No matter how bizzare the main story line with Desmond is getting, the gameplay of AC and story telling is still rich. However, this forced Ubisoft Uplay running alongside the story mode is annoying and buggy. 9/10 due to occasional random crash with DRM.
