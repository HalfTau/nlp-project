This game WOULD be incredible had it not stopped working on the 2nd mission. Now every time I try to play on story mode, a window pops up that says ACRP has stopped working, and there is no apparent solution. Graphics, content and gameplay are incredible for when it was made and would be a must buy if not for the issue. 5/10
