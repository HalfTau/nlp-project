Assassins Creed Revelations is a step up from the previous Assassins Creed games.It includes new climbing and freerunning movements and new equipment such as the hook blade and parachutes.The game is well written and is a perfect and climatic end to Ezios story.The customization aspect of the game is still in the opening stages compared to the more recent AC games but grasps the concepts that you want in customization with upgrades as well as visual improvments such as different colour sets to choose from.Alongside Ezios journey there is also the continuation of Desmonds with added and explained lore and more truths about the Animus, Templars and Assassins, as there has been with the previous AC games.
