I actually liked the game, but there are nearly no so lovely designed sidemissions from the previous games or show me them, I couldnt found them the story was cool, but a bit too short  and I had nearly no rememerable moments, I had from brotherhood Nothing, Id like to repeat after completing the story the world was too empty and I had nothing to do anymore Upgrades are kinda irrelevant despite armor Fight system is less OP, the fights are longer, but it feels a bit more boring bombs are useless. Ive used them like in some story missions, where it was nessecary, but not really more.All the good sides are mentioned in other reviews, I dont want to repeat them.In my opinion ACR was a dissappointment after ACBrotherhood it was shorter, shorter and shorter. The charakters werent so good, as in brotherhood, the story wasnt so interesting. Yet, as a little film to get the Eziotriologie to the end it was great, but it was far away from being so ubergood, brotherhood was.If youre an AC fan, who have played AC 2 and AC Brotherhood, I highly recommend it. As a little film to end the story atmosphere of old and wise Ezio is great!. But dont expect too much, as I did.
