Revelations takes the Assassins Creed formula and cooks it for too long. Boring and frustrating sidequests get shoved in your way, the crafting system is just useless for most stuff and all the things you find fun in AC2 you wont find fun in Revelations.That being said, the newish setting is entertaining, and some of the stalking stuff is entertaining, as is having a hook.
