This game is a must have if you have played the last two, also if you want to continue onto AC3. But it isnt that good of a game, so dont put youre expectations high. Or average, for that matter. Instead of continuing the awesomeness of Renaissance Italy, and adventuring, killing guards, retrieving medieval artifacts... Nope! Ezios last expedition as an Assassin takes place in... Constanople? WHY? Lame additions to this game include some hook thing that lets you jump an extra 2 inches away, and making bombs. In this game you also get a dumb den defense metagame that makes you feel like youre playing a 1.99 mobile game from the app store instead of an AC game. Basically, Ezio learns how to make bombs in the middle east, and learns how to magically place troops in front of some wooden spikes to defend a building. This game was painful to play. If Ubi wanted to make a cool game with Ottomans and Saracens, by all means they shouldve, but with Ezio? This game is undeserving of Ezio. This game feels like it should be a 6 DLC for the first Assassins Creed game. By far the best part of this game is the cutscenes, and I dont mean this jokingly. This game reveals so much... hence revelations, literally revealing the missing scenarios of Altairs life, including his death not a spoiler, come on. we knew it was coming. We also see Ezio retire in this game. Sorry. But at least its a happy ending, which Ill let you discover.
