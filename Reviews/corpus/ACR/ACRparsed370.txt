This game was simply excellent. The entire trilogy was. Unlike them new Assassins, this had a great story, still innovative mechanics, interesting mini games, awesome characters and most importanly brilliant atmosphere. And the ending left me dumbfounded, staring into the wall, thinking and feeling. As a great story should.
