For those who like repetitive and/or similar game play like those in AC Brotherhood, this is your kind of game.For those who are expecting similar yet provide an entirely unique and new game play a.k.a me this is not for you.To be fair, there are new things such as the variety of the bombs.Other than that, to me at least, the rest are pretty much the same.However, the story line is still good, so that what kept me playing.
