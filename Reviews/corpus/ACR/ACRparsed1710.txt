Not the best of the series to be honest, however makes use of similar mechanics from ACBrotherhood. Quite easy overall but has port problems causing crashes and  wierd glitches.If you do come accross any crashes Occurs on i5/i7 CPUs set the games affinity to just one CPU and play to the end of the memory sequence and then switch back.
