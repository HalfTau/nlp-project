Where to start? This is one of the laziest slap dashes for money Ive seen in my life. If this game were any more similar to the ones before it youd honestly start to think it was a mod someone had made for the game, while it would be good for a mod it is unnaceptable as a full priced game with little change from AC2 and ACB, those new features being the bombs and the real ing good TD mode, wow the hours of fun youll have with avoiding growing your brotherhood only to have it ing wasted by thewho come along and try and take your  new tower.To sum all of that rage up dont waste your money on this game, if youre that into the story google it, youll be saving yourself a lot of pain 2/10. Core mechanics are the same but too little change to warrant a new game. Ubisoft  EA
