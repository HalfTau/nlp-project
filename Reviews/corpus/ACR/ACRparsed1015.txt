Ive played AC1, AC2, ACBrotherhood and AC3 on playstation and quite enjoy all of them. Revelations is the first AC game I got on the PC because it was on sale, and what a let down. The game itself play very similar to other AC titles which I have nothing to complain about but the PC version is buggy as hell. Consider how long this game had been released I cant believe they havent fixed it and it plays like a bad console port. And Uplay is a pain in the Aviod.
