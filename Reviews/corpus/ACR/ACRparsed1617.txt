Buy when its 5.00.AC Revelations didnt reveal much. It featured some flashbacks to Altair, the original assassin, but didnt really explain much about the Templar/Assassin war, their philosophies, or just whats going on in the modern world.It did reveal how depressing Altairs life was. Pretty much his entire family gets killed. He gets disgraced and kicked out of the Assassins Guild, his son gets killed, his wife gets killed when they go to redeem their dead son, then more people get killed. Everybody goes and dies until eventually Altair himself sits down in a chair to rest and dies. But those are just the flashbacks.The actual storyline is not memorable.Gameplay is very similar to previous games. You have the same 4 groups of allies assassins, thieves, warriors, and s. You try to burn enemy outposts and renovate shops in the area. The only difference is the location, which is set in Istanbul/Constantinople.Visually, the game looks nice. Its sharp, crisp, with good character details and animations.Music is beautiful. The main theme is catchy. Voice acting is aboveaverage.Overall, Its a nice game in the style of AC2 and ACBrotherhood, set in a different town, cast in a gloomier tone. By the end of the game, you feel like an old man waiting to die, without really knowing the answers to your lifes questions.Rating 6/10.
