Recently bought it on PC, and I literally spent about 10 minutes just gawking at how graphically beautiful it was, and how smooth it ran Max settings at 1980 x 1080, 60 FPS. I hadnt played it since I had my PS3 I became PCexclusive a couple of months ago, and even then it was visually impressive.  Definitely the most beautiful of the last gen games in my opinion.  I love the the art style of Animus Island, and the dark, purgatorylike feel of the Safe Mode and Black room.Also, great story and fantastic voice acting by Nolan North.
