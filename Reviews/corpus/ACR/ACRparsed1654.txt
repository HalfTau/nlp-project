While being the shortest Assassins Creed title in the Ezio trilogy, it has the strongest writing involving Ezios personal journy to Constantinople/Istanbul while also revealing more about Altair. The main campaign is only about ten to twelve hours, but theres an additional ten hours of content from exploring and rebuilding the city, rebuying landmarks, guarding your Assassin towers as well as training apprentices to masters. The conclusion of Ezios story was satisfying as we also got to see the conclusion of Altairs life. I dont really know what else to add about the gameplay, besides Istanbul being gorgeous.9.1/10
