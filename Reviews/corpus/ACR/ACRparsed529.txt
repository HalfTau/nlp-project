Revealations is a great finale to the Ezio Aldatore trilogy. The setting of Constantenople was well chosen and executed. Being able to make different custom bombs was an unexpected addition to the game and allows for a variety in playstyle which I wasnt anticipating.Everything about this game continues in the good, amazing tradition in every other way that the other 2 games do. A must have for the AC devout.
