Assassins Creed Revelations is a great game. It is not flawless, but the story and the gameplay is really good. Such a great feeling when stabbing a guard or a Templar from behind. I can assure you you will learn a lot about Istanbul and Ottoman period playing this game alone. Revelations was my first experiance with Assassins Creed franchise. I spent 29 entertaining hours on this game and now other Creed games are waiting for me Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
