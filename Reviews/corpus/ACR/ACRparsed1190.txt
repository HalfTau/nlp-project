Revelations ties up the loose ends around Ezio and provides a transition into future settings. Constantinople looks and sounds fantastic and is one of my favorite recreated cities over the landscapes of Italy. While ACII and Brotherhood felt much the same, this game introduced much better sound and updated graphics so it feels and plays better. The den defense game was a fun addition and I wish they had kept that in later games.
