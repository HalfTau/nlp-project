Assassins Creed Revelations continues the story of Etzio, though aged, still has his talents as the great assassin. You are thrown into many different environments. Scaling buildings, fighting opponents, and managing your brotherhood is easier, than ever. Ubisoft adds a few kinks so that things arent too easy that is. Defending your Dens from attack, adds a defensive gameplay to the game, which has never really been done before in any previous AC game. The story is just as compelling as the last, with stunning visuals to lead the way. Soldiers can counter, your counter adding some interesting fights, as not all enemies can just be killed with a thrust of a sword, or axe. And on top of that multiplayer has improved as well. The game is once again a must buy. This story is definitely something you wont forget.
