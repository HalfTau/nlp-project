I really hope this game didnt ship as bugged as it is now... if you have to spend the first half hour browsing fixes on the web just to get the game to look decent enough to be played, you started with the wrong foot.Also, the annoying stuttering bug made me realize that these games have never been safe for people who suffer from epileptic attacks. Now I cannot unsee all the times the game strobes and flickers when it shouldnt... whats the point of that graphical effect?And whats with the weird alt tabing the game goes through sometimes, like it switches to another game for the parts about desmond remembering his past.The journey through the Assassins Creed saga has been like an insight through the game design process of Ubisoft, they build their game franchise like a Frankestein monster, scavenging parts of other games and assembling them in what they think gamers want, but the result is an aberration.For this one they thought you know what AC is missing? a tower defense minigame, yeah, gamers like that, dont they? and while were at it, lets just throw in a spatial puzzle section also, who cares if there are already too many mechanics!Well, at least they finally figured out the controls needed to change, scrap all that bllshit of head, hands, legs scheme, but I cannot fathom why they thought this was the necessary change, and why the heck they thought that having to stand still to activate eagle vision was a good design. At first I though eagle vision was bugged, as I kept trying to activate it while moving. All the frustration from badly designed controls keeps piling up.For this one, Im just tempted to go watch a youtube video of a complete playthrough of the game. If youre wondering if the game is worth your money, maybe you should just do that instead, just watch someone else go through this piece of garbage, and keep your money for something thats actually fun.
