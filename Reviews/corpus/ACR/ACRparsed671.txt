Ending the Ezio games in Istanbul or whatever name you want to use for it I thought it interesting to change the whole setting from Italian to Turkish or Ottoman.Truly, seeing Ezio grow from an impatient young man to a wise and slightly more patient older man is a very nice progress.I must say, tough, Roger Craig voice actor of Ezio is one of the few people Ive heard doing a good older version of his character. Most people dont really seem able to pull it off properly.
