Whereas the previous titles, Assassins Creed II and Brotherhood, clearly added gameplay elements and more substance to the franchise, Revelations more or less follows the preset footsteps of its predecessors. In addition to a new city, Constantinople, there are some minor additions, most notably the hookblade, the den protection minigame and the assassin training and recruitment episodes have also been upgraded to better fit the context, but as for the technical part, Revelations seems almost stagnated. On the other hand, it all still works so darn well and Revelations is a very beautiful and captivating game. In a sense, its about the end of an era and a character weve come to love since ACII, which is apparent in the physically aging Ezio Auditore and the conculsion of the Altair chronicles. That is why I strongly recommend you play Revelations, especially if youve already played through the previous games.
