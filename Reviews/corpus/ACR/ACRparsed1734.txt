Played all the Assassins Creed games, just not Assassins Creed 3 yet! This game is shorter and less assassinations missions than previous AC games but the game is pretty cool. Lots of cool new moves, new game modes, MP, good story. Cool new locations, friendlier Ezio. Play as Altair game in updated graphics, whoo! Though Assassins Creed 2 is still the best in the 2 series. AC1 and 2 are the best. 8.5/10. Great AC game! Fun.
