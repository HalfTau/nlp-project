This game is awesome! First of, its an Assassins Creed game with Ezio so you know its going to be good  The story is pretty good as well! I quite enjoyed playing through the story. I was motivated to find all of the keys. The combat is pretty good, the graphics are good, there are many different weapons, and the map is pretty fun to explore. I havent defeated it on the PC yet but I have on the Xbox.  All and all, a fantastic game D
