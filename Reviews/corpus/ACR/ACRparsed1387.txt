This installment in the series ties all the previous games into a single cohesive story line.Not being a fan of multiplayer games, Revelations is in someways the best game in the series, as after this title the games focus seemed to be more towards the multiplayer aspect. Ive played and enjoyed III and Black Flag Which is a total departure from any of the previous games. They are always decent. In terms of story though, Revelations marked a high point in the Creed games, that Ive yet to see another one achieve.Overall 7.5/10   in my ratings 5 is the base line and is a OK gameGraphics 8/10 At time of releaseSound 5/10   Music and EffectsVoice Acting 7/10Story 9/10Gameplay 8/10
