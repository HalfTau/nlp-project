The game was great until it stopped working entirely. I was really looking forward to playing the Assassins Creeds that I missed Revelations and AC3 but was really disappointed to find that at a certain point in the game, it stopped working. I was playing as Altiar escaping Masyaf or whatever and it crashes with this error message ACRSP.exe has stopped working. I have a pretty decent gaming computer so I was confused. I launched the game again and played for about 30 seconds before the error message came up again. I tried launching again... and it crashes again. I look online for a solution and apparently it is a problem that alot of people have with this game. After hours of searching and using a cavalcade of different fixes, nothing worked. I have tried my hardest to ask Ubisoft what the problem is but they send me some generic update your drivers nonsense. Even after I tried the obvious solution of updating every single GD thing on my computer, it still did not work. Well, I have looked on forums to see if people who had this problem have found a solution and the only thing I keep reading is that Ubisoft are Cs. So yeah, GG Ubisoft on your quality control and superb customer service. I hope to god Unity will not be as unstable as this game. If there is a god, I beg of you to keep Unity under control.
