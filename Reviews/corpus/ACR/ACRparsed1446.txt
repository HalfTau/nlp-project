Ive put many hours in to this game and there is still so much content to be explored, as a big fan of the AC series I would have to say this is one of the best. The mechanics are just as you would expect from an AC game except for the new hook that allows you to climb faster, which is a great addition because it makes climbing much faster. This game is incredibly fun to 100 there is so much to do and explore you will likely never get bored, there are all kinds of upgrades to get which adds many hours of gameplay, one of the great things about upgrades is you are basically invincible by the end. The story is very interesting and a little different than other AC games, the levels are fun and never really get repetetive.Pros/consPros great gameplay/mechanics, great story, fun levels, great graphics as you would excpect from an AC game, upgrades and renovating buildings are some amazing features from this game that kept me coming back to try to get 100 and allow you to get high amounts of money.Cons There are some glitches here but none of them are game breaking so dont worry about that, most of them are actually pretty hilarious, controls are odd at first which is not really a con because you get used to them fast but it is still something to watch out for I recommend using a gamepad if you have oneOverall I would have to give this game a 9/10. You dont have to play the previous games in the series to enjoy this game, but you should for the story which is amazing Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Im sure youll have lots of fun with this game and get way more than 6 hours out of it.
