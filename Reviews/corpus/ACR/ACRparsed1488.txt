Only complaint I have is I feel like the targeting is off here and there. I.e. when attempting to assassinate a cowardly Templar Captain at one of the dens, I always jumped on his GUARD even though I had the CAPTAIN targeted, absolutely dead in my sights. I tried it a few times just to make sure I wasnt crazy. Idk if thats on purpose to force you to chase after the guy and make it more difficult or if its a bug or w/e, but it was more frustrating than it shouldve been.Overall though I cant NOT enjoy an AC game.
