After rating AC II and hoping for improvement over that desaster I realize my hopes were placed wrongly.1 ACR controls still suck even if they are a little smoother because Ezio still jumps illogically crazy or does not respond accordingly to the direction youre facing at another thing is that there only is ONE freaking button for EVERY action move talk, loot, grab, hide weapon, etc which makes it difficult to pick the action you actually want to perform.2 The story is nothing special.3 ACR includes new features e.g. Templars Dens which can be nice but there are so many details which make one furious since the aiming system does not work because it has not been ported adequately for PC you will have a tough time killing guys in the sheds. Also Why the hell would you need to buy every single shop additionally after freeing a certain area of the Templars? Makes no sense to me.The list goes on and on but in the end I cant recommend this game either .
