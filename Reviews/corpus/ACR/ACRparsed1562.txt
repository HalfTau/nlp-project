Wackness overwhelming.Because apparently people read these....Its a weak extension of a tired formula that doesnt bring anything interesting into the story til basically the very end. Better off Youtube watching it or reading a synopsis and jumping forward to AC3. I loved each game up to this one so I guess my expectations may have been too high.
