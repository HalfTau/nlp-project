Probably the least fluid and controllable parkour and combat in the series.  Probably the worst AI in the series.  Probably the worst side activities in the series.  However, its gives a somewhat satisfying ending to the Ezio series, and its not a bad game overall.  Definite recomendation after you finish II and Brotherhood, more so when on sale though.
