Id love to finish playing the game but I havent been able to get it to work. It crashed near the end of one of the missions and I havent been able to get it to work since. I have tried deleting all the saves and file contents of the game, changing the compatibility mode, restarting my computer. Nothing seems to work. So. I guess Im leaving a bad review because it seems the assassin creed line has bugs like this a lot. Really disappointing.
