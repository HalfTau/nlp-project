I highly reccomend that you dont buy any of the ubisoft games until they get the launcher fixed. Every time I try to load the game, the launcher crahes and bypassing it is too complicated. 0/10 Ubisoft, fix your game or give me a refund. I was very excited to start playing the next assasins creed on my new PC, but apperently its not an option.
