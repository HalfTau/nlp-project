IMO, its the best one yet. I remember IGN saying that they did a great job of blending 3 generations of Assassins into one fluid story...and they couldnt be more right. It was seamlessly and brilliantly done. I really dont think Ive been as intrigued since Bioshock. And thats saying a lot, haha. So yeah, would definitely recommend it.
