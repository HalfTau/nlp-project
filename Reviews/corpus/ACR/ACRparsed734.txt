2 and Brotherhood were great. This just felt like an unnecessary add on to score some . Couldnt have been much more disappointed with this one, killed the series for me. Story was dull, left too many strings untied, city design was cramped and unintuitive, gameplay additions from brotherhood were not enough to merit another game.
