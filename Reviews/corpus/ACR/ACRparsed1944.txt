This game dissapointed me in a lot of ways, though it impressed me in one.Gone are the crazy puzzle sections from the truth.  I cant get over that, they were awesome, and added so much current time backstory.As it is, the game has very little connection to the current time, the primary plot thread  literally does not move until the end of the game.Something cool they did add though is the portallike puzzle sections for desmonds backstory.  Though interesting, his backstory is too much of a retread.Anyway it was worth what I paid for it, but I cant really reccoemend it unless its 30 or less.
