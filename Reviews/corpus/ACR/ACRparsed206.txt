I feel like this game is so underrated. It is the best out of the first four games. All the mechanics were perfected to their best up until AC3, because it changed to a more fluent freerunning system and combat, which is way better imp out of all the Ezio games.Brotherhood was like the younger brother of Revelations. Revelations has the same economy system, same but perfected version of the Assassin signal, better story and better graphics. The story was really interesting and the setting/location of the game aswell, Constantinople was an enjoyable city. One thing that will always make me remember this game was the background music while running through the city. It had this nice eastern style to it and really made me love the game.Also in Revelations we get to see what happened to Altair and the Assassin brotherhood. Though the modern day part in Revelations was boring, I believe it wasnt particularly interesting in any other of the AC games either.I highly recommend this game because many people skip ACR for it not being so popular.
