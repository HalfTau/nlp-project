The game finally speeds up the pace which was slowed down in Brotherhood and rushes through diverse set of events without ever leaving the space for boredom. It feels somewhat shorter than its predecessor, but this helps keeping things interesting through and through. Gone are the brilliant puzzles from ACII and Brotherhood, but theyre replaced by firstperson storytelling sequences with platforming elements. Main theme by Lorne Balfe performed by the winner of a fan singing contest sounds amazing and is probably the most memorable musical piece in the whole series to date. Multiplayer got a facelift as well and now features a sort of a storyline with cutscenes. The game once again manages to pull off a mindblowing and heartfelt ending that leaves you with a melancholic afterthought.The best AC game since ACII, a magnificent conclusion to the stories of two brilliant characters.
