Assassins Creed Revelations is by far a great sequel in the Ezio trilogy, getting more in depth and letting the player realy connect with Ezio as he has gotten so much more older since he was in Assassins Creed 2, the player in this game must continue Ezios story and see the end of Ezio and Altair as they both and Desmond clash together in this amazing story line. Great graphics and such a deep story and characters make this a game any gamer should have to complete the Ezio trilogy and the Assassins Creed Series! Highly recomened!
