Mixed feelings here. This title brings some of the problems of its predecessors, like camera issues. Many times the camera turns to angles that causes more trouble than solutions. This makes the game boring.Besides that, this is the least challenging AC until it. Things only go wrong when flaws happen like npcs making wrong moves or getting stuck and game controls or camera angles changing at wrong times.However, they did very nice in the game new content, like the tower defense mini game.But not everything that was added is meaningful. Like the bombs. Even though they may be cool, I simply did not find proper use for them in the game used only when the game obliged me. At the same time, the chests already strange in the past game got even more odd. Well, why there are chests around the city and no one cares?. I know, every game has this kind of things, but it just seemed to me too out of context.In the end, the history is nice, and it fills an important gap in the series. I liked the lore and I think they did well in adding more facts and topics in the extra anymus mode.7/10
