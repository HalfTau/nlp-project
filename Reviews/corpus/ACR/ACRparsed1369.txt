not a bad game, why vote down? bcs of the Uplay. i bought this game for single player, when i start it up the game hast to check for updates. OK, but isnt it a bit old to recieve updates? and it takes quite long. than the Uplay launcher starts, WITH UPDATING! when i click play, i wanna play. not some stupid launcher update from what has nothing to do with the game itself! im actually writing this while Uplay is updating..AND NOW ITS LOADING THE GAME INFORMATION WHICH ALREADY FAILED ONCE AND NOW IS GOING ON FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES, I dont wanna waste my spare time for some stupid game infromation to load!
