SPOILERS, review not intended for people who cries about spoilers, read at your own riskI dont know what happened with the Assassins Creed series, to be honst, AC Revelations was the last game that I liked the most, I dont know if it is because the sudden dead of desmond in AC3 or the cloning easter egg or because the resent games arent that much about the war beetwen abstergo and the present assassins to search for the orangeofdoom.No matter what we still have this nice piece of game, I really recommend it.PD sometimes controls feel clunky even with my xbox360 controller, the story isnt that impresive but pretty good andthe designs, oh my oh my, it feels so good just to watch everything except for the army of clones that live in the city at the end you can still watch some videos to understand what is good and bad...anyways, buy it and play it!
