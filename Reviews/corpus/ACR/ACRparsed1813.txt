Ive had terrible problems with this game that I blame on Ubisofts online DRM.  Initially I couldnt play the game for a week because I couldnt get the launcher to work.  Eventually I got it working and it was fun for a while.Now after 20 hours of gameplay, the game crashed no problem usually right, just load the latest save point.  Not this time... the game doesnt see any of my save files anymore.  It just offers to create a new game when I try to start single player.  Ive tried restoring the files from a backup to no avail.  Ubisofts online save sync service doesnt seem to do anything either it makes no difference if I turn it on or off still cant find my saves.For this and all Ubi games, make sure you turn off their savesync system.
