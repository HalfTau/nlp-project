Hello everybody.I guess I am not adding much by saying this is a solid entry in the series. Its my third AC instalment and after having completed AC II and brotherhood, the feeling I get from revelations until now is a familiar and nice one. The combat is more difficult which makes more sense really, but very... fragmented too. The aim system doesnt work properly and the AI is having a little bit of difficulty in understanding that I obviously want to shoot the guard and not the fellow assassin standing next to me.Combat doesnt have the superb flow evident in brotherhood. Same goes with the parkour system, although I have noticed that the AI is a bit more... intelligent here and doesnt make me climb on any bit of stone  I come across. I havent advanced much in the story yet, the game kind of compells you to buy the whole city before getting on the real business in hand. Oh, the thing with your notorieaty augmenting every time you buy a building? Annoying. And just absurd and time consuming. The Den Defense seems a bit out of place in this kind of game. The big breakthrough of the game is obviously the bombs, but to be frank... I never really liked using them. And although it is a fitting utility, ubisoft did it a bit too much. Last but not least, I regret the absence of a selected saving point during missions. Especially in the big dungeons when you try to get 100 synch... you fail and you have to do it all AGAIN. Silly really. All that said, and STILL its an incredible AC game. Constandinoupoli is great, and take it from a Greek, many NPCs are talking greek. Most merchants seem to be Greek, taylors and booksellers mostly. The city is vast, the bazaar is an eye candy, and the story is what it should be. Enjoy blading people!
