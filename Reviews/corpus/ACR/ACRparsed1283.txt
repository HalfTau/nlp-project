AC2 started off with a very good storyline, which Brotherhood extended. However Revelations is where things got really interesting with the introduction of a variety of bombs which made completing missions a lot more have it your way. Of all the AC2 titles, would definitely recommend Revelations the highest in terms of gameplay... although the original AC2 had a much more interesting storyline. Brotherhood was inbetween the two on all counts!
