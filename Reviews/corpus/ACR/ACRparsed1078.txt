This review is subjective and entirely my own opinion, feel free to agree or disagree with it.I love the Assassins Creed franchise, but this is by far the weakest link in its chain. It feels like Ubisoft took everything that made AC Brotherhood great and then added a few new features that drag the game down.I havent tried the multiplayer I never really liked MP in AC but I imagine the multiplayer is dead given the age of the game.There is probably a few things that I have missed but I would only recommend this game if you are a fan of the series and you want to see a conclusion to two of the best protagonists in the franchise. I would only buy it if it is on sale, it may be worth 14.99 but I would wait until Steam has a sale, where you could pick it up for around 3.75.
