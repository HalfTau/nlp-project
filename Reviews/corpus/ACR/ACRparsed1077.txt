So this is the first Assasins Creed game I decided to play on PC, considering I usually play it on XBOX. My experience at the beginng with Uplay was awful. Ubisofts pc ports suck. I signed into a account where they never told me it got deactavited, so I had to Unlink uplay, uninstall uplay, reinstall uplay, uninstall the game, and reinstall the game. Yeah. Thanks Ubishit.The game it selfGreat game! Awesome story, great fighting, good graphics, and cool weapons. Its a great AC game! Has everything you want out of Assassins Creed. Ezio is as always a badass.The Game itself 96/100 DesmondsUbisoft 1/8 IGN too much uplay
