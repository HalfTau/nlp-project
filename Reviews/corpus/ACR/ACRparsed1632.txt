Taking the best from the previous series, game gives you an amazing experience, actionpacked intense gameplay, random and interesting missions. Story is great, ancient Istanbul is huge and interesting to explore, music is so much epic. Some people say brotherhood/revelations is more like addon, but this isnt true. It took me almost 30 hours for about 87 total sync and still have some sidemissions left.If youre up for a good mature story in an openworld sandbox  pick it up immediately.If youre a series fan  this is must have of course, will fill up the missing story chapters so you can see the untold earlier Altairs stories, Desmond past and so much more.
