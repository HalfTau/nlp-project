I started a few times on an honest review that does Revelations justice.Screw that. Here is the unjust one.Its not thrilling.I dont recognize Altair from AC1, I dont recognize Ezio. TAAAAME! These men need wisdom like fish needs pliers.And, really, after the breathless chase after the best 16th Century had to offer,  how could you go back to the old formula of the fat  ugly Templar villain? Criminal, just criminal well, okay, not criminal.Screw that.Other than that, ye gods, tis gorgeous, and Constantinople is the place to be in the early 15hundreds, and they managed to make the OW less painful, and the Assassins Guild   almost interesting. Well, VIVA LA ASSASSINI!On my subjective scale of extreme latecomer to the franchise, this game places asAC1 ACBACRAC2
