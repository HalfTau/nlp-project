This will be a brief summary of the Assassins Creed series in which Ezio Auditore da Firenze was the protagonist, and an opinion about the final part of the trylogy.From all the three games AC II,  Brotherhood and Revelations, this was my favorite.Not only for putting an end to an amazing story, and the life of a man, but for technically very well created.Being outside of Europe kinda was a nice fresh experience, I liked the city of Constantinapole. It was more alive, than Rome and other italian places, in my opinion. The engine seemed to be updated, I saw some beautiful light effects and the enviroment was more detailed. I recommend you turning off music and just walking around on the streets listening to your surroundings. Whole new game, isnt it?This series always represented a different world view and lots of hidden messages throughout the story. That is that drove me to play the game more and more, I found it really exciting. Sadly the gameplay can be repetitive sometimes, and even frustrating when youre too far away from a fast travel point, but close enough to your target location, so you have to run across the city. cause no horses in Constantinapole are allowed...Even though its small mistakes, this series is a mustplay for all gamers out there, Im looking forward to the next episodes.
