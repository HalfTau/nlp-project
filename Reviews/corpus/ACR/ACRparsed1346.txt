Fun but to easy, I was able to get the master assassin armor during like sequence 23 and all the best weapons. Also the stalker npcs are anoying to me in my opinion. I cant walk the streets and buy stuff without having to look behind me everytime and when it does happen the game blasts your ear with a noise that will make you jump as the stalker tries to kill you. Drives me to the point where im like  off! p
