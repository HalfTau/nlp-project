Ive attained 100 game completion.Pros Great gameplay. Great graphics. Good story. Fun and enjoyable city exploration, and plenty to do for completionists like myself. Fantastic way to conclude Ezios trilogy and life as an Assassin.Cons There were a few glitches here and there, such as when you have to fight a man called Shakulu later in the game, the game crahses and stops responding. Those who experience this issue should go into task manager, right click on the process ACR.exe and click set affinity. From there, disable all threads except for one. Core 0 should remain ticked, if its literally unplayably laggy, then sometimes enabling Core 1 as well as Core 0 works, or at least it did with my 8700K . This will make the game lag heaps, but after the fight has finished you can turn them back on. You dont need to restart in between reenabling. The same fix works for the third Altair mission. Again, much like ACB the game is reletively short at only 9 sequences, but after all, it is just an expansion of AC2.Rating 9.5/10.
