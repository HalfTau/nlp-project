ACR does everything that AC2 and ACB did right, and adds to it. There is just as much faffing about as you like though its mostly not required. Horses are inexplicably missing, but you get to recruit much earlier. The tower defence segment can suck a fat one. Also, the begger women are back in packs. The setting and cutscenes are beautiful, as is the smooth combat. I give it 9.9 ! and highly recommend to all.
