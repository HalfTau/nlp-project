After playing Assasins Creed 2, which i found to be a flipping awesome game and assasins creed brotherhood what was a great continuation in story line, assasins creed revelations doesnt quite cut it for me, the game gets far too same old gameplay, their isnt really anything new to it to really keep me playing and the story line was just plain boring, i think the best way for me to describe it is, its like a really really bad book in a trilogy of books, its boring untouchable and really when u do try and play it all i want to do is burn it.
