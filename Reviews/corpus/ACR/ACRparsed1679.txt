would not recommend. If you are an altair fan, DEFINITELY would not recommend. Very very poor story. Chapter 8 shouldnt even be there, feels like a space filler. The ending is crap if you actually buy this nonsense be prepared for something similar to the end of assassins creed 2. The worst part of the game to me was the 5 gates where you could get to see desmonds past. Utter crap. Really boring, really badly told. This has got to be the smallest city theyve ever made, too. Its rediculously small. You spend most of the time as Ezio, by the way, and only get to see altair 6 times for around 5  10 minutes each. Shortest game so far in the series, yet for some reason more expensive then the games before it, which were much better. In short, dont play this game. For those who wish to skip this game and go to 3, here is the story line in a nutshell. Spoilers.the world will end soon and you have to find out how to stop it. Yes, thats the whole thing. Yes, that was all in the last 5 minutes of gameplay. Yes, this game has a terrible story find 5 keys. Whoopie!!.
