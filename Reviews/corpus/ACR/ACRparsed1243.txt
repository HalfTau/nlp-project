i cant recommend this by a long shot, the controls are so bad, freerunning one of the core game features just is not working. so many gameplay functions are glitchy climbing, distractions it just sucks the fun out of the game. every entertainment value of the game is destroyed by the mechanical failures. just a disappointment.
