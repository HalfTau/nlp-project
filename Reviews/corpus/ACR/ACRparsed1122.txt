This is by far the worst game made for the assassins creed series in my opinion.I dont know what made this game so boring for me but the game was painful to finish  I finished the game only because I bought it and wanted to see the end of the ezio storyline .The game is boring in two aspects  the soundtrack and the story  every time I played this game I almost fall asleep from boredom  speaking seriously here.Your character is old in this game and thats also makes the game feel old and boring.The combat and sneak system is good but still not worth playing this game.In addition I didnt like the cities in this game and how they looked in contrary to all the other games.Would recommend this for people with problems at sleeping, you can just play this game for an hour and you are good to go.My score 5/10P.S Buy this if you are one of the people who want to know how ezio story ends but you should probably wait for sale.
