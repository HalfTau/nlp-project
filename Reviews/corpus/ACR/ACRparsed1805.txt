Follows the same formula as the previous AC2 and Brotherhood titles, however still feels like its not bringing much to the table as far as Story goes. It was a needless toss in to the second games storyline I feel like. The addition of the Bombs and the Hook Blade felt weak and unnecessary. Pick it up for 7 if you really like the series on the next Steam sale, but thats about it. Graphics and Gameplay were fine though.
