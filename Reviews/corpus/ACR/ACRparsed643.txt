This is my favorite game in the series. I absolutly love the Ezio story line plus the gameplay is solid. The voice acting isnt amazing but Ezio is still a badass so theres that. The multiplayer is also my favorite in the series because of the changes to stuns and the character design is really good.69/10  IGNOh and play AC2 and Brotherhood before playing this or else the story wont make that much sense
