rather then letting get to a location, scout it out and work out a plan, your just there. most assassin puzzles. are just you getting into a big brawl.a lot if not all the cut screens could of been done wile you will still in control and walking to new locale AKA this is 96 cut scene 2 game 2 nothing fights.simplified and yet misplaced ui / controls. i think in an attempt to make them the same no matter what it was played on for example only a few buttons are used, my main annoyance was stuff like press tab for map and exit 3 times to get back out out. so no attempt to take advantage of it being on PC was used.combat moves like holding a body infront of you to absorb incoming bullets often dose nothing. i got an award in the tutorial for being in the top 50 of avoiding being hit by bullets on my 4th rerun of it with just the free pre placed badguy that is supposed to show you how the move works that 1st one did, it was the next area your supposed to use it i kept dieting in so im not the only one.
