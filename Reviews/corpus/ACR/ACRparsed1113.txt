AKA Ezios fun trip to Constantinople. They added Plants vs Zombies and Portal to this Assassins Creed game for some reason. If you like stabbing people, owning your own businesses and jumping into bushes, this game has it in spades. Plays a lot like AC2 and Brotherhood though, so hopefully you liked those games.
