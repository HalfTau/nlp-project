Definite avoid.Writing Ubisoft are just pumping the pump here. A convoluted story that at times makes little sense and has you doing farmville type activities to try to bulk out the game. The writing is pretty awful. The first AC game was really interesting but as soon as they revealed this whole templars thing I think it fell flat with players. The animus is lot more interesting than Brotherhood though.Gameplay Almost entirely unchanged, the game mechanics are so similar that youre spending most of your time bored here. There is a lot of bloat here that is best skipped. If you want to recruit other assassins or earn money instead of playing the game thats great. I hated the whole direction. Altair is back but it might as well be cutscenes.Graphics The graphics appear to be an updated theme in an old engine but the bugs are really out in force.Bugs 4 years on and this game is still heavily bugged. During this game it crashed multiple times requiring CPU affinity to be set to a single core crippling performance. Other bugs include falling into areas that end with you stuck, camera issues that make the game unplayable and a QTE boss fight event doesnt accept the key strokes required, leading to a restart. Focus on stealth is sadly lacking and you cant restore to a checkpoint if you are discovered, you have to restart the entire memory or suicide.Its unlikely Ill put any time into another AC game without stunning reviews.
