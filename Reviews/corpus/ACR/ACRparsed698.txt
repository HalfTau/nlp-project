Ubisofts laest gimmick pay 9.95 to get stuck on the press any key screen. Thats right folks! step right up to spend your money to view a message on how this game was designed by a multicultural team with different faiths and beliefs. I wonder did any of those beliefs actually include producing quality work? i highly doubt it. Alas i have myself to blame for being stupid enough to spend money on anything ubisoft chruns out. Ubisoft does not make games, they make disgraceful defective rubbish and scam money with them
