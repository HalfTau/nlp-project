Almost as bad as Assassins Creed 1.Now, Im not saying its like complete trash, theres still a storyline with this game, but as I have mentioned in Assassins Creed 1 Review, Id rather have watched a Synopsis video than waste my time with Ezios end. I was hoping for an epic adventure, a big bang per say when I ended, I did not in any way, shape, or form, thought that this was the case with Revelations. Hell I dont understand why the 7 people that downvoted this review got anything out of this game O.oThe only cool thing was the hook, amirite? Im sure everyone the higher population of people thinking this game blew, when Im saying everyone can all agree that this was the only redeeming factor, other than that, you wished you could just watch like a 1 hour movie and hoped that you could train the Chinese girl for DLC like AC Freedom Cry, but itd be of course a name related to the Chinese Era in which Shao Jun is the main character.Sure, there was a Tower Defense like minigame but I didnt feel... Assassiny? I mean, a group of men are REALLY going to keep going down the same road seeing countless of their own men dead knowing theres been Assassins roaming around the area, I dont think so.
