Like with most Assassins Creed games, you play them for the story, not innovations in the gameplay over preview games. You should only get this game if you are interested in the story. It may be a bit of a filler but it definitely pumps you up for the next game in the series. Worth a sale purchase for the fans of the series.Rating weighted based on the genreIm basing my rating on the game being part of a larger whole of the series. I do not recommend playing this game on its own.Story 5/5Gameplay 4/5Challenge 2.5/5Discovery 3/5Replayability 3/5Aesthetics 3.5/5Visuals 5/5Atmosphere 2.5/5Music 4/5
