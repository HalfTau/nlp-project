In my opinion the worst game of the Ezio franchize. I may be a little too fast to pass it off, but 5 hours into the game and I still dont feel involved in the game at all like I did in the other two. I simply just dont feel the same way I did about Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood. which were outstanding all the way, I could feel a wholeness in the two I was able to set myself in the world, in Ezios story, and the others around him. But with Revelations, I do not feel the same at all. Ive been trying to connect this game with the other two, but I havent been able to at all the time Ive played. I might force myself to finish this game someday, but not sure when.. or how long it will take to do so.Id like to finish with what made me stop play Revelations the part with Altair. I may be a little too picky, but I can not help it... all Im going to say isWhat the heck happened to his voice, face, combat style and his way of talking? Nearly grinned my face off while playing that part. Oh, and not to mention the way they talk Im going to get you, traitor! ... Oh, Im not a traitor ... I got your master how can you read that without grinning? Let alone hear them say it. one thing from another, there is also that annoying Yosuf guy or whatever his name was again. Id rather meet him with my hidden blade in his face than working with him.. there are so much more to talk about, but Im going to stop before I grin my face off. Im not going to recommend this game not just because of things that annoy me, but simply because I do not like the gameplay experience in general. For those who consider buying this however I hope it will fall to taste.
