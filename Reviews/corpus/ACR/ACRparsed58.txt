I cant thumbs down this game. Its an AC game, and its a nice game. But in all honesty this is light years away from Brotherhood and AC II for that matter. The story feels kinda streched and it added useless anoying things. None the less, its an ending to the Ezio trilogy and a must play if you wanna tie up the loose ends.
