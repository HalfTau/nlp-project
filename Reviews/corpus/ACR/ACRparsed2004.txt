This game was excellent, you get to play old ezio, young/old altair and of course desmond and i really felt like i have learnt alot from the characters and the story they are trying to tell. The gameplay is the same but  with a few new features like the tower defence type game on your assasins dens and being able to use bombs and ziplines etc. I did miss the wealth of locations in the previous games but still it was alot of fun being in a different location with different types of people and enemies. Again definitely recommend it if you enjoy any of the games but id recommend you play them in order to follow whats going on.
