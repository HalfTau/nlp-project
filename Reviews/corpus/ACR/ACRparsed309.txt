It is with genuine sadness that I come to the end of Ezios story.If you are looking for innovative gameplay, that ship has sailed, as the mechanics are essentially an evolution from AC Brotherhood. There are a few interesting additions, such as unique missions for master assassins or the hookblade for climbing, but its not going to win any awards in this department.However, where this shines is the writing. For someone invested in Ezios story, it was a fine wrap up and send off for him  and as a part of this we see Altairs life fleshed out in key scenes. We have another plot update for Desmond, and you can also play through parts of his memories In a somewhat portalesque puzzle based fashion in order to understand more about him before his capture by the Templars.If you are new to the series, I wouldnt get this straight away. Play the others first, and if you want to see the end of Ezio and Altairs tale it is a great experience  if a little short for my liking.However  Ezio playing the lute dressed as a minstrel singing songs about beating people up? Too good to miss.
