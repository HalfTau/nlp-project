Even though I enjoy playing AC and even more playing with Ezio, this game gets a little stale for me and I cannot find the motivation for getting through the game.The missions is kinda repetitive and the bomb craftings is really boring and I have almost never used them.And dont even get me started on the defence of the dens /Buuuuuut... it is great that it connects the memories of Altair and Ezio and some day I may find the interest to complete the game. And the improvement of the battles is as always great and makes it more enjoyable.
