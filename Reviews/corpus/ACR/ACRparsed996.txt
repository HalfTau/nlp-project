For an Assassins Creed game, it did pretty... bad. The story is not thrilling as the others installments on the series but can get you hooked at some point. The love between Ezio and Sofia did not receive as much attention as it should have. However, if you think of this as just a game and not as part of a series, it can surprise you. The game is simple enough, no stealth, slaughter everyone and proceed. Youll only use stealth when the game makes you. Assassins Creed is much more of an Arcade than a stealth type of game, and the difficulty is the same. If you want an easy, fast paced and parkour game, this is the game for you.
