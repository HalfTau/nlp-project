Very amazing experience. I recommend every single Assassins creed game on the market. Each one gives you a similar, yet, completely different, wonderful experience.AC revelations runs smoothly on lower end PCs, even running at about 30 FPS, lowest settings, on some laptops.Ive played for 79 hours on this game, and still havent beaten it. Theres so much to explore, and so much to do.
