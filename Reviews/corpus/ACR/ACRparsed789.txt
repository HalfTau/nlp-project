I must admit I did not like the first game Assassins Creed very much the list of complaints is endless, especially as I was coming to this game after having played a rich and detailed RPG such as TES4 Oblivion which, unfortunately, happened to be my first foray into PC gaming thereby making my expectations humungous for other PC games.However, in the sequels, the Ezio chapters were quite interesting in terms of story, gameplay, and the combat options available  chances are, one interested in historical settings and free running is bound to like this game.Ill be back later with additional observations.
