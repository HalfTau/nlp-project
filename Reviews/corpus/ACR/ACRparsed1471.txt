The final Ezio  Altair game and the 2nd best of Ezios trilogy here is Assassins Creed Revelations!WARNINGContains SpoilersSTORY You again assume the role of Desmond Miles, after being possessed and killing Lucy, Desmond goes into a coma, he is still inside the animus and meets an individual name Clay, Clay informs Desmond that he must relieve the final memories of Ezio in order to get out and so Desmond does. You now assume Ezio in his early 50s as he heads to Masyaf to find the hidden keys that will unlock Altairs libary and awaken its hidden secrets. The templars are also after the keys and after Ezio fights one of the captains and takes a journal that belonged to Niccolo Polo he must head to Constantinople, find the other keys, and stop the templars before they can use the knowledge for their own gains. The story here was honestely the worst for Ezio, he felt like a mentor to the other characters and didnt really put in much of a impact in this game but I understand because this is Ezios final game and it portrays both his final struggles and his somewhat tiredness towards his own brotherhood.7.1/10GRAPHICS The graphics are the best out of Ezios trilogy enough said.9.5/10GAMEPLAY The gameplay was way WAY less difficult than ACB was, you could buy all the stuff without going through some stupid fetch quest for it, the full sync was better, and it only frustrated me once.Simple as that.8/10CONCLUSION This was a fine way to end Ezio  Altairs story but it shouldve been stronger like ACB was at least, but Ubisoft still tried their best with gameplay and a hookblade, GO HOOKBLADE!BUY RANK12 Pretty good price so far, you should buy it now or wait till a sale. Your choice.
