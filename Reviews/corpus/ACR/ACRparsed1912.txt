The finisher to Ezios era of Assassins Creed, Revealations is a step backwards from previous games. It is clear that the developers are out of ideas and have no idea how to progress the series foward after switching to the CoD style yearly release.Whereas in the previous games, Brotherhood, factions such as the mercenaries or thieves would have multiple side quest missions with their own rewards, Revelations only has 1 mission for the mercenaries and the Romani.The story itself lacks any clear enemy in your search for 5 keys that contains a diary from Altair, and the main quest line really, the only quest line can be completed within 20 hours. There are insights to what happens to Altair after the first game but its better to save your money and look up spoilers of the game than to play through this snoozer.
