While this game is the 4th main game in the Assassins Creed universe, it doesnt hold up to the previous 2. Even though Ubisoft managed to keep the great gameplay while adding new components, the story just fell short in length and in quality.Dont get me wrong though, the game is great and worth a play at least once. I was just disappointed that revelations couldve been much better.The multiplayer gets a facelift, keeping the funfactor going. Its mostly the same, with a few added and new mechanics.I got the game at a discount, and was very satisfied with my purchase. If youre following the Assassins Creed storyline, it wouldnt hurt to pick this up. Dont expect any miracles from the story, though.
