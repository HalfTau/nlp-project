1. Multiplayer  Good. Especially Maps. 7/102. Singleplayer   Boring Den Defense  I hate it! Boring and Disgusting defense System! To avoid it, I lowered my notorious level by bribing a herald, assassinate vizier, take off the poster. Side Mission  Not good. Worse than Assassins creedBrotherhood. A few side missions and Mostly about Master Assassin Mission. Background and Graphic, Packour and Battle  Good. Secret Locations  Nice Secret Locations.
