Considered to be one of the worst games in AC series by the fans. But I am not a fan, and I liked Revelations. Heres why. Smaller locations compared to other AC games, but with memorable landmarks and you dont have to ride on a clunky horse like in AC2/AC3. The game is pretty short for the series, so you dont get a feeling you repeat the same again and again. Not too many typical dumb and boring AC missions such as eavesdropping or following someone. Overall Revelations seems more action packed. Great flashbacks of Altair. Even though theres no revelations really, the story is ok. Definitely better than AC3 and Black Flag.
