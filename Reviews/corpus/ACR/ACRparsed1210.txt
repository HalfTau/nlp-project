Revelations is one of the worst titles in the series. The area control aspect is extremely repetitive and uninspired compared to what Brotherhood had to offer. Every tower can be tackled with the same strategy they lack design and the areas are extremely similar. They removed the brilliant stealth missions on separate maps, which were one of the best things in Brotherhood. Optional mission objectives full sync were added arbitrarily without much sense of design. Istanbul was a large city I guess, but it seemed too flat and uneventful compared with Rome.
