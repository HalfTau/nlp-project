Assassins Creed Revelations has an amazing graphics and incredible gameplay, full with action objectives and interesting story, the last in the Ezio saga, who also comletes the Assassins Creed 1. the only disadvantage in my opiion is the fact that the game is very short and almost does not provide you the options of an open world gameplay like its former. yet the location is very exotic and different than the rest of the games so far, and the game brings many answers to interesting questions about the franchise. in addition the game contains another version of the multiplayer gameply, who had been improved, clearly, and has an interesting story as well.
