This is the last of Ezio saga.The game involves more of Altairs last moment and more to the apple of eden.The game is still fun to play but its pretty much the same game as previous games. Unlike botherhood, it introduce the assassin dens. For this its the same but you take over the territory. The fight, climb and everything else is pretty much the same thing.I would recommend for those fans but dont expect anything new about this. Apart from that, I have to say revelation isnt as great as previous titles though. I wont say much about the story, it more to finale to Ezio and Altairs story.My RatingExcellentGreatAverageBadGraphics ExcellentSound  music ExcellentGameplay GreatStory Great
