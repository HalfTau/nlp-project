Its kind of impossible to follow all the Assassins Creed yearly releases, so Im still 2 games behind. Although this is inferior to Brotherhood I did enjoy Revelations more, maybe because I was a bit tired of Assassins Creed when I played the previous one. I enjoyed Constantinopla and Ezios final chapter, he is truly one of the best protagonists of this generation and AC story is more enjoyable if we see it as Ezios personal journey. All the crap around Animus, Desmond and the gods is a big, giant mess.3,5/ 5
