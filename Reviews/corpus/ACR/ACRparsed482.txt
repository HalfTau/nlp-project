This game is not as good as Assassins Creed Brotherhood or AC3 but it still provides a fun gameplay. The hook blade is handy in scaling walls, but youll end up at least I did using your wrist pistol more often than the previous games, as you face tougher enemies like Janissaries that carry two weapons most times instead of Halberd wielding guys in clunky armor. Ezio is an old fart but still runs around and jumps across buildings as if he never aged a day. Age has no meaning in video games neither does time. Id still recommend getting it, but dont expect the same type of game as Brotherhood.7.5/10
