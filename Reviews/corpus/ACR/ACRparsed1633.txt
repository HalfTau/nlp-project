This game follows the formula established in AC2 and ACBrotherhood. Youll find the same economy system, shop restorations, etc. The notable additions are Extended activities to do once your assassin recruits level up Craftable Bombs Assassin building defense minigame essentially tower defenseThe tower defense minigame is a bit annoying, but Im glad they introduced it since in Assassins Creed Brotherhood, there werent any serious consequenses for allowing your notariety to max out by doing illegal things.If you havent played either of the prequals, hold off on playing this one, since the story picks up where they left off. I dont think that the first Assassins Creed game is necessary, however, to know whats going on.I enjoyed AC2 and ACBrotherhood and I enjoyed ACRevelations as well. They stuck to what worked in the previous games and added a bit more. Im glad I didnt get it when it was full priced but I think anything around 10 is easy to justify for this title.EDIT I noticed, as I was recently playing, that I really like the NPC models/textures. They are significantly more alive and colorful that they have been in the past AC games. Quite impressed.
