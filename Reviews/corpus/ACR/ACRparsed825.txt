The games content is fantastic. Storyline, game play, everything. But here is the catch, you buy on steam, download third party software, that said software crashes upon startup, if you get it to work and update the launcher, create a third party account. This is exactly like GTA 4. This is completely unneeded amount of crap. Only reason I do not recommend this game is the hassle and amount of hoops you must jump through to play the damn thing.
