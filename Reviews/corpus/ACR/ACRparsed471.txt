Assassins creed revleations brings an end to Ezios amazing story. Dont look at my time played counter. Because i havet played it on this account its almost nothing.Im a huge fan of the series and this is my opinion.Story Ezio travels to masyaf to find something from Altar his father did not find. ezio has to collect 5 keys. One of them is in possesion of the tempalrs. the story is a lot bigger but im not gonna tell you guys. Just go and play itgameplay It changed. You know have a seperate weapon wiel for melee and ranged/smoke bombs. You can also use zip lines with the new hookblade.graphics Its quite old. But it loks okay imoverdict This game brings a great end to the ezio trilogy. i would reccomend this to anyone who has played 12 and brotherhood. PLay this game after youve played 2 and brotherhood.
