What brotherhood did wrong, Revelations does right. the boring minigames are less boring, the overworld is more interesting and the villens and writing are on par with the first. as well as seeing the main character being a well seasoned veteren of an assassin and watching him be tired of his life. fallowing a single man through his life as an assassin and watching how it affects him as he goes from a young gigalo to a jaded gray hair was the most enjoyable part of this game set for me. and with all this game DOES improve over Brotherhood does make this worth a purchase.
