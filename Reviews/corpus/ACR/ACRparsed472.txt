Five out of five stas. The best Assassins Creed title to date. It takes everything great about Two and Brotherhood and polishes it to a shimmering shine. Virtually bug free, packed with well paced action and stealth, and set in a beautiful atmosphere and story this gem deserves more attention than its recieved.
