Plus 3rd installment for Ezio. Starts off weird, and continues in about the same manner. Constantinople is super fun. Money is pretty easy to make nearly right from the start. Good graphics. No noticable bugs.Minus Bomb making is kind of wacky. Unlike Brotherhood, the tunnel system doesnt have terribly good placement on many of the entrances. Addon DLC is lame.
