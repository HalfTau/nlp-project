The game is okay and I recommend either iii or black flag over this but it is okay. The main story line is interesting although I think 3s is better It is still pretty interesting the assassins and templars are a lot more obvious but it is still a good game and I recommend  getting it during a sale if you have 5 extra. Wait until a sale it is not worth the 20 that  it costs.
