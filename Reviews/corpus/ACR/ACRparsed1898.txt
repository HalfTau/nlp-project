ACR is the latest installment to the AC series. The story continues with Desmond and Ezio. If you followed the AC series then this will be an excellent addition to your list. The physics and overall gameplay has been improved, but as usual sometimes they just dont do what you want. Hopefully with improvements in the games this will be better in future. Overall the story remains as excellent and puts more light on what happened. Additional videos and content are only available on the other side of the world though.The one problem that most followers of the series will have is that the version available in the US is much more limited than the ones available in Australia for example. Additional maps and characters, items and sidestories that are not available and are region locked made many shy away from this. Personally I only purchased it because I got a coupon for 50 off  else I would not have purchased it for the original price without the perks that are available elsewhere.
