I recommend this game mostly because it has a very good storyline, and its needed to understand all the things that happened to Ezio Audiotore after becoming the mentor of the assassins in Rome, as well as Desmond before getting caught by Abstergo in AC1 and between games. It is also a very interesting approach to the way the Animus works, how Desmond could keep conscious thanks to the Animus despite being comatose, and how Subject 16 conscience remained alive in the Animus even after his body died. Definetely a good plot.Now, the game has a few issues too. In my experience playing it, I had some troubles with the commands, because some of them are different from previous games, although after a few minutes hours, to be honest I could get used to them. There are some troubles in some missions too, specially when one wants to get the 100 syncronization. But in general, its been a rather good experience.
