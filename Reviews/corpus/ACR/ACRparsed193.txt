I feel empty, that feeling of doom you get when you read such a good story, almost like you lived an entire lifetime and your ok to the coming ending. Such a great game, I mean its a beautifull game. Im 100 in love with ezio, he is so awesome. The strugle Ezio goes along for 30 years of his life, the search for a meaning, the discover of truth, the game makes you completely feel the same way Ezio feels and forward you play because you want an answer. That is a sign of a great game.The story itself, from AC1 to revelations is absolutely amazing, that ending was everything we ever wanted and more, OMG fantastic ending!!! !The way they connected everything, altair, to ezio, to desmond, to whatever is to come, its AMAZING.Now to review the game, its a damn buggy game, it has bugs. Brotherhood had some, but in this one its even worse. Not game breaking bugs but bugs, fighting animation they added so many complex moves, so complex that the animation is garbage, you dont know what your looking at. Terrible fighting animation. I died like 3 or 4 times thanks to camera angles, buggy game again. Not major but its worth mentioning.Music wise, the game felt diferrent than the other Assasin Creed but still mantaning a familiar sound to it, making the story flow perfectly between ages. Great soundtrack! !I actually enjoyed the tower defense mode, i only played 2 or 3 times, and the game doesnt requires you to play it, its a bonus but actually enjoyable, not to easy not to dificult. I enjoyed training my assasins. As long has the game doesnt require you to do it, it can be fun.I still havent finished there is still more to do it, so Im pretty happy with the game.8/10 game Get those animations right and you earn yourself the 10 perhaps. If you want a conclusion to Ezio, altair story, this is it, its a must buy.Love you Ezio, we hate you shepppard.Sad day today. frattello mio
