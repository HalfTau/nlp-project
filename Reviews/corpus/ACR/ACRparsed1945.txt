For three consecutive years, Ubisoft has been releasing new installments to its Assassins Creed franchise. My fears with such quick sequels were quelled with Brotherhood, which bested its already remarkable predecessor by a mile. Needless to say, Revelations had a lot to live up to.Id be hard pressed to highlight memorable additions in this new iteration. While Revelations recaptures what made its prequels amazing, it lacks innovation. The few new inclusions are a tower defense minigame, bomb crafting, and puzzle sequences featuring Desmond.If you loved Brotherhoods multiplayer, its still as exhilarating as ever here and the plot remains a meticulous tapestry of fact and fiction. Any fan who has followed the storyline will appreciate this new installment which concludes the journeys of Altair and Ezio in heartwarming fashion.At the end of the day, Revelations is still worth recommending, despite it coming off as more of an expansion than a fullfledged sequel.Grade B
