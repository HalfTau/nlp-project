Pretty much Brotherhood with more bombs.I got it on sale for five bucks so I dont really mind. The combat is more or less the same but with more gory killmoves. Overall, I find the game way too easy and theres all this extra stuff thrown in but I never wound up using any of it because its always easier to just stab everyone than to attempt any stealth or diversion tactics.The story kinda straight up sucks. Its over before it really begins and I didnt really even care when no spoilers one of the plot essential characters died near the end of the game because he only appeared for like a half hour of screentime total. It was also somewhat hard to follow, and I didnt feel like any of it really mattered to Ezios goal. On the bright side, Altairs story what little of it there was was great, though I was somewhat let down by the fact that Altair never wears the armor he made the invincible armor from AC2.The map is very bland as well. Its nothing but building after building with a river separating 1/5 of the map from everything else.Id recommend this game only if its on sale, your first assassins creed, or if you just want to finish Ezios and/or Altairs story. Otherwise, I wouldnt bother.
