Easily one of the best from the Assassins Creed franchise. Good gameplay , a story that will blow you away, combined with smooth graphics add to an amazing experience. A must buy for an Assasins Creed fan. Was completely satisfied with this even though the game only took about 15 hours to complete. 10/10
