I didnt like this game. The whole Assassins Creed series seems more and more pointless to me. The story has really turned for a worse since the ending of Assassins Creed II, now its just Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull kind of crap. In other words they nuked the fridge in the past and they try to do it again and again. The micro story Ezio in Istanbul is really flat, the meta story Desmond and the connections of it all is waaaay to silly/boring/meh.But the overall game could be good nonetheless IF the game werent that incredibly easy. I mean Assassins Creed 1 was easy counter killing most enemies, ..., Assassins Creed 2 was easy BUT had some fiercer enemies with polearms and, Assassins Creed Brotherhood took a turn for the worse If you hit me, Im gonna call my AC brothers to whoop you and in this game, you have this and that and bombs and superior armor and many healing potions, and even when you get down to zero health, you only get a warning You might die, heal quickly!, but you dont die you still can take 2 more swings by a blade before you really get desynched. And rifles... you get shot, and you only lose 2 to 3 health points? After that amount of time the AI rifleman needs to aim and really shoot at you it should take at least 50 of your health. There are even some pistol wielding guards who want to shoot you in close combat/melee range they aim at least 3 seconds before they shoot... they could touch you with their pistol tip but hey, better aim that thing before popping it!The easiness isnt all that game has only one real assassination, where you have to sneak up onto your target. All the other missions are run there, go there, get that, buy that, pick some flowers or climb a tower to look for a book... very meaningless, boring tasks, oddly disconnected from the story line. There was only one missions which I found to be enjoyable. And I enjoyed a lot of the missions / riddles in AC 1 and 2.
