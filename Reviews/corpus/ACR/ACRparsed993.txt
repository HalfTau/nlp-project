This Assassins Creed game has improved in some ways but also gone worse. The new bomb system is great and opens up for much more possibilities in the big world. The many options in the crafting system of bombs makes it  funny and interisting to craft a new kind of bomb ever time and try it out. However the towerdefence thing is awfull. It is boring and you have to do it more than once if you dont want to be follow by the templares all the time because the restricted area is increasing. This Assassins Creed game doesnt have as many side quest as the others which isnt the biggest problem but still sad they didnt just added some more. But I still think this game is great even though I didnt put in as many hours into it than the other Assassin Creed game because of the lack of side quests. In the end I didnt want to play towerdefence anymore so I stopped playing even if I havent completed the game 100.
