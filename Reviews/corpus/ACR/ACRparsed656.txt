The first downside is, this requires Uplay.Second, this is my only opnion about the game, if you dont like being spoiled, scroll to other Spoilerfree reviewsStoryline 7 / 10  Sometimes I dont even know what Im doing in Constantine, the storyline has almost, nothing to do with finding the key to open Altairs library Much shorter than its prequel, Assassins Creed Brotherhood and Assassins Creed II probably cuz theres not much to do in Contantine?Audio 8 / 10  Not the best, not badGameplay 8 / 10  Has its moments, the hookblade is good, but the Bomb Crafting is not an optionThe 120 possible bomb combinations means you combine this material with others, total there are about 9 types of bomb divided to 3 groups that you can mixed with other type of fuses and gunpowders and theres some type that youll never want to craftOverall 7.5 / 10, I suggest buying this game when its on sale, so far the highest sale is 50, and you should play its prequel  AC II and ACB
