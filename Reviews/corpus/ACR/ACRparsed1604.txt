The fourth release in the synchronisation failed... Im sorry I mean Assassins Creed series some of you will get that joke.  Again I highly recomend that people play this series from the start, the storyline is actually very well written, rather I should say storylines since there is more than one at play here must stop, spoilers.Aside from the usual bugs here and there what game doesnt have them? things like suddenly not being able to move past a certain spot because the floor tiles change just fast run, for some reason a very few spots get treated as if they were ledges and the usual hey I totally didnt jump sideways you did that moves this game is a lot of fun, especially if you like scaring everyone around while you scream at your screen a personal favorite of mine.The graphics continue to improve, well... except for Desmond hisself, theres just something about him and one other character he talks to that just doesnt look right, all the rest though, the character you play the ones you meet and the environment itself, very good.The puzzles you do get in this one can actually be figgured out without having to google what squiggly line matches the number this time to get past them, I mean Im reasonably smart, I dont stick my face in the fire to see if its hot or piddle on an electric outlet to see if its live, so most puzzles Im fine with except which squiggly line matches the number with no clues at all puzzles.In case youve read all this and are still scratching your head wondering wtf does this guy like the game or not, yes I do, so go play it already.
