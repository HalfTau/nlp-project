DrawbacksGraphics havent improved much from AC2 and Brotherhood. In fact, I noticed that there were a bit more glitches in this game than the previous ones.Newcomers to the series will definitely not benefit from starting with this one, but this has been an issue since AC2.Story and characters are not as engaging as the first 2 arcs of Ezios story. And the modern side to the tale gets more convoluted than ever.Good pointsThe setting of Constantinople is again beautifully crafted. Turn off the HUD and explore.The music is gorgeous, shame that this is Jesper Kyds last work in the Assassins Creed series.The multiplayer has improved and added new game modes. But you might be hard pressed to find a lobby nowadays.The bomb mechanics are quite nice and the hookblade as well.I would recommend this game only if you have liked Ezio and you want a conclusion to his side of the story.
