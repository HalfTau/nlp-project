Unnecessary cashgrab filler sequel. The good bits are an exact carbon copy of Brotherhood set in a slightly different but samey city. The few added mechanics are not worth it, sure now you can customize your own smoke poison bombs in a game that already has like 150 ways and weapons to kill things.The bad additions are a crappy tower defense mode which is just not fun, but fittingly the game treats it as a punishment. Hey, youve done too many bad things, now go and endure this horrible chore! The previous conspiracy puzzle bits have been replaced by annoying firstperson puzzle platformer sections that try to be Portal but fail. They reward you with bits of Desmond mumbling throwaway facts about his childhood, yaay.The plot isnt meaningful at all, nothing really happens and Im fairly sure you can just skip this game completely and none of the events will even be mentioned in the next one. There are some okayish flashbacks about Altars time but if youre one of the few who are interested in the silly overarching plot I am just check them on Youtube and save like 15 hours of tedium.If for some reason after spending 60 hours in the previous titles and having 100 completed them you are still not fed up with Ezio, sure, maybe then you can grab this one to do all of it again. Most people should really not bother. This wouldve been okay as an added DLC to Brotherhood that lasts a maximum of 5 hours, not a full game.
