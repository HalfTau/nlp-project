I will keep it short in order not to sound like broken record.If you liked AC II and Brotherhood, theres no reason Revelations should let you down you can also check my reviews of AC Brotherhood, since Revelations is very much like it with minor new things here and there, like bullet time moments and zip line actions. In certain areas this title surpasses previous two in the department of epic moments. The game is still a bit grindy, but beautiful location in Constantinople makes up for it. This is also great continuation of Altair and Ezio story and great ending for Ezio trilogy.
