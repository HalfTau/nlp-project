One of the best Assassins Creed games both in the aspect of a great story and gameplay.This game is the end of Ezios storyline and honestly they couldnt have made it better, infact the end of the game shed tears in my eyes.The game introduces a hook that Ezio uses to get up buildings faster and it makes the game that much more enjoyable. You also have a wide selection of bombs and a parachute that you can use for your advantage.The climbing in this game feels less wonky than for example AC III which always made you climb buildings when you were near them which was annoying...This game is definetly a must own to an Assassins Creed fan and it is also suitable to the new fans of the series.
