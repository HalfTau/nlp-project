Every time I play a new Assassins Crees Game it gets better and better. There are more variaety in the missions and the story keeps getting better and better.I love the fact we can see all Ezio Auditores life as an assassins since the AC II.However i found more fun to play the AC Brotherhood than this one. Its still an awesome play and fully recomended.
