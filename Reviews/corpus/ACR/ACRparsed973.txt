For some reason the game doesnt save. The cloud save doesnt work and neither does my local save. Ive played this game 3 times now and every time I made progress I would quit and nothing was saved. Even though the auto save was working. Does anyone have a fix to this problem or know where I can get my saved files? I REALLY like this game but I dont want to play if I keep losing my progress.
