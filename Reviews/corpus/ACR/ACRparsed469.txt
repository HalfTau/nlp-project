Get that unpopular opinion puffin/penguin/whatever that memes name here, AC Revelations is my favorite AC. Great graphics improvement, top gameplay preAC III and so on , and a little mash of tower defense. Get your favourite assassin Ezio in his old days, and get Altairs full story revelated, in the centre of the old world, Istanbul/Konstatinopoli. Great reconstruction of the city, beautiful buildings for an acquired taste and good ambience. Wish they could replicate the feel of this game to future AC installment.
