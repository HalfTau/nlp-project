Its really good because it keeps everything that made Assassins Creed II and Assassins Creed Brotherhood great and added new elements to gameplay like the hookshot that allows for faster climbing and ziplines that allow for faster travel around the city.  It also explains the history of Altair and how Desmond, Altair, and Ezio are all connected.  Assassins Creed Revelations is not a perfect game however.  Its too short with the campaign being only about 1011 hours.  Also the setting in Constantinople is not as fun and scenic as the Italian cities or Rome, Florence etc.  I still would reccommend it to anyone whos played all the other Assassins Creed games.  I would give this game a 7.5/10.
