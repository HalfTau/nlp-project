Revelations feels like a completely different Assassins Creed game, mostly because of its atmosphere and the country it takes place in. At first it was a downside for me, but I started to like the change over time, although I still think that Brotherhood was better. I would recommend the game to people that really like the series, as it continues the story of Ezio, who also meets Altair from the first game and Desmond.Overall it is a good game, but it has three main flaws If you run it on Windows 10 it is very glitchy and unplayable, but fortunately its easy to fix as you only have to remove one file. Secondly the face of the main character was completely changed, what I will never understand and I think its unnecessary. Thirdly, I wish it was longer, as it is the shortest AC game.
