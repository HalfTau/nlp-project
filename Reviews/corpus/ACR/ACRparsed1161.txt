Possibly the best game of the Ezio Saga, because of the evolution of the main character. The game doesnt bring big changes like Assasins Creed 2, but it improves on it and Constantinople is a very interesting city to develop the final chapter of ezio. It is especially recommended after playing the two previous games to be able to enjoy it on its fullest.
