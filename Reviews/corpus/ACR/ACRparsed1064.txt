Very similar to the previous game, Brotherhood, with no significant improvements. The series is beginning to feel a bit stale, but not bad by any means. The story is ok, but a bit incohesive/random, like the last one. Great soundtrack. The game feels a bit shorter and the explorable world a bit smaller, a small pity and perhaps the result of Ubisoft rushing development. Certainly worth getting in a steam sale though.
