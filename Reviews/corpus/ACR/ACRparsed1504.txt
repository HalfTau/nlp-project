Its a fairly decent continuation of the AC2 storyline. Has a lot of backstory elements in the bonus stages that I enjoyed personally. Overall the game plays like any other AC game except with various grenades and equipment to use. Climbing is sped up with the hook blade and the game is solid. The strange tower defense mode is slightly pointless and easy to complete.
