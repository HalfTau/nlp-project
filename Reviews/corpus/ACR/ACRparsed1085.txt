ACRev is continuing from the ACBro which the story of the ancestor tell us now Ezio is going in adventure to reveal what Altair has left behind, as for Desmond, he is being trapped inside his mind after kiling Lucy in ACBro.Its definitely level up from the ACBro in terms of gameplay. Now you have many arsenal of weapon in your hand to assasinate the enemy. But, from the money to get mechanic is the same from ACII and ACBro.And in this ACRev, you will know Desmonds past and what happen to Altair after he defeat Al Mualim.I really recommended this game to other fan of AC and to all of you who want to play it. Even though Ezio is becoming old, his skill as an assassins is getting more polished.So its definitely worth to try.
