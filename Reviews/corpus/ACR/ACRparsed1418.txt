Assassins Creed Revelations is a sequel to the previous game Assassins Creed Brotherhood.Desmond has fallen into a coma state.

Now Desmond has to find a way to sync nexus so that he can regain his broken mind and get back to real life.Assassins Creed Revelations takes us into new atmosphere, the city of Constantinople, which is now has been renamed Istanbul by the Ottoman Empire. The gameplay offers the same gameplay with the previous game with some expanded aspect. The Assassins recruit system has been improved and the Assassins now perform better in combat. The environment has changed and wont feel the same anymore as youre now playing in the eastern part of Europe. Graphics and effects still feels the same except the change in environment settings. With the new setting, it makes the game feels different while still retaining the Assassins style of play. I recommend this.Rating 8/10
