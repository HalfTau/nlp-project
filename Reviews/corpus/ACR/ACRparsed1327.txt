I just cant do this anymore. Im like 9 hours in and Ive only found 3 of the 5 McGuffins. After stepping away for a couple weeks I have no desire to get back in to this. An introduction from some guy youve never heard of and I suspect never will again sets up a repetative mission structure that eventually turns in to a nextgen bomberman. This is broken up only by an awful tower defense mini game that I thankfully only had to do once because I always paid the heralds anytime I passed them. There are also different classes of enemies that attack you based on apparently nothing, which can lead to a pretty frustrating experience just trying to get around. And they still havent fixed the problem of flashing extremely specific instructions in the corner of the screen while youre being chased down or under a clock. You already have to know what all 20 buttons do plus the combinations you can get by holding one of them down, I dont have time for this. The whole thing felt really underbaked yet needlesly complex. If anything was revealed in the end Im sure I could find it on Youtube if I bothered to look.
