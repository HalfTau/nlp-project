Fantastic game and probably the best in the series. Beautiful realistic reconstruction of medieval Constantinople, with georgeous light effects, music and movielike camera, while preserving fully controlled 3D experience. Action, love, adventure, mystery and intelligent story. The best of the main character Ezio Auditore da Firenze in his mature age. Only few glitches in comparison to the other games in the series. Thanks to the atmosphere, cinematic action and intelligent story one of the best PC games ever. A must play experience. Dont forget to visit the inside of Hagia Sophia temple accessed only by fulfilling certain task!
