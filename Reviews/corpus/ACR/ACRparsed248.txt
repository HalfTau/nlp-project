Love the Assassins Creed franchise, but theres no way in hell Ill ever buy another PC version of any of their games.Ive dealt with the hilarious ragdolls, the sometimes unresponsive controls and random character movement, incredibly stupid AI, stretchy models, enemies dying in slowmotion even though youre in realtime, and incredible glitches that have forced me to restart the game. However, now Im at the 3rd Altair sequence and I just cannot finish the game...literally. At one point during the mission the game just crashes, for no reason. Ive reduced the graphics to their minimum settings, followed all of the supposed solutions online, and Im still not able to get past that part. Its such a shame too because its such a beautiful game, and the story is so intriguing.My suggestion is to just buy the console version where theres less of these issues and the game can actually be played to completion without any hassle.
