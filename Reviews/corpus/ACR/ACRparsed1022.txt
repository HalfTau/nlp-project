The controls on this game are useless for playing on a PC. Often Ive got locked into combat or Ive just had times when any command is completely ignored. Ive killed citizens and Ive no idea why, Ive died becuase all the suggested commands for breaking combat are useless and dont work. To be honest Im not even sure I have a clue what the ulitmate point of this game is I seem to get randam missions that didnt seem to fit any real coherent plan. Before anyone asks I have played this for quite some time, or rather Ive tried to, Ive saved the Sultans son or whatever he is and am currently on some silly mission chasing down a beggar women who even when I catch ON HER OWN WITH NO ONE NEARBY any attempt to hit her results in me killing some randam citizen who suddenly appears in reach. If I hadnt paid so little for this in the Steam sale Id be demanding a refund.
