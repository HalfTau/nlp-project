Good thin... No, lets go the other way. Bad things ACRSP.exe suddenly started to crash non stop. Apparently there is no solution to the problem based on lot of Googling, Reinstalling the game seemed to fix the problem for as long atleast it took me to finnish it. Getting some achivements with factions seemed next to impossible, even after Googling for them.Good things Everything else. Brilliant ending to a story that kept me glued to the chair.No doubt I will be returning to the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze some day in the future.
