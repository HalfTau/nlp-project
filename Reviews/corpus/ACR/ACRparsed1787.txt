Overall theyve done a great job continuing to improve the mechanics from game to game. This one is streamlined in a good way and has done away with the horse riding between cities, etc. You get in the action and stay there. The Desmond chapters have more in common with Portal, but If you liked Brotherhood youll like this one just as much.
