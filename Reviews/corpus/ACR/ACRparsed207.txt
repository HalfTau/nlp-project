Assassins Creed Revelations is a good game, but it just doesnt do enough. While Brotherhood managed to shrug aside the concerns of its parent franchises annual schedule, the developments in Revelations  in both plot and gameplay  feel like a quarterstep. Whats at the core is still undeniably brilliant  and the originality of the multiplayer overlooks any repetition concerns there  but it doesnt feel quite as engaging as it did in Brotherhood. Renovating a historical city while training an elite group of Assassins is still a satisfying endeavour  but Ezios last hurrah feels more like a stopgap than a next chapter in an otherwise fascinating series.
