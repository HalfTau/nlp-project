Join Ezio Auditore on his final journey, which will take you to goodold Masyaf and to another capital of the ancient Roman Empire, Constantinople. Not quite a revenge or liberation tale as the last 2 games, but a search for knowledge, left by Altair in a library built near the end of his extensive life. What will wait you inside? Thats for you to find out.Not only will you get to experience Ezios last chapter, but also control Altair for a second time during key moments of his life, from a young and humble apprentice to an old and wise Mentor. While I consider it to be the weakest of the trilogy, its not without its merits. The introduction and conclusion are among the best in the series and the characters are still interesting.Bombs are probably the biggest addition, and Ill just say they can be useful at times, because I usually dont bother tinkering with them. Constantinople, although beautiful from afar, didnt feel as varied or memorable as Rome, which is ironic, since it was so aptly named as the Crossroads of the World due to its cultural and religious diversity. I dont see the point in bringing back Brotherhoods system of cityrestoration, since the Ottomans have been there for some 60 years now. The fact that the fasttravel points are unlocked from the beginning doesnt leave much room for exploration, and Im generally against fasttravel right off the bat, since it doesnt feel earned.Despite these last few negative points, there is much enjoyment to be found here, especially if you liked Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood which you should finish before going into Revelations.
