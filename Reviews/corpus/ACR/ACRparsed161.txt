AC R is a decent and good looking game but it is too similar to its previous AC2 and AC B instalment and feels very repetitive if compared to previous chapters.Overall it is a good game that introduces some new solutions to the established gameplay and extends the world of AC series, but it feels extremely repetitive and doesnt really bring anything that players can feel excited aboutOverall 60/100
