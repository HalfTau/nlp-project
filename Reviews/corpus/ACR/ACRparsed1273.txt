Ubisoft has utterly dissapointed me with this junk they call a game. WHY? Because I cant even play it! Ive had multiple issues with the uplay app and once I finally got that working note I had to re download the game I tried booting up the game trough their stupid ing game launcher AND I GOT A CRASH REPORT MULTIPLE TIMES. Ubisoft needs to get theirtogether or let steam deal with running games on PC not them! Good thing this was on sale for 5 dollars or I would be rioting. UBISOFT.
