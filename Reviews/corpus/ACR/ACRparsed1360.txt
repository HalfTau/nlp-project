I totally love the AC series but this game is beyond redemption . So many bugs and so many glitches , not attended by Uplay or ubisoft or whatsoever . Lost 3 chapters of gameplay due to a craash and uplay not being able to restore the cloud saves , constatnt crashes , that make attempting to 100 the game basicly impossible. I was optimistic about uplay! at some point but now i despise it even more then GFWL seriously ubisoft start paying attention to the games and no attention to support , or youre gonna turn into EA at some point . You platform really sucks beyond comparison. Its sad that Im considering not playing a certain game just cause it runs through uplay..... Get yourstraight
