I had read it online somewhere and it is true  Assassins Creed Revelations is the best way of seeing off both Ezio and Altair. All good stories must come to an end and the superb character of Ezio, whom you played with since that first fistfight in the streets of Florence, all the way to the very last sequence in Revelations, could not have wished for a better ending.The game goes on as you might expect, though everything is again technically enhanced and better than in the previous installment. Ezio continues to be a spiffy, sharptongued and cavalier signiore, who blends beautifully into a superbly designed Ottoman Konstantinople, where you can feel as if in a real city, with markets, slums, palaces and all. Sure there are the continuing problems, such as guard intellect and the fact that they simply cant seem to remember that you were the guy who just now killed someone, and there is this new addition of bombs which is just a little bit too much, however all in all, the game delivers.The ending of the game, in how it is sequenced, and Ezios words both towards Altair and as to his own life, could not have been said better and although there is a sadness in seeing this great character leave, there is also the satisfaction that it simply could not have been done better. Congratulations Ubizoft on sending off one of the most beloved game characters ever in an appropriate and dignified manner.
