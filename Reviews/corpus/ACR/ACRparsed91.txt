This is, storywise, my personal favorite, so far, in the Assassins Creed franchise. Since I played this after playing the previous ones, I managed a connection with Ezios character that made me tear up at the end. Specially with the short movie, Embers.The playability is really good, with very little bugs, which I cant claim for the following titles. Im currently suffering, err, playing Assassins Creed Rogue and boy oh boy I want to smash my keyboard...Loved the mechanics. I find myself missing the parachute on later games...Anyway, love this game, love the city, love the language.
