I found this to be a pretty descent game though I would not pay the full price for it, if it were me i would wait for it to be on sale allthough thats just my opinion. This game had pretty good graphics and you can play it with an intel celeron although it will run somewhat slowly.  The storyline bored the hell out of me though except for the altair memories. I would say its okay although it completely severed itself from the storyline of the two previous games of the ezio trilogy.  Anyway if you want a game that is big on the storyline then go buy ac2 or ac3 because this game doesnt have much good story to it.  and if you want gameplay then ac4 is the way to go and if thats to expensive then ac brotherhood is the way to go. ac Assassins Creed
