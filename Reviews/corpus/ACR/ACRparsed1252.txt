Another good Assassins Creed game. Note that I wrote good instead of great or awesome. It has great potential, but it doesnt develop very well throughout the main plot.When buying this, expect to be entertained only by the story missions. Not having what to do except to follow the linearity of the game is a bit frustrating.Unlike 2 or Brotherhood, this installment isnt as long or extensive, in terms of gameplay time or maps. One has enough money, by the end, only to rebuild about 70 buildings and buy about 70 of what shops offer.The titles setting is Constantinople, which is big indeed, but the whole game is restricted to that ares, except for a few missions which take you to Masyaf or Capadoccia, which are small and not fully explorable, by the way. For movementation, the lack of horses on the city is another downside, as it could be a time saver and more interesting than the fasttravel system for many trips.On the other hand, Revelations earns new gameplay refinements. The addition of bombcrafting and using definitely makes for a better experience. There is also the new hookblade, which replaces your secondary hidden blade to make climbing easier, faster and more practical.Storywise, it wrapsup Ezio Auditores story in an interesting way. That is why one should first play Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood to know the main character better and have a better experience.Overall, Id recommend Revelations in case one likes the Assassins Creed series, but dont expect to be overwhelmed by the amount of content or excitement the assignments bring.
