Assassins Creed Revelations is definitely a good game and worth to play through, especially if one is interested in the Assassins Creed story in general like me. For me it was mostly fun. There was a very small amount of frustrating missions, but the overall gameplay fun was as known from the previous parts, only slightly improved here and there.The map and the locations are wonderfully detailed and very enjoyable as usual, but the buildings to climb in freeroam are not as fun and versatile as known from AC 2 and Brotherhood. There are parcour levels like in the prequels, but not as many and they are rather linear not bad, but not as big and challenging as in the prequels. As usual, there is much to do in freeroam like refurbishing shops, before they can be used, buying points of interest, capturing areas, training assassins and more. The story and the characters are well designed and left good memories behind.Its not so much about the present storyline unfortunately, mostly about Ezios time in Constantinople and you also get to play Altair in Masyaf a few times. It is not necessary that you have played AC 1, but if you did or at least know the story its more fun, because you can relate and connect the stories to each other. DO PLAY AC 2 AND Brotherhood before, though. They are both bigger and have things I missed in Revelations like these puzzle minigames, more secrets, present story, gorgeous parcour levels, .... If you dont like them, dont try Revelations.There are also some very abstract puzzleplatform levels for Desmond and, if you own the Lost Archive DLC, for Subject 16 these levels are completely optional and do not integrate into Ezios gameplay. They are quite challenging at some points and tell you about Desmonds live before AC 1 and about Subject 16s live. These are recommendable if you like experimental or indie puzzle platformers or if you are interested in the story. I recommend you playing AC 1 before, though, for the story.
