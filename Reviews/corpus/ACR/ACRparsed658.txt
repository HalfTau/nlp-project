Amazing game. Honestly the best out of all the games Ive played so far everything from AC1 onward.It refines all the elements from the previous games and combines them with a very compelling story especially if youve played the previous games, amazing soundtrack and beautiful cinematics.Definitely a must have if youre a fan of RPGs.
