This was my favorite AC game out of I thru III. The mechanics of the Ezio games were finally perfected with the hookblade and the bomb crafting made combat interesting also. Getting money is a bit harder in this game, but if you invest in shops and treasure maps early on, its okay.The best part of this game was the story, which is an element Ubisoft has neglected in later installments of this franchise. Ezios character development over his 3 games trumps any other AC protagonist yet. Altairs chapters give him a lot more depth than the initial AC I story did also.The graphics are good, the map is easy to get around, and the game is quite enjoyable all around.
