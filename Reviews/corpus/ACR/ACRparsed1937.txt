Ive always dreamed of being an Assassin whose charms rivals that of Casanova and that  comes true in Assassins Creed Revelations.  I still have that Disability of jumping off roofs like a someone committing suicide, when it should be a swan dive into a cart full of hay but thats not the games fault...I think!
