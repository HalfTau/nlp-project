An epic conclusion to and Epic series for Ezio Auditore.However this game made me waste half of my gametime trying to finish challenges and achievements that were bugged and or by farming money long after the game was finished. A perfectionists nightmare.The multiplayer is as awful as last game. Since you will have to go all the way to lvl 20 to unlock the Uplay award you will tear your hair apart because of how unbalanced it is. That is if you even have the luck to find anyone to play against.
