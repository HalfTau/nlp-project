Assassins Creed Revelations is the climax of the Ezio trilogy and the second the last game in the Desmond storyline. The graphical jump from Brotherhood to Revelations is not only significant, Revelations features the highest incitymobility and most importantly climbing speed of all and any Assassins Creed games so far. Its probably also the reason why they took the hookblade out of the series again, as it made climbing too fast at times.Revelations still looks adorable six years later and it plays absolutely fantastic. Personally I also liked the maturity of main story dialogues compared to the earlier games. Probably one of my favourite AC experiences.
