A fitting end to the Assassins Creed II storyline that nicely wraps up many questions, fills in much needed details, and leaves you wondering where things will go next. The Den Defense minigames, a towerdefense style minigame, are an interesting addition to the various activities youll find around the city. I did miss the larger environments and the horses, but honestly, they didnt add much to the game. The Assassins Apprentice missions really add more character to the Brotherhood concept that the last game brought to the table, and really serve to make you form a bit of a bond with each of the assassins you recruit, rather than just more fodder for you to throw at guards. The firstperson Desmond missions were boring and repetitive and barely provided any story for the amount of time spent just to unlock them, then by plodding through the yawninducing puzzles. Id rather theyd expanded on or done something similar to the previous games modernday Monteriggioni sequence
