The best thing about this installment of Assasains Creed is the setting, art style and the optional minigame but everything else is very linear and short. This is my least favorite so far of the AC series.Everything of AC brotherhood is in Revelations with a different setting and tid bits of Altairs last days. I only wanted to complete Revelations because I was interested in the story and wanted to know how it connected and everything else just was time wasters.If you play AC for the action this is the same of the previous. If you play it for the story, you can skip this one, its very short and can be sumed up in a small video.
