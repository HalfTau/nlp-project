I have mixed feelings about this game. Though I had tons of fun and loved every minute of it, it just feels like an Assassins Creed Brotherhood 1.5. Improved graphics, tweeked gameplay, better multiplayer, and one of my favorite gaming soundtracks to date, it is a solid entry to the franchise. Yeah, it feels a little bit rushed and though the story is good, you can tell Ubi is stretching it. Some new elements are a welcome addition bombs and others missed the mark horribly Tower Defense anyone?. Good game overall.
