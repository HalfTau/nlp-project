BEWARE YOUR SAVED GAME IS NOT SAFE.Im an fan of the Assassins series. I wanted to move through the storyline. Im busy, so Im on Revelations after finishing its predecessors. I got 3/4 of the way through this game and suddenly my saved game is GONE. Cloud backup? I keep reading yes  but its simply not.Strongly STRONGLY recommend steering clear of this one!
