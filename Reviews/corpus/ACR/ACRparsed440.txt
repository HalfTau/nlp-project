Great game! The finale of Ezio was perfect and the ending was Genius!Every game has problems though and this is lacking the desmond portion which I really liked in previous games and they made it optional and also I found the game was a litte too short but other than that great characters, fun gameplay and underground parkour levels which amazed the hell out of me.9/10
