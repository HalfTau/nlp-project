Im not sure if I should recommend this game. This game has some major advantages the combat system is intact, additionally you get the absolutely amazing hook blade and bomb making system. Some characters are very interesting, like Prince Suleiman and Sofia. Music is brilliant, especially the main AC Theme that plays in the main menu. Also, Istanbul and Cappadocia are marvelous locations and are fun to explore. Unfortunately, the drawbacks are probably too big. Storyline starts interesting, but then gets very predictible and not very... revealing. And if you like Altair, then you would probably not like scenes with him and ending at all. The whole ending sequence is just very dull and unimaginative. The whole game just feels like it was built on something great, but actually managed to turn it into something boring. Also, just a warning Ezios face looks very very very old and Desmonds face looks nothing like Desmond. I also played AC3 and I must say, both those games have issues with faces, which just look very altered and unfamiliar. In the end, though the game has some great points, I would not recommend playing it, nor AC3 and not even AC4. If you really love this franchise, like I do, and not have a major letdown, I would strongly suggest to finish it with ACBrotherhood.
