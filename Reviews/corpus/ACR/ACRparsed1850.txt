This was yet another fantastic Assassins Creed game. The game series just keeps getting better with every new release. If you enjoy very large and immersive environments, and medieval type combat with an emphasis on stealth without any limitations, you should definitely consider this game along with its previous releases. If you enjoy the genre, this game should be an easy choice. Id give it a 9.5 out of 10.
