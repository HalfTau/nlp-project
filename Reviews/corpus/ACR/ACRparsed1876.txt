Ezio is getting old, but is showing no signs of weakness. The final chapter in the ACII spinoffs goes out with... not that great of a bang. To say this game is worth 50 dollars is a longshot, but fans of the series will have long time questions answered. However, they will soon be replaced by more questions. All in all, if youre a fan of Assassins Creed, you will find some repitition in this one, but at the same time, there is enough good to make you want to keep playing.
