Revelations is not as good as AC 2 or Brotherhood but I still love this game mainly because of how well it closes Ezio and Altairs story. This game has a lot of great moments, some of the best in the whole franchise. These very well done character moments with both Ezio and Altair as well as great action set pieces such as the first hour of the game or the tombs of the Masyaf keys make this game very memorable.  A lot of the story missions and side plots feel like filler and it is not very interesting which brings this game back a lot as well as the additions that the series didnt need like the tower defense and bomb crafting. Even though Constantinople is a great setting for this game its not as interesting or memorable as the previous games settings. These problems stop this game from being amazing but I still consider it to be a great game and it closes off the Ezio trilogy perfectly.8/10 Great
