Another incremental refinement on the Assassins Creed formula. The dispatch quests and clan recruitment features return from AC Brotherhood, and now theres ne Tower Defense style Hideout Defense segments, for better or worse.Multiplayer is similarly expanded on, with more and better gamemodes, new maps and custimazation options, and better postmatch voting and party continuation options. Unfortunately, the multiplayer still follows a Call of Duty style leveling and perks system, and the EXP curve can be frustratingly low  meaning youre not going to get to use the toys you see everyone else with until youve put a decent amount of time into the game.Basically, its another yealry AC release, and it manages to add just enough to the experience to stave off boredom for maybe one more year. Just in time to leave behind Ezios story for AC III.
