Despite adding a number of features, Assassins Creed Revelations is very similar to its predecessors, and thats both its biggest strength and weakness. Theres nothing wrong with Assassins Creed. Its a great franchise with unique, compelling and welldesigned gameplay. The catch is that weve effectively been doing similar things for the last several years now. Incremental upgrades are more than welcome, but at some point players need a new experience.That said, Revelations serves its lead characters well and is a very effective bookend. The improvements in graphics and storytelling, combined with alreadygreat voice acting and music, help make this a memorable finale for some of the most interesting video game characters Ive seen.If youve been following the lives of Altair and Ezio this long, you owe it to yourself to see their last adventure.
