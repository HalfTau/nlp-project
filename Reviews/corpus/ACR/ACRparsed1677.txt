Maybe one of the most memorable and diffcult experiences in the ac franchise.Economy system is not as easy as it used to be, thus making the game more challenging to complete. But the key elements are all there. Awesome story, epic graphics and a nice conclusion to the assassin saga of the middle ages. So far after ac 1 revelations is the best this series has to offer without having played 3. To all ac fans its a treasure to behold!!!
