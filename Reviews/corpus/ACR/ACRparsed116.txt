I love the Assassins Creed games dearly. The graphics, the atmosphre created ingame, I find the story intriguing and the character absolutely well written. Another thing that works for me is that the game is not so hard, as to take away the desire of moving forward in the story,  but neither is it too easy  it still offers up a challenge here and there. I am very much looking forward to discovering the later games once this one is done! Yes, keyboard controls arent ideal, but you can do just fine without a controller and I am not the best of gamers but any means.
