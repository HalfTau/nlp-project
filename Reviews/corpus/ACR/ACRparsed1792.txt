The single player is fun and addictive, but the multiplayer leaves much to be desired on multiple aspects. I played all the way through the single player without hesitation and had alot of fun doing it, but I quit the online play after a week. If you are into the Creed series or stealth oriented games, the single player mode is well worth the money.
