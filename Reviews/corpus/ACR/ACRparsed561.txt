The game itself is a blast. I played Brotherhood and AC2 and those were some of the most fun Ive ever had in a video game. This continues the trend parkour, thrilling swordfights, a dashing Italian protagonist What more could you ask for?Well.The reason Im giving this a downvote, and the reason I deleted it from my hard drive, is because the game will not run unless you create an account on Ubisofts own app, Uplay.Aside from the fact that Uplay has so far proven to be clunky, buggy, and unappealing, I resent on general principle having to register AGAIN to prove ownership of a game I have ALREADY LEGALLY PURCHASED from Steam. In the age of everincreasing piracy, companies can either place trust in their user base or not, treat them like customers or potential criminals. Ubisoft seems to prefer to treat players as potential pirates, and insists that I place this useless bloatware on my computer.So if you really want to play Assassins Creed Revelations, go ahead its a great game and it might well be worth it to play all the way through. I wouldnt know. I unfortunately also bought other Assassins Creed titles during the same Steam sale where I purchased this onehowever, I will not be buying another one, and I will urge others to do the same. Because I shouldnt have to spend an hour wrestling with a thirdparty app to play a game I already own.
