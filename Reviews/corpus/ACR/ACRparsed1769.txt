Revelations feels like a true progression to the Assassins Creed franchise, expanding on everything that was new in brotherhood, but giving it purpouse and depth. Assassin recruits are given more meaning, as once you level them to 10, you can assign them to a den and begin a mission with them in which you actuall interact with your recruits. Gaining recruits seems some similarly unique missions, as aposed to the simple defend the civilian from Brotherhood, which still exists but in lesser numbers. Missions for your rEcruits also has a purpose, letting you gain control of other reagions of the world while you work towards your goals in Constantinople.The story is much richer in Revelations, and ties up loose ends, and gives a very satisfying conclusion to both Ezio and Altairs storylines. Desmonds story is progressed only slightly, but some of his backstory is filled in, more than him actually making any forward progression in the over arching plot.The new setting is refreshing from ACII and Brotherhoods focus on Italy, and the new characters you meet are easier to connect with, and care about than in previous titles.The new hookblade adds some much needed precision and functionality to freerunning, and adds some speed to vertical transitions. Finishing animations add a lot to combat, and might actually make you stick around and fight a pack of guards instead of running away and hidding.All in all, this s the best game in the Ezio trillogy, and in the first 4 games.
