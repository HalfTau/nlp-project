Gee... What to say about this one? Im already running out of ideas and it is only game number 4 out of 14 or so and I heard complains about the Call of Duty franchise repeating itself.Ezio Manlyman Auditore da Firenze de la Jolla Cardinal strikes again  just  not that fast anymore. Ezio struggles a bit since you are playing an very old version of him. He had his best days behind him and still he is able to do all the crazy stuff you did in the other games Phew! what an relief.Ezio already gave the bloodline to the next generation and in the end when you meet the spoiler you go wandering yourself why a spoiler is talking to you and b how Raymond main Character... remember is able to see his Grandfather at this point when the Ani..machine is taking him back to his genetic memorys in the first place if future is not predicted, which if so happen to be would make no sense for any conversation between him and spoiler in the first place... or maybe Im just loosing interest and want to play Death from above on every enemy in the game like before.8/10 Is it me or is the gamingexperience getting worse?
