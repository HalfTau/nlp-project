TLDR If youre a die hard fan of the franchise, this is a great game to get on sale. With an average completion time of 12 hours based onand lots of collectibles for you completionist junkies, you should have a great time. The level design is on point, and the cities are anything but boring. But I found myself lost in the plot in a notgreat way.I must a cardinal sin  I never played the first Assassins Creed. Because of this, I felt as if the Altair storyline felt shoehorned  and out of place. I found that they tied up Ezios storyline quite well, but it would have been even nicer if they should have somehow made a transition into their third installment into the franchise. Desmonds line was also too short and not memorable. Characters were also nothing of the ordinary, but it was neat to see a grizzled Ezio well into his 50s60s leaping towers like a Parkour Youtuber.Without stepping on spoiler territory, the storylines and objectives were a bit muddled. However, I found myself forgetting less about my objectives and more into the rich map design. Its showcased in its entirety by lengthy and enjoyable missions. One quip from a design standpoint  both stealth and assault are favoured, though there are missions that are stealth only. For the most part, the designers respected these divergent playstyles.The most common criticism in the game would be its wonky minigames tower defence missions were painfully slow and poorly choreographed. Im inclined to agree.Though the campaign alone is worth the price of admission, stealthloving players that favour the covert stylings of Splinter Cell multiplayer games will sink some hours into it despite a poor userbase because of age.
