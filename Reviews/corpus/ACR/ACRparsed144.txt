Wont work in my PC with a Nvidia GTX980. Graphic stuttering makes the game unplayable. Id steer away from this game if you have the same card. I wish I know before I got it. Shame, as I have many other Assasins Creed games and other Ubisoft games. I just dont have the patience anymore to rip apart my graphics card, settings, drivers and use other tools to get an old game to work properly.This game goes in the trash.
