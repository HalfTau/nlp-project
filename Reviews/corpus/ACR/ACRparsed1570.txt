Revelations made me sad because its the end of the Ezio trilogy. It was well worth the purchase and I liked the gameplay. They added a whole new bomb feature to the game so u can place trip mines and other neat bombs. The only thing I dont like in this one is the tower defense system they added to it. I get they wanted to try something new out but Im glad they dont keep it in for the rest of the series.
