WARNING If you see reviews telling you UPlay is annoying, or horrible, or that it sucks the life out of everything, believe them.As for Assassins Creed Revelations, if I could get UPlay to connect and let me on at least once, I would know what the game is actually like. However, since I cant even get the game to play the 4.4 hours it says I have on the game are the hours I spent trying to get past UPlays login screen, I cant give it a positive review. I had no idea if its as fun as others claim, because after paying for my game on Steam, I have to log in to UPlay for who knows what reason. And unfortanately for me, UPlay has no idea what an internet connection is. I looked up what other people did about this problem and lots of people have this problem, tried various fixes, but ultimately was denied access. Opening ports, rebooting my computer in safe mode, closing all other applications... nothing worked. If I can fix it in the future, after my frustration has died down and I reinstall the game, I will likely change my review to a positive one. Until then, remember that UPlay is horrible.EDIT A friend recommened I use my iPhones hotspot to login to UPlay, and it worked! I have finally been able to start playing the game. If you havent been able to get through UPlay, try using a hotspot. I hope this helps someone!
