Is the one of nicest series from the  Assassins Creed franchise. Have a great storyline with some historical value eventhough its fiction, CMIIW. Very cool to play, animation when fighting is one of the most interesting stuff on this game. Various customization in single player when increase Ezio performance and ability is so challenging. In multiplayer aspect I think is good game. Interesting to play. Unfortunately in multiplayer we cant change our side. We always be templar on this series. Visual graphics is so wonderfull but not the best. But its no matter, because we can play without loss our performance. For sound effect...is very nice too. I love for the background music. Very touching. Appropriate with Istanbul/Constantinople circumstances. Overall I can give score for this game  90 of 100. Well done ubisoft, thanks for steam.
