I sort of recommend and dont recommend this game..The game itself in terms of gameplay is brilliant! the storyline is interesting to follow as you uncover Ezios Assassin Ancestory, resulting in a fantastic finale in the trilogy.However, I do not know if its just me, but theres something thats just not quite right about the PC version. The game can look fantastic with the graphics cranked up to ultra, but the constant frame dips are unbearable. No matter what refresh rate I have the game set on, it seems to dip about 3040 FPS every 30 seconds. 144 down to 90, 60 down to 30. I also tried turning off 4 of my 6 cores, which does help quite a bit, but was still a little iffy which left me unsatisfied. Probably should note I have heard of rolling back the drivers of your graphics card can help, but Im way too lazy for that.So I got a refund.But if youre committed to fixing the performance issues, the game is 100 worth it in terms of gameplay, story telling and a fanstastic bow out to a character with an amazing story arc.
