I was going to write a short joke of a review but this time I was so impressed by the game that I had to take a serious tone. I am genuinely impressed by how much this game has to offer. It is not so much a revolutionary improvement of the AC formula but instead a perfection of almost every single mechanic in the game. Since this is the fourth game in the series you can clearly tell that they have had a lot of time to improve and polish every detail of their now distinct form of combat, stealth, freerunning and so on.Although the combat is still pretty much the same as in brotherhood the animations have been cleaned up and a lot of new ones added. This makes the combat feel very fluid and the addition of the hookblade makes for some extremely awesome and brutal finishing moves. Even though this is still the same parry and counter based combat from the previous games, it has been polished to perfection and is the best the series has ever seen.This game does a great job of tying up the stories of Ezio and Altair leaving you with a very satisfying conclusion and setting up for a new assassin in the next game. The storytelling mechanics that the game employs are superb and make use of inception like memories inside of memories. This is complemented by a less exiting but still interesting story about the sultans of Constantinople and their struggle for power. While this may not be as good as the conspiracies of the second game, it serves as a well fitting background for the main story of Desmond and Ezio.In my honest opinion this is my favorite AC game so far and well worth your money.
