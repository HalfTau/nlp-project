You think Ubisoft went allafter Unity? Well nope. This game along with the other previous ones has a very  terrible patch. I played this game with an i7 Radeon R7 m260 8gb RAM and i only got 6 fps. It just lag so much with so many bugs. And considering this is the worst game of the ezio trilogy in terms of settings, design, and story. Its just isnt worth your money AT ALL!
