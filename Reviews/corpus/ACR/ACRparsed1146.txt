Cool story, cool setting, cool new things to do and new weapons to your arsenal. Id give it a 9/10, because it is too short for my taste. I fully played brotherhood in 40 hours, 2 in 30 hours and this one in 26, so its a little smaller.But nonetheless its a very epic game with amazing graphics.Sadly it is the end of the story of Ezio and Altar. But theyve worked it out brilliantly, good work Ubisoft.
