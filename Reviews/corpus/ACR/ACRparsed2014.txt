Revelations singleplayer portion is the shortest amongst all Assassins Creed titles, which only took me approximately 4 hours to finish. The game has great voice actors, but the characters are limited by poorly structured cutscenes, and facial animations were often too unnatural to ignore.Thankfully, Ubisoft has successfully refined the multiplayer portion. New unlocks, character customization options and the return of some Brotherhood maps are very nice additions. In fact, Revelations multiplayer gameplay is probably the only factor that redeemed this title the privillege of being called an Assassins Creed game.
