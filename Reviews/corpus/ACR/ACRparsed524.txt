This was the first assassins creed game I have ever played. the first one on pc being ac brotherhood. I originally played this on the Xbox 360 then some time passed and i got into pc gaming and when i bought this and played it through to the end. I wasnt disapointed. I even teared up a little bit because i was so emotionally invested into the characters. That may be because this was my first game that i actually loved... the single player was byodiful, graphics were very nice and i could even run it at about 60 fps on my  computer which was suprising. The multiplayer was tough to get a grip on but i got the hang of it eventually.
