Man, that surely was emotional! The ending forced a bit of tears out of my eyes youll see why if you choose to buy this game!Although Revelations is definitely a lowpoint in the Ezio Trilogy AC2, AC B, AC Revelations, it is a GREAT game and you should still get it, especially if you have played the first two Ezio games. Here we goEzio Story 4/5Desmond Story 3.5/5Gameplay although the game was almost seamless, there are rare glitches to be found, which foreshadows AC Unity, such as a citizen having a sudden seizure, or one of your fellow assassins suddenly climbing an invisible ladder in the sky after I threw one of my knives into him while he was climbing a ladder...anyways 3/5Music I must include this, because a lot of emotions, especially sadness came over me while playing Revelations 4.5/5Aesthetics/Overall atmosphere of the game once you get used to the fact that the Borgia guards are now Ottomans and Byzantines BTW, the setting is great! 4/5Total grade/rating 19/25 76/100  76  technically a C, but I would personally say BOther ratings, in my opinion just in caseAC2  AAC B  AGet it. As Palpatine once said Do it.Also, this game is shorter than the previous two.EDIT 7/6/2017 The open world gets interesting only after returning to the game after the first couple of playtimes/throughs. Only then does Constantinople and Cappadocia slowly reveal their charm.
