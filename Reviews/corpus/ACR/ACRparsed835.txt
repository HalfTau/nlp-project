I absolutely love this Assassins Creed.Best gameplay in my opinion out of the lot and small inovations that work really well. Its a shame the franchise has broken down alot lately scince Assassins Creed 3. Im sure alot of people enjoy the ships part of the games but me, it just doesnt seem like much of an Assassin thing to be doing.Anyway,Assassins Creed Revelations still stands up very well and it is without a doubt my favourite of the franchise so far !! !
