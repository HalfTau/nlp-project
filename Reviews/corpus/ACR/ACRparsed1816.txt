Easily the weakest game in the series. Too many gameplay elements are forced in that have no place in AC. This results in a very long and tedious tutorial and a very easy game.Even during puzzles and forced action sequenses the camera points out exactly where to go. For a puzzle I spend some time figuring out how to go about crossing the room, but it turned out all I have to do is hold free run  W and watch. Dont try deviating from your preaproved path, free running, but not free.The story is generaly weak or at some points just downright stupid, the only redeeming part is is a good ending. If youre willing to do annoying first person platforming theres more backstory to discover but I simply found the platforming way too annoying, partly due to the terrible controls and no way to change them.The game is still reasonable in the end but mainly due to being based on AC2, it only substracts from that base.If you are a fan of the series youll likely pick this up at a sale anyway, but for newcomers to the series this would be a very bad introduction get AC2 instead.
