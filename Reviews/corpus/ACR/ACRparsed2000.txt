The fact that as many as 7 Ubisoft Studios have been working on this game, makes the fact that this is the worst game in the series even harder to bear.The story is great, but the game has been dumped down in every other way. The Virtual Trainings has been replaced by short tutorials on how to throw a knife or a bomb... The horses are completely nonexistent, except for some horses pulling carriages in specific interactive cutscenes. The right hand hidden blade has been replaced by a so called Hook Blade that replaces the Leap Jump. Basically, the Hook Blade works like Leap Jump, but allows you to reach longer. However, you can only do it where the Hook Blade is able to reach, and no longer whereever you want. This removes the ability to jump straight up, and then reach your arms to a side to grab a ledge.Theyve added a new type of enemy that cannot be killed, except with counters. And they attack once in ten years, so you become extremely frustrated fast.Continued in comments
