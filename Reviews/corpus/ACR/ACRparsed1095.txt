Another Assassins Creed game!I will never stop fawning about the masterpiece that is Assassins Creed 2, and Brotherhood was a nice touchdown celebration/victory lap for all the fans of AC2. However, Revelations is the third game on the same character who already did all his most important stuff in AC2, and the pilot of that character who is now trapped in a recursive stack overflow and has to do unneccesary tasks to regain his body.Gameplay is unchanged from AC2 and Brotherhood, with the exception of some horrible first person platformers that you can more or less ignore, and a tower defense game that you really only have to do once. Istanbul/Constantinople in the 16th century was an exciting place where cool stuff happened but you really dont get much of a feeling of that. The open sprawling area of rome where you can ride horses into battle in the streets is gone, the main characters have little to add and the ending that the entire game builds to from the end of the tutorial is little more than a rambling introspection.In short, the game is good but is a pile of wasted potential.
