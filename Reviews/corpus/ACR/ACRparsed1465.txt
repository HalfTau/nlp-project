Yet another installment of the Assassins Creed series of course, Desmonds story continues after the unexpected ending in Brotherhood and this time he relives the last chapter of Ezios memories and like Rome in Brotherhood, Constantinople is where all the events take place in this game.Most of the features on this game are taken from Brotherhood like the fighting, economy, recruitment, etc. Of course, it has some changes to some of them, but to its core are the same as Brotherhood. One of the highlights about this game is you get to know more about Altair from the first game.Like all Assassins Creed this one is no different about telling a good story. Like the previous AC installment there is a lot of things to along the way like additional missions to the main, etc.A good improvement are graphics and how the everything looks going from the world to the character models you should be able to find a lot of detail through all the game. As the previous games the music is and it keep being really good and it fits perfectly to what happens.A clearly great improvement to this game was the multiplayer which was improve in good ways compared to the previous, which of course introduces new modes to play, which feels fresh in the PVP multiplayer world, not the classic run with your gun and shoot everything moving kinda multiplayer is all about style and how you eliminate your targets. Lots and lots of rewards, challenges and even more context to the Templars background.Also, if you got the Lost Archives DLC you will be able to know more details about Desmonds story, like what his past was and some other stuff this may add some context if you want to know more about the characters Ill say it will be like an hour or hour and a half of extra content.Bottom line, if you like the Assassins Creed series, this one will probably be something you like so, what are you waiting for? get that hidden blade a target and go for it!...
