Not nearly as long as AssII or AssBro, but still a vital piece to the puzzle that is theseries. I found the addition to fill in the backstory between the original and this title to ber thoroughly engaging and entertaining. The economic side of the game is rather weak with a buggy income system that resets the income timer every time you start or finish any mission. But its easily worked around, and as I alluded to earlier, the storyline was well done.A great purchase for fans of the series, short but worth any sale price!
