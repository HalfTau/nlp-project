Assassins Creed Revelations is one of the weakest points in the series, but it doesnt mean its bad, the game just mostly focuses on story instead of gameplay. It is about the final days of our assassins Ezio and Altair. This game kinda made me feel old and experienced just like Ezio after climbing the same tower in the same generic city and fighting the same guards with the same strategies.ProsHook bladeAssassins Guild got improved with a personal story for each assassinTower defence minigame to protect your guild headquartersEconomic got some balancingExperimenting with ingredients to create bombsStory focused on two main characters Altair and Ezio, also reveals a few things about DesmondMultiplayer continues to improve with a story elementNostalgic momentsTons of revelations1st person puzzlesConsSame combat systemGeneric and not memorable cityFeels like a story fillerScore8/10
