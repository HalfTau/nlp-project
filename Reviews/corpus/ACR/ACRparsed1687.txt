A bit buggy and arrogant Lost Archives has no sound,  the achievements are not integrated into steam, it has its own 3rd party ubidrm, you have to enter every key into the game and the launcher no integration there either, and not even ctrlv works ingame.So business as usual for Ubisoft who the  cares about the customer?Yet another Ubisoft game where you are better off with a pirated version. sigh
