whether you are playing this game for ezios story conclusion or just for the gameplay . you wont be disappointed .the story is 10/10 .we followed ezio from birth to death and shared so many memories with him it feels as if he existed in realitythe gameplay is 8/10 .nothing particularly noticable about the fighting system it has improved a bit from brotherhood and assassins creed 2 . the hook blade brought a certain unique aspect to the gameplay , defending dins and sending your recruits on missions was a nice side game to have . however crafting bombs and all the complications that come with them was not something i liked . just my personal opinion . a simple smoke bomb would have done it .
