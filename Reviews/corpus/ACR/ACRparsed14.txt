Assassins Creed Revelations helps to tie up the story line of Assassins Creed II and Brotherhood. It further refines the systems pioneered in the earlier games while offering a welcome overhaul on the notoriety system. The game isnt in any way ground breaking but is a fun diversion for those who are a fan of collectathons and murder.
