The game itself is amazing, the graphics, the story, the gameplay ... its all really good. The multiplayer isnt really good, but thats not the main selling point of the game. But I cant recommend the game for one simple reason THE MOTHERFCKING BTCH A UPLAY! I hate this Ubisoft garbage! In order to play the game Steam launches Uplay! WTF?!Well ... I enjoy the game, but for the love of all gamers Ubisoft PLEASE DELETE UPLAY!
