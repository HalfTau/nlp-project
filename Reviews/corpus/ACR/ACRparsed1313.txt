After 37 hours of Assassins Creed Revelations, this game is amazing just like any other Assassins Creed game! Though, not as good as 3 or Brotherhood, far better then the first. I truly enjoyed and it was far more cinematic than the other games before it. Though, I did have one problem with it and that was there was not as much to do compared to 3 or Brotherhood. More than 1 or 2 but still not enough. I still highly recommend this game to anyone for sure! The Lost Archive DLC last two pictures were really really shocking if you pay any attention to the main modern story line.
