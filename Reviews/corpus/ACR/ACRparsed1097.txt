10/10PLUS Great ending to the saga of Altair and Ezio. Beautiful graphics of Istanbul, amazing characters and very cool missions. The ending is absolutely perfect, creative and touching!Game runs smoothly of my PC and looks better than AC3 and Black Flag withot high tech requirement!MINUS The game doesnt improve anything nor does it add fresh things, but it doesnt have to. It continues the saga and give a perfect finish to the story of previous AC games.
