My personal favourite of the Assassins Creed series. I love the way the recruit system works in this game. You eventually get a dozen recruits, some of which you personally train into becoming Master Assassins. The story is interesting and keeps you guessing. Some interesting sidequests and minigames here and there. Den Defense is pretty compelling and there are lots of things to collect and find. The very definition of what an Assassins Creed game should be!
