THIS IS A MUST READ I promise!!! This game is really good but if the first assassins creed game you played was AC3assassins creed 3 then i advise you to buy AC4 blackflag next. The reason why is because the controls are different from AC3. The graphics are good, the story line is okay and there are other thing you have and can do in AC Revelations that you cannot in AC3. I rate AC Revelations a 4 stars.
