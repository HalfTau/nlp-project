As a fan of the series it pains me to say I was not very impressed with Revelations. The game was not bad, but it did absolutely nothing new compared to Brotherhood. I have no MP experience, so maybe thats where it improved. Otherwise this is just Brotherhood with some stuff tacked on. The upgrades to the Assasins in general were cool, but overwhelmingly tedious/confusing. All the cities, all the dens. Yuck. The bombs were straight up OP so I declined to use them  at all. The city was massive, and while parts were great, most of it was just brown drivel. I did not feel like there was much incentive to explore like in previous games. Combat waseasy  although Ill excuse this as Ezio by this time was the master of all combat forms.... The economy seemed even more tedious than before. Dungeons were too easy  although very unique and entertaining. Characters all muddled together  either that or Im a racist. And for a game called Revelations the ending didnt answer much.
