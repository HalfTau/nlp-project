This is my first Assassins creed game,the first play was very interesting,but there had some disadvantage of this game  the storyline is too short!I try to finish the game with 100 complete, and it cost me only 50 hours, the game is lack of content, the storyline is very short and the secret extras like new assassin suit or weapons was too easy to unlock.The Assassins creed Revelations still a good game, but not that perfect, I am enjoying in the mutiple player games, the mutiple player is better than single player, more fun and exciting.Whatever, I guess I will buy the Assassins creed 1 and Assassins creed 2 and brotherhood when speical sale coming, I want to know the full story of Ezio and Altair.
