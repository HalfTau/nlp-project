I am a huge Assasins Creed nerd. Ive loved the series all the way until this latest one, but that is besides the point. My personal opinion is that Revelations and II are the best ones in the series. For the parkour, for the combat, for the story. It all works very well together and the progression throughout the game really makes playing enjoyable!
