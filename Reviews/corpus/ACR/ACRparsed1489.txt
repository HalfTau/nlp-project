Ok, I like the game but there are MAJOR flaws.1 The Aspect ratio is fixed to 169 so black bars for us who dont have a 169 moniter.2 Controls are pretty horrible, theyre rebindable but badly IE Run is Left Mouse. Jump is E/Shift. Theyre just horrible3Parkour is no where near as fun as it is on a console. Buy the game, but for Xbox or Playstation.EDIT After playing, its alright, but still better on Console
