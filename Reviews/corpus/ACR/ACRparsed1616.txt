Like all the past versions of Assassins Creed on PC, this one suffers from dropped support, leaving the game broken in some ways, glitched in others.   This game is abandonware, no more updates with no further support on PC.  There is a news crawl on the bottom that is so out of date there is even a tip that reminds us to preorder AC3 and get all the great preorder bonuses!!!!  This game started out good by giving players a hook to reach higher places, then it went downhill fast.  This is by far the WORST assassins creed game EVER made.  Many of the buildings in the game you cant climb there is nothing there, just a big blank space.  While the controls are as bad as every other PC version, making it so buildings are harder to climb while making the average building much taller this time around 4 stories is a huge pain for navigating the city, especially the fact its broken up into 2 parts.  Taking place in a third world country it has no horses for whatever reason even though there are multiple scenes with carriage chases.Some of the challenges are almost broken, the Bomb Challenge set 2, rather than get fixed in the last patch got all bugged up.  The bomb challenges are completable by making bombs at the quick station then making them in your inventory.  Took like twenty times of doing it for it to pop, but just keep doing it one by one, and you will get past that menace of a problem.For a story you have the end of the Enzio trilogy, so sad to see him go.  There is even a wonderful romance including a picnic for the two lovers in a graveyard.  The time trials are crap, just mirrors edge wannabe clones.  Other parts where you play as Desmond they actually found a way to make more annoying by making it an fps platforming part where you move blocks around, as dumb as that sounds its that stupid to play.Rating  0/10  Value  4.99
