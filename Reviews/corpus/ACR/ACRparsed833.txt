Assassins Creed Revelations brings new gameplay to finish the Ezio trilogy in a fun and exciting way.ProsAltairs storyBetter graphics than BrotherhoodGreat voice acting, as usualFluid combatConsSide missions lack interestMusic not up to par compared to previous installmentsThe finale to the Ezio trilogy is definitely an Assassins Creed game. You can tell as much immediately. But besides Altairs story and Ezios grey hairs, not much differentiates itself from any other Assassins Creed. But dont get the wrong idea. If it aint broke dont fix it. The world is still fantastic, looking great and fun to explore. Learning more about Altair makes up for the lack of backstory in the original game, and is a delight to play. But Desmond on the other hand still hasnt learned to shut up. Continuing in the pattern of doing things with entirely different gameplay, his side missions are only useful because of their glimmer of backstory. But, all in all, Revelations is satisfying to the AC fans, and a great way to end the reign of Ezio.Final Score 7/10  Good
