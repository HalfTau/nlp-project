seems lacking for an assassins creed game. still pretty fun, but doesnt quite live up to expectations. no riding horses, no outside of the animus sequences, and a generally smaller feeling than the previous two games. i think the lost archives dlc is the only one i actually played since i didnt do multiplayer, and its not much fun though it does give some interesting glimpses into the story.
