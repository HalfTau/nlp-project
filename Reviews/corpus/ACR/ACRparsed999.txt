A game worth playing! I played this title on my Xbox 360 two years ago and Im so glad I found it here on Steam.I think this is the best game of the AC saga the plot is intriguing and the gameplay allows you to go around a wellreproduced city like Istambul. The views are incredible.I totally recommend it.
