The gameplay is relatively shortnot counting time spend on collectibles, however the missions are fun and breathtaking, they are the best mission design comparing to its previous work. The story give me goose bumps, linking Ezio, Altair and Desmond, once again displays the grand world of AC series. On the contrary, the DLCs are bland and boring, with useless multiplayer items and depressing game mode in Lost of ArchiveUbisoft is one of the most innovative game developer Ive ever seen, keep adding new entertaining elements in their new work, in this particular one they added bomb system, tower defense and new kind of hidden bladeJust a fine piece of work, Im eager to play the rest of the series
