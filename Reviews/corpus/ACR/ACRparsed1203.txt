Nobody plays multiplayer anymore but the level 50 players, making it unfair to anyone who just bought the game, the single player campaign is bugged beyond playability, a convoluted storyline that tries too hard to confuse you, and its nearly impossible to get the multiplayer to work due to the Ubisoft server issues. Not to mention the godawful Uplay stuff that comes with it. Honestly, if youve played the first two Assassins Creed games, you arent missing anything in any of the recent ones.
