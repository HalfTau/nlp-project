This game, Idk if the game is good or not. Maybe it is! Maybe its not. But I cant get the game to WORK. Stupid freaking Ubisoft and their Uplay crap! Im not the only one getting this error. Somethings wrong with your internet, blah, blah, blah. Im done. Never buying another Ubisoft game ever again. Steam did it right, let me launch through Steam! Not through Uplay! Well, luckily this game was only 9, because of the sale. Guys this is a warning. DO. NOT. BUY. UBISOFT. GAMES!
