Assassins Creed Brotherhood was a fantastic game, improving on and adding much to the greatness that was Assassins Creed II. The completist in me really wanted to see the Ezio trilogy to the end, but I just couldnt because Assassins Creed Revelations just didnt improve on Brotherhood enough and add more value to the previous games to make it really worthwhile.The graphics in Revalations are gorgeous even by 2013  2014 standards and I love Constantinople as the setting, but the whole game felt sluggish  like the aging Ezio ironically. When I found out that in this game, Ezio tasked himself on another hunting quest, I thought, Again? The freshness of Ezios adventures was gone and the Ubisoft team should have stopped while Ezio was still on top. Adding new weapons to your arsenal was not enough to keep me interested, and I actually found myself dreading the need to invest in city businesses and to train assassins all over again.The pacing of the game was offputting as well, with the Den Defense minigame to be most annoying. Similar minigames were found in games like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas  it wasnt fun then, and it isnt fun now or ever. Plus, Den Defense was not what I want to do when I play an Assassins Creed game.Unless youre truly invested in Ezios adventures, dont bother with Revelations. There are too many good games out there for you to spend your hours on than this game.
