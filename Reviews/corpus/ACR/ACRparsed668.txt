A small step up, in terms of parkour and combat, thanks to the hookblade, The hook, not the blade from Brotherhood. You can now use counter grabs as actual kills when attacked, counter steal to save time on looting after killing an innocent Ottoman soldier, climb walls faster, use ziplines to get places lateral but still somewhat downward from whatever roof your on, and get to reach for ledges, those times when you accidentally drop from rhem, by showing anyone that may be looking at you your hidden blade.
