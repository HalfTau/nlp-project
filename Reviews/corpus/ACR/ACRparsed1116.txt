8.5/10Another amazing addition to the series, one that ends the stories of both Altair Ibn LaAhad  Ezio Auditore da Firenze.Story is very compelling and worth playing for. Gameplay has not changed from the last two Assassins Creed games but improves on them with more gameplay elements including a hookblade, bombs, and other assortments. A lot of things makes a return from the previous Assassins Creed games such as a brotherhood, brotherhood missions, renovating cities, collecting items scattered throughout the whole game and ofcourse, synchronization points. Worth buying in my opinion.
