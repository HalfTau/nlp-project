THIS GAME. If you have played the other assassins creeds you will love this one. With your familuarity of Ezio it really shows how his wisdom and heart have developed. He is no longer an arrogant young man not saying he wasnt cool But it is nice to see him develop in maturity as he gets older. Also The story gets really heart wrenching near the end and the last scene with ezio not gonna give any spoilers just was 10/10 in setting voice acting music etc. BUY THIS GAME AND EVEN MORE SO IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE OTHERS.
