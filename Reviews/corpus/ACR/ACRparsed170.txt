Fourth AC, and my fourth AC game as well, since I am going through them chronologically. Even though there is definitely stuff I prefer in one of the previous games here and there, Revelations is my favorite so far.Constantinopolis is my favorite city, you can move around it better thanks to the hookblade, the game looks better graphically and old Ezio is now all wise and stuff.In addition to the main big city you get to visit Masyaf the Assassin HQ from AC1 both as an old Ezio while its in disrepair, and in couple of the missions youll get to play as Altair around the time of Ac1 ending and what followed, including one where you are 80 years old. Those are fun.Other than a tower defense style minigame which you can avoid past the tutorial its an AssCreed all right, if you played AC2 or ACB youll feel right at home, and if you disliked them, Revelations will hardly win you over.
