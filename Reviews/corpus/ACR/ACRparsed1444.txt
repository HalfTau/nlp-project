There is a much greater attention to detail this time around.Excellent building of the Ezio character.The overall story following desmond doesnt get much attention, but the story here really was about closing up the Ezio and Altair storylines, which this title does an excellent job of.As with any of my recommendations on the AC games, play them in order, or else youre going to be confused.The DLC really helps to clear up some of the confusion of AC Brotherhood, so get it.
