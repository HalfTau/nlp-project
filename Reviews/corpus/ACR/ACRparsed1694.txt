Definitely the worst since the first.  The gameplay is essentially the same as Brotherhood, except for a few minigames here or there which seem more like diversions than anything meaty the new tower defense game is especially halfbaked.  Its nice to see the conclusions to Altairs and Ezios stories, I guess, but I was never that attached to them in the first place and the new plotlines involving political intrigue in Constantinople really arent that interesting.  Whats left, I guess, are the promised revelations, which are nil and mostly just reiterate stuff we already know about the games silly, convoluted, scifi/templar/apocalyptic mythology.So why do I keep playing these games if I obviously complain them so much?  I dont know, honestly, as its certainly not the plot.  I think the core game element of freerunning through beautifully designed historic cities is novel enough that it keeps me coming back.  Its like causing havoc in a digital museum.  Plus, I dont think its pointed out enough, but these games have unusually gorgeous costume design for a video game.  I could just wander around staring at the clothes extras are wearing for hours.Honestly, though, you could probably skip both Brotherhood and Revelations and not miss much.  Heres hoping AC3 is the shot of adrenaline this once good series desperately needs.
