Having played the previous versions I was quite looking forward to seeing what happened next. Having put about an hours game time into the campaign I am now stuck in the screen where you wander around and get the chance to practice tutorials whilst the game loads. the practice tutorial button changes nothing and the game doesnt load. Dont press anything at all during loading or saving. Whether this is a game problem or a UPlay issue, its shoddy and not good enough. There isnt the option to load from any previous point, so I will have to start again from the beginning. If I was further through I would be very annoyed. It also has loading issues, dont press anything whilst its loading. Its not a bad game after all but it has issues which should have been resolved in beta.
