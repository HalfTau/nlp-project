Another AC2 expansion pack played. The story didnt move an inch, no horses, no controlling Desmond in the real world and no explanation why we are in some hippie wet dream. On the other hand, the city and the missions themselves are quite enjoyable. If they want to end this story in a bang they better be making AC3 for some time now, or its another ruined franchise. A little padding and feature creep is not the end of the worldpun intended, but its a fine line to tread.
