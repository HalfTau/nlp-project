Assassins creed is such a good franchise I could not say no to this game but it is the weakest one so far. The base defending minigame is just a stupid distraction. The 50 sync concept started in Assassins Creed botherhood is antiopen world, forcing you to do things in a certain way. I eventually just ignored it because it was too tedious. Still its not nice to be confronted with failure on every mission. Better to talk about bonus than failure if you want to keep your customers happy? Additionally there are many missions against the clock, which I do not particularly and the graphics are a bit off.However on the plus side  Etsios love interest is a high point and having access to the assassins early on in the game is good. The portrayal of Constantinople/Istanbul is nicely done having been there. I particularly like the recreation of the Bazaar. Etsio is such a great hero to play as he is so charismatic.
