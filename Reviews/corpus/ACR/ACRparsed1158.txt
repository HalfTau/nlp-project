Crap consol port just like the orignal. Doesnt lock cursor to game so constant clicking on actual desktop beneath or on second screen popping you out of game. Just what one needs in the middle of a high paced action sequence.  I hope be able to finish and delete without pulling all my hair out due to this frustration!
