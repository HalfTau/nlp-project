Requires finishing the first two parts of the Ezio trilogy and beforehand, in order to fully engage in the story. I also recommend finishing, in order to appreciate Altairs expanded story.Revelations is largely more of the same while a fair portion of the gameplay is repeated fromespecially the city quests, it ties up several loose ends with the Ezio, Altair, Desmond and Subject 16 storylines, and adds some fun new features  such as ziplining with the hookblade  which help make it a worthwhile playthrough.I found the Desmond memories more interesting than the Ezio storyline and enjoyed learning about Subject 16 in The Lost Archive DLC, both of which are set in environments reminiscent of, making a nice diversion from the Constantinople setting. The addition of both the Mediterranean Defence metagame and bombmaking seemed rather superfluous to the rest of the game but somewhat interesting nonetheless. I would have liked more voiceacting in the Animus database entries, as the feature seems to have been dropped for this iteration.After four games set in very similar locales, Im looking forward to a change of environment with.
