9.8/10 Amazing Sequel, Ezios story wraps up perfectly, and you even get closure on Altair which was a fantastic touch. The combination of stories flow perfectly together. Ezio is a legend and truly is the most interesting man in the world. AC2 /ACBH/ and ACRev will always be in my top stories of all time.
