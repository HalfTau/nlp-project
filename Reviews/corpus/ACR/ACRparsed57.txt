By far one of the best Assassins Creed games in the franchise. I used to live in Istanbul so the actual city was like being back home. I loved the controls in the game a lot better in Assassins Creed Black Flag because the shift button was easier. Although overall, the gameplay as a whole was easy to use. The graphics are amazing for the year this game was released and you can change the settings to whatever computer you have. The only thing that I would comment on is how easy it is to get rich in that game. You basically purchase stores throughout the city in order to control the city under the Assassins. Its a really clever idea but its extremely easy to purchase the shops and get the money in the game. Otherwise the game its self is a 10/10 for me!
