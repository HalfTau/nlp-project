Although they didnt put much effort into making this game fresh, I could still enjoy it and replay it. The story was rather plain, but the placement Istanbul, the music and how the main character developed through the trilogy made it for me.Id give it a 8.5/10, but the rating couldve been disturbed because of my love to the saga.
