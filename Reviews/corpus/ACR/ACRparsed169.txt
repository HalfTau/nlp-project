In my opinion, this game was a big step backwards from Brotherhood. Sure they added bombs that you can throw but the millions of treasure chests carelessly placed through the map are mainly just bomb ingredients now and are thus no longer as fun to search and explore for.The addition of the hook was more gimmicky than anything else. It can marginally speed certain things up like climbing but it slows me down more often than not and can also get you into trouble since you can no longer sprint and bump into guards you use the hook to go over them which triggers an alert amongst all guards in the vicinityThe posters are gone now and simply paying to refurbish buildings armorer, tailor etc creates notoriety which makes it significantly more frustrating and time consuming to buy everything if you are the collector type that has to complete everything to 100. In other words, when building up notoriety it is painstakingly more challenging to bring it back down again. To make matters worse, when you get the notoriety to a high enough level the Templars attack one of your dens which leads to this absolutely awful minigame where you motionlessly stand on a rooftop and direct a battle in the streets.The combat is still as fun as Brotherhood however the addition of occasional slowmo kills slows things down. The one improvement though is that you can choose what your sidearm is so you can use the smaller daggers with a pistol.Even the story seemed less interesting and the maps slightly smaller. I just found it tedious to push myself through this game but I finished it solely to move on to Assassins Creed 3.
