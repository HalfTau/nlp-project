As the title suggests, its reviling the stories of the 3 protagonists we had since the beginning Desmond Miles, Altar IbnLaAhad  Ezio Auditore da Firenze, now in his 50s Its mainly continuing from where things left off in AC Brotherhood, but they added bomb crafting and a hook blade. Should be all right then right?Not so much I use a controller and the command which used to be for calling your followers is now the same as the one for lowering yourself from a ledge. Long answer short What the ! Who thought that was a good idea?! Most bombs are useless, so youll find what really works for you and youll stick with it. The parachutes are a nice addition, but why are they deleted on random when picking up Altirs story? Horse cart sections are frustrating, I really dont have a clue why they are there. Desmonds story is by far the most frustrating First person platforming with generating walkways. Enough said. The story mode is still good Ill give it that, but the Janissaries are too unbalanced, they will stun lock you with attacks when you are combatting them, and that isnt fun.In all, the game Ubisoft sold is still unfinished There are far more glitches in this game then in the others with some being quite major. How it had not got patched in 2 years ever since it was released and when I got it idkIf you really, really need to get it for the story mode sure the multiplayer I havent touched. But if I have to have an opinion if you wanted a good way to end Ezios and Altirs story, this isnt it.
