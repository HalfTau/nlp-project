Like most AC games lately, its a further refinement. Unlike just the sprawling content in AssCreed BroHo, it offers a little less total, but whats there is much more detailed. For example, instead of just numbers going up when an protoge becomes a master assassin, you actually have a unique quest set for each master to do! Bombs offer tons of tactical and offensive options. The Hookblade speeds up climbing without being too powerful. Despite all these ideas, I still feel like this game could be better and should not have focused on Ezio again. The very last Da Vinci mission in Brotherhood would have been a much nicer exit to following Ezio.All the same, the game itself is rad. Get it on sale assuming you have played through the first 3 games!
