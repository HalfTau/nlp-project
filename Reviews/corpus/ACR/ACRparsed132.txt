I dont understand how or why, but every time i try to play the game there seems to be a bug that causes the game to stutter when i look to the left of ezio, but when i look to the right, everything seems to be ok with the exception of his arm. Please fix the bug and ill change the review, because otherwise its a beautiful game.
