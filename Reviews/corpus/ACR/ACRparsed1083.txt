Just getting into the AC franchise and the Ezio trilogy is great!  I just did story mode so I could get to the other games.  Graphics good, storyline also good.  There is a lot to do in this game that I didnt explore much.  Den battles, assassin recruits, etc.  I was pretty much entertained with the story and like I said, I wanted to get to the other AC games.
