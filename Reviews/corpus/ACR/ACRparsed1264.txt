i love this game. but Uplay is causing my audio to mess up so i have to play muted and everytime i force quit uplay to fix the problem i cant save. can anyone help?Edit Fixed it, Uplay for some unfathomabel reason has an option to force what audio you want to use cause you know the fact that I have headphones pluged in isnt proof enough that I want to play with them. and it had changed on its own, anyone else with this problem go in to the options on uplay itself and the fix is in there.
