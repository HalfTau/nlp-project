The best AC game of the lot so far Ive played up to AC3, with a wide variety of options for assassinations and new tools to use. Its a shame every AC is made by a different group so none of the improvements from one game infuse into the next, to make an incredible AC. They got just about everything right with this one, too bad it will just fall down the memory hole when the next one comes out.
