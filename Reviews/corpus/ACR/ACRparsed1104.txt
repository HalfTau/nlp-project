What a game!! ..TOP gameplay, a little easy, but if you dont buy new weapons its not too easy  a must have for fans of the series..it completes the storyline of AC1 and AC2 if you didnt play it it wont be such a revelation ...to me its the best part of the series...best controls, best sound/musik, very good characters and best story till the end.. a must have
