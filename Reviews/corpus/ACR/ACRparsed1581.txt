It has a good story line, and closes the chapter involving Ezio which I think is a shame, since it doesnt show what happened to the rest of the family, it was kind of short though compared to brotherhood.Only thing I had an issue with, the controls, they were so well laid out on the last game, in this one everything was configured in an odd manner for a keyboard and mouse layout, I had to reconfigure everything, to match the last game, and there were still a few controls that used to cover a couple of actions, that were separated for some reason.  If I had a 360 controller it wouldnt be a problem.
