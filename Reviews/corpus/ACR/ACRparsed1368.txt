Say AC2 was the greatest one of Ezios trilogy, Revelations is the most userfriendly.I played this game twice, that the second was right after seeing the end of the story.The whole story mainly happens in Istanbul,which may be the largest city AC series ever has, even larger than Rome.The background music is as good as epic, adding a lot emotion to cutscenes. Especially the main theme beginning with a female chanting.It is tremendously beautiful and echos in my brain over and over.During the play, Altairs life after AlMualims death is revealed. It is pretty much the same story told by AC novels, so it didnt surprise me. The amazing part is when Ezio finally meet Altair, face to face, well, sort of. I felt the sorrow and joy across hundreds of years between those two masters. It did feel like witnessing the history.Ezios story may be over, but that of the assassins continues.
