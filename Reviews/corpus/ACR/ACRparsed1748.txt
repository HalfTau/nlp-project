Young Italian born, Love and Tragedy,Experienced Veteran Assassin, Revolutionary and PassionEzio Auditore da Firenze, now an aging mentor, filled with Questions and Struggle.The Fourth and last game with the aging italian assassin.My friends, my brotherhood, we have seen Ezio go through much in his life, we have seen family, love, tragedies, revolutions, mysteries, and yet this final chapter concludes his journey.Expect literally everything that made Ezio who he is, what he became, what he struggled for, and what he fights for.We see a man who is plagued with questions that need answers, that can finally end this war between Templars and Assasins.He still is smart and despote his old age, still can make an old lad learn new tricks.The unexpected marches to your door, only to find a new sense of adventure, love, companionship, struggles, death, corruption, greed, betrayal, treachery, and wisdom.I cannot say for sure, if you will enjoy this game, as much as I have seen Ezio grow from a young lad to an aging man. It is heartwarming and sad for him to continue to find answers that long elude his blades.But, keep in mind this game wraps up previous questions like that of Desmond and the unknown that plagues each and everyone of us who have been with them for over  two games.Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Youre final journey is at last within your blades reach.Take the Leap of Faith.9.63/10
