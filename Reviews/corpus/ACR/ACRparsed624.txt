Assassins Creed Revelations was one of my most anticipated games of 2011. At that point in the franchises lifespan, I couldnt get enough of AC games.After a solid first entry with Altair, we were introduced to young Italian assassin Ezio Auditore in AC 2 back in 09. Two games later, Ezio is older, much wiser, and ready to embark on his biggest adventure yet.Ezio left Italy in order to find the meaning of the assassin brotherhood. The journey finds him in Constantinople, where he meets fantastic new allies and enemies.Besides Ezio and Desmond, we take control of Altair for couple of instances that further explain the story.Combat was improved, some good new features are added like bomb crafting and hookblade, and some not so good gameplay features like the flawed den defense system.Assassins Creed Revelations is a fantastic closure to Ezios trilogy. It has extremely satisfying and emotional ending and it shouldnt be missed.
