And here is where Ezio officially overstayed his welcome. The game became a lot more boring, and the story was pretty well defanged. I can recommend it solely for the gameplay which remains entirely unchanged even if they do keep stapling on new things, but the lack of any genuine agency to the story really hurt this game in a big way.5/10.
