Good way to end the Ezio series. This game is somewhat nearly from the 2nd game but with new more advance mechanics and also you need to play the other previous games to understand the story of the game.Fighting style still the same though.Good atmosphere. Best environment. Techniques. Stealth. and much more, I cant remember already XDAnd also. SPOILER You work hard enough and leave your family and friends behind to fight those keys only to see a skeleton sitting right behind the door HAHA. But still worth it, Altair will be forever remembered 99/10
