god man this is one of the best assassins creed games by my standards in my opinion it goes1.assassisn creed III2.assassisn creed revelations2.assassins creed II3.assassins creed brotherhood4.assassins creed5.assassins creed liberationi havent played black flag yeti havent played freedom cry yeti havent played unity yet  preorderd but yes the stiry is one of the best and you have to finnish assassins creed I to understand it a little better but i think there shoud be the both duel hidden blade and hook blade because if you would have to do the dubble assassination it wold be like hitting some one with a spoon with the hood blade and it does help you climb alot faster. the story is amazing like i said the graphics arnt the best but the gameplay makes up for it just wow ubisoft i know people give you lots of crap about not being able to login but i did that fine the hookblade made you beable to go on rope lines and travle faster.over all i give this game a 8/10
