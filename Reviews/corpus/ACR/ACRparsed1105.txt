This game is boring and the controls are really convoluted. I honestly dont know why this franchise is so popular. The controls are just horrible.Its also broken. Another terrible PC port that belongs on consoles. In the single player campaign, none of the cinematics work properly. I guess there is a fix for it, but I cant see wasting more than 15 seconds on this game.The multiplayer was unique, but the novelty wore off quickly. I would pass on this one.
