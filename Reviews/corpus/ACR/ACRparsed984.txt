I like this one.If you just focus on the side missions, metagames like den defending, sending assassins to other countries, its just the same game as Brotherhood with a change of scenery. Istanbul is not even fun to explore like Firenze or Venezia yeah Because while the European setting of the first two games is quite colorful, Constantinople is in sepia tone and full of mosques and such. Maybe I dont find it interesting because its my everday scenery but there is a problem in color grading of the game. It just makes it boring. Istanbul is still beautiful  in the game but...And they didnt even use much of a music to support the atmosphere. The ones you hear except one or two when you hear during cutscenes are just backgroung chorus that you shut your ears later in the game. Maybe they tried to avoid being oriental with the east theme but it didnt work good for them.Still theres the good old Assassins Creed feel when you walk the streets, pass people in their everyday walkabouts, run on roofs and climb fast to incredible hights for the view of the beautifuly modeled city.And if you just focus on the scenario its just like the headline says. There are revelations and boy are they exciting as hell. Some nice diologs, a couple of loveable characters, really important pieces about the past and the future. And toward the end it would become really emotional. If you finish the metagame crap early in the game you dont need to do that more than one or two times though like I do, you can enjoy the awesome scenario till the end like I enjoy hopefully. Now I just need a discount for the 3rd game.
