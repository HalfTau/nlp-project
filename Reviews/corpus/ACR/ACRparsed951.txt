Asssassins Creed Revelations isnt that much of a bad game, however, the graphics do feel outdated and the controls on keyboardmouse feel terrible. Uplay is one of the most terrible gaming services ever devised by man, making it very difficult to start the game. The game will only launch if I open it as administrator, meaning I have to go into the games files to open the .exe file. Everything is pretty mediocre in this title, but at least you get multiple playable characters. 7/10
