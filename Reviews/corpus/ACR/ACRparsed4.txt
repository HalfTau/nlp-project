I load into the game fine on my fist time, I complete the tutorial and i realize the controls are a nightmare. I play for a couple hours mostly fighting the controls instead of guards and decide Ill try again the next day. Turns out i didnt have to worry about the jacked up controls because when I loaded into the game, and no joke, my character could only run West, no other direction. If i try to move in another direction he constantly jitters in a very small figure eight. Often turning into himself over and over once i got into combat the problem was solved. Then i exited combat and the game breaking bug resurfaced immediately. On to of that the textures were spazzing out and flailing around nonstop. Ive looked online for numerous fixes and cannot fix the problems. Ive just decided to uninstall and move on, and to think this is one of the few games Ive paid full price for.
