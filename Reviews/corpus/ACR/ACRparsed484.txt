It is the best Ezio game from a character development point of view, and the gameplay is a pot pourri of the best elements from AC2 and Brotherhood.Yet, the gameplay didnt evolve, and its basically still the same game youre playing, reskinned.And that makes a game boring, whatever its narrative qualities may be.
