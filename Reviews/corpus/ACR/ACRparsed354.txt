When I was a young man,I had liberty, but I did not see it.I had time, but I did not know it.I had love, but I did not feel it.Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three.And now, the twilight of my life, this understand has passed into contentment.Love, liberty and time, once so disaposable, are the fuels that drive me forward.And love, most especially, for you, our children, our brothers and sisters,and for the vast and wonderful world that give us life.Endless affections, Mia Sofia.Ezio Auditore
