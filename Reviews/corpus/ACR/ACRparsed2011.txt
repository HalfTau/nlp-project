Awesome Story , nice ending of the Enzio Triology.But wow the gameplay gets boring, feels like i play Assasins Creed Brotherhood again with a different story .When Assasins Creed 3 not brings some new stuff , then is this my last Assasins Creed game ,most disappointed game this year for me , defenatly not worth 50
