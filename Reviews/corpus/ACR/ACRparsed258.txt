Assassins Creed Revelations is the perfect closure for Ezios trilogy, with nice flashbacks into Altairs memories. However, it does not offer something completely new and if you were getting tired by Brotherhoods mechanisms, Revelations will definitely not change your mind. But the beauty of Constantinople Istanbul and the desire to see the end of such a charismatic character like Ezio will prevail on imperfections.Highly recommended! 10/10
