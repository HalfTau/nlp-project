Heya, Almog here friend of the real Rander and real owner of ACR.I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys an open world with a few factions and their little challenges, just beating down guards, following an epic journey after a failed toooldtooambitious for his own good Ezio Auditore Da Firenze.The game itself quite disappointed me after all the babling about playing with both Ezio and Altair when you can only play Altair and some stages.The games engine itself got improved more and more, the only two bad things is one mentioned above and the other is the horrible interface, I have to wear my glasses to see how much templar awareness I have?Anyway I was very very satisfied with the multiplayer, playing as spoiler Vali the rogue assassin and other semiassassinmission targets is an awesome idea.I would not recommend the DLC too much but its a fun idea if you wish to be more hidden then usual, especially at rome and port maps.Rating 7.8, GET IT, LOVE IT!
