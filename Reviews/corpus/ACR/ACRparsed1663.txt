An enormous disappointment. While Constantinople is visually amazing and a great location choice, the games story is so boring and unimaginative that I got tired of it before even reaching the halfway mark. I stuck through it up to 100, and can round up the games qualities Jannisaries, grenades allow for some cheesy and fun moments, Constantinople, and your assassin trainees unique missions. Im not going to list the faults, only mention what bothered me the most putting Altar back in the game. For me this effectively ruined the character, who was so enigmatic in AC and mysterious in AC II as an almostgod among assassins. Putting him in Revelations took the mystery out and threw the crappy combat in, and it ended up seeming like Ubisoft just threw him in to please the fanboys. Huge mistake.
