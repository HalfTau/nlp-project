This is the first Assassins Creed game I couldnt finish. It wasnt frustrating as much as it was just boring. It felt lazy, made without passion or attention to details. The characters dont look like themselves its not that they look older, they look like completely different people. The battle/defense sequences were annoying and unnecessary. The world didnt feel nearly as alive or as vast as the previous games. The story failed to hook me. Ezio storyline shouldve ended with Brotherhood. Last but not least, the game crashed on me regularly. Not worth it.
