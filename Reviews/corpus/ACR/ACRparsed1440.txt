Assassins Creed Revelations  its Assassins Creed. Again.At this point in the series, you know exactly what youre getting into. The basic gameplay has remained unchanged from the previous game, and the only new gameplay hooks are completely superflous. Bombs are largely useless, except in really specfic situations the Tower Defencestyled Den Defending is not only boring and frusting, but youre likely to not even see it I had to actually try and get my Infamy up just to see them, and the Hookblade just basically changes your combat and climbing animations, and not much else.So why am I recommending it? Because at its heart, the gameplay still just works. Combat is shallow but cool looking, the world is graphically beautiful even if Istanbul is far less colourful than Rome and Italy, the full syncronization goals still add great replay value, and fans of the series will definitely want to see the wrapping up of Altairs story. The actual ending to Ezios story however, is reserved for the Ubisoftproduced film short, Assassins Creed Embers, so make sure to give that a look when youre done the game.Also of note is the incredible Desmonds Memories minigame, which is a first person puzzleplatformer where you assemble and place blocks to traverse surrealistic Animus worlds as you find out about Desmonds life before becoming an Assassin. The Lost Archive DLC consists entirely of new puzzles and story in this style, and for that reason alone, the DLC is highly recommended. The gameplay in this supposed minigames not only outclasses the main Assassins Creed gamplay, but with a bit more depth, would easily stand as its own game.
