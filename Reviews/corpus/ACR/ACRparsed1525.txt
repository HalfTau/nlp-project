Overall 6/10Careful! When you read you are in the risk of breaking into tears. Read at your own risk!This game is very enjoyable indeed with the new features and stuff. I liked it a lot and i still like it like the previous ACGames. Parkour, Assassination, Stealth, Tactics, Surprises, Brotherhood, OptionalRewardingMissions, Story, New Wisdom and more. The protagonist is back and wise  dangerous as ever but you also play the previous protagonist again.PROS Have a visit in Turkey Constantinople/Istanbul TowerDefence based missions available Make your stand there!. This one i like probably the most! Replay the previous protagonist. The actual protagonist is good too. Challanges and AssassinMissions are rewarding a lot! Many varianting memory missions Like the part with the hookblade  ziplines You can craft BOMBs!CONS However you play the previous protagonist, his voice is DIFFERENT and not original! UPlay fux everything up! I had to modify something before i could play it! No help from support! First civilisation do not fit in such games like this IMO Mentioned before, that some optional challanges or missions are rewardable you can and i did right on your start of the game gain the rewards for the very BEST EQUIPMENT available ingame, and as the game progress you will find nowhere better stuff than you got rewarded! This makes this same a walkinthepark. Game is very short!I do not recommend to pay for this game since the developers have gone on a moneyhunt and are releasing since AC3 nonassassin games with cheap tricks. AC  Revelations IMO was the last entertaining and yet an assassin game. However it is still worth playing. I do not support the devs any further because their products have gone worse and I still have the inability to play it clean without UPlay.
