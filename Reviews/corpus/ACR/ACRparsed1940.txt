This game is, like its precursors, well made and written. On the other hand it comes to long phrases of running and running and running... and climbing . . . running.Well than .... its Assassins Creed! What do I expect? DAssassins Creed  Revelations feels a little bit like Brotherhood, just a bigger City and more exciting quests and many more peoples.Finally it is a good game which improves, that UbiSoft isnt that bad One drawback because it is not the old Desmond/Altir/Ezio model. A new face. Why? Idk.9/10
