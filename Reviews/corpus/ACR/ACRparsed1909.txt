Assassins Creed games are great in general, but they shouldve called this one AC 2.75 or something. Its basically ACII AND Brotherhood all over again, but this time theres practically nothing new. Yes, there are bombs which I hardly used, a hookblade which was actually pretty good, a parachute never used it only for the story and a tower defense minigame which works alright, but doesnt belong in the game if you ask me, but its just not enough to call this a NEW Assassins Creed game. Theyre really milking the franchise.However, the story IS told in a better way and you get to play as both Altair and Ezio. You also get to play as Desmond, obviously, but thats only a matter of minutes, thankfully. Desmonds segments are critical to the story, but it diminishes the gameplay experience. It just pulls you out of the entire experience.All in all, you really cant go wrong with AC. Just dont expect too much from it.Rating 77/100
