It has a bad reputation for being the worse game in the series but I thought I owed it to Ezio to complete his amazing trilogy and I am glad I did.The map isnt as large as the other Ezio games but they make up for it by having plenty of extra missions, quests and collectables.If you are thinking of skipping out this game, dont, because it is well worth a play and has a brilliant storyline with characters that you become emotionally involved with.
