Constantinopoli is looking great.Much better than Rome.Also its rather big,so there is much to explore.Mediterranean Defense minigame.Improved brotherhood managment.Altair flashbacks was very memorable.Generally i love the idea of EzioAltair crossover.Improved main characters faces and models.Improved graphics.Interesting side missions.Great ending of Ezios trilogy.However they could end Desmond story too,not stretch it to AC3.Story is weak.Sometimes i cant even understand characters motivations.Many nonmain characters has the same face.Even in Brotherhood and AC2 i didnt noticed that.But here they use the same faces in Altair and Ezio stories.Why they cant just make some more faces?Bombs.They are not so useful as game tolds you.But developers just force you to use them.Stealth is ridiculous.AI is still too dumb.Well,Revelations is ok,but its much  worse than AC2 and Brotherhood.Recommended only for fans of series.
