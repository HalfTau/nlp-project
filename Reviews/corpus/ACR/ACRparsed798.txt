Its mainly filler, which youve probably guessed.Its an alright game actually, but seeing as this is a result from milking a product dry, I honestly dont think it deserves a recommendation. Of course its nice to see an ending to Ezios story, but I seriously think they shouldve done that with the end of AC Brotherhood, or perhaps even AC II.Although, If you feel that you really need to experience the ending of Ezios saga, then Id say its probably worth it, but in terms of exploring an entirely new game, you will most likely be somewhat disappointed.Constantinople is an atmospheric city, but joined by a less compelling story, and almost no change in game mechanics from previous titles whatsoever, besides the obvious hook blade and the addition of bombs, which both seem as a very cheap way of avoiding to add new content, this particular game certainly doesnt live up to the standard Ive come to expect from Assassins Creed games. Besides all that, which is probably the most accurate way to describe the game, I personally liked it, but Im also a stupid fanboy.Hey, maybe thats what you get when you try to push out a new title every year with no exception, Assassins Creed Unity sure showed us that, perhaps not creatively, but surely in a techical matter.Oh yeah, and Uplay isnt exactly anything to cheer about either. Bla bla bla.sighMan! Now Im all bummed out!
