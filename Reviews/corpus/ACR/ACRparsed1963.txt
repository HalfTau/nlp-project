I would recommend not purchasing Revelations it provides meagre improvements over Brotherhood and only exists to milk customers for their money. There is no big reveal as the title implies and the storyline is barely continued but only for altair, Desmond gets his own filler arc and Ezios storyline actually ends up being a waste of time as nothing Ezio did has any importance for his storyline but is only used to introduce the parallel Altair storyline. Even worse Brotherhood ends in a major cliffhanger which is promptly mentioned sometime in the beginning for a minute and promptly ignored for the rest of the game. I feel as though Ubisoft ripped me off with this title and acted unfatithfully and unethically towards customers, I was deeply entrenched with the storyline of all the Assassin creed games up unitl this point.
