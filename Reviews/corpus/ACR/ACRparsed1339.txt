Heyyo, This is probably the worst entry in the AC series for me... its a console port that looks as good as the first AC game but runs worse... plus some of the fight achievement requirements of taking no damage are quite difficult when you cant do a counterattack to kill some of the NPCs and sometimes itll put 5 of those in a fight... so then you have to mash your left click like crazy and hope the others dont swing at you as you do... otherwise you take damage and buddys health seems to be back to full... sigh.
