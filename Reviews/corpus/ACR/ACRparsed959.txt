Time to review what I consider to be one of the best ways to end an amazing trilogy off in a nice little bow.This game was bought by me during the Ubisoft Weekend Sale whereby I got this game for 8.99. 10.13 in USD and 6.64 in British Pound Sterling When I intially bought the game, it was the Gold Edition meaning that in this review I will include The Lost Archive, Mediterranean Travel Map Pack and The Ancestors Character Pack.You play as Ezio Auditore De Firenze, this time continuing off from where the story left off in Assassins Creed Brotherhood whereby it is Ezios time to travel to Constantinople. With the history of Altar IbnLaAhad to give Ezio a sense of direction as to what to do and what to discover, he sets off in order to finish off what Altar wanted discovered.An excellent game which holds up and has become one of the top best Assassins Creed games for me. In my opinion, although the gameplay can seem lackluster especially in the multiplayer, this is a game definitely worth playing in your life if you love games with an interesting story topped off with more history than the other editions that came before and character development. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I cant wait to review the other Assassins Creed games and play the ones I havent yet. I give Assassins Creed Revelations aand a recommendation to buy it but only with the intent of perhaps buying The Lost Archive and the full game if you think you wont be as invested into the multiplayer as I have.Thank you so much for reading my review, please give me feedback if any and happy gaming.
