Yes, it is another yearly iteration of the series, but no, its not terrible, in fact i think its better structured than brotherhood was in quite a few areas. the story was good this time, made sense, and i finally understood ezios motivations a bit more.complaints.1, this could have been longer i cant help but feel that the story was really short...and in this series thats really all that matters to me. it was good, but in comparison to 2, it was short.2, the soundtrack was less memorable than 2.3, the bombs are great, could have used them in earlier games, but you can get by in the game without ever really using them. one way i think they could improve on this is some sort of xp system tied to certain skills, where you get better at things by doing them. and having more utility uses for bombs, like revealing hidden areas in the platforming sections, or knocking over objects to create a path.have not touched the multiplayer yet, but i think its self explanatory.
