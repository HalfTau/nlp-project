Could not get any asscreed game to run on windows 10. Googled around, its a common problem. Ubisoft does not officially support windows 10.This game installs another launcher ubisoft launcher, and I believe it requires an internet connection.Ubisoft is everything wrong with PC gaming. Never giving them another dime.
