Finally! That word could define my impressions of AC Revelations. I finished the AC, AC 2 and AC Brotherhood Oh my god! What a terrible game! on my PS3. Definietly, Revelations IS the best AC so far didnt play AC 3, Liberty or Black Flag yet. The history is by far a way better. Maybe just because explains a lot of things Oh really?! Revelations, right ?!. The game doesnt wait to the right end to show something really cool, like the previous sequels. There are some awesome action moments, like Ezios jumping obstacles while dodging bullets and pursuing a boat. The ambientation is a way better than Rome at least for me. And the mechanics... well, ok! They still . But I kinda desliked a little less than the previous ACs. Maybe the PCs version is a way better, maybe they really did some improvement. Still, you will continue to climb undesired walls, to jump on undesired ledges and to target undesired people sometimes a lot of times, but still worth it. The history is freaking cool. Its the first ACs game that I could finished without getting bored and the first that I could finished so quickly. I mean 22 hours in 3 days and a half, not bad for an Assassins Creed.AC1  7AC2  7.5AC Brotherhood  6AC Revelations  8
