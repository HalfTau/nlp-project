Assassin Creed that you are used to by now, but this is the point of the series that makes me mad. If you only like Assassin Creed for its gameplay and dont care about the story, I would say you should pick this game up. I enjoyed the beginings of the series, where the first game had promise but was repetive and the second game and brotherhood full price dlc showed how this series can be interesting with continueing the ideas of the first game. Revelations is where I started to getat the Assassin creed series as a whole. What really made me mad was retconning Altair as some Moses, deemed by an almight power to lead the Assassins completely undermind the whole purpose of the first game. Besides changing his voice to some typical low pitch grawl that is typical in all games today, Altair completely loses any sort of humbleness as everything he deems is now the spoken word of God. Any missions with him pained me the most, and I really wished they just kept it with Ezio. Ezio isnt as charming in this game like how he is in ACII but I cant hate Ezio, even if he didnt do anything too interesting in this game.
