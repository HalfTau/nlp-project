This game seemed a lot longer than it was. I only did the main story and it ended at about 52 sync, so dont get fooled if you expect a very long campaign. It took me 15 hours to complete it. It will take you about 50 if you wander around.The story was. Not quite as good as ACII or AC Brotherhood but still fun to watch the cutscenes and the dungeons to retrieve the keys were fantastic and great fun. You dont see much of Desmond, which for me is a big plus out of animus sequences are terribly boring.The ending left me satisfied and I got closure by watching the Assassins Creed Embers short movie 20 mins.NEGATIVE THINGS The menus are slow and there is too much loading just to open the map or the pause menu. You can only play on fullscreen mode. A lot of things are very expensive, if you only do the main story you wont get the chance to try good armor and weapons like you could in ACII for example. On the fast travel menu you have to scroll blindly until you find the one you want, you cant click on the icon on the map to select it and there is a loading sequence every time you select a different one.If youre a fan of the ac franchise I do recommend this game. If you arent, this one isnt gonna change your opinion on it.
