heres what i think...Fistly,this is for the children...if you never like books or doing your homework for school, because you simply do not like mathematics, or social sciences, or history lessons, this is boring,,, and you thought playing video games are better,,well youre probabley right... well then,, this is the History lesson you may not want to miss..This game,,, is a History lesson.After this you will want to do better in school...This is a family orientated game, a Historical game where you can learn, love and play,,...2NDly I would recommend this because of its storyline, Actions, environment, not to mention the hardwork in computer graphics/ designer,  and the type of gameplay temptations you aquire along your journey.......Great game......
