This game was as good as Brotherhood! Oh... wait... its the same thing.In all seriousness, it wasnt terrible. I give all assassins creed games a fair shot because I absolutely love the story and the game. But this one did feel like it was ripping off the first two and the story wasnt engaging for me. Theres lots of new side content which is pretty interesting, but if you wanted to skip to 3 then you wouldnt be missing a ton.
