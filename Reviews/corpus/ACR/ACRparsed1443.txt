Coming into this game, I was very nervous. I had played all the Assassins Creeds prior to this and loved them, with Brotherhood easily being my favourite.Now I was nervous coming in because going to Constantinople from Rome was a big jump and I didnt think I would have fun in this new city. I mean its kind of hard to top going after the Pope and the Borgia family. I was so frightened about this problem that I actually delayed myself playing it for a very long time.I can say, however, that this game did very well. As the conclusion to Ezio Auditore, this game gives him a wonderful send off, while still making sure that everything is fun along the way. While this game doesnt quite meet the highstakes assassinations of previous games, it does plenty of new things that come in to replace them, and most important, makes them feel very natural.Now I wont spoil anything, but some of the setpoints are very fun. Some of the side dungeonlike crawls are especially fun and make for excellent game play where you feel as though you are a real assassin having to fight time and perils, compared to the idiot who bumps into everyone while running.As far as plot, some of its pretty good. Overall, its fairly average for a game. I say game and not Assassins Creed because plot is not something any of the games are trying to accomplish. These games are to make you feel like an assassin in the most spectacular ways possible, and this does that very well.Overall this game receives a 7 out of 10
