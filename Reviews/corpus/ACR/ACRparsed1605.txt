I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but overall it feels like a giant rehash of everything that worked, and and even bigger slump of things that didnt.AC2 Brotherhood has been my favorite so far. The characters the collor pallete, everything just worked. Pacing was fast and interesting, as well as the ammount of achievments that felt right. save for a few final missions.AC2 Revelations is a reskin, that went overboard with with tedious. The awareness factor increases super quick, and killing officials or bribing the heralds only takes it down 25, not bad, doable, but just buying a shop bumps it 25 as well.The mini tower defence game is tedious and boring, it yields nothing that you can find in the world which will give you an edge.Ezio is still amazing, his old age only breeds a more powerfull Alpha Wolf rage that is ready to crush all opposition, and as much as I love Altair, the voice actor is different, so he feels a bit more bland.I bought this game regardless, because I like the cannonical events and want to see what happens to the characters of the AC universe. If you are not OCD about this, and couldnt care about the characters or the story developments, then feel free to skip this game unless its 5 during a steam sale.In my opinion, this is the worst of the games so far, not considering AC3  Black Flag.
