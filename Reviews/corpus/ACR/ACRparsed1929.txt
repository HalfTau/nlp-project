Really? Samedifferent city!And how old is Ezio now Im surprised he could even make it up a one story building without a zimmerframe..This is just getting stupid now, its time to move on. They have tried to make the game more fresh with different mechanics but it doesnt work. This game is just an excuse to tie up loose ends in a story people are becomming disintrested with.I only bought it for the story, Game play is ok, and this is CLEARLY a console port.And WTH is with Desmonds little Tetris adventure.And as for the Multiplayer I quote Ive got nothing against multiplayer as a concept, but you shouldnt try to make it carry a game because there are logistical problems.
