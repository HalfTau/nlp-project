16 minutes of Credits  all those people and not one of them in charge enough to say this game has too many of the notfun minigames and way too much running around the notfun city.  Boy you can really tell this one was put together by too many teams and the final product was really missing a master chef to throw out the bad ingrediants and stick with the good ones.  Yes, I actually finished the game twice, once on the PS3 and now again on the PC.  Everything worked great technically on this PC port  no complaints there.  Just way too many unfun things you are forced to do to complete the game.  Whoever came up with the concept of doing one thing wrong and having to restart the mission is an idiot  those really ruin the whole flow of the game!  Also the city design itself was just not fun to run and jump around in like the previous games.  BUt I still liked it enough to finish it so I guess I can recommend it, its not as bad as everyone says.  Just way too many people with no leadership it seems putting it together.
