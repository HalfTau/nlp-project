AC Revelations is the last entry in the Ezio story which started with AC 2 and it ties all the loose ends the story might have had, both for Ezio and for AlTair, it also explain the reason behind the hidden vaults with ancient technology and what hapened to the ancient civilization that built them.To uncover all of this, the game take you to Constantinople just after the Ottoman Conquest and allow you to walk in the foot steps of giant men, such as the famous admiral Piris Reis and prince Suleiman who would be known later as  the magnificent , all in all this is an excellent game and I recommand it to anyone slightly interested in the history of mankind.
