ACR picks off right after the events of Brotherhood. While the gameplay and mechanics are the same, Ubisoft have brought in several new things to this title. You can now recruit dozens of Assassins and place them in cities a strategy type minigame whereby you can control cities and ensure they do not fall under templar control, access to bombs and new citydefence minigames. All in all, the storyline is as smart as ever as you play as Ezio but this time it takes place in Istanbul, Turkey. The music needs no introduction its ace! While you may feel that this feels like ACB, the Multiplayer is as fun as ever and overall I had an amazing time attempting to unlock and complete the whole Singleplayer campaign with 100 which I later managed after many many hours.A must buy. 8/10!
