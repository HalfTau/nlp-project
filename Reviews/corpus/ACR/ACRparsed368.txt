Dear Claudia,This games storyline is amazing. It details the final missions of your brother, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, while introducing a bunch of different and memorable characters and locations for you to explore.It also explores the memories of Altair IbnLaahad, one of the greatest mentors that shaped the way the Creed is today. It picked up where his story left off, in the first game in the series, and gave a satisfying yet saddening ending.Although the game sometimes makes me jump off a wall when I dont want to, I still love this game.Truely yours,Daemonic
