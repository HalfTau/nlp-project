I like the game quite a bit. Uplay might be annoying for some, I dont really mind it that much, personally. Personally, I think this one might be the best of the Ezio trilogy, I love the story and the new characters we get to meet. If you like the Assassins Creed franchise, then this one is a musthave. Just be prepared to have to deal with Uplay.
