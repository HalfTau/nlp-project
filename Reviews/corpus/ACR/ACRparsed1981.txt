Another great entry in the Assassins Creed series, Revelations begins right where Brotherhood left off and has you controlling an aging Ezio Auditore through 16th century Constantinople and exploring memories throughout the life of Altair. The story is mostly focused around wrapping up the tales of Ezio and Altairs lives but Desmonds story continues to move forward as well, and as usual there is a cliffhanger ending that leaves you in heavy anticipation for the next game.
