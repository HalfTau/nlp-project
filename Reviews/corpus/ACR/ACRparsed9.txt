Great game. I know there are alot of comments about screen flickering, but I didnt notice any throughout my playthrough.The story was short compared to the others in the ezio trilogy, just check my hours for proof. That being said, I had a blast with it, especially during the bits where you play as a certain someone, no spoilers.Gameplay mechanics are ing great, I loved the hookblade that was introduced.Overall, buy this, its the second best game in the ezio trilogy in my book.
