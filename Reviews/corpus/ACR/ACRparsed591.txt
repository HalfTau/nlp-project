Best Assassins Creed ever!First of all its the best one because it is the ending of the previous 2 beautiful gamesAssassins Creed 2  Assassins Creed Brotherhood which i really enjoy playing.Also in Assassins Creed Revelations you can play as Altair which means that youalso get to see the first Assassins Creed and in addition with this memories and Eziosyou finally complete the puzzle of that awesome and wonderful trilogy story.Furthermore this game has many gameplay characteristics of the an old game of ubisoftwhich is Prince of Persia, you can see the similarity in the temples that you try to find the keysfor the apples location.In addition the story of the 2 presequel games is not the only feature that this game hasbut also the beauty of having your own assassins crew which was introduced in the Brotherhoodand also the awesome mechanics of combat that, although there are easy to learn like the previous games, there are so beautiful when you master them.In conclusion, this is the best Assassins Creed and for me, now that i have played all of them i believe that not only the Assassins Creed series after Revelations does not have that many new and  good features but the new ones have lost the old and good featues like having your own assassins crew that this game and the Brotherhood had.I rate this game 10/10 DP.S. This game is also one of the biggest games not only from the series but from many other openworld games.P.P.S. Also this game has one of the best trailers that i have ever seen!
