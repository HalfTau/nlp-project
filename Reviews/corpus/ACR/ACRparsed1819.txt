Following AC Brotherhood and the AC2 was always going to be tough, and despite some fun stuff, the storyline, characters and generic cinemaesque awesomeness of the game, this game seems a little weak to me. It is definitely a transition to another sequel, and I can admit, its a shame to see Ezio go.
