Revelations is, at best, more Assassins Creed. If that is what you want, that is what you shall receive, but there is very little of note for the game itself. It is hard to recomend it over Brotherhood, and it is far from the high point of AC2, it is simply another formulaic yearly sequel.The combat is largely unchanged from Brotherhood, and retains the sense of bloat that was present in its predecessor. While there are 6 ways to kill an enemy from range, you rarely ever need anything more than the throwing knives, a weapon found in every entry of the series so far.The missions are somewhat lackluster as well. While the challenge feature from Brotherhood remains present, the challenge seems to have been left out. The challenge requirements for most missions are laughably simple, and often can be accomplished without any real difficulty.If you want more AC, that is what Revelations offers, but if you just want the pinacle of the series, stick to AC2
