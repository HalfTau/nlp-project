Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh review timebest AC game hands downBest storyline of all, from beginning to end. It felt like the elements of a good story was there. The ending was the best part, it left you with a feeling especially if youre an AC fan.I love the new addition of weapons and explosives. The Crossbow was fun to use most especially because you can use it incombat, Datura Poison Bomb was OP, and other newadded to the game like the new Hookblade and the ziplines, the easier use of the Hidden Gun and that you can quickscope with it, and the Assassin Recruit system and stuff which Im too lazy to explain.AI is pretty funny, except its just lazy programming basically.Combat System had no changes, except when you fight Janissaries or whatever you call them.The Desmond Stories were given spice and interest to Desmond himself you unlock these missions through animus fragments and all I have to say is, its also as good as the Ezio story.There maybe a lack of no. of sequences since an average AC game has 12 but I dont care.Anyway, what a ing long review, heres my rating9.4/10What a good way to end off 2 legends on an excellent AC game.Thanks again, Ubisoft. not sarcastic at all
