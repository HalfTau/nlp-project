Great game, bad port.Game has crashed twice, Ive had to restart missions because NPCs get bugged out stuck in walls, frozen, walking around in circles, etc.. A lot of the animations are janky, especially executions e.g. tackling a guard, then stabbing the ground to his left. Its obviously playable, but very frustrating in an AAA title.Uplay is the fart on top of thesandwich.
