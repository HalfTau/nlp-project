Was a huge fan of II and Brotherhood. This part of the series did not do it for me. The storyline is very good to be honest. I really liked travelling to Constantinopel and see how things were in the time of the Ottoman empire. The Ezio sendoff at the end is worth it and makes way for part III. But the rest of the game felt tedious and boring. I even stopped playing for a while. I had to force myself to continue playing to see how the story would unfold.The bomb system just didnt add anything special to the fighting mechanics and you can easily play the whole game without ever using a bomb.I am usually an achievement and stats horder, but this time I just couldnt be bothered.The number of different fighting styles from enemies could have been cool too, but it didnt add excitement to the game. It brought frustration to the game, which is a shame, because it really could have been cool. The fact is that every enemy has a single strategy to defeat them and thats it.The Tower Defense  minigame doesnt add anything to the game in my opinion and the fact that you had to send your assassins to other cities just felt stupid and worthless. Why would you send them to cities where you dont play yourself? Could easily have worked in the main city divided in districts where you really have to fight to gain control and keep control. Now it just feels like something that happens way over there and doesnt effect you very much.The shopownership system feels like a waste of time too. AC II, where you rebuild your mansion and small town around it, felt way more satisfactory in my opinion.In conclusion if this game is on major sale and you want to see the story progress, do get it and play through it, but otherwise... stay away from this title, read online how the story unfolds or watch the split scenes on youtube or something and move on to AC III.
