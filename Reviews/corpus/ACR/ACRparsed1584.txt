If you want the exact same game just in a different time setting and one new feature then look no further, Assassins Creed Revelation is not only the same damn thing as Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood, but its also an introduction to one of the worst multiplayer games youll ever see! For the third ing time, you play as Ezio Italianoli, a cunning old man who somehow can still fight flawlessley, the guy has gray hair and is jumping all over the damn place, tell me how that makes sense, Ubisoft. Another thing is the bomb crafting, spend countless numbers of hours searching for seemingly impossible brand named gunpowder to mix in to make some sort of torm. Also theres a hook blade this game not worth your money
