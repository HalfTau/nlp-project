Assassins creed revelations, the bon voyage of the series two greatest protagonists.Join, Ezio and Altair for the very last time as their paths cross again when Ezio goes seeking purpose.It plays and feels no different to brotherhood but is i feel a step down in total package.If youve already travelled with Altair and Eizo then you need this if you seek resolve but if you started with AC rogue or syndicate say, then you might want to consider how much of the famed creeds history you actually want to know.I liked it, its saddening to see the two greatest assassins ever to grace the creed for the last time.
