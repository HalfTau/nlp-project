 Amazing story like always. Epic ending! like no other. Improved Characters for developed story. This will catch your mind in instance. Difficulty of battles have gone a little higher which is just about right. Last series was too easy. Dropping rocks, Collapsing structures and floors, falling down the pit! This game has raised its bar. Cheers! Thief mission has poor description. It never told me that! So how the heck should I know to do what you ask me to do! Making me waste time will you? Opening stores raises notoriety. This was really bothering, for it was extra work. The fact that ways to lower your notoriety was limited than before made this more drastic. It was a buzz kill for I had to stop a lot of times to bribe and such. However they did made the gage go slower so I dont know, maybe it was ok but all I remember now is that it really dragged my buzz. Fast Travel needs to have map clicking ability. Searching through list was inconvenient and poor. I mean come on. Still? I dont know if its Windows 10 comaptibility issue but the game twitches in every first launch.
