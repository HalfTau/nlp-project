Compared to AC2 and Brotherhood, this game feels like a shameless cash grab. The story after AC2 and Brotherhood felt complete, this feels like it was tacked on afterwards. Its not all bad, the trademark AC action is still there and Ezio has a few new tricks bombs, ziplines but overall the game isnt as polished and just doesnt feel like it was necessary.If youre an AC fan I would still recommend it, as youll want the story and the core AC gameplay is still fun, but beware that this game is not as good as the games that came before it. Definately wait to buy this one until its on sale.
