Very cool setting and story, but there are too many new features!  too many? Yep too many.Theres so much to do that you just cannot do everything. Because after the story there is no way to play along with Ezio anymore.I kind of like the idea of the dens and their defence but in the entire story  24 hours  I only had to do this two or three times. I think thats because I always stayed anonymous or so but this is a fragile concept! If I want to defend my dens I have to be noticed by the guards but for every other situation it is bad to not be anonymous.Of course I still recommend because its story sets an interesting end to Ezios life as an assassin. Graphics are solid, too, and I like the voices. Both, in English and German.Jaker
