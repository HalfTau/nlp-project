The third Ezio Auditore da Firenze game is as good as ever. One thing I like is the games change, but still feel like sequels. AC II was a country roaming, assassing vengeance quest. AC Brotherhood was a power building game, build your strength, make your mark, raise you team and then strike. This game is more story based.The intro is my favourite to the three Ezio games. Masyaf castle is an excellent setting, and the story is just great. You leave Roma for once and go to Constantinople Istanbul, Turkey to follow in the footsteps of Niccolo Polo to retrieve the 5 keys to Altairs library. Excellent game once again, keeping in the same style of the other Ezio games.However, I personally was not a fan of the bomb mechanic that was introduced. I preferred the tooth and blade style.
