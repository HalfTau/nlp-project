Oh Another Assassins Creed Game! Well this one is pretty darn good. You play as an aged Ezio, in the Byzantine/Ottoman controlled Copenhagen. Honestly the games storyline could be a bit better, but improvements to the combat system, really smoothed the whole game over. Also the additons of Dens and more to do with your fellow assassins really was cool.
