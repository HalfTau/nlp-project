I would have to say that this was the last good assassins creed game and the last assassins creed that actually meant assassins creed before the series started to get boring. I mean ac 3 was ok but I still preferred the original ac games because the new once are just compleat garbage I mean there ok but they dont really have a story all you have to do is kill the target and thats it I mean you get a back story of the character, but the new games just feel boring and plan. So ya revelations was the last good ac game rakuezka de patche ezio
