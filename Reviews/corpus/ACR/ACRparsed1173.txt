first of all, Ezio is the best character from the series..seriously. i love the gameplay, the town setting, and the bomb perks. I think the most suitable AC theme supposed to be happen in capital cities, unlike AC III half forest half cities. The interactions with hiring gypsies, thieves and mercs to get invisible are awesome! i also enjoy the story between solving the puzzle to get the Masyaf keys and the background story about saving the capital. Its just well made, well done! Annndd just a friendly reminder, AC III sucks hard.
