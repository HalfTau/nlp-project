I want to like this game but I simply cannot because the controls are an absolute horrible mess.Pros Amazing graphics Fantastic story and cutscenes Great voice actingCons The controls are an absolute nightmare. I try to climb something and end up doing a jump off it instead a shove which either severely hurts me or I fall to my death Weapon selection is unintuitive. It took me awhile to figure out how to assign a secondary weapon  shouldnt be that difficult Theres no real storyline per se and sometimes youre left standing there with no clue of what to do next as the instructions are either lacking or unclear Too many cutscenes and character narration Cant skip cutscenes UPLAYBottom line  It seems like the developers spent more time on looks than gameplay. Even if you can get this dirt cheap on sale I would avoid it. Its not enjoyable if you cant bloody play it properly, despite how amazing it looks.
