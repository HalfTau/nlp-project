As much as the assasins creed games are fund to play their rewards leave much to be desired. All of the rewards for completing x y z challenge are wholly unnecessary, as Ezio is so blatantly OP that he doesnt require the help of anyone else in the world.Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Its certainly unbalanced. I got through the majority of the game without the bombs, and didnt realise there was a tutorial mission until I had gotten through the game and was wandering around for 100 sync. Wandering around for the chests is useless...if not for the memory, I wouldnt bother. Even now that Im actively trying to use my bombs, I still have far too many materials. Theres no one on the multiplayer version either, which is sad, and no way to get the achievements singally.Not sure I like the trend of the jump puzzles becoming more cinematic...though it is pretty.Fun game  a little broken.
