This game was just as good, if not just a touch better than Brotherhood. They added the hookblade, which was a huge addition to climbing because instead of having to grab after you do a jump while climbing, the hookblade locks on and does it for you. It also is useful for the ropes that are around the city like ziplines, along with extending your reach while jumping from rooftop to rooftop. The parachute is also helpful for when you are falling. The combat felt the same, the story was good, loved how they included what happened to Altair after AC1, and what Desmonds childhood was like. Great game
