AC R is the third an the last part of Ezio Audiotres journey to fully understand what being an assassin truly means.The game introduces a new mechanic called The hook blade, which is basically a hidden blade, with a small hook on, helping you climb faster and fight better. And, frankly, thats the best thing in the game. Except for the mission you just go and pick flowers.Anyway, the game has a lot to improve. Maybe not gameplaywise, but storywise. The plot of the game just felt very dull, although it gave a closer look into Ezios personal life, which was pretty nice. After all the  that went down in Italy, the Ottomans just dont feel like anything.I know, I know, maybe Im being too critical, but the game didnt make me feel anything, until the very last three or four missions.Still, the game finishes Ezios story, and even though I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who hasnt played AC2 and AC B, the game will be a satisfying end to Ezios legend, for those who played the two games before.
