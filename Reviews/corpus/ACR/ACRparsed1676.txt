A continuation of Desmond and Ezios story with Altair flashbacks! Also the end of Ezios trilogy however Desmond should still be in ACIII. Story wise its not too great compared to the previous ACs the gameplay is much approved though! now you can swing around on ziplines! and parachutes can be used anywhere! time to check out the multiplayer.
