As the third and final installment in the trilogy, this is by far the best out of the three. Ezio, 25 years later, finally completes his lifelong mission, with all the best things from II and Brotherhood combined in addition to a new romance, a much deeper storyline and more enemies/weapons, this is definitely a game youd want to play til the end.
