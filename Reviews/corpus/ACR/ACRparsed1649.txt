The final installment of Ezios story.  Ezio is now an old man but still an active assassin.  The introduction of the hook blade is one of the big changes in this game, allowing for more options in both fighting and freerunning.  One thing I really liked is the hookandrun, which allowed you to get past a bunch of guards making a roadblock.  This game also introduced the den defense minigame, which I wasnt very fond of.  I want to freerun and assassinate people, not play a towerdefense game...  One more thing they added was bomb crafting, which I never used ever...  While not as good as the first two, Assassins Creed Revelations is worth playing simply because it provides closure to Ezios story.
