This game is amazing. However it is short in terms of campaign length I completed it in 18 hours, this does include me farming and doing extra missions. This game does make up for that with the replayability value of completing missions 100 synchronization. The Multiplayer is something I am not a fan of. However you may gain some time and fun on that. The conclusion of Ezio is outstanding, I have played and completed all the Assassins Creed games before this one around 4 times each, and I absolutely adored them, they were by far masterpieces Assassins Creed II in particular. If you are a fan of the series like me, then I would definitely recommend this game. However if you are new to the series, then I recommend you try the others first, and see if this is your style of gameplay. If this game is on sale, then just buy it along with the other Assassins Creed in the Ezio Trilogy.
