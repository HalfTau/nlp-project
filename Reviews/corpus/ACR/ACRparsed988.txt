Revelations was just a pleasure to play, the final chapter in the trilogy, you get to play an older and wiser Ezio, leaving Rome in search of answers eventually leading him to Constantinople.The story itself is really well made, combining scenes from Altairs past and Ezios fight for knowledge and clarity, the story keeps getting better and better as you go through sequences.The gameplay itself didnt change much from the previous games, the combat animations are still the same but improved, Constantinople also has an Assassin presence, as their mentor Ezio recruits and trains them as he did in Rome, calling upon them while taking Bizantine Templar strongholds or sending them across Europe on missions. Maintaining the banks and shop management, adding to this there is a notoriety consequence that calls Templar attention.The time period is very well portrayed, the city is beautiful and filled with monuments and landmarks like the Hagia Sophia, this does wonders for the games immersion. It was also a refreshing change of pace from the Italian cities, combined with the great soundtrack it truly is great to play a game like this.I could not recommend this game enough, it quickly became my favorite of the trilogy, the portrayal of the city, its people and history is amazing, combined with good missions with interesting characters. It is definatly worth the purchase.
