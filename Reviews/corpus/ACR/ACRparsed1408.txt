Assassins Creed is one of the better games in the franchise,graphical not a lot worse then Black Flag. The game also has a great storyline,and, a lot of fun to play, even without playing a story mission.Roaming through the streets of Instanbul is awesome,its not a boring open world, a thing which would have made ACIII suck less.You can spend a few hours on making the city free of Templars,and even more in the huge assassinsmanagement minigame.A lot of bang for buck, mostly now its older.Though you may think the multiplayer is impossible to play, because there are just a few people,you can play multiplayer matches sometimes not at 1 in the morning though.But the coolest thing in the game is, of course, Ezios SUPER AWESOME ACCENT!!
