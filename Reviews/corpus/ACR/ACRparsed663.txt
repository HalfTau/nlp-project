Not as good as Brotherhood, but still a great game nonetheless. There are some pretty cool additions like creating your own bombs, ziplining, the hookblade adds a cooler element of parkour, and the rpg element of building up your brotherhood. I also love how the story ties in the altair story from the first assassins creed as well, explaining how his life lived out, a very unique aspect I have not seen in any other game. Its one of the better assassins creed games out theredefinitely worth a play.
