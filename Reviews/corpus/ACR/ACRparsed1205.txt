This game crashs quite a bit, I had it crash 3 times in less then 3 hours, It just closes. Also Uplay randomly losses connection though it isnt a abit deal for SP.I have read a a lot of reviews about this game and peple are having issues and keeps saying that game runs like crap, even them with a CPU that supirior then mine. I have never dropped below 80FPS but it will use my FX8320 8 core at 5ghz at a round 80 at times. More then BF4.Once in game though, the guards when you kill them, their bodies freak out, or if you assassinate a guard that you knocked down, you will assassinate him like as if hes standing up. Their are deffenitly glitching AI in this version of AC.
