There are parts of this game that suck, such as having to defend some area where they introduce a whole new type of gameplay, its like a game in a game if you ask me, and there are parts of the game that are really nice, such as the hook to the gauntlet, which allows you to zip across buildings and such which they brought back in Syndicate. I like they moved onto another geographical area with the story, to Istanbul, which gives it a different atmosphere, roaming through the streets and the bazaars is really nice, gives you a nice exploration of the city. I dont like the crafting part, and havent used it much in the game. Overall its worth it as it is still a quality continuation to the previous AC games, and spoiler alert it ends the storyline for Ezio yes, sniff, this is the last game youll see him in. Def worth buying as a sale.
