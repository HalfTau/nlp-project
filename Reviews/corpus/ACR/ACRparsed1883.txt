What a way toall over a perfect series. One of the developers said there isnt much we can do with Ezio at this point. Except make another game and charge a high class hookers blow job price. Thats the laziness of these developers, All they had to do was stitch this game together with Brotherhood and boo yah...You got two games in one, loads of DLC along with Ezio dying off perfectly in his little Pixar  movie...Not only would they have made money, they would have made money with a more reasonable game. No justification calls for glitches and  bugs in this one, and this game was alot more interesting than Brotherhood. Altair again got thrown under the bus, 6 missions with him and hes dead to you.  off Ubisoft.
