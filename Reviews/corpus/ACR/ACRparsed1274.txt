My personal favorite of the series so far. This game brings closure to Ezios story and provides a smooth transition into the next game. Desmond is given more story and there are optional levels where you can learn more about his life by solving puzzles.Revelations takes Ezio back to the route of Assassins Creed and has him follow the trail Marco Polo has left for him in Istanbul. At the end of each memory sequence there is an Altair memory which reviells the events following the first game.As well as updated graphics and mechanics, this game introduces the hook blade used for moving quickly though the districts but also intresting and original combat tactics. The use of bombs has also been expanded creating unique solutions to large patrols of guards. Ezio can distract guards by creating divertions, frighten them by filling the bombs with lambs blood, or simply blow them up!As in the previous two games the notoriety system adds a level of caution to the game steering the player to use tactics and stealth, rather than brute force to resolve confrontations. This, to me, makes a lot of sense as Ezio is an older and even more experienced assassin.Couldnt recommend this more espesially as its normally ont 2.50 on sale!
