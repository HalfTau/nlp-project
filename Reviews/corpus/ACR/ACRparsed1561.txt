This game was very conclusion to the great trilogy of Ezio Auditore. We followed him from Assassins Creed II to Assassins Creed brotherhood to this one. I feel like the game had been a great experience, yet it felt like it was lacking in some sense. The graphics were amazing the story of course still great, but it was a bit short. The game I felt came too soon and they could have added so much more! I did enjoy exploring the cities although it seemed to go too fast to explore, and creating the bombs with different ingredients were a fun trip too. The city of Istanbul is were you are located at and it just beautiful! maybe on of the greatest locations so far. The addition of the knife grappling hook also made it ever more so worth the while.I loved it, but wouldnt call it my favirote. Though I would recommend it for any person who has completed the first three.
