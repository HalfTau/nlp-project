My favorite of the AC2 era games, it delves into both the end of Altair and Ezios era in a cool way. The annoying climbing puzzles and tedious tombs of ACBrotherhood are gone, replaced with more actionoriented tomb sequences that felt inspired by Uncharted 2 that were way more entertaining. Only main annoyance was that there is a bug with the deposit youre supposed to get every 20 minutes that made its frequency vary from 20 minutes to multiple hours, so I felt stiffed on my income for a lot of the game... but the best armor and weapon arent bought with gold anyway, so it didnt really hurt the experience overall.
