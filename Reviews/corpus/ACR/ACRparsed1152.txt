This game is basically more of the same. This is what I said about Brotherhood, but even more so. The game was entertaining and I damn enjoyed my time with it. The bit where the underground city lights on fire was awesome, but Im left thinking that the game was pretty standard. It didnt seem like a sequel to Assassins Creed II. It seemed more like a continuation of Brotherhood.The name is dumb too. Hollywood and the AAA video game industry thinks that putting some dumb word on the end makes it sound cooler. NO! NO! Brotherhood made sense, because of the brotherhood of assassins. Black Flag makes sense on account of it being a pirate adventure. Revelations is dumb. Of course theres a revelation. Almost every story has revelations!Anyway, this one takes place in Constantinople, not Italy among other places and adds some new weapons. The renovation and customization elements are lessened thankfully, but they are replaced with other stupid sht. Thankfully all of it was optional, so I took the option of not doing it.I have not played Unity yet, but within the Assassins Creed games I have played 1, 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, 3 and 4 this one is probably the weakest. Ezio at this point is kind of tired. On account of his old age and the fact that weve spend 90 hours with him at this point.Its alright if youre a fan of the series, such as myself shocking I know, but if youre not following it closely this is one to miss. If you are then you should pick it up to keep up on the story.Its OK.
