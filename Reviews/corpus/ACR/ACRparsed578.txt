First MAJOR downside 16 minutes of unskippable credits. I have no idea if theres anything after them, and I dont care enough to watch 16 minutes of names that mean nothing to me to find out. Brotherhood did this too, I dont know why the games keep having this garbage.Second less major downsides camera is annoying, Ezio sometimes seems to act like youve given him a book on general relativity if you input too many commands, and the menus load way too slowly.Third I had to install the game on my C drive to get it to launch, rather than my separate hard drive with literally all the rest of my Steam games are on. Assassins Creed III also has this problem.But besides that, this was a really good game. Great story, great gameplay, ran smoother than the previous Assassins Creeds and the controls listened to me more, mostly. The story would probably make absolutely no sense if you havent played through the previous games, but its still fun in the off chance someone buys this one on its own.In the end, it still has a lot of the issues the previous games did with zero improvement on them, but like Lego games it continues to be fun and makes you want to keep going in the series.
