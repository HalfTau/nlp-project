As with most of the early Assassins Creed franchise, the plot is strong in this story, even though it is shorter.  There is the added fulfilment of what happened to previous characters that wraps it all up nicely as well.The settings are beautifully designed, but very similar to previous games.  If you are familiar with previous games then there is very little challenge in trying to get around  if you see a white cloth, you know a climbing sequence will be ahead.  The fight system has been improved though, with new moves that make combat a little more unpredictable and some much stronger bad guys who can really do damage.The looting function still exists but is now mostly redundent due to useless prizes.  There is a big emphasis built on putting together hand grenades that are really not that useful and most loots give you ingredients for them instead of weapons or money.  The grenades system is convoluted and unnecessary, and depending on preferred styles of play can be completely redundant and a waste of time.
