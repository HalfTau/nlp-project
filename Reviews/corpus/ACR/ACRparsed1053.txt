Worth it, if you can get it working. It was a big hastle to get this game to finally work, but once I did, it is pretty good. I had to uninstall the uplay stuff that was downloaded, restart my computer, download uplay from their website, restart again, then I was finally able to login, exit uplay and go back on and enter the key to play the game. I wish Ubisoft wouldnt use 3rd party systems because they are just a waste of time. So far, great game, would buy if its on sale.
