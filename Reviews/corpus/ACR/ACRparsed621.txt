I was a AC fan before this game. After playing first AC, I bought AC2 and Brotherhood on release day and did not play anything else until I finished them. I had same excitement and motivation for ACRevelations. Note that I live in area where this game takes place. So, I was looking forward to travel my suburbs with Ezio in Ottoman era.After playing half of the game I suddenly stopped playing. It was just same, same, same...2 days ago I decided to continue just because I wanna complete the game before I delete it.I dont know the story, dont know who is who and dont care indeed. I miss the feeling I had in AC2 but my AC adventures stopped before even finishing this game.Such a pitty.
