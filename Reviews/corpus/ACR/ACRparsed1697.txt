First of all, you dont need to play this game if you EVER want to see the end of the Desmonds side. He will be sticking with us a little while longer. It is the end of the AC2 trilogy, though. Again with the same flaws Brotherhood had, it feels a little less like a new game,again, and more like an update to AC2, theres some new gameplay features but not much. Not called AC3 for a reason. Still the usual fantastic singleplayer story, dont mind the multiplayer.
