An early Assassins Creed part but still a good one. It has way less collectibles and side mission content as other titles but the ones that are in the game are good choosen. The main story is a bit short and I completed it in 22 hours. You have not to much money to spend and always you can buy something usefull. The controlls are a bit weird if you started with earlier games in the series as me but it was no big thing for me.Buy it in a Sale and you will be happy with it.
