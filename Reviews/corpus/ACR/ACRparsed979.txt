So, far I have played AC3, AC, AC2 and now AC Revelations. But apart from AC, which was a horrible game, just a next step after Prince of Persia, I think AC Revelations is the weakest point before the Connors story. I havent played Brotherhood yet, but Ive heard its the best in Ezio Trilogy.Dont get me wrong, ACR is a good game, definitely worth the price. The main story is interesting, the combat is smooth, most missions are fun, there are new weapons and tactics, the narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. But the game experience itself just doesnt feel that fresh anymore. I guess, theres just that many AC games that you can play before the excitement starts to fade.So to sum up the pros and cons...PROS Good main story, but not as good as before or after You are not forced to play as Desmond, if you dont want to, in order to proceed. Its constant Ezio/ Altair experience Combat and camera is working perfectly it was a big problem in previous parts, so you always jump and land, where you want Narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. You can cross the whole city, without touching the ground. Ziplines are also a nice introduction Some new useful weapons such as bombs, a crossbow and a hook blade. Parachutes are very useful, tooCONS Income problem is still not fixed. Youre short of money in the beginning, and youre millionnaire, when you dont need it anymore Only 4 locations Masyaf, Constantinople, Cappadocia and Maiden Tower Boring side quests except for Master assasin missions and grinding challenges. Ultraboring Desmond sequences, which are basically about Desmonds memories and block building Kind of short, compared to other parts The game does not introduce all gameplay elements equally well. For example, Mediterranean defense, assasin assignment, assasin promotion, den attack triggers are not explained enough.I didnt play the MP, but if its the same as in AC3, I dont even want to try.My overall rating 7/10.
