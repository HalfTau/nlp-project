I have played this game on PS3 when it came out and bought it for a few bucks to replay it again on the PC, but its just not worth it. This game is very unoriginal and the guy who thought a base defend minigame in an Assassins game is a total Rtard. I do not recommend buying this game, because the story is dull and it suffers from several technical issues such as framedrops and lag.Only buy this when you hadnt played it before.
