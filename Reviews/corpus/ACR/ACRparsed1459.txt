I had finished Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood, I like them so much with over a hundred hours of game play.Then I started to play Revelations. The begining is ok, an old Ezio, a new city, new assassin friends, a new hook blade, more parkour skills, it sounds good.Then I reach the mission ON THE DEFENSE and I hate this f tower defense part of the game with all of my forces. WTF how they put this in the game? It sucks a lot, boring a lot, frustating a lot. If they put it as optional missions, even that I like to do all the missions in the game, it could be ok for me if its possible to skip these f parts, but not, it is part of main history, I cant skip this. It sucks a lot.I definitively hate this tower defense part of the game, thinking about stop playing and go play other game.
