This is a welldone PC port. It launches in native resolution, chooses sane graphics options and changes ALL of the user interface accordingly whether youre using keyboard and mouse or a controller. Youll have to manually install Uplay in order for it to launch, but at least Uplay doesnt prevent it from working, unlike other Ubisoft titles.
