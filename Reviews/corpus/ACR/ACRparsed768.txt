When I learned that we are going to play as Ezio again, I was confused  I thought, we had enough of him during two games. But, it concluded the game just perfectly along with Embers it concludes Ezios story  from birth to death  what game character can boast such attention to his life?So, everything good that was improved compared to the previous gamesWhat I definitely didnt like is that challenges didnt change a bit since Brotherhood. I understand that not too many core gameplay elements were added, but some are practically identical.By all means, recommending this game. You must know how Ezios history concludes.
