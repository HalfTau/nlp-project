GUH...well holy talk about revelations. That ending was intense. It really is just a bigger, better continuation of the series. Not quite perfect because of the combat system and stuff, but everything else is so fantastic that it pretty much overrides it. And the story is so damn good! Jesus now Im excited for AC3...9.75/10
