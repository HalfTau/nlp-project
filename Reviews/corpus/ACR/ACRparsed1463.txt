To me, this game is sumarized in two words. And these two words really dont warrant a spoilers warning in my opinion because ultimately the developers were very open in saying that this is what youd experience when playing this game BEFORE the game came out.So heres the two words. You get to say Goodbye Ezio. Which. You get to play as him ONE LAST TIME, before inevitably saying goodbye to the most timeless and compelling character in all of Video Game history my opinion. Though this game DOES wrap up the story arc oriented around The Apple Of Eden, to me, Goodbye Ezio is the thing that truly stands out.Though this game can be sumarized in two words, its just as amazing as any game in the series pardoning AC3... what a disapointment.
