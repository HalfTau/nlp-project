People often wonder whether AC R. is worth the money given that is doesnt add in to any great extent to the AC series but to  those people I say please just splash out. As the subtitle suggests, the game brings greater clarity to the overall storyline of AC and adds insight into Ezio and Altair. The gameplay is recognisable and clean and there is a greater graphical cleanness. The storyline is interesting and enjoyable and adds new weapons and armour. No, the game isnt a necessity to the series but is still and 9/10 for me.
