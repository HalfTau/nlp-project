While the tower defense minigame is lame, Constantinople comes alive with a vibrancy parallel to Brotherhoods Rome. The middle eastern architecture harkins back to the cities of the first Assassins Creed, while giving us the upgraded gameplay of the later games. The hookblade, while silly at first, grew on me. Its a fun, if gimmicky, new tool.
