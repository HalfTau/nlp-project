July 26th, 2017.Delete systemdetection.dll in your game folder if your graphics are going crazy artifacts, screen tearing, etc.If you played Brotherhood then go ahead and grab this on sale. If youre new to the franchise and trying to figure out your play order then my words of wisdom are to play 13 if you like a convoluted story with uncharasmatic characters and hints of an alien conspiracy. Start with 4 if you dislike Desmond Miles, running through cities, and enjoy the pirate life.My major issue with this game is that it was just a rebranded version of the 2 before it. 40 hours between the Ezio games and you either dont know enough about the characters to engage with them or the few things you do discover feel like bad exposition or a plot device. Remember in 2 when Ezios family was executed? Youll actually be hoping for more of those moments.This game was worth the price on sale and the time spent on it. I did not go for 100 completion because there are other games to play and dragons to slay. I would not say it holds up as stand alone title as you really do need to be aware of where the story is at in the continuity of titles.I do have to say though, it was nice to have closure for the Altair character even though I feel like some more information about his lineage would have been gratifying. Its almost like they left out just enough of Altairs life to make a decent movie with but then the film studio said, naaaah, lets get Magneto on a twirling arm thing. Unrelated I know, but I feel like it illustrates the missed opportunities of this franchise as a whole.Requiescat in Pace, Altair
