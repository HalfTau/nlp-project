played on X360Good main campaign  storylineSatisfying endingGorgeous city best in series imoRich color paletteQuicker climbing mechanicsAltair sectionsFirstperson Desmond story sequences cool for fans of series loreSolid multiplayerOverly familiar, and I cant stress that enoughMost time in game will be with useless filler tasksBoring economy systemBoring side missionsBoring meta gamesBombsTraversing the city can be cumbersome and frustratingOne billion treasure chests  collectiblesTower defense sectionsBottom line If the Assassins Creed overall story arc has kept you interested, this is worth the 10 or so hours it takes to finish the campaign. Anything more will feel like a redundant waste of time  youve done it all before. Stick to the campaign.7/10
