Assassins Creed Revelations had a few ups and a few downs. For instance, the main quest of the game is to open a library that finding the 5 keys takes up 90 of the main story. But some of the additions to the game including The Lost Archives dlc which made some of Brotherhood make sense and some of the character development make sense, I would go to say that this game was alright. My biggest problem with it by far was the map and the river separating it. It wasnt the end of the world but it definitely was annoying.
