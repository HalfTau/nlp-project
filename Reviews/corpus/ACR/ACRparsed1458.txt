10/9 for me , one of my favourite games and what to say , I have not finished the single player yet,and i dont know a lot about the story, but i know it looks pretty nice on a Full HD monitor or Tv whatever.it has a similar gameplay to Assassins Creed II and Brotherhood , not the best optimized game though, but its pretty much playable on a GTX 260 OC edition , 8GB DDR3 Memory and an FX6300 sixcore CPU  I know its not the best GPU , gonna upgrade it soonI get a Minimum of 3540 Fps and a Maximum of 5060 Fps on max settings , excluding AA, i only run it with 2x AA , since i get unplayable framerate drops on 4x and above.Im playing multiplayer mostly and its fantastic Y,and in multiplayer i get a solid 60FPS in every situation...All in all I highly recommend, and feel free to add me on Uplay george940203 or on Steam
