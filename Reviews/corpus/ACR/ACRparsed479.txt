Ived always loved the Assasins creed series yes even 1, but Revelations was just...meh. The bomb mechanic was annoying to use and the story started to go downhill. Ive always played Assasins creed to as close to 100 as I possibly could but I cant even finish the story for this game. How disapointing. Sure the assasination mechanics are still mostly there, but stop at Brotherhood if you can unless you just want this for the additional gameplay.
