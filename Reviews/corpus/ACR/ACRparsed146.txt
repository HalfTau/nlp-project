Very beautiful ending to Ezios remarkable story! The Ezio Trilogy is definitely the best part of the Assassins Creed series, and these games will always hold a special place in my heart. Some of the newer ones truly lack the magic of the beautiful soundtracks and great locations that the Ezio Trilogy had so fondly contained.Revelations is the most relaxing Assassins Creed adventure, in my opinion. Masyaf and Constantinople are both beautifully created, and recreated, in this game. The soundtrack is beautiful as always, and the gameplay is refined to feel and play as well as it did before, if not better. However, during the battle, I found that the bombs are absolutely useless. I never used them, did you?In conclusion, I can only add that Im  playing this game not in the first time, but I have many positive emotions. It makes happy
