Dont buy this  game. It installs its own protection, uplay, and requires you to go online and share personal information to play a game you already own and have paid for. Also, CD key. Why is this even on STEAM? If I knew it had another protection I would not have bought it.This is insane. I dont care for UPlay, I dont want it, and now I cant get rid of it. What next, Origin as well?I hope they choke. I made a new account, but they wouldnt let me log in until I verified my email  apparently personal data is part of their asking price.Also, fresh install, fresh uplay, click to play, denied. Updating game. Updating uplay. Updating uplay again. What is this joke? Why would you download and install an old version? What is my PC, the neighborhood hooker that everyone can just throw in?DO NOT BUY. It is a drag on resources, installs software without asking, does not make it clear that it requires online accounts and personal info to play, this hast to stop.I regret giving money to these people. I already finished the game, I liked it, and I wanted to support the developers. And now I regret it. It took literally 2 minutes to load the game on a quad core i7 with an SSD and gigabit internet because all of the updates.Also, nobody at Ubisoft heard of a firewall. Do you really need 50 connections? Really?DO. NOT. BUY.
