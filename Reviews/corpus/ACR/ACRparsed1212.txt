the assassins creed series is my favorite and I love all their games from ac to ac 3 because I only played ac, ac2 brotherhood, revelations, and ac3. this game is really good for someone who want freeplay and wants to go on a killing rampage in the game and not really life and wants to roam free to just explore and do all kinds of side quests.
