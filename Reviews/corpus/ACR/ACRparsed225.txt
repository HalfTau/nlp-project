Nice game, and man oh man I really liked that ALtair outfit Not the masters robe, the original outfit so much. Back then it was not easy to obtain you had to get it through preordering through Gamestop in Australia. But now you can get it through the Desmond DLC The name escapes me. Good game, but the assassins  defense gets annoying and be cautious of stalkers theyre freaking scary
