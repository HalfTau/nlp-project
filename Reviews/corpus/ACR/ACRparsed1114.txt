I must say, this game is absolutely fantastic! The graphics are amazing even on a low setting and the gameplay is up to Assasins Creed standard. My only downside to the game is Uplay, which seemed like it wanted me to play the game since Uplay kept crashing for no reason and I couldnt play AC revelations without Uplay. Took a while to get it working.I think AC Revelations is THE best game from the series along with Black Flag.10/10 For the game100,000,000/10 for Uplay
