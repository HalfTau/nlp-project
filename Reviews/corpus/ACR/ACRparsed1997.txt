I know this isnt a popular opinion, but this remains my secondfavorite game in the series as of this writing, I havent yet played Black Flag. The way it intertwines the stories of the three characters of the series is very cool. Though the bombcrafting mechanic is a tad useless, it still makes for some fun moments.SCORE 9.25/10
