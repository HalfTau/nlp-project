Loved the game. But now when Ive played all the assassins creed games and finished Black Flag a month ago, I see that they could start earlier with the sailing in revelations instead. Search for Hayreddin Barbarossa and youll see what Im talking about cause his life plays exactly the same year as Suleiman the magnificient. Would be easy to make sailing mission with forts and all that.
