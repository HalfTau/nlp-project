Though its been a while since I last played this game, I do recall it being a decent ending to a story arc in a game series that was really enjoyable. Granted with most endings theres always a little bit of resentment that follows with any ending The hero should of done this, why did that character die off, things should of been done differently, the writers are morons! to name a few. But overall this game finishes up the story line of the main series in a nice way, game play for the most part is very similar and at times a bit more challenging that it was in the prior games which really helps you develop a want to master it.The tower defense mini game added in was a neat and interesting idea that works well, but should not have been as mandatory as it was throughout this game. It does add a sense of urgency in the event that one of your bases does fall under attack, and in some ways acts as a punishment system for the player for allowing the locals to get wind of all the crazy stunts you keep pulling in that area. Keep it low key, do what needs to be done, and youll hardly have to face these annoying mini defense games.All in all if youve played Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood you need to pick this game up and finish the Story. The only thing I dislike about this game was the change in their graphics with this game from what they had previously done with Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood. I feel with their step towards realism approach they made all the faces in this game feel flat and emotionless. Granted it had more textures and the world looks better but the characters suffered more for it.
