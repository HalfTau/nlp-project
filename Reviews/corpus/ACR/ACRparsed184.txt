once again what could be a great game turns into a struggle with control system. I have persevered with both keyboard and mouse razor black widow keyboard and utrecht gaming mouse and 360 xbox controler the game is on a pc, as I enjoy the graphics, story line and ai. However after trying to complete the grabber sequence for the 50th time, face foreward jump dosent work, go back run up facing forward and then jump left! I give up. The assassins creed games I have most of them  but wont be buying any more are the most frusrating games I have tried to play. THe controls seem to have got worse since the first one  that was not too bad.I have no objection to a hard game but when it is the basic controls that dont work I give up.I give all assasins creeds games since the first 4 out of 10 and can only recomend the games to  a masochist.
