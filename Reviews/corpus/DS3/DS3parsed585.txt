This is a great game the physics and mechanics of this game is up to scratch, but one problem, its too dam easy! But if i put it on Hardcore its too dam hard, its not so bad at the end of the game but when you start of with junk weps and its on hardcore its almost impossible to run solo and too time consuming running around dodging mobs to regerate life, However Online COOP Hardcore is recommended. Also it took me 5 days of playing a few hours a day to finish, and 3 days once i knew what i was doing on another character. 5/5 for graphics but the game itself 1/5, I would never recommend this RPG to anyone unless it was free. Otherwise waste of money.. IMO anyway, maybe you will like it.
