Ughhh... Seeing all the positive reviews makes me sad, but I can understand them if people hadnt played the  first two. Dungeon Siege III is well... Not  a Dungeon Siege game... its more like an over the shoulder hack and slash, there are no parties, no character specs, and as far as I know, no real story that follows anything like the first two. I have tried to play this game on multipule occasions but I cannot bring myself to enjoy it. I dont recommend for fans of the series, but I do recommend it if you have never played the first two.
