This game feels awfully similar to Dragon Age II while playing it, though it is a LOT harder. The similarities to Dragon Age II also means that Dungeon Siege III doesnt play even remotely similarly to the previous two DS titles. Its an extremely good game if you can live with the high difficulty level, and because it is so different to the first two DS titles, it is not essential that you play those two games before this one.
