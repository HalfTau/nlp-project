Decent  both good and bad but overall okay.ProsGood story, but a little slow to start. Perhaps this is different if youre familiar with DS lore from previous games. Played them, but must not have been memorable enoughGood voice actingChoices come into play during and at the endSkills and abilities are balancedConsPoor camera control  takes a few hours to get used toQuest system/map isnt well designed. Hard to find some quest lines and others are much too simple and bunched together.Capped level  DLC increases it, but I hate killing stuff and not getting xpSome of the quest lines are a little predictableEquipment is a little all over the place  cant get into details on some stats so youre not sure which piece might be superior
