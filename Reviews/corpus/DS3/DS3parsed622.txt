I have heard both good and bad things about this game. The bad mainly because its not like the other Dungeon Siege games, etc. As I am new to the series and I briefly played this game with a friend on her Xbox 360 I decided to but it for myself.Let me tell, this game was so much fun to play! I usually tend to get some form of lag while playing system games on my laptop, but I got none whatsoever with this game. It was both a refreshing and fun game to play. The level system is simple and easy to use. It was nice just to choose what abilities I wanted to buy or upgrade instead of using a point system to upgrade attack, defense, health points, etc. Your weapons, armor, and accessories decide to what kind of stat points you get.I highly recommend you get a Xbox 360 PC gaming controller from Microsoft check, that where I got mine for like 23 to play this game with. Before I got the controller I spent an hour just trying to map the game commands to the keyboard to my liking but it just didnt work for me. Playing on the keyboard was just too clumsily and ackward.You get to choose from 4 characters to play as. A sword user male, a gun user female, staff/spear user female, and a magic user male. I choose the gun character and as my supporting party member in battle was usually either the sword user or magic user.I am nearly done with the game. I just need to fight the final boss and then my first play through of the game is done. I think this game has a high replayability.I am not disappointed with this game and I will continue to sing its praises. The only thing I am sad about is that I am almost down the my first playthrough of the game and that I will have to start anew with a new character once this storyline is done.Out of a scale of 10, I give this game a 9.
