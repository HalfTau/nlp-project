From playing this for an hour and half I got the impression GPG must have walked up to some Russian/Ukrainian Game Dev. students and said here, we will pay you a bit to make us some random cheapgame to sell do the DS fans to make lots of quick cash! but oh wait, apparently the game IP of dungeon siege is owned by Square Enix now, so no real surprise there...Basically, its a sub standard game. Oh would that steam only had a proper scoring mechanism, but no it takes its scores from meta critic. this was a horrible waste of money.All I can do is recommend the game with the handwrittentyped score of 2/5 bleah.
