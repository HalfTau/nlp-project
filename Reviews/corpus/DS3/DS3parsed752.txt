You need to play this one alone or with three other people and have yourself a controller to fully enjoy the game.Its horrendous to try to play Multiplayer as 2 or 3 people, and incredibly confusing for whatever reason until you hit all four.That aside, its still a very fun, simple yet challenging dungeon crawler with a decent story.Dont pick this game up and expect it to be anything like the original 2 Dungeon Siege games! Play style is no longer the above dungeon crawler but instead a thirdperson crawler with a lot less customization. Each character has their own set of skills that cant be changed.
