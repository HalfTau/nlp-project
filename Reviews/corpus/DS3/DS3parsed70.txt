The game is beautiful, and overall playable. The combat is very clunky though. Attacking roots you in place during the animation, which is used in other games but its very noticeable in this one as there really is no fluid movement between attacking and dodging. The attack animations are very generic as well. Targeting is also very clunky, with all that is happening on screen youll often find youre attacking the wrong direction. The story appears intriguing but is very straight forward. You know from the outset who the big bad is, with very little in the way of twists.Overall its passable as an ARPG, but taking into account the legacy of the franchise, it feels more like a cash grab due to the name than an actual successor.
