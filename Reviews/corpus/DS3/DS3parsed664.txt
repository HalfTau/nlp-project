If you want to play this game after playing the first two, do yourself a favor and keep a good taste in your mouth.  This game is nowhere near the same as the first two.  The games graphics is vastly better than the others but thats about the only thing better about this game.  I tried to enjoy the game but I legit could not get into this game at all like I did the others.  One would think that they would step up their game and not jump off a cliff head first with this one.
