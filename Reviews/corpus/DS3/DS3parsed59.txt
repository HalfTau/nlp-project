Unfortunately, I do not believe I can recommend this game with a clear conscience. Im almost at the end and stopped playing because, frankly, there is nothing in the game that keeps me wanting for more. The story is bland and generic, the combat mechanics  very simplified and trivial and the game world isnt all that interesting. There is nothing here that other ARPGs simply dont do better. Im not saying its not possible to have fun playing the game, its not terrible, but unfortunately Steam does not have a grading system beyond yes/no, and this one is unfortunately more on the no side something of a 4/10.
