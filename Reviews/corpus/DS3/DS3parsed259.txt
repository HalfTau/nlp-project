I wasnt too sure about this game from the start as I like when games stay true to their base. As I started playing I was astounded by the graphics and solid gameplay throughout. The Framerate stays solid with no lag or tearing. Even Mid to low range machines can play this game flawlessly with no issue. With its Steampunk/Anime staging and deeply engaging storyline it is sure to keep you interested all through your journey. With a balanced ablility tree with defensive offensive and passive powers there is no battle you cannot win. The Armor system alone in this game is unique as you have to really think about how to balance your gear for maximum effect. Agility is crucial for critical hits which matters when you come up against higher level opponents so brute force isnt the only answer in all enagements. That alone to me is what keeps this game fresh and unique.
