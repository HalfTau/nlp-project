I never played DS1 or DS2 so based on my unbiased opinion, this game is not as bad as other people seems to say. Its a decent action RPG which has a pretty linear story and location. The map style reminds me of Dragon Age 2, although not as pretty. The story is intriguing and the combat is okay, can be hard when 20 mobs are ganging up on you though.I agree that the camera is quite horrible however there are some camera fix available floating in the internet if you bother to search for it.Overall its a game that I dont mind playing 7/10
