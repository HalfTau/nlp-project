Topdown action adventure. Its okay, not great.The good stuff No glitches, decent storyline, interesting abilities, good comboingThe bad stuff Not many abilities only 9 per character, boring enemy abilities melee or range. No specials.The worst things1. DPS doesnt mean anything in this game. Every description is too vague. Lightning has a moderate chance to do low damage over 2 seconds This is meaningless without number. Most abilities work this way.2. You cant play a mage. Theres no way to just use will to attack, and will powers spells. If you use just abilities, you run out of mana. Then you die because you didnt build attack power, just will. Be a mage and do something every 5 seconds or so maybe.Its fun for a single 8 hour playthrough, but I can pretty much guarantee its not worth a second playthrough.
