First, Ill admit I hardly have over an hour of gameplay in this game. That being said, this game was hard to play due to camera angles! You could not switch the camera, and often this would put you at disadvantage when playing the game. Your character would go behind a wall, or a pillar, and you would not be able to see what was going on. Very annoying!Two of my friends bought this game, hoping to rekindle the great times we had playing Dungeon Defenders, as well as the sequel! This game, however, was not even worth the sale price we paid.
