Great graphics, specially with all the bells and whistles on. The camera though is awful to control and sometimes it may go to the worst angle possible within a fight.A good story to guide you through the game, but nothing memorable as other RPGs out there. Good voice acting though. Dragon Age Origins set a bar for game beginnings, and I think each lead character should have a different start. Ill have to go a second playthrough to see if theres any significant differences between each one.The gameplay needs some getting used to, specially if you go with mouse and keyboard, but it is fun to unleash your powers on mobs of monsters.Overall it is a good game. 7.5/10
