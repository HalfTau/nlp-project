This game pales in comparision to the original Dungeon Sieges, and doesnt do them justice. The game is boring and the plot is contrived. It tries to be Diablo and fails. It never kept me interested.Many other recent RPGs have done much better Skyrim, Witcher 2, Diablo 3, etc, and I suggest you take a look at those and avoid buying this.
