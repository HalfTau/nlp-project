If you played Dungeon Siege 1 or 2 you probably found them both to be beautiful and not overly complex games. Great games to relax with. Dungeon Siege III is so simple it is clearly aimed at 10 year olds. And its super clunky. Its a big waste of money for anyone older. And quite disappointing in general.
