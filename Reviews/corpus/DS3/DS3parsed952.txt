Taken on its own merits the story is interesting, the playable characters are fun, and the combat handles well while keeping the fights difficult.But do NOT expect Dungeon Siege 3 to be like 1 and 2. I am highly annoyed that this is a console port, and would be a great game if not for my expectation of what a Dungeon Siege title should be.The multiplayer is more like Fable 2 than your typical dungeon crawler. You could even compare it to Hunter The Reckoning or Marvel Ultimate Alliance. The biggest weakness here is really that the camera locks your team into a small area of movement on screen while enemies will spawn and attack outside of it. You need to move together, while still blocking and dodging, in order to engage targets.Its no wonder why you only get the single player versions of DS1 and 2 when you buy this, LAN either of those 2 games and you will have a vastly improved multiplayer experience...
