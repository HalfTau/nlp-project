An unfairly maligned game.I understand fans disappointment at the shortcomings of coop mode and series diehards feeling that this strays too far from the DS core, but its really not that bad. Taken on its own as a thirdperson hack n slash RPG Dungeon Siege III isnt too shabby and will leave most genre fans satisfied. Not a fantastic game, but not a terrible one.
