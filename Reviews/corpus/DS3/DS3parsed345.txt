This game  goes into a darn near no win situation on the first boss. If you love being frustrated in less than one hour of gameplay than by all means buy this game. I REGRET BUYING IT NOW AND WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS GAME AT ALL. But then again thats probably why it is so cheap now. What a waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
