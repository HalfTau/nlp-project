Visuals  3/5 theyre actually quite good environmentwise, but character models couldve got some more love. Faces especially.Audio  3/5 no J. Soule this time, but soundtrack is comfy enough not to annoy you. You cant remember it after a game, though.Story  3/5 its not that rich, but its solid enough. You have some plot twists, some choices to make especially depending on your current party partner. The game provides funny allusions to the plots of Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege 2, too. No romance subplots, pity though one book makes a rather straight hint, and the ending video makes another one.Gameplay  3/5 pretty decent fighting system, strange mouse controls were figured out by the end of the tutorial. Id say that the combat suffered more from unclear synergies and information about stats than from somewhat repeated and lackluster buttonmashing. The moves look cool enough.Replay  1/5 only for 100 achievements, Id say. It seems that boredom will eat me for sure, should I decide to replay the game only to win Anjali/Katarina/etc. influence and level up a character up to 20... without any clear rewards item or storywise.In the end, the game seems a decent one to spend money on. Youll get a bit of anything hard fights, decent visuals, some funny dialogs, a bit boring but solid enough story. But you wont get the ideal RPG of all times with 100 in either department.Truth to be said  Ive never seen Dungeon Siege 3 to aspire for such heights, though, so here you are.P.S. dont forget the thaumaturgical analysis of those statues! The closer you are, the more power start emanating... from somewhere. p
