Utter and absoluteIf you liked DS1 and DS2, this contains very few of the elements that game did.This is another Square Enix project grandfathered from Gas Powered Games for example, they have the Supreme Commander franchise, and when they made a sequel to that, it in no way matched up with its prequel. As usual, they trashed it and left us with something that makes you feel physically ill to play.
