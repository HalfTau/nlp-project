no, no, no, oh god no.dungeon siege III is very poor attempt at an rpg with the dungeon siege name slapped on it.The camera system is nearly locked in place, leading to you not seeing enemys.the comat system feel very clunky and delayed, with one click per attack with no option to simply hold the button.the loot system is a bunch of differently named items with the exact same stats just to up numbers of loot.where in the previous titles you could build your own character, in this you are locked to 4 choices.not worth the 3 sale price
