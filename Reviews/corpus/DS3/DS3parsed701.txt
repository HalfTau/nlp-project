Dungeon Siege III takes an interesting and well defined world and shoves it into a blender. The resulting mess is then poured down your throat like the worst karmic payback in the history of mankind. Im only still playing it because I cant get a refund and I want as close to my moneys worth as I can get.I mean this with all honesty when I say that DSIII has ensured that Ill never buy another game in the franchise again. Square Enix should be ashamed of themselves for utterly ruining a wonderful product line and setting with the worst control interface ever designed by human beings.As a matter of fact, I highly doubt the interface was designed by men. I believe that it was, in fact, cribbed from apes.If you have kids, use this foul abomination of a game as punishment. An hour attempting to accomplish anything while the controls actively conspire against you will get your children acting right. Another hour attempting to fight grotesquely overpowered bosses will ensure that they continue to act right.This game gets four stars because thats how many it takes to censor the word I feel most aptly describes it.
