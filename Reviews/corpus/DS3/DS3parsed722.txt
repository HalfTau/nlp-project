Dungeon Siege 3 was my very first foray into the RPG genre of gaming.  Before this game, I was strictly a CoD fan and would only consider FPS games.I received this game free upon the purchase of a nVidia video card, and the coupon stated that a Steam account was required.Not knowing what to expect from the game, I installed it and started playing I picked the female character with the guns.  Little did I know that I became quickly immersed in the game and had a hard time putting it down.I loved the graphics, gameplay was solid, good story line, customizable character powers you pick how you want to level up your character, however the character selection is rather limited.
