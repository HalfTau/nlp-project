This game was pretty terrible. We went from a diablo clone where we all knew what to expect and were fine with it, to a weird hybrid of dungeon crawler and traditional rpg. Unfortunately, the story was atrocious, so it failed in that respect. And the combat was medociore, with clunky controls. In sum this game was a complete failure.
