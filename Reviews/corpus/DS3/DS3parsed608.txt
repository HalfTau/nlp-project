This game wasnt what I expected to buy, however that doesnt make it a horrible game, I would still recommend it. If you ever played Legion Legend of the Excalibur, Baldurs Gate and more on the PS2, as well as Diablo, this game is reminiscent of those gameplay styles but in its own, more simplified fashion. Combat is simple and straightforward, is fun and can keep you entertained throughout most of the game. It does tend to get a little repetitive at times, but swapping allies and changing equipment builds can help ease that. The part thats probably lacking the most is the story, which is the main focus of the game. The story isnt very original, the cutscenes are all flash animated paintings or drawings, hardly ever if at all do you get a closeup of the characters, giving an absence of connection with the story and characters in my opinion. However, Im sure youll be happy killing skeletons, zombies, etc. etc. regardless. Its good to catch on sale, dont pay full price for this game though, its not worth it.
