Read the lore, Play through the entire game play. I believe this was written beautifully. It may not been like the older style of dungeon seige 1 or 2. And the camera could be  a bit better for multiple player. But the game play, graphics, and the story alone surpassses the the two in the past. This game pack quite a challenge base on which character you decide to roll out as. I do hope they make a dungeon seige 4 and keep up the good work. And the ending script is all base on the choices you made. So play multiple times and choose different actions spare someone slay someone else. The choice is yours in the end.
