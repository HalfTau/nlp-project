Wow, i played all of 40 mins of this and was completely blown away at how NOT DS this is.I am a hardcore DS old school gamer, and this is not even remotely DS.The controls are clunky, the camera is clunky, choice of four playable characters, not choice in doing your own thing Combat mage archer!! !.Im glad it came part of the collection and i didnt out right but it... i feel like i got a free game with DS 1 and DS 2 and the free game is pants.I do not recommened this one at all, but the first and second.
