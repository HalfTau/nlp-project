This game is alright. Been playing for 2 hours so far cause I accidentally bought it on amazon a while ago, but yeah, its not bad. People keep saying its ruined the series but I disagree. Then again, I havent played the first two cause they have  graphics.Recommend buying this game? Meh, if youre into this kinda stuff I guess, but Im not a great fan of this genre.Otherwise Id say yes, buy it.
