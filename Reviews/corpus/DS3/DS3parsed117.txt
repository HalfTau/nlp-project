Action RPG. I dont usually buy or play these type RPGs, but I read a review that said the single player campaign was very well written, and well worth the time. It is worth the time, and well written imo. I enjoyed it. And yes, I played the other two DS and liked them as well. I would rate this 4.5 out of 5. If you usually dont play action RPGs, you should try this one, it may change your mind, as long as you understand it is not like the other titles. Not sure why the bad reviews just because it is different than the other two, though it did take me six years to purchase this because it was action and not turn based.
