Its kinda bad, especially compared to the last two. Looting is terrible, multiplayer isnt worth the time considering only the host makes any progress srsly? wtf? The last two games had persistant multiplayer. I also dont like that they split all the gear into seperate characters. It just seemed really unneccessary, and limiting the fun of half the game. Shiney loot. Controls are pretty bad too, but you get used to them. Character acting is bland and the story is uninteresting, and retracking through the same area several times is just boring. I found myself more grinding my teeth than having fun. Ive tried to give it a chance a few times, now Im just sorry I bought it. Maybe if youre really desperate for an new RPG, pick this up. Otherwise, go play something else.
