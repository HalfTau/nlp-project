Cause who doesnt like a good dungeon crawler? This game has loot, skills, specializations, different classes and more. Without having played the previous Dungeon Siege titles, this one just felt like an old classic along the lines of Champions of Norrath. This is a great game for the price. Dont expect Diablo 3 level graphics or skill animations, but it keeps things simple while also offering decent variety.Recently tried the multiplayer. You can join your friends very easily, or play with strangers if you want to. Its annoying that you cant save your character if you join a friend, but the game saves that character for you so you keep the abilities and gear that you collect. Still, very fun to play with a friend and a great game in my opinion.
