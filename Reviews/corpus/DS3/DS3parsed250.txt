Dungeon of Fable 3  Diablo is anything but a Dungeon Siege game, you get loot with every kill and there are so many treasure chests it makes you wonder the meaning of the word treasure. The combat is a farcry from the originals and you can only play as premade characters all of which are humans. Truly a step backwards in the franchise, but what can you expect after such a long time between sequels.So why am I giving this a positive review ? Simple, its a good game, just not what yould expect of a true Dungeon Siege title.
