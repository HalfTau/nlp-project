If you played the first two Dungeon Siege games and are a huge fan of them, youll probably have issues with this game. It goes in a very different direction away from the Diablo style click to a hack and slash style game. I didnt take issue with the change to different format of combat, but where it really fell flat was in the skill trees. The skills were really dumbed down, all your stats to improve your charecter are now just the gear and nothing else. For RPS players who like depth this will be very dissapointing.Aside from the change in combat and the dumbed down skill trees. This game is good in my opinion, not great but good. It has an interesting story. The combat is fun,and pulls you in at times. I would recomment playing with a friend at this game does have local coop.Its not a game that most people will play for months or years, but if you are planning a day with a friend this will fill the bill. Great story, good graphics and decent combat. If you were hoping for a really deep combat system and skill tree sadly you wont find it hear. But if you are just looking for a fun time. This should suit you just fine
