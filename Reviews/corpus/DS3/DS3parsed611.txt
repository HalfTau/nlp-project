If you dont mind playing a watered down ARPG that is nothing like the previous Dungeon Siege games.. playing it coop with some friends an obvious console port controller recommended the horrible camera angles...Then you might be able to have some fun.I played this coop, on the couch, with a controller, in a few sessions and I actually enjoyed this game for what it is.There, I said it.
