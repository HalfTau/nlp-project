ProsExcellent graphicsDeep and fun storylineExcellent voice acting on almost all npcsCreative and fun skills, abilities and execution of themConsImpossible to play without gamepad smooth as silk with one thoughCan only use one companion at a time sighNot much in gear visual changes when getting new equipment weapon only noticeble visual change when upgradingOverall still worth the play just for the characters and storyline. Just really miss the feel of having that group of characters at one time. Choosing just one companion for situations feels so limiting. Excited to keep playing through which has been rare for me lately on other games.
