A fun little couch console aRPG, you play as one of four preset characters a tanky knight, an elfish kind of thing, a ranged gunner, and a mage set on restoring the glory of the 10th legion of Ehb. The game can be quite unbalanced for the melee knight due to some difficult ranged enemies and bosses, and the games difficulty fluctuates a little. But its overall a fun corridor shooter RPG kind of game. Ive been playing it with the Xbox 360 controller, with Lucas the tank and the combat is very satisfying and challenging!Dont approach this from the epic RPG point of view, rather a more dynamic Diablo or Torchlight where you dodge and block, and that is played with a controller. Only then will you have all the fun!There are also some choices that you can make throughout the game that affect the epilogue after the one ending. Id recommend you buy it for 5 or 7.5 or something, great fun for that price!
