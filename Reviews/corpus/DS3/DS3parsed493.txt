I will never upvote or recommend a game that doesnt allow you to save.My first play through I didnt have a lot of time so I messed around trying to learn which character I wanted to play then after spawning in, I quit out to go run some errands. The games firs check point doesnt even occur after you choose a character and spawn in.A little further down this path there is the estate you are traveling to. A save checkpoint ok not too bad I guess. Ten minutes later after entering the estate and having my first encounter and first task given by another I quit out to get something to eat.Come back to it? Im way back at the beginning of entering the estate... lol wtf?Im not a big fan of the controls. In fact theyre so borked Im not even gonna try and describe them. Suffice to say its not a typical HnS ARPG where you highlight somethign with the mouse and then attack it. You have to actually have the character facing it. This means you have to hold down MMB constantly in a fight. Strafing is worthless because its not actually strafing. Pressing left or right strafe actually faces and moves your character to the left or right. Its a rightleft movement key. Not a true strafe.The only game series to get third person right was the first two Batman games.Waste of money even at five bucks for the franchise pack. Complete waste.
