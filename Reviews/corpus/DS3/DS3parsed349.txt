This game is much harder the Diablo 3.  Sure, Diablo 3 has more chaos and effects onscreen, but it just isnt that demanding in terms of tactics unless you go up several Torment levels.  Dungeon Siege III demands that you react quickly and use both fightings modes with their associated abilities properly.But beware, just like Diablo, theres a bit of grinding involved, especially if you want better gear.Basically, if you like Diablo 3 but wish it required a little more skill, then I highly recommend Dungeon Siege III.
