Combat has few buttons but is hard to master.No doubt, that fans of Dungeon Siege I and II was dissapointed so much with this game.Because here in order to win, you have to participate and not just click your way.Kiting welcomes you at boss fights and higher difficulties.I remember you, Palefang, to get back to you at higher level!Coop is fun, and fixed camera even helps to find your mate, so no way Im unlocking it using console.Because no one gets lost, and you should stick together anyway.Im playing as Lukas in Coop and blocking actually helps a lot, and often I ress my teammate if anything happens, and keep tanking.This game in Coop is like Dungeons in WoW, but only 2 people is enough.Also, to save progress of Player 2, host should save to steam. For this case, save menu has special button ingame, at the bottom of the save window  steam saves. So save there and all the inventory and talent build will be saved for both players.If player 1 wants to play singleplayer, and got huge level, then player 2 may join him in multiplayer while getting boost to the same level as player 1.Do I recommend Dungeon Siege III?Yes!
