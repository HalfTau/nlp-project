Game is ok, but not great. Its decent enough to play but with so many coop options that exist these days, this mediocre game just doesnt stick out. Still has its own merits but is nothing speacial. Recommending it merely because its not a bad game, and I did enjoy myself, but only get if it is on sale and you have a weekend with little else to do.Overall Rating 6.5/10
