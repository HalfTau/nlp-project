If you look at the other reviews, a lot of them are extreme fans of the previous 2 installments and cannot cope with the game changes in this one. Dungeon Siege 3 is actually a pretty decent game, its kinda like RPGlite but with a bit more background lore to it. Anyway, Im having fun with the game and I think I could easily see it through to the end
