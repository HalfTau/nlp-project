Graphically beautiful but with clunky controls. Dungeon Siege III is a vast departure from the long in depth story of Dungeon Siege 1  2. Dungeon Siege III is a focused linear story line played in cutscene and with quick gameplay. The characterization is well done but of the 4 player character choices it is clear that Lucas and Anjali have the advantage. A decent hack and slash for the 610 hours it would take to finish. Worth the purchase on Steam Sale if you are looking for an experience similar to  Diablo a time constraint.
