Wow. I have been a big DS fan, I still own 1 and 2 the games in there cd covers and cases, but this....this is just so wrong. The controlls are wonky as all hell. Theres no chacter creation. I mean 1 and 2 it wasnt the best but you still made your chacter and played your made chacter. I liked how DS 1 and 2 did there classless progression, but this. This has premadewith classess. I just cant get over how bad the controls are. And yes you see that right I havent even played the game 5 mins. Its that bad. Maybe it gets better but I have no care to see it do that. So for now im giving it a 0/10
