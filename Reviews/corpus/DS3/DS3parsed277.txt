if you are someone someone who has played this entire series, I do not recommend.This game is nowhere near as good as the installment before this.I liked it, yes, but it did not succeed the DS series at all in my eyes. better off being named something else.As for the newer players of this series, I reccomend playing this or the original first.pros good story. good gameplay at least when you modify settings. easier on new players.cons odd default controls. no wheres near as much character diversity as the 2nd. too linear in challenges. as in simple to solve problems.summaryI did enjoy this game, but the dissappointment I had with this was too high to enjoy this as much as I could have.I give 6/10if there was a neutral rating I would give it that.
