This game is nothing like the orginal two games. This game was consolized in a bad way. The entire game can be won by roll attack rolling. This game has no challenge the old two games had. No thinking power is required. In my honest opinion this game is at most worth 5 dollars. I would not have bought this game if I knew that they destroyed what made Dungeon Siege a great series.
