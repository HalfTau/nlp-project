Its the best Diablolike experience I had in years since Titan Quest. It plays really smoothly, landscapes and enemies change constantly, every other room you find/buy better gear for yourself and your companion, the game is also quite a looker! A single playthrough took me about 35 hours so thats also quite nice for a modern title. Different classes are very...different  I finished the game with a warrior, now Im replaying it with Lara Croft a rogue who uses double pistols and its already something else.Now for the warnings its consolised so make sure you play it using a 360 gamepad because it sucks with mouse and keyboard Im a PC gamer at heart but this didnt bother me at all, in fact a pad is implemented really good  all the menus function great, there are useful shortcuts too, its also very different than the prequels so just treat it as a new title with no expectations ok? All in all its very arcady  thats why I love it! Thats all, quite a pleasant surprise!
