I am writing this as a recommendation to STAY AWAY from this title. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two DS tiltes but this one really  on the series. The control scheme has been revamped which is okay but the moving camera does its best to make this unplayable. The targeting system is absolutely horrendous and adds to the already difficult boss fights. I almost never NOT finish a game I start but the stink of consoleitis was just too much to bear. Its unfortunate because theres a good game under here. It looks great and I love loot hunting but the controls and camera are AWFUL. Im bummed and I hope those who read this dont waste their  on this like I did. Hell, youd be better off watching the Dungeon Siege movie than playing this. AVOID AVOID AVOID.
