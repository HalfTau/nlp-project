This isnt like the old Dungeon Siege games, theyve gone for an action RPG this time.I wasnt sure at first but after getting hold of the controls I really liked it. Dont get me wrong, the game isnt perfect but the combat is smooth and quite challenging. The boss fights so far have been hard but not unfair and quite diverse. I might have wanted a few more skills and spells to choose from but the story and combat is enough for me to forget about that and enjoy the game.Not game of the year but worth the money and your time.
