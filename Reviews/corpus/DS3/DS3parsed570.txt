Graphics? Acceptable. Sounds? Fair enough. Gameplay? Pretty bad with keyboard and mouse, so I switched to a controller, a bit better. So Im playing this game, only on normal difficulty, and I keep asking myself Why do I even bother? Even though Ive purchased this game, I have absolutely zero intention of playing it again. I just cant get into it. Let alone the tedious walking from point A to point B, the respawning monsters and/or the loot system which isnt very good either, the controls just kill it for me. I know my character isnt bad equipped, yet I keep dying because of control issues bad response time, etc.... I just cant recommend this game.
