Underrated good action RPG, give this game a chance!Most of the bad review were from people who expected a different game. Taken on its own, its surprisingly good.It still looks gorgeous in 2015 and combat is fun with a gamepad.Quite linear but good main story and plenty of side quests to explore the world, I enjoyed my time there!The ending explained the results of choices made through the game, felt satisfying
