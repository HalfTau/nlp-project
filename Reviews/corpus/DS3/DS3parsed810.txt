Even though this game is a few years old, the graphics are still crisp. Now, a downside to this game is that theres only one way to really fast travel between locations, and those are limited. Within any given area/city/etc youll be going back and forth from one end of the map to another multiple times, and the enemies will respawn within a few moments so the maps are never clear of baddies. That aside, the game is still very playable, with easy to pick up controls, a good story and nicely written characters.
