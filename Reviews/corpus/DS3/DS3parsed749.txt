Bad game....literally bought it on day one expecting good things as i liked the others....the loot system here is so BROKEN, literally picked up an item within the first item that was THE BEST item in the game.....loot doesnt scale with you, and its all the same over and over and over....and then lets talk about the mobs, literally just backflip and shooting off screen all day because of severe bad balancing....bosses are a joke, small mobs are harder then these things.....graphics are okay but I dont rally care if everything looks cool, I like to have fun playing a game...oh yea, the save game feature IS GARBAGE...omfg it is a joke...
