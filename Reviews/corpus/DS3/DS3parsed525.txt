Probably the most important info about this game is This is not hackslash. This is pure action gameThis is not continuation of old Dungeon Siege by any standard.When I first played this I thought to myself  what the heck is wrong with this?!I played with keybord and mouse and I was completely confused by the camera and controls.There are only three or four classes with pretty much no room for customization.I stopped after half and hour and felt cheated but...After few moths I gave this another try. Now I was prepared.I grabbed proper gamepad, took the class with the lady that hold rifles, pistols and shotguns and...I was blown away.This is extremely fun action game. Its very challenging. Boss fights are probably the best part.Graphic are beatiful and get better the longer You play.I understand that this might be not game for everyone especially for those rooted in HS reality but If You like pure action and Your gamepad literally burning under your fingers give it a try.
