This game is nothing like its predecessors, but its amazing in its own right. There are so many different choices to make, so many different outcomes, a freeform hackandslash type of combat system, and so much lore that it can make your head spin. If you are a fan of deeply engaging stories, then this is definitely a game to try. You can play through as one of four main characters, getting the rest as partners along the way, each with their own attitudes, fighting styles, and things they agree with. You can switch between your partners at will, and they add to the story as you play through, with different pieces of insight or comments they make. The gear is completely random, but not overly terrible. There is also a nice multiplayer feature where you can host your own private game or join in a public one, although you only have access to the gear the owner has acquired as it is their game youre playing. All in all, a fantastic game with a lot of lore and plenty of replay value.
