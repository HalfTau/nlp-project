Has nothing to do with a good action RPGgame. The controls are totally designed for a controller pad and not for a classic mouse  keyboard setting. It feels very iffy and unprecise. Also the way you deveolpe your character is even more linear than in Diablo 3 after release. You just take every skill at the end  because there arent much anyway  and then just choose between 2 upgrade options. There is no real freedom in that game at all, but this is what defines a good RPG. I dont mean freedom storywise that isnt really necessary, as linear stories can be as good as nonlinear. But the way you approach that game in terms of gameplay is the worst Ive seen in years. I payed 3 Euros for it at the Humble store and it was still too much money for a that game. Casual console gamers maybe could enjoy this but this game should have nevert been ported to the PC.
