I bought this game when it first came out on the consoles. I was excited for it, as I was a big DS II fan. However this game plays nothing like its predecessor. That was a dungeon crawler similar to Neverwinter or even a team orientated Diablo. This is more of a straight action game. Each person has two weapons, and that is it. You never get a different type of weapon for them, only upgrades. What this means is combat is the same for the duration of the game. You do aquire different abilties, but that is about it. That would be fine if the combat was fun, however it never really managed that for me. In the last DS game you had a wide creative range on how to build your hero, in this one you are forced into a path depending on which avatar you want to play. If each hero had a unique story mode this might be worth it, however they all follow the same quests and maps. The only real difference is some conversation options, and a few videos. Think left 4 dead or dead island, there are different characters but the story is the same for everybody.I got this game on steam for free, so I installed it hoping after not playing DS II for years I would be more receptive to it. Not the case, the same issues still bother me. It feels like a shallow game to me, and a wasted opertunity. If you played the first two games, pass on this one. It will just bother you how different it feels.
