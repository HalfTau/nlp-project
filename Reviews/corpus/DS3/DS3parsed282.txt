RECOMMENDED  HIGHLY NOT, you shall not pass, run you foolsReasons All version about Dungeon Siege on Steam are cursed.Dungeon Siege 1 is incomplete no addon Legend of Aranna, no multiplayer and cut end game scene.Dungeon Siege 2 is incomplete no addon Broken Worlds, no multiplayer and cut end game scene.Dungeon Siege 3 is pure joke and will never be Dungeon Siege.Stay as so far as you can from Steam versions about that serie.If you own boxed version, play it about 1  2. Do legal copies to keep them safe and never sold these jewels because they cost a lot to buy online.
