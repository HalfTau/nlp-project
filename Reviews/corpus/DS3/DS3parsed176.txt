Ok so I deleted my previous review since it was a 20 page review... I will just keep it simple this time. Ever played The Witcher? Well this game is exactly like The Witcher 1 same mechanics, go around the village doing side quest for villagers and main quests that have to be done in order to progress. This game is very detailed very nice graphics music and controls are tight enough, my only problem with this game is that it has a level limit, meaning you will never obtain all abilities and spells, and whats worse is that the level limit is very low, you will reach it way before the game ends in case you have Treasures of the Sun. Just for that 7/10 if it werent for that I would rate it an easy 9/10GRAPHICS 10/10 Really amazing and very detailed, almost like Vagrant Story or Dark Souls.Best part about the game IMO, even the swamp area which I always hated inprevious Dungeon Siege games was amazingly done in this gameSOUND 8/10 Nice music and sounds not as memorable as Final Fantasy OST but good enough like any other decent RPG game, reminded me alot of Legacy of Kain seriesCONTROLS 4/10 The controls are simply broken, just plug a gamepad and it will solve it,that is if you get the gamepad to work properly, xinput should helpSTORY 9/10 Really good story, lots of interaction with player and lots of cameos fromprevious titlesGAMEPLAY 4/10 This game couldnt decide what it wanted to be, if a common RPG or a hack and slash dungeon crawler, the camera is fine even if others say its broken itsexactly broken like the rest of the other Dungeon Siege titles, the level capkills the game totally if you ask me, also the multiplayer mode is broken,only the host gains significant things and the screen is shared like GauntletLegendsOVERALL 7/10 The DLC is really nice, the graphics and story are enticing just that is enough for some.BTW I DID FINISH THE GAME EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS I PLAYED ONLY 3 HRS
