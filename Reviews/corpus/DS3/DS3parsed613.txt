This game is not like its predecessors.  They changed too much.The camera, wow worst implementation of a camera I ahve experienced.Getting through the menus is a pain in the The controls, UI, AI, quests, everything is clunky ugly boring and confusing.I never imagined a game series could be so easily ed up. I found nothing I like about this game. Thankfully it was dirt cheap at 95 off and I wasted only 1.50
