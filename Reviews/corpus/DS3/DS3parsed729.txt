I got bored with this rather quick. I loved the original Dungeon Siege game but I felt like I was doing more running around than anything else with this release. In addition, I found the games POV annoying in a lot of movement and combat situations. If you like RPGs Id recommend looking elsewhere from something a bit more enjoyable to play.
