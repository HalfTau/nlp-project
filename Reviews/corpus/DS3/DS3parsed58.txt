I didnt like the controls or the way the the camera works. It has this auto rotation feature which makes it hard to click on the spot you want. The items you pick up are typically garbage and you cant really grind. The end game is essentially a dodge fest where you get instant killed and has to fight against the awful controls.Also the multiplayer is really stupid, you can only join and help the host essentially, no benefit to your character in anyway.
