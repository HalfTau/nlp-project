This game is great! I got it on a sale because Ive heard good things about the series for over a decade. I never really got into the other games, but I bought this one because I noticed that it was done by Obsidian. Im glad I did because I really enjoyed this game. The story isnt anything great, but it works for the game. The gameplay is where I had the most fun. Its not complicated at all. The simplicity of this game is really great because I dont always want to get mykicked by every game I play. It was really enjoyable just to enjoy the fun story and gameplay without all of the micromanagement of Diablo or similar games. The game is totally worth the price especially if it comes on sale.
