Just finished this on the easiest level. Yes, I thought the interface was somewhat frustrating. But the story was awesome, and games with random equipment of a zillion combinations are almost necessary to me. The camera swirling around was kind of annoying, plus using the keyboard and mi keys on occasion was too. But heck, you are killing some pretty scary monsters, so I figure the dubious interface helps model the fact that we arent all level 30 warriors with super agility.I did have to cheat a bit to beat the tougher bosses, that is look up which techniques work well. Which is good, the games difficulty was appropriate for me. I would recommend this game to RPG fans, but suggest a demo if you are picky about camera views and so on.Comparing this to DS I and II  I liked the story line better, but the interface was kind of sketchy as noted. I felt more like I was following the character around from behind, as opposed to DS1 and DS2 where it seemed you were overhead like a god of some sort.
