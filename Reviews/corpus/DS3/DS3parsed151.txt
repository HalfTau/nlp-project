OK, I give up.Ive started to play it now, no matter what reviews are.More than five years after releaseOn maximum difficulty. Played as Katarina.Mapped controls for strafe, quick inventory etc.Downloaded  instatalled the console.Adjusted player speed, otherwise player movement is toooo slooowplayeradditivespeed 7modalcloseallBut.. Stuck on Master Thief boss fight.. Ehregott?Previous bosses were nasty, but this one..OMG, he does damage 1000 with debuff on a distance before animation draws.This is probably the worst OBSIDIAN game Ive ever played.It designed badly. Persisten camera problems, the console doesnt really help.Spend twothree hours only trying to defeat that boss..Its not fair. In Dark Souls series if you die  it is your fault.Here  is quite different story. this Im out of here.
