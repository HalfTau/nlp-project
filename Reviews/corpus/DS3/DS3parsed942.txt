PC controls are a bit jacked up which is why I went out and bought a wired 360 controller. The game is much easier now. Wont seem to work with any other pc controllerThe game lacks character customization which i came to believe was standard with most games these days.I would like to see top down view as a choice for camera angle.Great stoyline keeps me interested in whats going to happen.Choices made within the game effect the outcome of the story making it that much more unique.. to an extent, this is not the first game to allow choices in game.Sidequests are available however i would like to see a few more.Graphics even on the lowest setting look fantastic, runs smooth on laptops i5 until it gets hot and needs to cool for a bit8/10
