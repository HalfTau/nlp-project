Absolutely great hacknslash action game. Pleasant graphics, interesting characters, great atmoshere and an ok story, but most importantly  the gameplay is very dynamic and thrilling and, even though its quite simple and repeateative, like of any actionRPG, it doesnt ever tire, cause consecution of fights, exploring and dialogs is designed so that nothing feels too excessive.The difficuly is made most perfectly challenging totally insane on hardcore, I advise against playing it solo, yet no cheap pish like stunlocks, unavoidable blows, invincible enemies and QTE, so loved by nowadays developers. Everything is hard, but fair. The control is quite good too  makes you really feel that you are in charge of what your character is doing and it can be made to work just fine with keyboard and mouse after some rebinding.I would easlily give this game 8/10 and disregard the amount of negative feedback  most of it comes from fans of previous Dungeon Sieges, who dislike the fact that this one is nothing like them. And if you decide to add a few bux and buy a whole bundle, you can see that its not at all a bad thing.
