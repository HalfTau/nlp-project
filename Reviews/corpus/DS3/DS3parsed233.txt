Its the least dungeon siege of the series, but its still fun to play. I am almost done with the main storyline.pros Fun boss battles enjoyable combat awesome graphics great action combat perfect with 360 controllercons Its sublinear design is annoying. Its like its linear, but has options, and the quest flow will end up forcing you through long boring journeys to finish up meaninless quests. the viewpoint can be frustrating. Sometimes in caverns the view will get obstructed, which gets frustrating. The storyline feels pretty meaningless, as if they tried hard to write it but it just fell flat on its face. I think my eyes rolled pretty hard when they told me that the dvarves made magic fans in the caves. Yeah magic fans.no fast travel. This sucked pretty bad when you complete quests and have to go back to a place to finish a small quest. the difficulty was rather nonsensical at times. I am playing on hardcore, but only some of the bosses are difficult, some are kind of difficult, but alot of them I can literally just run around while my companion does all the work. pretty lame.Conclusion Its a great game to get on sale, and its pretty fun to play with a controller. Other wise, just play the other two dungeon sieges.
