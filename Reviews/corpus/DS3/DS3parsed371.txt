Bottom line If you enjoyed DS1 and DS2, dont expect the same from DS3.Its nothing new. There have been games like this before, but it is nothing at all like Dungeon Siege 1 or 2. Baulders Gate did this with some console games and they were similarly shallow compared to its progenitors. This game was designed to bring DS to console which was a mistake for the franchise IMO. Controls are simplified and there is no more party tactics playstyle and very little character customization beyond choosing your gear. That said, if you like this type of game then give it a shot. Its relatively well finished and mostly balanced some issues introduced with expansion. Not a lot of replay value and no higher difficulty reruns like in DS2.The leveling up system allows SOME customization, but at the end you unlock all of the skills. You can customize individual abilities for special effects, but after you find the core skills for your play style and max them out, it becomes a chore to level up.Only get the expansion for this if you got it in the bundle which I dont like because it doesnt have the expansion for DS2.
