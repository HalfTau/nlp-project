This game doesnt deserve the dungeon siege title. In fact, that may be the whole reason I hate it. NOTHING Dungeon Siege is in this game, the leveling, skills, pet system EVERYTHING Dungeon Siege has been gutted from it and replaced by an ok hack and slash. I was hoping when I heard of this that it was just going to be a hack and slash DS game. Which I dont mind I love the ARPG genre and have played tons of them with my friends and family. I loved the DS genre even more. Mashing the two  into would seemed easily doable in my mind and would give me another game to spend hundreds of hours replaying with my friends and family. Sadly that was not even close to the case. I really dont understand gaming companies anymore, lopping the head off of their success and replacing it when a watermellon trying to convince themselves its just as good if not better that way.... RIP DS... I loved you truely.
