As a Diabloeque hack  slasher, Dungeon Siege III is far from the usual fare youve come to expect from Obsidian. While the game is fairly linear, where forks in the main path usually means loot chests or side missions, choices being reflected in the epilogue was a nice touch and a welcomed addition.Instead of building a party, you only control 1 character with 1 other character deployed as an AI companion. Combat involves mixing up the 9 skills, and their empowered variety the stances switching and constant dodging reminded me a little of Bastions combat.The game is pretty and practically glitchfree. It is a shame that the beautiful character models were rarely showcased as the dialogue camera never panned over to your character, other than in the DLC. Other mild annoyances are the slowish walk speed and restrictive camera pitch.One feature they did retain from the Dungeon Siege brand was the huge continuous world. Its quite amazing how the lack of loading screens can add to the enjoyment of a game.All in all, I can understand why Dungeon Siege fans condemn it and others bemoan its console dumbdown. Dungeon Siege III seems to suffer from the recent trend of being a decent game but also a bad entry in a franchise, however it should still be an enjoyable distraction for a budget price.NOTE probably best played on a gamepad
