I can recommend this game for people who are looking for a good single player dungeon crawler. But for those who are looking for a cooperative adventure, dont come here. The coop mode in this game is completely useless, you come in as kind of like a placeholder for the companion you have in the single player. You dont gain levels, or loot, or anything of value, its a onesided help to the host. The story is decent enough to continue to play for a while, but because of the fact that dungeon crawlers are lonely by nature, the game loses luster unless you are completely commited to the game. If you really want to play the game get it. But not at full price.
