The graphics are fairly pretty, the gameplay is solid and the optimisation  stability is great.Why do I give it a thumbs down then?The story is BORING. Not just boring, but BORING in capital letters. After only 8h Im already 3/4 finished yet nothing interesting happened and character development is quasiabsent, in the end you just cant get yourself to bother about the plot or the characters.Because of that I stopped playing, farming for badger hides in a mmorpg feels more epic than this story...
