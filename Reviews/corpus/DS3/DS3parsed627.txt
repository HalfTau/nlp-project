Dungeon Seige 1  2 were fun. Dungeon Seige 3 is graphically beautiful, has a reasonable story line, nice music, but is otherwise clunky, confusing, annoying and frustrating. The controls are awkward and clunky to use, particularly when trying to implement special abilities. The skill tree is confusing. Combat is frustrating. Camera control is an exercise in continual annoyance. Item stats are confusing to the point of being meaningless. A huge disappointment. Would not recommend this game to anyone. Period.
