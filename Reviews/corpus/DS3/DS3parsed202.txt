This is not what I was expecting from a Dungeon Siege game. Not getting what I was expecting is often a good thing, but this time it left me wishing the game had more personality.  I found the mechanics to be mostly a combination of right clicking constantly and occassionally hitting a heal and kiting until I had enough health to run back and repeat the proceedure.The most dissapointing aspect for me was the gear.  Very uninspired in both name and function, wierd names even.This game would be an okay time killer if it werent Dungeon Siege III.  It deserved better than this.
