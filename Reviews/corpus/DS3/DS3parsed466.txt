played offline a lot and at school so my game time is wrongNOTHING LIKE THE DS1 OR DS2!The game looks good and plays okay...well aslong as you play single player for that i give it a 7/10 points for  pc controls since i cant be botherd to pay another 30 euro for a good controler. Still playable though but its a lot harder to walk around definatly remap the keys Also NO POTIONS ANYMORE???? wich is really strange...Now the multiplayer is where the mayor problems are. Your charecters are restricted to 1 screen so you cant just walk away and do something on your own this is fixable with an unofficial patch Only the host can interact with NPCs for quests so as p2  p4 you cant do  your just like an AI prettymuch.YOU CANT PLAY AS YOUR OWN CHARECTER ON SOMEONE ELSES GAME!You join someone else and you have to play as Insert charecter you play but the version on their pc so if you actually want to do a fun mp game you really have to start from the start as MP then continue together every time which is horrible especialy if your not playing on the same machine with controlers.For the multiplayer i would probably give it a 4/10Dont buy this if you want to really have a fun multiplayer experiance atleast not for pc for singleplayer only its okay though.
