I enjoy most Square games, usually give them a shot, this one was no different. It just took me longer to get into the games story than I would have liked. Four unique characters all having unique play styles, but all of which feel bland at first. This tends to hold true for most of the game, whether its character or story telling, it starts off slow, gradually improving.There is nothing ground breaking about the style presented, nothing new about killing for loot and moving on. The level design left something to be desired, and the mini map was not very helpful at times, and certain stats were never quite explained without delving into the help section of the game. The combat was fun, if not slow at first, as you learn to dodge and block and to use your two stances. One for single enemy combat and the other for Groups. This holds true to all four characters, even if they have vastly different abilities, they are still grouped into group or single combat. The AI partner never bothered me and seemed to do thier job fairly well as the game progressed. There are also dialogue choices that affect your current companions trust in you, not as in depth as Mass Effect or other bioware games, but pretty alright. You can also unlock deeds through this and completing certain tasks, which give permanent stat boosts, which I found rewarding.By the end I found the story to be quite alright, envolving and engaging enough to feel rewarded after it was all said and done. I ended up liking the character customization by the end, even if, like I said, it took awhile for the ball to get rolling. All in all, a decent game, well worth any marked down price its given, and certainly not the worst hack n slash loot fest Ive ever played by far.
