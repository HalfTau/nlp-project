tldrranting below/tldrPros Hack and Slay Lots of loot  Kind of like Dungeon Siege Fitting, coherent art style graphics are not the best, but that was never a thing in any DS game Runs surprisingly well, not a single crash on Win10/Nvidia GTX970/Intel i52500k, not even when hibernating the PC while playingCons Only kind of like Dungen Siege Annoying subtitles camera angle The old DS games had the same problem controls I played Kat with a keyboard and mouse and it worked well for most partsPutting all the negative reviews, if you play it long enough to deal with the camera angle you actually get an enjoyable game. It felt like it could have been a bit more, but then again it wasnt particularly bad and there was a lot of stuff to do. Its state actually reminded me a lot of Risen 3.
