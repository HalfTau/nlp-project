I have to say this is the few RPG game that I finished, Which include Van Helsing and both Torchlight. Have to say one of the best RPG experience I ever play, If youre a fan of DS I or II dont even bother with the storyline, just go with the flow and enjoy the gameplay if youre into ARPG.But the game also have a flaw to be honest, I Rage and QQ while battling Jayne over her Overpowered move and teleportation, she is even harder and much more irritating than the final boss, This has to be the poor build boss to be honest, just a poor disappointment.But if I want to recommend this game? I would say yes, But the score that I willing to give is 7.5/10
