Ive played all three dungeon siege games, and have enjoyed all of them to various extents. While dungeon siege 3 abandons the somewhat abstract party system of previous titles in favor of a more arcady action style dungeon hack, it still does quite well.Overall, I enjoy dungeon siege 3. As a standalone dungeon hack it is reasonably fun, with a moderately strong story, reasonably diverse and active combat, decent visuals, and a fairly straightforward and accessible UI/interface. There is lore to collect, items to upgrade, a nottoocomplicated inventory system and what I would consider to be mediumstrength character levelup options skills and powers and whatnot.This is all single player. Coop varies tremendously based on a single issue  out of the box, all coop characters are tethered  the game plays in a topdown isometric view, and out of the box, all players playing together up to 4 must all be fit within the same camera area.  Its crazy.However, moderately simple console commands that you can look up onlineallow you to untether the game camera, allowing all coop players to move around the map independently. This is, in my opinion, a TREMENDOUSLY better way to play the gamesadly, the game only bears a passing homage to the original dungeon siege mentions of various characters and locations are tied into the storyline, but have littletono impact and absolutely no discernable connection to dungeon siege 2 which is okay, as ds2 bore almost no connection to ds1, which was a little annoying  but I digressall in all, I love this game.  While limited in scope, its a betterthancompetent dungeon hack, and suprisingly fun coop online that seems to function pretty well  easily worth 510 us, and quite possibly worth more depending on whether you have friends that like to coop with you online, I not only recommend this game but I actually quite like it
