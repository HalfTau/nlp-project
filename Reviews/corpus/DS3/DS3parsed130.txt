Single Player Review  It is a shame that so many people gave this game a negative review just because it wasnt what they expected. Check thier playtime and most of the negative reviewers didnt even give it one hour. I think the game is pretty good. It has good graphics with interesting environments, the gameplay is fun even though it can get a bit repetitive,There is a lot of skill upgrades you can make to your character and a lot of armor and gear to aquire. You can choose one NPC to join you on your journey and they are really helpfull. It doesnt have any bugs that I noticed. The replay is ok too because you can try a different style of hero on your next playthrough. Its pretty easy most of the time but some of the bosses will really challenge you.I have so many games that I start but struggle to finish because they are not that fun. I keep playing DS3 so that is most important thing for me. The expansion adds a few hours of content and some decent gear  too. If i had to point out some flaws, I would say the shops should have some uber gear that you can work towards getting. You will end up with a ton of gold and nothing to really spend it on. Also, A town portal scroll would have been nice and  some of the character models are not done that well. But these things dont really take away from the game. Overall, I give this game a 7.5 out of 10. Its worth playing.
