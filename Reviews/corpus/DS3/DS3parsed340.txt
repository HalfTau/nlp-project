This game gets a lot of slack for whatever reason and I dont get it. While I didnt play the previous Dungeon Siege games, I have played a few dungeon crawlers in my day. While this one I wouldnt say is AAA good, I will say it was an enjoyable experience.ProsGraphicsUnique CharactersDecent Combat SystemDecent length roughly 20 hoursConsThe loot isnt as good as it could beNo way to drop items must be sold at a shop to remove from inventoryThe controls without a controller feel a bit off W,A,S,D to move instead of traditional click with the mouse to moveDialogue while decently VAed, theres a little too much to go around making you want to skip it.Overall worthy of giving a try if you like games like Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc.
