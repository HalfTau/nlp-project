This played like a blend of Diablo 3 and Dragon Age. It is a pretty standard RPG  build yourself up, save the world, sort of deal. The graphics are lovely, and visually pleasing, but most of the world is standard fair but very well done. I really enjoyed the combat, except for the camera mechanics. They know how to make worthy boss fights too, and keep the difficulty at a good level. Most bosses took a few tries to get past, a few were smooth, and several took many attempts. The length of boss fights was plenty long  it felt like a BOSS fight since youd be battling for 515mins, instead of blasting them down super fast. Normal mode kept me on my toes, but wasnt gruesomely painful  which is how I like normal modes. I think the weakest point is the character development, for there really isnt much. There are a few fun phrases, but nothing to make you glom onto the characters and love them as you would in Dragon Age. 7.5/10, would recommend to RPG adventure fans easily.
