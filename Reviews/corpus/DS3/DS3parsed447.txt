A lot of peopleand moan about this game in the reviews, and I can understand why. The game plays nothing like either of the first two titles, and is quite restricted in what you can customize about your character. That aside this is a really damned fine RPG, and the story is very much equal to the other Dungeon Siege titles. Available quests and in game lore pay a great deal of tribute to those titles as well. The biggest complaint I have for this one is the camera is really restricted in how far you can move it and zoom, there are a couple quick fixes available on the net that will remove this though, and that makes the game much better by itself. Locations and characters are quite beautifully done, and the voice acting is very good. The only real negative to this game is that the story cut scenes are basically poorly drawn stills with narration.
