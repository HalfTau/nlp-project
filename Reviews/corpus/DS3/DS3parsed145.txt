This game is a huge let down, as I was very excited to start playing it after completing the previous two dungeon siege games.Instead of it being a true open world game where you are free to  explore vast areas, you have to go down narrow passageways to get to anywhere on the map.The storyline is boring and the cutscenes are dreadful.If you play as Lucus you will probably give up as he is impossible to play as you have to go right next to the person you are attacking.However, for me there are two major things that disappointed me about this game the lack of customisation of your character and the horrifically annoying camera angle.So no, I do not recommend this game, it is one of the worst games I have ever played.
