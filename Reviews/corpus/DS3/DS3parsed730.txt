Playing this game with the male mage makes this game a joy to play.   After playing this game with a female half red spawn and having a the blues.  Replaying with another character made this game a breeze and a blast.  Even though this game doesnt reminde me of dungeon siege it is still a lot of fun and worth your time if you like single player action rpg.  The whole game can be taking out with DLC in about 10 hours if your dying all over the place.  Give it a chance
