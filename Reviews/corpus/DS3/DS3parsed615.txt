I have no idea whats with all the hate for this game. I havent played the two first installments of DS so I guess that might mean something. However, as a newcomer to the series, I can heartily recommend this game to anyone who likes a nice actionRPG. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and some of the boss battles were quite cool. The combat can get a bit tiresome and repetitive and the skills are not very imaginative but all in all I think this game is worth its price. And if you get it on sale, youre getting a real bargain!7.5/10
