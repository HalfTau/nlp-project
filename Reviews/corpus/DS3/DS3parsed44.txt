Compared with the previous titles in the Dungeon Siege games, this is a clear downhill slide. The playable characters are very narrow in terms of development both storywise and skillwise. Controlling a sizeable but managable team is missing too. You are narrowed down to your main character and one of the discarded classes that you didnt chose in the beginning. While you can exchange your companion, the idea leading a group of heroes is lost. Controls are okayish while the camera behaves quit annoying at times.
