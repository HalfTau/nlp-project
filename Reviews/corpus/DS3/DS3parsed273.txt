Years ago, I used to play the first Dungeon Siege game at LAN. Me and a friend played it a lot, never finished it, but had fun with it nonetheless. Then the second game was released, didnt play it and dont really remember why. Although, it got excited back when this third game was announced  Hell yeah, another game in this great series!. Imagine the disappointment when I first played DS3 and it was NOTHING like the first two games.Well, that was like three years ago that I last tried DS3 and it was on the Playstation 3. One strike right there. Well, I got the game in a Humble Bundle some months back and thought Id give it another go and surprise, surprise, I actually had a lot of fun with the game.The first two games were squad based tactical RPGs, this one youre only controlling one character and youve got one companion and its more like a Diablo clone, more than anything else. Maybe youve grown tired of Diablo 2 or 3, Titan Quest, Path of Exile... whatever it may be, and you want another game to play for a few hours with or without friends, give DS3 a go. One character may be completed in like 10 hours and theres four to choose from so in all reality, you could play this game for abour 4050 hours if you choose to play with all the characters.Anyhow, I do recommend this game but that is if you get it for a maximum of 5. So in another words, during a Steam sale or a bundle of sorts.
