If you are buying this only because you liked the previous titles, DONT. Its nothing like the previous games and thats not necesssarily a bad thing. I personally found this game extremely fun, with great replay value and I previously owned it on my Xbox360 so Ive spent 100hours of whatever my steam account says.ProsStoryline seems linear, but if you read into it youll find otherwiseCombat is fun and challengingAll characters play differently and thanks to the ToTS DLC you can do all sorts of different buildsPlaying on hardcore could lead to you dying a lot to certain bosses, but you get iframes on your dodge and by studying   the boss you can flawless them. Kinda like Dark SoulsYour companions actually have a personality which is certainly a change from other gamesDeeds are hidden until achieved, so you get what you deserveAll abilities are incredibly satisfying to useYour choices actually change the endingKatarinaConsJeyne KassynderOdoCamera can be a bit iffy, but I personally used my mouse to move around so I never had a problem with itJeyne KassynderThe enchanting system can be really rage inducing. I disenchanted my 96 Doom spear and got nothing. Good thing I had a better oneJeyne KassynderWe get it Odo, you hate herOverall the game is extremely fun and has great replay value, but it is very different than the previos titles, which I also lovedPS I would literally marry the Dapper Old Gent if I couldPSS If you have Lucas as a follower, dont let him get too excited. He has this weird glitch where instead of traveling 15 meters with his dash, he shoots of into the nearest wall, which may be kilometers away. Fun to watch though
