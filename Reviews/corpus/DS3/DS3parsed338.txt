I put off this game for quite a while but I finally decided to play it and I enjoyed it, its not as good as Torchlight but if you like ARPGs then youll most likely like this one. This is more linear compared to other ARPGs but its got a decent story, I never really played any DS games before so I cant say if this is better or worse than its predecessors. One thing I did not like was that the camera would sometimes get stuck in bad positions and was hard to see.
