Dungeon Siege III is a decent RPG, as you would expect from Obsidian Entertainment. But if youve played the previous Dungeon Siege games, you will notice the way it plays is much different. In my opinion it is much better, but some people will find it off putting to find such dramatic change. The storyline is good, if confusing. Combat takes a little getting used to, as the control scheme is a bit weird. As most Dungeon Siege games go, its a good game if a bit unpolished. Wait until its on sale.
