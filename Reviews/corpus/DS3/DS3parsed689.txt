A lot of people were dissapointed in this game because it was so different from the original 2.   It was definately made for Consoles more than for PC.   I found myself enjoying the game enough to give it a play through and if you have the RIG to play it in 3d you wont be dissapointed.Dont expect it to be anything like the first 2.  Take it for what it is and you will enjoy it.
