For a game that was released 6 years ago I was really surprised at how good it is. I havent played a good RPG in a long time and this one hit the spot. Good story line with good voice overs and some reallly nice graphics. I played it on my Acer Aspire V17 gaming laptop with a  Windows  X box One  USB controller.  Gaming controller worked perfect.
