This game is frequently on sale, and when the price goes down it is DEFINITELY worth picking up.  Played through the console version and liked it enough to play through the PC version, as well.UPDATE Nominated for the guilty pleasure Steam Award for 2017.  Only because I know some people hate it.I, however, cannot look away...
