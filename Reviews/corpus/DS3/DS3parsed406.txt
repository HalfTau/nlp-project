The most important thing you need to know if you think this might be nice game to play with friends is that the camera makes this game unplayable in multiplayer!  Not difficult to play UNPLAYABLE, it feeling like playing gauntlet for PS1 on a 10 inch TV.If you want a below average action RPG the is single player ONLYyou might consider this for 1, no more.  However if you wanted any game that even slightly resembled the other games in this series, run as far from this game as you can.
