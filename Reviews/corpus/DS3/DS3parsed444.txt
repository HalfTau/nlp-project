Short version This is a competent and enjoyable Diablo clone. Certainly worth the timeIt has some interesting places, a story decent enough you dont just roll your eyes and quit it Yes, that would be you, Lords of Shadow. Yours didnt last 3 maps. It has a lot of what I emember being optional content and nice mechanics. Guess a testament to how well it was made is that I finished it once and still wanted to have another go with a different character AND see how it plays out with a party. So yeah.. worth the monies, worth the times, would play it again especially now its been quite a while and Ive forgot most details
