 Smooth combat Nice character designs Great storyline Nice map system Very dizzy camera No CreateaCharacter systemThis is a very good game overall, however its so different from Dungeon Siege I  II that it shouldnt be named Dungeon Siege III. Maybe Dungeon Siege Retribution or something like that? IMO one of the main reasons this game gets so much hate is because, the way it was named generated a lot of expections from long time fans of the franchise.Honestly this game is very decent to say the least, so try it if you dont mind that the gameplay is different than the previous two DSs.7/10
