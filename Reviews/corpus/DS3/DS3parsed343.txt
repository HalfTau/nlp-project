Despite all the negative comments I think this is a great game. I loved the story and the gameplay. The battles, especially the boss battles, were great because you had to actually work out tactics to beat them, evade their hits and utilise  blocking.If you dont want the game to be too hard you can just play it on easy. I finished it on normal playing as Lucas and thought it wasnt insanely hard. The game gives you a good challenge though.To solve the camera and controller problem I changed the button layout as follows Give it a try! W Move ForwardS Move BackwardsA Move LeftD Move RightAnd now the important bitRotate Camera Right ClickThat way its easy to control your character and to adjust the camera angle even in busy battles
