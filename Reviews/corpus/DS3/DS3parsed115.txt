This game is thrash, plain and simple. The visuals look okay for their age, but thats about it. You know the ages old control mechanics that pretty much every ARPG used since the original Diablo? You know, left click to move or attack if you click on an enemy, or pick up loot and right click to unleash your primary ability. Convienient and simple. This game wanted to reinvent the wheel though. Left click attacks, even if theres absolutely nothing to attack. The attack animation is sluggish and cannot be interupted. To move around you either have to use WASD clunky as all hell or hold down the right mouse button contionously. Theres no clicktomove. In addition the camera is as reliable and fast as a a drunken mule. Oh, and picking up stuff? No, you cant just click on them you silly sausage, no, you have to stand next to the item and press E. Because a context sensitive cursor is way too complicated to program apperently.A lot of these ARPGs have a checkpoint system where the game automatically saves. Some others have the normal, manual save system. This game has neither. See, there are checkpoints and you have to save there manually. You forgot or you thought the game would autosave? Well, there went several hours of your time, you can start from the very beginning.On the top of all that even the presentation sucks during dialogues the camera zooms in. The character models are okay, but this puts focus on the horribly low quality textures on the environment. I know, I know, the game is 6 years old at this point, but you know what else is 6 years old? Skyrim. Oh, and if we were at dialogues, Ive heard fanmade mods for TES IV Oblivion with better voice acting. Everybody sounds equally bored and uninterested in whatever they have to say.Dont bother with this game. Not even on sale. This pile of garbage doesnt worth a single cent.
