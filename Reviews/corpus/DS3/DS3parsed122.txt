I am definitely disappointed, this game didnt even exceed my expectations, which werent too big. First of all theres not such thing as autosave, so if you die after 2 hours of playing you will have to start all over againas in my case but only if you forgot to save it manually and the fighting mechanics are poor The gameplay is pretty boring , the story has a forced coolness and the voice acting is terrible, additionally the multiplayer is a total disaster.Overall not a good game but not a very bad one toofor people who REALLY love rpgs. I just dont really like it and I think a 5 price would be a reasonable price. I would rather buy a Diablo game.My rating 2.5
