As a big fan of the previous two games, I was pretty excited to see a sequel. I received this game as a gift, which is probably a good thing, because Id have been pretty annoyed had I spent money on this. Why? Because the only thing this game shares with the previous two games is the name.The actual boxed game came with a doublesided piece of paper as a quick start guide. Unfortunately, it doesnt really give any indication on when or how to use things. The minimalist UI doesnt display the bulk of your abilities, and one of the more important features, saving your game, isnt really explained that well  make sure to use the save portals. Likewise, theres next to nothing in the game manual maybe theres one on the install disc? about which stats are better for each character.I picked what was labeled the wizard to try out. The wizard runs around and punches things. To be fair, he can throw a lightning bolt, but literally, he runs around and punches things. Do yourself a favor, and buy DS II instead of this, because this is just flat out awful. Were the game released as a standalone title, and not as a third installment, it would pretty much still be awful. The story seems vaguely interesting, but the game is pretty lackluster with an unhelpful UI.
