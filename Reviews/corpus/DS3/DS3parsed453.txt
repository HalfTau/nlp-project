I actually enjoy the game play, the quest based story line and the look of the game. Where it falls completely short is 1. No map other than a mini map  2. No potions, but rather a very lame healing mode which when getting hit in combat almost always fails to heal you enough or fast enough. The boss can ALWAYS damage you faster than you can heal. 3. boss battles that are insanely hard even on the casual mode. NO GAME IN CASUAL MODE SHOULD REQUIRE RESTARTING A BATTLE 5 TO 20 TIMES!!!!! 4. The main tank character is almost completly useless in boss fights and even with everything I could find has almost no resistance to any kind of magical attack which all the bosses so far rely heavily on. I like a good story based adventure game that is challenging but fair. This isnt that game.
