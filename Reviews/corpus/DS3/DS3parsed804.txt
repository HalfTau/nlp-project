As a huge fan of DS2, I was extremely disappointed in the direction they took for DS3. That said, DS3 is still a solid action RPG  it just wasnt what I was hoping for.I tried playing the melee dude on the highest difficulty. Regular mobs are pretty ing difficult, and I loved it, but some of the bosses are damn near impossible. They have so much health and can take out 1/3 of your life in one hit. Play this on normal difficulty.
