I dont want to join the drivel of negative reviews that plague this game. This Is a very good game, but with its own flaws. Much like any other game, those flaws will be present and overrated by people who only spend their time looking for those flaws. The game is set much like Diablo but without the randomly generated maps. Instead, you have a well made out landscapealthough somewhat obscured by a lack of camera pitch that is very detailed and well thought out. The environment is nicely detailed and the seamless transition between inside and outside is a very nice detraction from the constant loading screens that haunt most games. The story is somewhat linear, but the side quests and DLC can keep you entertained for hours on end. My first playthrough of the game as Lucas is completed as of this post I still have yet to complete the game with the other characters and have roughly amassed 40 hours. Reading all of the lore inscribed really immerses you into the world even though its not necessary in a hack  slash rpg. The dialogue was well spoken and richly entertaining especially once you reach Stonebridge and listen to the automotons. The characters respond rather well to your hero, although the AI leaves somewhat of a burden when playing solo as I do. All in all, I still recommend this game.
