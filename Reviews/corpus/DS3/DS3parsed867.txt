the game is great although there are ppl that say its fun okay or bad. this is my opinion. ds3 is different from ds1 and ds2 because of different gameplay. ds12 was more like a basic action rpg game like dragon age, fable or kingdoms of amalar. ds3 resemble a bit of the diablo combat system with its own feel to it. this what cause ppl to complain saying its a terrible diablo clone. like i said its a different feel and not suppose to copy diablo. the graphics are beatiful and voice acting is very good in this. even though they say story line is short approx 1214 hours thats just 1 person. if u want play each one to know how they affect the story in the game and there background. really reccomend this if your looking for a good rpg to play.
