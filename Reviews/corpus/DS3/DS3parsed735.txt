Grafic  Great , Gamefun maybe also great, but impossible to play in multiplayer !The Game is made for Consoles and the PC Version is the same !!!!!  Nothing changed !!!All Chars who plays in Party must stay on the same screen.....!   So  movment freedom is gone Completly !If you like to play an Archer ....or Gunner...just forgeth it you will use your weapon just in Melee.Another Game becomes useless because its made for Consoles and noone changed anything for an PC Version !Please write it on the Cover if its made for the Console in the Future and the Players can keep a lot of money.I was paying fullprice for it on the first day because i loved to play the first two parts of DS. I stopt playing part 3 after 1 week and i saw under the half of the Game.....no more use for it !HOT TIPP  KEEP YOUR HANDS AWAY !!!
