I liked Dungeon Siege. I really liked Dungeon Siege 2. I wanted to like Dungeon Siege 3, but it fought me at every turn until I stopped fighting the inevitable and admitted the BEST thing that can be said about it is that it simply lacks.The first two both featured adventuring with full parties. The third barely made a pretense by allowing you one companion.The first two actually allowed you to create a character of your own. The third lets you pick from a very limited selection of premade characters, where your entire input is choosing one you dont even get to name them.The first two were both pretty linear. The third one makes the term linear seem insufficient to convey just how on rails the gameplay is.Replayability? Pretty close to zero, in my opinion.Just not seeing the appeal. At all.
