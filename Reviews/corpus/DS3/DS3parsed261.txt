Sacred 2, Van HelsingYou are part of a guild of sorts that has fallen out of favor. You learn the reasons why the crazy zealot chick wants you all dead eventually. After events take place you must fight men and monster a like and find the truth about the past or ignore it.The story and atmosphere in the game are actually pretty compelling. The voice overs actually work well. The combat feels pretty good overall.The game comes off with that sense that youve seen this all before. Even with a good atmosphere it never feels real. Everything is done well, but not well enough to truly hook you.The game may never get you immersed and truly attached, but the story and gameplay are worth doing if your up for a solid RPG.Its a solid RPG thats a bit closer to finished looking product then say Two Worlds 2, but without the engaging crafting and spells systems so Id say 15
