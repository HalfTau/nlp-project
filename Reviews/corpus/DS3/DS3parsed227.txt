I only played this game in couch coop, and for this purpose, I recommend it is as a fun, if not particularly deep, hacknslash with a pretty good story and good production values. It provided us with an enjoyable 30 hours of monster slaying and while I will probably not play this game ever again, I will remember it as a pleasing experience.Most probably it would not be as good if I played alone, so keep that in mind.If you can this at 50 off, and have someone to play with, I say go for it.
