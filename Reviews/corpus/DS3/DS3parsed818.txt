This turned out to be a very solid hack/slash/loot game.  You can choose from 4 solidly different characters.  The combat starts fairly simple mash attach, use 1 or 2 abilities, but it gets more complex in a really rewarding way.  Each character has 2 combat stances, and each stance has 3 abilities that you get as you level up, plus 3 defensive abilities.  Each ability can also be mastered to unlock a more powerful version of that ability.  You get to distribute a few meaningful upgrades each time you level up.  The entire game was bug free for me in single player.  The graphics were really nice, and the plot was pretty solid although as with most fantasy games I said huh?! a couple times.  The looting is good, the inventory and quest systems are good.  The game isnt incredibly long, but for me that was good.  It was about 9 hours for the single player and it really felt like an epic journey.  A few sidequests, but it wasnt bogged down with them.  As I ramble on, I realize that the bottom line for me was this game was pretty awesome.   I am also a couple hours into the coop.  Only the person hosting gets to save their character, but as long as you play with the same person, youll both get to keep your stuff.  Coop is mostly smooth, but since you have to both be on the same screen, sometimes your partner running off, gets you trapped in a corner.
