If youre a fan of Dungeon Siege 1 and 2, this game isnt even remotely the same. It was sold by Gas Powered Games DS1/DS2 creators by Chris Taylor and Square Enix were the buyers.Obsidian Entertainment butchered the style of Dungeon Siege entirely, but they obviously couldnt have been trying to use anything more than a similar lore basis.Ignoring the relation to the previous two games, this isnt actually a bad game in its own right. Its got a decent story and a decent combat system, though its entirely designed for consoles and simply given a decent PC port.While it doesnt reinvent anything, its a solid title if you get it on a Steam sale for under 7. It gives roughly 20 hours of gameplay, and the DLC adds another 2 hours or so as well. More gameplay if you replay it to try out each character, as you can only play that one character, even though you recruit all 4 throughout the game. All 4 character clears would be around 60 Hours of gameplay.
