For those who are here for a DS game can leave, for those who are here for just another game do try it out. The main reason why its getting so many negative reviews is because of this game not being like the previous DS series. It still has a great story and a decent ARPG while having good graphics. Yes there are ofcourse cons like getting used to controls and camera but if you want to say bad about this game about its bad mechanics, go try playing darksouls2 on pc without a controller . if you can live through the start of getting around then it really is a enjoying game.All games have flaws but stop judgeing a book by its cover, just cause its a DS series game doesnt mean that if it doesnt continue the series good it stops being a game. Even most of the negative reviewers writing i quit the game in 5 mins or something still have played over 10h. HOW CAN YOU PLAY SOMETHING YOU HATE OVER 10H! ?
