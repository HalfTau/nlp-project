This game is terrible.  It is nothing like the first two Dungeon Siege games.  I want my money back.  The camera controls are awful, the voices are poorly done, the multiplayer is terrible, theres no key bindings you can adjust so youre s.o.l. if youre a lefthander like me.  Let the console lamebrains have their woo woo kewl graficks.  Screw you, Obsidian.  your games have all been rubbish and youre certainly not breaking with tradition.
