played the original and dungeon siege 2 on an oldpc my brother had, we still have the original cases they came in, I played the second one so many times I think it just stopped working.At any rate, when this game came out I tested it on xbox I THINK, dont quote me on it, it was either a demo or perhaps on a laptop, the point is. NOW that I am reexperiencing the series again, I think this MAY be my least favorite, it could be the wonky controls as far as keyboard goes, or how the camera seems to move around you if you walk with either mouse or keys, and the combat is probably the worst combat I have ever played with in any game ever, honestly it feels WORSE than a mobile port, at least you feel like you have a sense of control in mobile rpgs, this is just wrong. The blocking mechanics alongside the attack buttons seem like the game wanted to have such a huge  emphasis on the next attack position, that it dissociates itself from having smooth combat overall.The story is also pretty meh SO FAR, and the characters to choose from look alright, I picked a mage, which has a voice actor that doesnt fit his look in 15 years. Hes like a damn 70 year old mage with a 20 something year old voice actor, come on. Atleast pretend to be old or edit the mans voice.I can say one thing that makes this game good that stands alongside its tendency to give me who has never experienced it in his life vertigo or some is the graphics. Sure, parallel to its aspired gameplay overall, the graphics do puzzle into sort of a mobile fashion, but I think in order from best to worst, DS2, 1, 3. For sure.
