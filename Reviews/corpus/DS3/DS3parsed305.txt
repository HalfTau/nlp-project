Well after beating this game, I have to say I enjoyed it. I like the combat system, most of the time it felt very skill based as opposed to just spam dps moves, you actually want to move and roll to dodge enemy attacks. I was interested in the story and ended up caring about the characters involved.  And the voice acted dialouge was nice and enoyable to listen to.However, after all that has been said, here are my complaints..... Some bosses ended up feeling like bullet hells, in some cases I was almost just rolling around spamming space bar non stop while waiting for my ai componian to kill it. especially the dlc bosses Speaking of dlc, the special moves you acquire in the dlc never felt needed. The level design in the game..... sucks..... just felt like narrow hallways all the way through, inside a cave? narrow hallway, outside in the open? narrow hallway, running though a town or city? narrow hallway.... Another thing I didnt like about the level design was during the credits I got to see the awesome concept art of each area, and it just gave me flashbacks to all the ugly textures I saw throughout the game. I would say the dlc desert was the best designed since most of it felt more open and alive.All in all I liked it and want to play it again with a different character, and see how the ending will change based on my decisions.
