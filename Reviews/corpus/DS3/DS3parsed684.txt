I was a little torn on whether to give this a recommendation or not, but decided not to in the end. While I did play the entire game all the way through, I wasnt too interested in playing beyond the ending. Theres a few characters to choose from, but I found that one playthrough was enough.Its your questbased RPG. You go into a zone/dungeon, you fight monsters, you fight bosses, you complete quests.The gameplay was at times frustrating and not at all something that could keep me engaged.You might be able to get about 20 hours from this game, but probably not a whole lot more. If youre truly interested in checking this game out, get it during a sale.
