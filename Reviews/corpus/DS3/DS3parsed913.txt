I bought it and played it for about 11 hours before being completely tired of the monontonous click and kill method to this game. It didnt even have the same appeal other hack n slashers have had for me. This game would be worth about 19.99. Id suggest waiting for it to fall to that price and then picking it up. This is just another reminder of how far Square Enix has fallen from what it was at the end of the 20th century.
