Ok HacknSlash, weak RPG, uninteresting story with incoherent characters  Every major boss in the game basically murders entire citys because The Legion was mean to them, but, when you beat them, they turn kind and thoughtfull...Some of the enemies especially towards the end look really good and graphically the game is pleasing.I would recommend it if you like top down, fantasy RPGs and have a friend to play with. Otherwise, its really not good. I finished the campaign as a knight, with a gamepad and solo.
