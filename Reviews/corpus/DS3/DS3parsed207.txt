It is a good game. But Dungeon Siege 2 its way better. In dungeon siege 3 seems that you only can control 2 chars at the same time. That was dissapointing for me. Also you cant create custom builds as in previous games. Graphics are better and you can use an xbox controller. Gameplay is kind of fun.
