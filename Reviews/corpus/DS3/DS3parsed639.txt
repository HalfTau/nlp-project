OK so I finished this game....My verdict Too linear, too dumbed down, and story was bland at best. I feel bad for who ever paid full price.Only positives I can think of is that worked well with a controller. Voice acting not bad, but Reinhart was almost intolerable. Bad attempt and intelligent humor.This is not a dungeon siege game nor should it have been released under then name but it is what it is. Dragons Age was closer to if not an actual Dungeon Siege title.
