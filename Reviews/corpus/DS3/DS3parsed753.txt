If youre used to the theme and style of DS1 and 2 then this one might shock the senses a bit. It has the Square Enix flavor all over it, which might be good in some of the games they tend to churn out, but I definitely dont want it in my Dungeon Siege. The game is just unbearable to me, I loved the original Dungeon Siege despite it being incredibly simple, everything just seemed to fit into place. DS III you can just stay far away, Ill go back to being a humble farmer.
