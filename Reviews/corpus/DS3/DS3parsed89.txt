A decent enough game in itself. However fans of the series prepare to be disappointed. It shares very little in common with the Dungeon Siege I that we love and the Dungeon Siege II that was a pretty good followup. They did away with the groups and instead made it a single character focused game. Fairly disappointed in it and I hope that one day they will find their roots again.
