After Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege II, I was again expecting a nice action RPG. Dungeon Siege III has serious flaws. The camera has a fixed perspective, the drop items are horrible, theres only a single layout to go through, and because the items drops are terrible, item grinding is useless as theres no respawning or dungeons like in Dungeon Siege II.Do not buy! Rated 3 out of 10.
