I normally dont post that many reviews but sense this game has gotten so many negative reviews i feel i should post a positive one. I just got this game on sale and  ilove it. I would have been fine with paying full price for it. It seems most of these negative reviews are from people who have played the first 2 games. I have not. I bought the second one when i bought this but i wanted to play this one first.I have been looking for a solid RPG that was not as in depth and time consumming as WOW or Skyrim and i am so happy i found this game, cant wait to start the second one.
