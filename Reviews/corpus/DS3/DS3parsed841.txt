The 3DS!  I was first in line for this when it became available for download and I do not regret it!  It is 5 gigabytes to download, but its worth it once you see the awesome 3D effects.  After you download your 3DS, I also recommend getting Mario Kart.  Strangely, while they offer the 3DS on Steam, they do not offer Mario Kart.  I sent an email to Mr. Torvalds about this, but all I got was a form letter about FreeBSD whatever that is I think it is an illegal recreational drug.
