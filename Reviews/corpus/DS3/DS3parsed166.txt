This is, without a doubt, one of the WORST action RPGs I have ever played and a travesty to the Dungeon Siege name.  Do NOT buy this game, it is unoriginal, plays like a gauntlet legends clone with terrible interaction w/ the environment and after dying to the same boss for 20 minutes in an absolutely LINEAR RPG experience w/i the first hour of gameplay, I would rather mutilate my genitals than play this game.  This game needs to go die in a dumpster fire.
