Obsidians most polished game but also its most unoriginal  a hack n slash based in a medieval world, as if we dont have enough of those already. However, the game is reactive to how you play it and there are some excellent conversations and plot points brought to us by none other than George Ziets the genius behind Mask of the Betrayer.
