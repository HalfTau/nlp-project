More arcadestyle action than I was expecting, this is still a pretty fun action/RPG. I dont know if the coop is any good the game seems to tout that as one of its main features, as I only played singleplayer.A pretty polished game overall, with enough depth to the combat to keep the otherwisemindless slaughter of enemies interesting. The boss fights can be a little gimmicky, but thats true for damned near every hacknslash action game these days.
