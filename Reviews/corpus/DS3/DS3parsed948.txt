Dont listen to gaming magazines or websites. Dungeon Siege 3 is worth the money. With four characters to play through as, theres tons of replay value. It might seem like a Dragon Age/Mass Effect clone, and there are similarities. The story drags a little at first, and there arent any customizable controls, which can be frustrating, especially for new players. But the second half of the story is where DS3 shines. The ending, depenant on your choices, is superb.
