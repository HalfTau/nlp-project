Decent enough, BUT dont expect it to be even remotely simular to DS1 and DS2.  Quite frankly, this isnt Dungeon Siege at all.  Its a console game that they named DS3 and released it to the DS community thinking we might take the bait.  Yes, I did buy it and yes Ive played it, but felt so ripped off and disappointed the whole time.
