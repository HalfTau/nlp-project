Dungeon Siege 3 is one of the games with is underrated because it has a good storyline and has very more to it then you think because not only is it a hack and slash game but it is also a role play game because a lot of your decision you made has a great impack in you game later on. so I wil say go buy it especially when it is as now on sale for 75 less then the normal and if you think about it buy the collection edition because you will get a lot more for the money or if you only will play the third so at least buy the DLC for it for you will get more for the money.And for the record I have alredy finish the game and collected and see what there is to it but I am going to play it again because it is a good game.
