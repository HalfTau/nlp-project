DS3 is very bad rated game. Its really nothing like Dungeon Siege 12. But it really so bad game? I dont think so. You must just forget everything about previous Dungeon Siege games. In DS3 isnt so epic world, there isnt awesome soundtrack, stunning areas, good inventory, your own character.....So what is good in this game? I cant say why, but i really enjoyed it for some reasson. There are 4 premade characters. All of them have 3 stances  single attacks, mass attacks and buffs.Game build up on these characters and their role in story. They are all in game as companions, doesnt matter on which one you play. And all of them make very different gameplay.Lucas  10th Legion grandmasters son. Knight using sword and shield, greatsword and protective/heal spells.Katarina  Rebel girl, daughter of Lucases father and witch. Using dual pistols, musket and support spells including summon spirit hound.Anjali  Archon girl, spirit of the fire. Using spear and martial art in human form and fire spells in Archon form. Support spells in 3rd stance.Reinhart  Descendant of Merik. Using steampunk devices to boost his magic. Using various spells in all stances  lightings, traps, teleport and many more.There isnt many positives in DS3, and there is many negatives. But its not bad game, biggest problem is, its named Dungeon SIege  this game definitely isnt Dungeon Siege. But how i said, if you forget everything about DS 12 and give DS3 a try, i belive you will enjoy it.storycharacters and skillsreferrings to DS1graphic locations are poorcamerainterfaceside quests are bag of trash but give good rewardsAt total 5/10Warning I dont recommend DS3 to romantic and melancholic players, if you see what they did to Stonebridge, Glacern and whole Ehb you will cry
