I like to use the Terminator series to explain the Dungeon Siege series.DS1  A classic, has issues, even more so now with modern OSsDS2  a great sequel, probably the greatest sequel ever.DS3  Hard to live up to its previous greatness.But in all seriousness, Its pretty, it plays alright, the boss at the end is a bit of a buggy dissapointment. Its just not as good as 2. Youre probably gonna buy this with the other 2 in the series, and they are all worth your time.
