I attempted to play the first Dungeon Siege game, but I couldnt get into it, so I decided to play this one first. From what I played, you dont have to know what happend prior to this game since there are plenty of lore books lying around to read to get caught up.I tried playing with a mouse and keyboard initially, but felt weird to play and a little complicated. So I tried playing with a gamepad controller and the game became much better and enjoyable.This game was meant to played with a controller, not a mouse and keyboard. PLAY with a controller.
