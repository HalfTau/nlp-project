Bad console controls and camera camera is fixed for local readsame screen  coop.Ontop, its got absolutely nothing in common with other dungeon siege games and I dont even see why as they were perfectly good games with a groundbreaking design. Dungeon siege I and II mixed hack  slash with TRPG creating a real time tactical RPG with tons of replayability and a seemingly endless journey for a campaign.Dungeon Siege 3 on the other hand is just a generic action RPG for consoles.Granted, the characters and skills arent all that bad designed, as is the campaign but its not great either and the consolized controls drop it below mediocre for PC games. It may be worth buying if you have no expectations whatsoever.
