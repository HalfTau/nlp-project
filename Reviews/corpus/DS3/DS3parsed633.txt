Honestly, not really sure I want to reinstall this one. The gameplay changed so much from the first 2 that it seemed like they couldnt be bothered to do something decent with this one. You have a choice between 4 characters 2 male and 2 female. Gender specific classes and story based around each character. While you didnt have much in the way of customization due to the garphics in  DS and DS 2, youd think they would give you the option of playing characters that had more open ended story. Instead you get that gun chick, the tank guy who is actually really nice to have as a second, the amazon caster chick who didnt really make a whole lot of sense to me as a character in the basic story, and the mad scientist dude. I disliked the movement controls and point of view for the camera, but I really liked the boss mechanics. The whole Oooo something on the ground which you wanted to avoid because it generally meant a special ability that really ing hurts. The nice thing about that was you actually did have a chance to move out of whatever ground effect or targetting effect was in place before you took damage.
