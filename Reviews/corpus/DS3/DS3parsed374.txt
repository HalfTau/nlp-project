This is a very good game that never found its audience. Peole who were fond of early Bioware forays into consoles  KOTOR and Jade Empire, to be precise  would have loved it. Its built on the same design principles incredibly wellpaced story in a choose your own adventure form coupled with extremely linear level design. You wont find open world exporation, deep character customization, complex skill trees and full party management here  but its not a bad thing, per se, since it allows to focus on a story while not being entirely devoid of gameplay.Even though there is no traditional party, the game features companion NPCs that double as pregen player characters. You cant control them in battle, but you can change their equipment and stance. You cant initiate conversation with them, but they have plenty of contextual banters and can disagree with your choices in conversations. All four are fully voiced.Story is lighter and less prone to deconstruction than certain earlier Obsidian titles. There is a fantasy trope subversion here and there, but most of the time the setting is treated with respect. This is a welcome change for me, but undoubtedly those who wanted it edgier were left disappointed. George Ziets was creative lead on both this and Mask of the Betrayer NWN 2 expansion, so they share much of the atmosphere.Starting levels suffer from being incredibly bland traditional fantasy, but later areas  both Stonebridge and Tumbledown Court  are excellent each in their own way, with great NPC casts and unique ambience.Gameplay wise its your run offthemill ARPG. Once you get your twitch going, it flows smoothly. Makes you wish the corridors werent so narrow, the trash mobs  so numerous, and small time bosses  such obvious damage sponges. Otherwise it gets the job of carrying you from dialog to dialog done. This is a departure from the first two games in a franchise, but its not really worse  just very different.
