Youve probably noticed that the negative reviews are from fans of the original Dungeon Siege games.  Thats because this isnt a bad game in and of itself I actually liked it more than I expected but it breaks the mold of the original games in an unimpressive way.  If you played the original Baldurs Gate games and then played Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance, you know exactly whats happened here.So if you want a controllerfriendly hack and slasher with good visuals, good audio, pretty good gameplay, and a meh story, look no further.  Youll get a pretty good, costeffective time here.If you want Dungeon Siege 3, find something else.
