This game is a lot like being constipated it leaves you with a vague sense of accomplishment, but mostly theres just a lot of bored waiting.The game bears little resemblance to DS 1 and 2, and feels more like a generic title crapped out onto the XBox Live Marketplace in the hopes of making a few bucks from people that remember the name and thought it might be worth playing. Its not.
