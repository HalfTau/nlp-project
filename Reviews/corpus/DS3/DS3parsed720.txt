The first game from Obsidian I have to give the down finger. Its a shait console port, and even worse, it completely did away with the character system and playstyle from Dungeon Siege I and II. Some good characters and playing coop are the only redeeming qualities, so if a you are not a fan of the first two games and b can withstand consolitis, you may want to try it for the aforementioned redeeming qualities.
