Dungeon Siege III is a great game, but it simply isnt a Dungeon Siege anymore. The gameplay mechanics are very, very simplified compared to original Dungeon Siege, or even a Dungeon Siege 2. Nevertheles, it is a great, solid, rather simplistic RPG with beautiful graphics and engaging gameplay, but do not expect almost anything youve used to in previous installments.
