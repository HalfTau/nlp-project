Single Player Couldnt get into it though because I really wanted to do the coop. I have not completed or beaten the game because it cannot hold my interest and that says A LOT.Multiplayer Coop is garbage due to camera issues, however there is a community mod that fixes the camera issue making the game actually playable in coop. The problem was getting my friends interested in downloading it again because we spent a whole of 20 minutes before we decided we did NOT wish to play anymore.Conclusion if you can get it on sale for cheap, by all means. single player makes it worth spending an hour or more. dont expect too much more than that.
