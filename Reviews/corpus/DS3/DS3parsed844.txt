Dungeon Siege III is by no means a great game, particularly in light of the drastic changes that make this entry to the series a sharp departure from its superior predecessors.But that tart treatment is not the whole story. The truth is that DS3 is simply a fun game to play, particularly with friends, even if its not a very good one. Its quick to pick up, easy to engage and hooks you with the classic ARPG formula leveling, talents and gear upgrades!With the entire Dungeon Siege franchise bundled for less than 20 these days, its hard not to come home with this one in tow. Grab some friends and enjoy it for what it is a simple and enjoyable hacknslash.Verdict 7/10
