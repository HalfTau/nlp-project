Utterly pathetic excuse for a game, lot alone a Dungeon Siege sequel.Story  Its story BARELY sets it in the Dungeon Siege worldGraphic/Style  For the time it came out, it is both graphicly unimpressive and lacks any kind of thematic artstyleGameplay  Plays like you jerked off in your controller and never cleaned it, with extremely poor movement and camera controls alongside clunky game mechanics which was somehow achieved even with the extremely simple, uninspired  gameplay.Characters All generic, most are repeated models with the worst lipsync I have ever seenAliensColonialMarines/10  Literal garbage that killed an amazing IP, they could have just remastered Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 remastered with Multiplayer and they would have made aload of money.
