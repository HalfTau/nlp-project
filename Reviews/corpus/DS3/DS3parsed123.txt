Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege 2 are without a doubt my two favotite games of all time and it really hurts me to see what Dungeon Siege 3 became. Its clear this was envisioned from the start to be nothing like a proper Dungeon Siege game. On its own its perfectly respectable... for a console game. For the type of game it is, it does well enough. My problem with this game has nothing to do with the combat or loot or even the screen sharing issues though. It the fact it tried to sell itself off as another Dungeon Siege game when it makes no effort to even try to capture what made the previous two games so great. Under another title it wouldnt have had the fan following behind it but it also wouldnt have created such a contraversy. The Dungeon Siege lore was turned into a joke. Without spoiling anything, Ill just say the main plot revolves around a religious nutcase being the badguy and doing all kind of things but with a selfrightious justification like all badguy religious nutcases are prone to have. I dislike the story. I dislike the visual representations. The only thing I actually like about this game is the Heroes Crypt. Its where the heroes of the Dungeon Siege 1, the main character and all your companions you gain throughtout the game, were laid to rest. Its a beautiful nod to the first game but unfortunately the only good one.This review was a long time coming. I hate this game for everything it should have been but isnt. I hate Square Enix and Obsidian for effectively killing my favorite series and I dont believe I will ever forgive them for it. If you are new to the series you probably wont mind the change. If you are a long time Dungeon Siege fan dont waste your money on this. Do not reward the developers for this abomination.
