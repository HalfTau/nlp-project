I was a huge fan of Dungeon Siege series and unfortunately this game nothing to do with DS. I played this game one hour and I was so mad that I uninstalled and shelved the game. The stupid Obsidian perk system yeah, the same one they put in every game like they cant do anything else  replaced the unique attribute system. The character based weapons replaced the free customization of your character. The game world is just a one straight path with locked doors. Obsidian Entertainment is a one big joke in game business and its famous for ruining big game francishes because they doesnt respect the legendary games. Go ahead and spend your money but dont say I didnt warn you.
