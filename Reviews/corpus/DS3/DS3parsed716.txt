I bought this and the expansion for about three bucks during the christmas sale and expected to just kind ofaround with it for a few hours until I got tired of it. I was surprised that I was drawn in as much as I was, however, and certainly not for the reason I expected. The combat is honestly pretty boring and tedious especially later on. The boss battles in particular can be a slog the final boss of the DLC in particular is just awful. The loot is boring, there is no exploration to speak of and the skills at least for the class I played were nothing special. So why would I still recommend this game? I was actually drawn in by the story. This is something that VERY rarely happens to me with video games but there is something about the setting and the interactive dialogue choices that really clicked with me here. Would I recommend this to just anyone? No, probably not, but for anyone who wants a pretty mindless action rpg with a story that blows most diablolikes out of the water and coop, I would say go for it. I actually plan on playing it again in a year or two, probably.
