After playing this game for quite some time I have found the game to be very functional dungeon crawler that combines support and coop aspects.  Im pleased with the end result and have found the single player experience to be very good and entertaining.  It is unfortunate that multiplayer does not allow you to carry over your earned items.  You will have to play someone elses character.  Its a pain.  But great game none the less.
