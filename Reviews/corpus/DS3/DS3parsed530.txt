At first, the controls and the frustrating camera issues almost caused me to quit this game. But I stuck with it and decided that this was something worth finishing.The game is good. The graphics are nice. The story is a real page turner meaning it grabs you and makes you play on to get to the next chapter. As a Dungeon Siege game, though, there is very little customization that we saw in the first two installments. Having only 1 other ally with you in single player is a bummer, as well. But allinall, this was a good time and maybe Ill come back to it to try the story from another characters view once my backlog slims down yeah, right.
