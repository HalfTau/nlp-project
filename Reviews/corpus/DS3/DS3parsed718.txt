I havent actually played the first two games but from what Ive heard they were awesome. DS III is abit different from what Ive played before but I like it nonetheless, the story is interesting and it wasnt at all hard to get used to the whole idea of the gameplay. I wont say that it is one of my favourite games of all times because... well it isnt P it does keep you entertained though so if you have nothing else to do give it a try D
