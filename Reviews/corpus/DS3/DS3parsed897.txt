Obsidian is at the helm here for Dungeon Siege 3, not Gas Powered Games. DS3 has improved in some regards, yet went backwards in others.For improvements, DS3 has the best story  characters this series has ever offeredup. Another improvement is that there are quests which have more than 1 solution to them.There are issues, though  the camera can be wonky  windup poorly placed. The game lacks the size of parties, which basically made the previous titles what they are. Pretty much, there is only you  a NPC which you have no control over going with you in your SP campaign. All the strategy elements of DS1 and DS2 Broken World are gone. Forget MP  pretty much nobody is playing this online currently 10/24/2011.Take the improvements  also the fact theres plenty of loot to pickup  skills to upgrade for your character to obtain, this should still certainly keep you playing. Obsidian has overall delivered a solid ARPG experience here w/ DS3.Grade C
