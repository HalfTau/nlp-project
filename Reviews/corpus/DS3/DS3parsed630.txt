Worth the sale price if your looking for a local couch coop game. Not fun if you want a single player RPG. Not the best game ever made nor the worst game ever made very milk toast... However, it can be quite fun to grab a RL friend and do some hack and slashing couch coop over the weekend. I do have to thank the devs for implimenting local couch coop on PC, not many developers add this feature anymore in PC games. I guess if PC games featured local coop then there would be no reason to buy a console...
