Feels horribly linear for an RPG.  You cant go exploring much, it leads you to very specific areas and keeps you locked on goals.Cant custom create characters, you have to pick between a few specific and incredibly boring ones with predetermined stories.Forty mins in, I couldnt take any more.  It sucked all the joy out of what is supposed to be Roleplay by taking out the roleplay elements and freedom.
