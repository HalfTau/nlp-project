Cool abilities as naked fire chick.The story isnt that interesting until the very end. I have never played any prior Dungeon Siege game though so maybe Im just too out of the loop to get into it.Some challenging boss fights. You find some cool gear.The top down angle of the camera is really annoying for me since I can barely see what is in front of me. However, I really like playing games where I can see the full horizon. Very good multiplayer. Played the whole game with a friend, makes the experience very fun!Some cool environments to explore.
