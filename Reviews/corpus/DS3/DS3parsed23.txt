Remember that feeling you had when playing Dungeon Siege II with your friends and everyone was having a blast I mean there was so much to do!! The hidden levels, the tough enemies... Well this game is nothing like that... I restarted the game 3 times with a different character and still managed to finish the base game in under 12 hours... And it want fun doing it either. I kept hoping maybe Im missing something itll get better. Then the end game credits pop up and you realize you could have spent your time better by skydiving without a parachute for example...
