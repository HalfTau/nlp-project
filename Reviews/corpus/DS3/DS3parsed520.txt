Ugh, just playing this game for the quarter made me feel sad. Atleast dont call it dungeon siege if you cant have real backpacks and a 4 party of followers.you disappoint me microsoft, this was the series you actually did good, why did you sell?This does indeed not give a dungeon siege feel.Terrible gameplay, average story.The gameplay is just terrible yet its meant for controller.WASD to move? dafuq? if you first make a dungeon siege  it should atleast be pointclick, right?I hope there arent coming any sequels to this bulls.h.i.t game.
