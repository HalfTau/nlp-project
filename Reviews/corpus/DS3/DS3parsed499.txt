Dungeon Siege 3 is actually a GOOD game, and youll enjoy it quite enough once you get past the 2 biggest problems of this game1 despite the fact that it is called DUNGEON SIEGE 3, and takes place in the same fantasy world of the previous 2 DS games, other than that it HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO with DS1 and DS2, and if the producers of the game had not named it DS3 this game would have more appeal and approval, overall.Lets see unlike the other 2 DS, this is NOT a HACKNSLASH RPG, its a quite good, actually ACTION RPG, with very pretty graphics even now, considering its age, good acting voices, a deep and intriguing storyline full of lore.2 A good controller is MANDATORY for this game become playable and fun. Once you get the hang of it youll discover a whole different game than the one described by most of the reviews.So, my advice, coming form a HUGE Dungeon Siege fan, that spent hundreds of hours on the previous titles, is to give this game a chance, making an effort to completely forget this is called Dungeon Siege 3, and after the initial hate ends, youll be surprised.8/10 Y
