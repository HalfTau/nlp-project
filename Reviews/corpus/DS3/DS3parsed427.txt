I honestly loved this game it was another great instalment to the Dungeon Siege game only down side is no pack mule pout. other than that i really dont have any complaints about the game i also love the ability to use a controler with this game. the only downside is some times it can lag out depending on the computer. Awsome graphics and a good user interface makes this game worth buying expecially if your a fan of these types of rpgs.
