DS I and II were rather brilliant in their simplicity. You had a character that you improved by using skills...that simple. Very wide open, the possibilities for your character were endless. This one really packs you into a role and significantly narrows your options. If youre a Dungeon Siege fan and are getting this because you enjoyed the franchise, dont bother. This game is as much about Dungeon Siege as that crappy Dungeon Siege movie with Burt Reynolds was.If you want it for game play, its alright. Not fantastic, not horrible. I think the mechanics are a bit clunky, but then they were so smooth in Dungeon Siege I and II that maybe I just got a bit spoiled. If youre not a fan of the franchise, the game is worth a try.
