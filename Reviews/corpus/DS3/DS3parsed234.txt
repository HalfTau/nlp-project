Absolutely Awful game.. Terrible combat, crappy story, extremely linear levels, bare minimum skill ranksmight as well just have the 3 measely abilities, and rank them up... Its just bad all around..You spam 1 button for your attack combo, all 3 swings/shots of it, and you have 2 stances.. 1 button for attack, another for magic.. Even the mage class is a melee character, and his magic, like the others, is 1 or 2 spell casts, then mroe melee to build up focus..The camera is bad, and has 2 locations.. Both of which dont give you a view ahead of your character, and are more top down, but feel limiting.. I always wanted to be able to see ahead..3 times Ive installed, played, and uninstalled this game.. But its relly bad..it has Diabloesque loot, but theres not a single explanation of what any single stat means, or what it does, or affects.. So you dont know what base stats to upgrade.. then, there seems to be augments on certain items, again, with no explanation of what they do.. I saw something called doom, and a plethora of others when i visitted the first shop..theres a half arsed deconstruct system, which seemingly has no use.. Youcan enchant items, but its merely a stat boost for one of the stats on the item.. The weapons, and armors sometimes change the appearance of your character, but they all look 100 the same in inventory, and as such, are easily lost in the mix..If the combat is the onlyredeeming quality in this game, give it wide birth!
