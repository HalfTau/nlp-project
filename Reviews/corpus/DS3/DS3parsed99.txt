Square Enix NA bundle was crappy to say the least as with HB monthly March with One Piece I was hoping this game can somehow offset the price we paid for the bundle.Pros Great VA  after going through Incredible adventures of Wolfboy the VA here is quite good which helps the 2nd point Story is quite clear, simple but clear enough to understand the plot. It isnt as deep as Grim Dawn but isnt as shallow as Victor Vran.Took about 16 Hours to finish as a SP campaign and I would say was worth my time to finish. I liked that it also has decisions that affect the endings of the characters. ALso one of the few games where boss battles are quite harder than normal enemies. Stable perforrmance even when mining The only downside is during speaches between characters. its 60 FPS stable when outside fightingThings that I am technically NOT considering as cons Game is clearly designed for consoles  everything is quite big and skills and abilities are simple. It doesnt have the depth other ARPGs have. Items, maps and skills are all simplified to say the least. As much as I would say this is a top down ARPG i would consider this more as a 3rd person ARPG due to how the camera looks and feelsCons Lack of PC settings with only basic ones. Doesnt have 75 FPS supportits stable 60 in VSYNC but will produce more frames with it disabled Controller hang when moving sometimes Camera is a bit of a hassle to in 2 player modeFor now the story is enough for me to keep on playing, hopefully i get enough hours of enjoyment to warrant the SE bundle
