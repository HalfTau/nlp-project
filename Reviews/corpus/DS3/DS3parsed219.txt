I was somewhat surprised at this game, considering having played the first two in the series and finding them somewhat cool, but boring. This one is not very similar to the first two, but in a good way. It is a bit more linear than the first game if I remember correctly, but it works out anyway. I guess that the sort of linear gameplay is perhaps my only critique of the game, but as I said, it works out anyway. I would have prefered the option to go on more sidequests for fun and loot and experience points, but the game is not set up in a way that you will be massively outgunned and needing further levelups. If you do end up doing all the sidequests, then you will probably have enough good stats to get through the game with moderate difficulty. There were two times in the game that I had to drop the difficulty to casual in the options menu, but things in the game are pretty well balanced.This one is my favorite game in the series. I recommend getting the game, especially if you can get it on sale. There is one DLC that I can find, but I havent tried it. Supposedly it is more completist if you get that DLC before getting into the main game because it changes a few things.All in all, this game does not offer much in the way of innovative development, but the game is fun enough to be something good and wellmade anyway.
