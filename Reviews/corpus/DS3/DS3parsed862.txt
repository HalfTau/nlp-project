Play this game if you want to break your fingers on the keyboard.This game became fun only after the hours I spent programming a Logitech G13 gaming keyboard to keep my fingers from tying into knots.Some of the supporting abilities are very weak. Its possible to build a character that cant progress beyond a boss and becomes stuck. There are plenty of save points make a lot of new saves.Reading texts in game is terribly executed. I keep telling myself Ill read them later in the Lore menu.The visuals are pretty but the settings are finicky. Adequately controlling the camera requires a thumbstick. Fighting and moving the camera together can easily require 5 simultaneous keystrokes.I mute the music and listen to a playlist of my favorite bands.I really enjoyed DS1 and DS2 with all their expansions and Broken Sword.This game made me yell a few times.After slapping it around a few times with the G13 I feel that tender Dungeon Siege attraction.
