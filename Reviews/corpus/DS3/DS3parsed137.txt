Loved this game. The story was entertaining and some elements reminded me of a Salman Rushdie novel. Just fantastic. I read a guide before playing to choose the most OP toon and get the right abilities without having to spend ages thinking about it. As a result i picked the Gipsy and this helped me enjoy the story a lot and own all the enemies no problem. Environments are nice, its cartoony but its well done. Clocked it in 4050 hours which is great, didnt bother to replay with other toons or try multiplayer. If you get it at a discount, which happens a lot, you wont go wrong.
