Like most of my fellow here in the review section I would like to simply say, Obsidian... You ed up your own game series. shakes head and frowns deeply you have lost many lovers of these games and I would love it if you.... or hell any good game developers were to take a nice long look at the successful Dungeon Siege games cough not thiscough and make another so that us actual fans of the Dungeon Siege games, and world and true genre may have an Actual Dungeon Siege 3I write this as respectfully as I can to one of my long time favorite developers and to my fellows on steam.I would not and cannot recommend this halfattempt to milk money from your now dead series.EDIT Allow me to ammend an error on my part... My mind is a bit muddled at the moment and because of recently playing another favorite game series of mine I spoke of Obsidian... I am actually speaking of Square Enix and its failure in my and others eyes to bring us, the consumers, an actual Dungeon Siege game. Also another additive... Im sure its a good game if you like Action/Hack and Slash third person games and not Click to move/hack and slash RPGs with decent though not overly great stories.... Though I will never call this a Dungeon Siege game, as it is not. Added in a comment to my own post, but Ive now placed it here as well.
