Dissapointment is an understatement when it comes to DS3. I should have payed more attention to the reviews and just purchased the first two instead of the whole package. DS3 is by far the worst of its series and not suprising to say the least considering square enix copublished this game. Watching child baring hips swing from side to side does not make up for trashy gameplay as for the story it was alright, it wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. If you are a true Dungeon Siege die hard the first two of the series would be your best investment in time and money, not worth the 19.99 for all three which includes the DLC. So pay extra attention to these reviews and DONT make the same mistake I made.
