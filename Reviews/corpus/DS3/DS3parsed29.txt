Theres a bug in the Glitterdelve mines that will prevent you from completing the game you cant light the explosives in either of the tunnels, the only way around is to reload from an earlier point in the game and hope you dont make the same mistake that sets the bug in motion, years later they havent bothered to fix it. Seriously dont bother.
