hard to get into compared to 1 and 2, 3 seems like a good story and gameplay isnt bad. ive tried getting into it a couple times and being a single player final fantsy style RP i couldnt get into it. the action of 2 and the open world of 1 are missed in this follow up. i would still reccomend it though if you can get it for a few bucks on sale.
