While DS1 was a fairly boring hack and slash with a fantastic modding community, and DS2 an obvious attempt at trying to be more like Diablo 2, DS3 might as well be from a different series. Thats not to say however, that it is a bad game, merely questionably named. DS3 drops most of the grinding and instead plays more like an action game. Loot and leveling still exist, but the emphasis is placed on the combat and story. The story isnt anything to write home about, but its still significantly better than the first 2 games in the series, and most action RPGs in general. The combat is where this game shines, different weapon and skill combinations can accent any play style, and its just flat out fun to play. The controls, especially with KBAM, may take some getting used to, but the game is worth it in the end.
