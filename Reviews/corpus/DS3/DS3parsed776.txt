Dungeon Siege III offers an enjoyable story driven dungeon crawler experience with RPG elements built in to help replayability.  Shockingly there is still an active community so it is easy to find others to play coop with.  For the price you get a ton of content and the visuals up to par with other modern AAA dungeon crawler releases.
