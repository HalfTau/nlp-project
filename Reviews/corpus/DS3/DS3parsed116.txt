Honestly, this is not a bad game.  I credit Obsidian for taking a garbage license that had produced two poor games in the past and making something thats almost worth recommending out of it.Sadly, it just cant overcome its roots.  Nonetheless, I will give it a recommendation simply because it is not a terrible game, and many people have downvoted it simply because it is different.The differences are the only things that are good.
