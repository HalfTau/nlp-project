From what Ive seen, this game is considered terrible, to which I highly disagree. This game definitely doesnt pass as a Dungeon Siege game, the only thing that qualifies it is the lore thats in it Which I think I gathered all but one piece of. It has many nerdservice moments, in which it refers back to the original game, and even some moments that refer to the second, but its style is entirely different. I look at games for what they are, not what they should be. Its still a good game, full of great storytelling, and an alright Combat system. The Combat System could use a bit of work, and I would have liked some more companion interraction, but it was a different developer from the first two games, so first of all, you cant expect them to go all out like they would have. Second, people need to stop saying Its not the same! It fails my professional inspection! It was a bold move to go from a, well, I dont know what genre it is, but mostly mouse controlled, to a game that actually requires some thought into combat. The combat system is very situational, and quite challenging, I can say that in the last two games, the combat mostly depended on luck, and how geared out your characters were. This one depends on actual skill, with the gear of your characters... The learning curb is a bit off, seeing as how it went from disappointing cakewalk to frustrating fires of hell, but once you figure it out, it tends to be a rather wellthoughtout system that actually levels up quite nice now that I think of it.For those that couldnt pay attention to my horrible rant Its not a Dungeon Siege game, though it has the lore of it. Its still a good game, for what it is. I highly recommend it. Unless youre stuck on nostalgia rather than gameplay
