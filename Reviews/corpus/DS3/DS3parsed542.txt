NO, just NO, do not install this.This game might have great story, but I will never know, because I could not suffer that horrible console interface. Inventory, quest log and menus are designed for consoles, and they come with all the quirks and limitations. The camera in this game is abysmal at best, you are either too far or too close to see anything. The UI and the HUD takes way too much space and you cant click on it, in fact you cant click on almost anything in the game, not even to get info on various objects or characters, you have to walk to it/them and press E to interract, this brings me to the character controls, you either turn with with keys, or hold alt  and turn with mouse, which isnt that great. RMB is not used to change camera, all it does is make your character walk. On top of this there is no autoclickandmoveto functionality in this game, and you will get stuck on the environment a lot.Combat system seems week, switching between different stances on your character is clumsy and unintuitive. Boss fight mechanics are repetitive, altho I havent finished the game so it may get better in the late game I wouldnt bet on it. There is no character customization in this game, you have to select from 3 or is it 4? pre defined avatars. Chracter progression is unrevarding, abilities and their specialization is very limited I belive there are 9 core abilities for each class. And now about all the loot and all the treasures... well you know that feeling when you get that one special item that makes you feel so powerfull and rewarded? In this game you get lot of garbage with weird stats instead! And if you combine this with that horrible inventory system, you just wish you did not pick that up.Enviroments are well designed, the graphics are nice and some of the spell effects looks amazing, game have great voice acting and really cool music.
