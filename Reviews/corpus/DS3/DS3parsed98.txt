I like DSIII. The game had some interesting choices made for it during development it seems though.Lets take a small look at what you can expect IF you decide to buy it at the end of this review.Dungeon Siege 3 hosts a few terrain problems in some areas that force you to turn the camera 180 degrees before you can get away, unless you changed the basic controls W S  movement, A D  turn camera. Dont be scared of this though, itll mostly happen at the very edge of the paths and normally doesnt happen during boss fights.We also dont get to evade past enemies at least this seems to be the case most of the time but you get iframes during your dashes so just dash away once you find your character. DO NOT LOSE TRACK OF YOUR OWN CHARACTER.If you love a challenge, youll enjoy the hardcore mode, which no its not actually hardcore, its a cool word for hard to them. Powerleveling wont get you anywhere as the enemies randomly jump in power, and any spray or ability that makes the floor deal damage over time will most likely 1shot you, theres no limit for how fast it damages you so you can drop really damn fast, and they decided to let most bosses and later mobs have at least one of these two.That being said, every start is troublesome until you get to the first town Id say, an unequipped character is exceptionally weak, and easy becomes really easy as soon as you start getting gear.Normal is still fine for a small challenge later on, though youll probably be equipped and confident enough to win every fight.Theres also a few more things worth noting, this IS a ported game at least feels very much like it and IS made for 2 player coop Im not sure if you can do 3 players or more, I havent tested it. Playing anything but easy or normal on singleplayer is like asking for someone to make you mad because honestly, the AI is the worst Ive ever seen in any game, the way it attacks and positions makes no sense at all, it feels like it just spams random buttons in hopes of doing something useful. They also try to revive you instantly even if its dangerous, so dont play this alone, youll regret it.So please, do not buy this game for a fun solo rpg game, because this is a coop/multiplayer rpg, not a solo one.YES, you CAN respec in case you ruin something or want to change skills, but this requires the DLC and it isnt needed at all.At max level youll have 34 talents untouched and 23 ability upgrades untouched and from my experience theres always at least two abilities you dont want to level, because others are much better to use.While were already on abilities, the game introduces Mastery for abilities, which is based off of times used rather than time used or damage dealt with abilities, so keep that in mind when going for that.When travelling in the game theres a few things that are nice to know.Firstly, the screen is capped in the area the players are currently in on any given map, P1 counts as a host in a signal, if P2 tries to dash away or other things, theyll be reset and teleported next to P1 exactly like AI will if they get too far away from the host.This also means that both players have to cooperate when going places, or else one of the players have to let the other run around freely. This can be done by having either P1 or P2 open up any menu c, x, f  etc, though not escape menu which will force the player into AI mode, Its best to have the player return to moving their character around before combat as the AI sometimes will force the player to stay locked out of their character because theyre either using a skill, following a pattern of commands or a third thing that makes no sense at all. This can make it seem like youre unable to control your character at all, which technically is the case, but the AI has registered that you want to go back to control so it wont force you out completely. It will most likely stop attacking soon enough and you can help this by spamming the evade key just keep in mind that it wont always help and you can be stuck unable to control your character for a bit, so please try to have everyone out of menus before combat for your own sake. It helps a lot.P1 is also the ONLY person that can interact with people and quest items/objects and NPCs. I cant tell you why they decided to do it like this, but thats how it is. P2 and others CANNOT progress quests, interact with quest objects unless they just have to pick it up for pull a lever or talk to NPCs.Heres a final thing for playing multiplayer as well. Your mic is automatically turned on and you cannot disable it ingame for some reason. If you dont want it to be like this, change your mic settings under steam settings  voice, add push to talk or change the mic to something that doesnt work.I believe I have mentioned anything worth mentioning in this game, and Ill answer any question needed in the comments.Besides everything I have adressed, I love the game.I love playing the game despite getting mad at sudden barrage of projectiles 1shotting me on Hard, or other things.The story is average to good, you dont really have any big options in the game, but picking the right thing to talk about at the right time earns you small bonuses. Deeds give youstat bonuses and some you get from talking, others you get from really exploring and checking out everything you can. Exploring pays off in terms of items and deeds, rushing the game lets you farm achievements I suppose, but why would you do that in an RPG?The gameplay pays off tacticians on Hard, and lets people playing on Easy mess around and have fun, theres a fine balance from Easy to Normal, though Hard is a thing for itself.The graphics are also where they should be I feel, they dont seem old nor super hightech, I may be biased as I prefer it when games look like how Dungeon Siege 3 does, but I wouldnt say the graphics are bad at, they suit a game from its year.If you like the first 35 hours of the game I would buy the DLC if you have the chance, the DLC adds 5 hours of gameplay Id say, if not more, and gives you just a little bit more to do in the game.
