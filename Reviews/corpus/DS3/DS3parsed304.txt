This is the worst of the 3 games in this series. The witch boss in the church is hard to beat for this 58 year old gamer.Tried leveling up past level 20 on multiple characters and fed up with not being able to beat her.Had they left the game similar to the first 2 games in this series, it would have been a much better game.So it is off to play something less stressful.
