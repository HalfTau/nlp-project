I originally played through this game on console in local coop, and now I wanted to try out the DLC. Turns out you need to play through quite a lot of the main campaign to even get to the DLC which kind of sucks, but I found the game good enough to replay. Its even better in singleplayer actually because of the annoying camera issues in coop, and theres also quite a bit of dialogue which slows down the pace.DS3 is nothing like its predecessors the loot is kind of nonrelevant, RPG elements are dumbed down, the world is much more linear, and the main theme isnt even in the game. But its still a solid ARPG with a good combat system, good music and beautiful environments. The story and the lore is super well written and theres a lot of it, all with good voice acting too. Too bad theres no sequel in sight.
