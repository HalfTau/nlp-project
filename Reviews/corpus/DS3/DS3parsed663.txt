A great dungeon crawler with a great look. If you like Torchlight or The Adventures of Van Helsing, you should check this game out. It is  more linear than Torchlight 2 or Van Helsing, but its enjoyable with lots of side quest, gameaffecting decisions, things to explode, and a selection of companions to help the exploding along. The plot is interesting, but not incredible. The voice acting is not incredible at all, but the look and feel of the game may help you to over look that because it is bad. In short this is a video game I have played and enjoyed.
