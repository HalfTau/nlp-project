THIS IS NOT A DUNGEON SIEGE GAME!!! This game is nothing compared to DSII, the gameplay and style are completly different. I have not played the multiplayer and I probalby will not. Your team building is completely limited to the constructs of  the preset game options, your  character class is permanetly set and you cannot stray in the slightest to develop a character to fit your design or fighting style like the incredible system in DSII. You can tell that Chris Taylor had really nothing to do with this game, the fact that he let it be produced is disheartening. The visuals are great dont get me wrong, but the camera is horrendous. It is always at an angle that makes you a bit nauseous, plus you cannot adjust it to see well at all. The target locking system is entirely automated, I have not found a way  to turn it off, so the enemy that you are targeting  is not the one  that you choose, completly eliminating any potential strategy in the battles. The story line is not too bad, a bit dry at times but overall it has been pretty decent. Alas the only real connection to the wonderful DSII is that a few of the names like Asunites are thrown in for good measure.To anyone who is a fan of the DS series I WOULD NOT recommend this game. I wish I had looked into the game further  before purchasing, but the idea of a new DS game I hit the  purchase button without hesitation. But if you are looking for  a halfway decent loot based RPG then wait until it is on sale before you pick it up.
