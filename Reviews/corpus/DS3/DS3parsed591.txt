I bought the Dungeon Siege series on the summer sale for arouned 6 as I had lost discs for the first game and it was worth it for the price to play again.I had played the beta and couldnt really remember much of it, so I thought Id take the leap and buy it.  The running alone killed it for me...End note, if you enjoyed the first two games, dont let that sway you into buying this.  This has gone horribly wrong, I cant comment of the story because I couldnt even force myself to get far enough in.  Terrible game!
