I had fun playing this game, and seeing all the parts of the Dungeon Siege world again. Although the game is a long chase getting to the end and sometimes I wished that my character would just go about it another way, the ending brings all the factions, parts of the game, as well as historical references and extraplanar encounters throughout the Dungeon Siege world together. Lots of fun!
