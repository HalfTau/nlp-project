While Its not the worst way to burn hours. its very pretty, character design and artwork are fantastic, even as well crafted as the levels are, they are also boring. Do yourself a favor, if youre going to get this, get it on sale. DS 2 was vastly superior, as the other reviews have noted this game is designed from the ground up as a console game. blech. also the story has practically nothing to do with the previous game. The controls are wonky and have to be customized, though that doesnt solve the frustrating softtarget system. And the walkmesh sucks meaning your char gets trapped in corners if youre not playing with heightened perception. The storyline is interesting butslow moving. I can see why square enix is falling on hard times with failures like this. Its kind of sad actually.gonna try it multi, ill update this if it improves the experience.
