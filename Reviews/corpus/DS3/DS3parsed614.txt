What happened to Dungeon Siege? The first one was truly amazing, the second wasnt the same but this one is horrible, It doesnt feels like a Dungeon Siege anymore.If youre new to Dungeon Siege, you should either move on and get the first and second or play this one then play the fist game, you probably wont want to play this one anymore after having played the first and second in the series.Its still a good game but it shouldnt be considered as a Dungeon Siege game, there was 2 maps in the first one, the campaign one and the multiplayer one that could also be played singleplayer and that was a plus, you could always play with the same character on the campaign or multiplayer map, you could also create your own maps and/or download community made maps.Not In the second though but the campaign was still really good.The music was amazing in the first Dungeon Siege, in this one, its nothing special.The gameplay, well, even if this game wasnt called Dungeon Siege, it would still be crap because of that, it feels more like a console actionrpg thanks to the consoles than a real PC actionrpg such as the first Dungeon Siege.Its just bad, trust me on this one.People who downgrade this review or who likes the game are just console actionrpg fans, not the true actionrpg fans.If you like this kind of game, good for you, but I just cant endure it, its so bad, and Im kind of mad that they destroyed this great series with this piece of crap.3.5/10
