If you like RPGs and a bit of hack n slash, this game is for you. Lots of fun, good story line, good characters and super addicting. Parts can be hard boss fights but definitely worth it. There was a lot of thought put into this game and there are a lot of different ways your decisions affect it. Havent beaten it about 25 of the way through, I think and I absolutely LOVE it. Sometimes its hard to pull myself away, haha. Definitely a good buy and a good way to pass the time. Long Live the Legion! !Edit I beat the game quite awhile ago and forgot to update the review. I was addicted to the very end and was very sad when the game finally came to a halt. I ended up having to replay the last bit cause I missed one of the achievements which kept me from getting the fullywinthegame achievement. At some point I hope to play the other three characters, but I really liked Anjali so it might be a hard change.There are quite a few interesting aspects in the game that I enjoyed. The skill selection process, for one, as well as the essences to add boosts to your character by way of weapons and armor. The multiplayer is certainly not the greatest, it would be if it didnt have a tethered camera. There is a way around this, but I am not desperate enough for a multiplayer to deal with adjusting the game by way of editing files.So all in all, I would suggest buying this game to play solo. If you want it for the multiplayer aspect, I think I should say to skip it.EditEdit I forgot to mention this is a linear game, meaning it follows a pretty solid track with no real free roam. I didnt find it bothersome, but some others might so I figured it should be thrown out there.
