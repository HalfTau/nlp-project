I recomend this game because its fun and quiet hard to play, so it gives you a chalange acros the game but a good game comes with dissapointments suchin the last 2 games you had player costumasation and armor costumasation, while in this game you barley have armor costumasation and you are stuck with the same face if you like it or not.The save points are one of the most anoyng things that I find in this game. At first I foth the game had auto saves but no so I got backed down all the way to the start of the game and I was lvl 6.The good things are the graphics, story and the tresures of the sun dlc witch I recomend because its quiet funThats all
