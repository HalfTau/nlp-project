This game had great potential, but I gave up and deleted after 45 hours due to the fatal mine/dynamite bug.  It compelled me to get the cheats and try to fix the mission and objective status myself to continue, but it proved too arduous.  The loot system was ok, the enchanting system had great potential too, many of the fights were unfair on normal difficulty, and by all means dont play this on a PC as mouse and keyboard make combat tedious.
