DS3 while not like its predecessors its still pretty damn good.  I thought the story was fantastic and you have multiple branching paths like choosing your own adventure books.  Much like you would find in a Dragon Age or The Elder Scrolls title.  The game can be quite difficult at times too.  Difficulty spikes throughout the game.  You may down a boss within a few minutes, but getting to the boss you may come close to death more than a few times from trash mobs.  Treasures of the Sun DLC is highly recommended and has quite a lot to offer.  Level cap 5, enchanting, more story and the option to respec your skills!!!DS3 isnt like DS1 or DS2 in the regard of open world ARPGs, but still does a good job in the genre nonetheless.  There are save points everywhere in this game so if you do forget to save your last save shouldnt be far behind.  I do wish the respec pool for your abilities was easier to do.  Youll have to backtrack and traverse through areas again just to get to the town that offers this.  Buying new gear from merchants was way overpriced so buying from them was never an option for me.  By the time I made it to the last boss my gear was pretty good anyway, but I did end up having an excess of gold by that time too.On the fence about whether youd like this or not?  Like I stated above.  If youre into choose your own adventures like Dragon Age/Oblivion, but in ARPG form this game is for you.  DLC recommended.  Well written and very fun.  Enjoyed.  9/10
