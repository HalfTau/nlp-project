Er.....Fans of the first Dungeon Siege should steer wide of this offering.   The controls, UI, combat, party mechanics, plot , etc is geared toward less of a traditional fantasy and more towards an action game.  The menus are confusing, requiring navigation when I should just be able to click on the item right in front of me and perform whatever action I wish to perform.  I am glad the game has dialogue choices, and half expected them to remove voice acting which was in the first game from, now, 15 YEARS AGO!.  Sure, the graphics look pretty, but you can only polish a turd so much.  The game shows a general lack of innovation and more of a general phoning in of a fantasy setting.  If youve ever played Dragon Age and thought Man, I want absolutely no control of my team and want to just sit here and roll my face on the keyboard, this is the game for you.ProsPretty graphicsDialogue choicesConsNot a strategy game like previous gamesNo tactical/strategic control of party membersCumbersome menusHack/Slash combatNo Save optionNot fun
