just got done clearing the game at about 20 hours. the game has good graphics, and has some good mecahnics like not needing to have constant trips to sell things and having an ai player to help you. however, I felt it was quite lacking for a dungeon crawler. too many text choices that really dont matter and not a way to really customize your character game play. it felt like it was trying to have the skin of an rpg when it is really a dungeon game and therefore the duegeon part became lacking. the boss fights are okay. Overall, I would give this game 5 out of 10 and would only reccomended buying it if it is 5 or below
