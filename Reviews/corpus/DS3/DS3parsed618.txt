Note My time with this game was on a console rather than PC.This game is an odd one. If you were a fan of the first two games, this one completely destroys their story line.There is not much of a story line here at all. In fact the story line is so bad and boring that I usually just put on music and button mash this game away. Its fun but relatively short. This is one of those games that you can see a massive problem with it, yet you had fun progessing through the game.If I was more of a Dungeon Seige fan I would have hated this game. It is not true to the series, but I still liked it enough to give it a thumbs up.SummaryVery ShortNo storyVery basic gameplayFun to play with a friend and music going
