I was very unhappy with this game in comparison to Dungeon Siege 2.  However, comparing this game to others of the same type and genre out there, it is actually good.  It would be better if it had a different name.  As a follow up to Dungeon Siege 2, it sucks.  As a stand alone game compared to others out there, it is not too bad....6.5 outta 10
