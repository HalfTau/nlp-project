Clumsy UI, this game was probably originally designed for consoles. Its certainly not intuitive for keyboard mouse use. This for me, is an instant turnoff and makes up the lions share of why I think this is a waste of money for PC gamers.Theres little to no customisation available for the UI and scant tooltips/help etc. So if you play it fora while then get sidetracked because you start playing a new release you have been waiting for, and then come back to it, you will invariably have to start the thing from scratch to go through the tutorial/opening scenes to get used to the UI again.Its pretty, graphically, but a bit dated and certainly wont tax your machine.Lesson learned? Dont buy a game simply because of the intro vid on Steam and the reviews.
