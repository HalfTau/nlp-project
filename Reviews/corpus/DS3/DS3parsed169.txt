6/10   The first half is fun as you unlock new characters and abilities and can purchase equipment that makes a difference. By the last 1/2 to 1/3  money no longer matters,  increased abilites dont matter,  relationships don matter. This  is also a very linear game with only one DLC to a different world.Get it on sale for a decent 15 hours of gameplay. Worth1.49
