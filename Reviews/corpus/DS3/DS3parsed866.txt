Wow what a piece of...Never underestimate the ability of large corporations collaborating together to churn out a steaming pile of filth. The basic camera issues and glitches would more than fill out a review before therpg elements and boring game play could even be discussed. O you mean to tell me that every single move I get can be mastered and then empowered to create a unique variant of that same move? !....cool now I have total of 5 moves when I beat the game...and maybe 2 of them are useful. Riveting. The graphics are dated,  the camera sucks a huge phallus especially on multiplayer which is what the game is meant for, unless of course you enjoy running around with an  A.I  imitating Gilbert Grape, and the combat gets stale after 2 hours. Thankfully the game can be completed in around 10 so I can assure you, if you already made the mistake of purchasing, the suffering will be brief. Id rather go to church than play through this game again. 2/10  Doodie.
