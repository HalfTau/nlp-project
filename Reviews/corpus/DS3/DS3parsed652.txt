Overall, it is a nice game. Good graphics, good gameplay and good story. But it has nothing to do with the Dungeon Siege we used to know. I think theyd have more respect from players if the makers released this game with another name. This is a simple adaption of a completely different story to the Dungeon Siege plot. I do not regret spending my money for this game. It is worth. It was fun to play. I only wish the camera settings were better than this. However, I cant give bad credit to the game just for this because this is the biggest similarity of this game when compared to other Dungeon Siege games  The previous games also had problems with the camera settings.
