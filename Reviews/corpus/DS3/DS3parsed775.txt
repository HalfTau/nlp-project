Dungeon Siege III is definitely a Dungeon Siege game. Like its predecessors, it blends actionRPG gameplay with the character development of a more traditional RPG. However, the gameplay in Dungeon Siege III is bland, and the combat is dull and repetitive. Maybe it gets better, but I lost interest pretty quickly. Its a sort of consolefriendly Dungeon Siege.The storyline seems to expect you to be playing Coop with friends, and maybe that would add variety to the fights. But solo, its really difficult to stay interested, when most of what youre doing is mowing down wave after wave of enemies in the same way, over and over, and you make your way from point A to point B.This is an uninspired game, not worthy of your time.
