Dungeon Siege. A game about smashing, looting, and wrecking the place, with no care or consequence for the world.When I saw this game release, my coop buddy and I grabbed a copy and immediately jumped into the game to play. The Coop was decent enough, though you can troll the other guy in a few irritating ways. Most horribly, however, is the fact that coopter, the person joining the host, does not retain anything their character aquires when they leave the match. Instead, the hosts alternate character maintains the items. Thus, its not so much coop, as it is Youre my B.In the end, we never could make ourselves continue to play it, after discovering that, and thus, never beat it.
