This is a game that reminds us why certain games do better on PC and not on console due to their specific genre related contents. Unlike Dungeon Siege I and II, this game is no where near what it couldve been. Anyone who played Dragon Age Origin and then played Dragon Age II would immediately realize that a game that is built to be big, beautiful and content intensive should be put on pc only. Dragon Age IIs epic failure proved why DA II shouldve been on PC. This game, in an attempt to please the console players like DA II, is a port that failed to provided the mentioned contents, that PC players would otherwise expect. In other wordsTHIS GAME IS AN EPIC FAILURE IN THE FRANCHISE THAT WE KNOW AS DUNGEON SIEGE. If you see a very low price drop, get it. Otherwise, save your money.
