Having played and loved the first two Dungeon Siege games this one came as quite a shock. Its a very different style of game and thats not in itself a bad thing, but the way it has been implemented here is.As far as the good things go, the combat is excellent and a much better system imo than the previous games. Characters actually have some story to them, although the banter is not as good as DS2. The art, sound and graphics are also very good. And, oddly, your choices do actually have some relevance.Unfortunately the rest is not so good. Major things like the camera, the lack ofpath/journey, the skillsets, the inventory, the loot, the overall story the sub stories and characters are fine and the lack of playable characters really detracts from the game. Especially the loot. Finding uniques doesnt actually matter, the stats are cryptic and you will most often replace items every 5 minutes. Characters are also horribly imbalanced. Anjali and Lucas are what you would expect, but Reinhart is a tactical nuke the further you progress and Katarina is weaker than wet paper. Why? Because of stats. Agility Dex which is crucial to Katarina gets worse as you level wheras Will Int remains the same which is crucial for Reinharts skill spamming. Katarina is also not a good AoE character but Reinhart is all about AoE.I could ramble on for ages but what it comes down to is this. There are plenty of other games you could buy and play and be much happier with. If you really want to get this, do it when it is on sale as this is a once through kinda game with 0 replayability other than trying out each character or playing in coop.
