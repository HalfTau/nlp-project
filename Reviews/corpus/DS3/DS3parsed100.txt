Ok I have a few big issues with this game first being this feels like a console game that was poorly ported to PC. First off the controls are pretty bad unless you do some modifying in the option menu, game barely explains what any of the stats in the menu do or how they act on your character. You also cant reset any of your abilites if you wanted to try out a different build for a charcter and to top it off you have no control of your AI partner in combat, so you invest into their second tree its just wasted effort because they only use that tree in rare occasions. The game honestly feels like a halfdiablo 3 that the developers didnt want to put much effort into otherwise it wouldve been a good game.
