This game gets a 9/10 for me, it got nice graphics plus very detailed physics, like items that move they way the should in the background, you can walk towards some chains and they will get pushed by your character as they should. The game have a decent amount of spells, could maybe be like 5 more or something to each character, but still good with not so much to choose from can get confusing with alot of spells. The quests have a nice story line, and they managed to make the side quests more well made, that you do a side quest butt you still fight a boss that give you great loot, you sometimes even get to a pace that you probably think is a main story place, but its not.All the background content is well made and placed for it to flow in with the environment.The times in quests were you get options on how you want to do things, like spare or kill someone and that makes it different for you in the game.Only downsides that I can come up with is that you share the same screen when you play with a friend, it would have been more fun if there were 2 separated screens, though in this shared screen way you get more team play.Great game, recommend to anyone that like rpgs!
