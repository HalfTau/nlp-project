Not bad, though beware the dreaded not safe to... bug in chapter 4.  Ive run into it on each playthrough and even using a console to try and circumvent it, Ive had to restart the entire area just to advance the game. Suffice to say, this has been a known gamebreaking bug since its existence and wont likely ever get fixed this many years later especially....  With that caveat out of the way, its a fun game, warts and all.
