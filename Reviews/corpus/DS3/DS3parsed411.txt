Dont let my playtime fool you, Ive got 45 hours logged in this game across accounts, consoles, and demo.  I only own it because the entire Dungeon Siege trilogy was on sale.Its an awful, awful third installment of what was once a great series.  Camera controls are terrible, gameplay is simplistic in the worst possible ways  this turned Dungeon Siege from a wonderfully atmospheric partybased RPG to a thoughtless buttonmashing ARPG.  A sad end to the franchise.If youre looking for an updated version of DS1 or DS2 to play, this is not it.  Go back to DS2 and try to sort out the multiplayer bugs instead.I have heard the couch multiplayer in this is acceptable, though I have not tried it.
