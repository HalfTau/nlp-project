Most of the negative reviews for this game are about it not being similar to the previous games and being a vastly different experience in the Dungeon Siege series. Ive never played the first two games myself, however, even if I did, I would still believe Dungeon Siege III is a really good game. I would describe Dungeon Siege III as something that could be a Dragon Age action RPG spinoff.Tell you what, try the demo and decide whether you want to buy it or not. If you are familiar with the Dungeon Siege games, try playing the third one again. You may actually like it, or not. Give it an hour or two. It could be a whole different game, but you know, if you enjoy playing it as much as I do, then its a good game to you as much as it is to me.
