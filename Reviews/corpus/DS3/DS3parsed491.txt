There is no autosave... if you die, I hope you saved recently. I mean come on, I understand games where when you die you get pushed back a bit, or lose some gold or w/e, but no. In this game if you die your character, that means your levels your items all the abilites and talents, everything that you have done since the last time you used a save location is lost. Now there are save locations literally everywhere, but nowhere does it say that you can lose hours of play by simply not saving because your playing... thats what atosaves are for... ffs.
