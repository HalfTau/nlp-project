Developed by Obsidian and published by Square Enix Dungeon Siege 3 is a very good action loot oriented rpg. Streamlined compared to its predecessors but surprisingly polished and littered with the influence of Square. The original penned yarn and accompanied lore are well versed and played out through npc interaction and discovery.  The games art direction and lighting are striking and the voice acting is suffcient.  The companion AI, one choosen from a set of 3 as the story evolves, can be customized though not directly controlled and can be swapped but not during combat. Skill trees have been replaced with an abilitiy / profiency system though this system does not provide the level of customization seen in similiar games with extensive skill trees. To compensate for the lack of health or mana potions mana regen occurs though battle and health regen occurs though the use of abilities.  PC controls have been long since patched but the controller implementation is near perfect.
