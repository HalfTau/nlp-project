Short VersionComing into this game expecting more of DS1/2? Youll be disappointed. Forget the Dungeon Siege name and youll find a pretty solid game with nice couch coop.Long VersionGameplay Clearly more geared for console gamepad play, enjoyable nonetheless fights ask more out of your positioning and timing with attack/skills/dodge/block. Theres a lot of enemies/loot/merchants, some quests and the 4 main jobs youd expect on a DS game, even if under a new paint. Of course I miss using multiple party members but the AI is not that bad, my biggest problem is with the online coop the camera is BAD and the game doesnt allow all players to have a character, you have the hosts game and everyone else is a guest using the stats/equips of the characters in it.Story The plot isnt winning any awards, and there are less characters and worldbuilding than in the previous DSs. The narrator isnt bad but most of the story feels like its trying to be more epic than it is. I also felt that, for a game with choices, they should matter more than... next to nothing, lots of places could have been better/more explored. The main characters are decent and their interactions are a nice add to the experience.Sound A mild soundtrack with no memorable themes. Nevertheless, they fit the locations and acompany the battles, nothing felt out of place. I enjoyed the VA for all characters with a huge bias towards Katarinas, Im a sucker for that accent .Graphics A great improvement from the infamous derpy looking DSs graphics which I had no problem with, love the changing armours, the spells effects, the scenarios, they all hold up to this day imo.Disclaimer Im a huge fan of the DS franchise and, like a lot of people, had trouble adapting to this new style, I feel like it would have done better under a different name.
