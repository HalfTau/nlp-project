Third part of the game was the one I have spent most of the time. I had thought it can offer the best experience but I did not manage to check it out fully.Whole plot seems to be interesting but game linearity was bothering me so much that I couldnt forget I am guided by a hand not even once.There is also something else which is bad nice ascetic limited by one screen camera lock for coop play. This had made me so annoyed that whole game became unplayable after just a few hours. And Ive never looked back at it.
