Entertaining hack and slash game. Dont expect DS I or DS II gameplayI did that at first and didnt enjoy the game as much. When I finally came back to the game and reconfigured the camera controls... a MUST and judged it as a stand alone game in the general DS lore, I enjoyed the game much more.Story is only decent good at times, bad at times. Though it is a beautiful world with some interesting enemies. I definitely recommend getting the DLC.Overall, I was happy I played it. Even happier that I got it on sale.
