I havent played the first two of this series, and the only similar game I can compare it to is Blizzards Diablo. In comparison to that I find this game to be acceptable. The way some negative reviews go on about the lack of story and horrible gameplay mechanics, you would think they are comparing it to Baldurs Gate. The earlier Dungeon Siege games have never been compared to Baldurs Gate so Im assuming they are nowhere as complex and engaging. With that in mind this game in itself may not be a great RPG, nor an improvement over the older series installments, but its a decent game that I would recommend to other Diablo players who prize gameplay over plot.Also, the camera controls are fully customizable so if a player has issues with it, they must be the type of player who only plays on default settings. I never play on default so my game plays how I want it.
