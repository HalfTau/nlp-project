What happened to this franchise? The first and second games were incredible, this one is a like somebody decided to release a technology demo as a fullfledged game.Its the best looking Dungeon Siege game yet but thats where the praise ends. I tried to like it but was thwarted at every turn.A weird game save system, frequently finding yourself woefully overmatched, a weak storyline and of course those awful camera angles that have you looking at walls instead of your opponent. Control is vague at best which combined with the goofy camera angles make the game tedious to play. You spend more time compensating for the interface than worrying about your quests. Thats a shame because the maps are gorgeous and painstakingly rendered but the technical problems with the game ruin the immersion.It took the Play out of Role Playing Game...I actually bought a copy of Dungeon Siege 3 for a friend of mine whos an avid RPG player which included previous Dungoen Siege games. I was hoping for the same hundreds of coop gameplay hours we enjoyed with Dungeon Siege 2.He loaded it up, played it for 30 minutes and said to me,  I cant play this...Theres not much more to say...
