I may return and update this review, but I think Ive gotten to a polarizing aspect of this game in comparison to the first entry. The first allows levelling through activity, getting better at whatever you use. This game on the other hand gives set characters with set personalities set ability trees and set playstyles. This means your first decision is both crucial and completely uninformed. All of the character descriptions come down to Fights at range, except when it doesnt or Fights up close, except when it doesnt. All of the characters are supposed to be different in meaningful ways, but theyre also supposed to be adaptable to different peoples playstyles. So the differences come across as cosmetic at least early onThere are things like blocking and dodging to try to make up for taking all the fun of leveling up by limiting it to slotted abilities just like diablo. They even fail to make the low level characters feel weak. Ive already murdered about a hundred fellow human beings in the first few hours in groups of 510... So your character is both the chosen one and a supersaiian. At least in the first they were dimminutive goblinthings... Topdown just is not the right setting for the actionheavy game style theyre trying to create.Im gonna go play the first more, its not as bogged down by misguided aspirations.
