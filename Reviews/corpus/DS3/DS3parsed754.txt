Hello,Dungeon Siege 2 always gave me a Diablo 2 with a better story vibe. Dungeon Siege 3, while coming out before Diablo 3, plays very much like it. Quality between the third installments of the two series are much the same. If you like one, you will like the other. I dont much care for either of them though the second installments of each were very fun.I do not recommend this game. Go play Dungeon Siege 2 instead. Much better game I think.Cheers,Michael
