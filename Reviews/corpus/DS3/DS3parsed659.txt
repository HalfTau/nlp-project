I remember dungeon siege as being something that rewarded you for the skills you did over time no matter what they were, allowing you to create weird character types of strength and magic. This installment removes that and gives you 4 hard choices to pick from with no customization whatsoever and no skill branching that was indicative of the others.Id have preferred if this was called something else other than Dungeon Siege as it didnt feel anything like the previous installments of the series from my POV.
