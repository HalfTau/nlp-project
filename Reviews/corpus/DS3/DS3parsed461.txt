This is one of the worst, if not THE worst, game I have ever played. The UI, player controls, and camera controls are an abominable mess. I might have 45 minutes invested in this game and refused to waste another second. LOVED Dungeon Siege II back in the day, but this game is a travesty. Just glad I only paid a 1.99 for it. Yuck!
