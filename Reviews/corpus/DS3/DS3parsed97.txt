While definitely not as good as the first two four games in the Dungeon Siege game, theres quite a lot to be said for DS3.The simplification of the game mechanics was a huge shock initially, and as much as I loved the original DS games . . . theres a nice simplicity to DS3 that turns it more into a player skillbased fighting game with RPG elements. In DS1 and DS2 you just spent all your time ducking into corners trying to find armour and weapons and spells that were just a touch bit better than what you already had DS3 honestly does a better job of this, with a much tighter reward cycle.The story is a bit . . . meh. Decent enough, but not a selling point of the game. The butchering of the original DS1 lore is a touch sad, even if it kind of does set up nicely for a sequel . . . that wont ever happen, probably.Couple of other things that bothered me many of the female characters have armour that isnt even close to being realistic for Azunais sake, Katerina wears high heels in combat!. Multiplayer is a bit of a joke... some of the skills are solidly OP. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty and only ever needed to use the block mechanic in one battle, which was in the DLC content . . .But overall its a solid fighting game with beautiful graphics. Camera controls are a touch annoying, and the story is nothing to write home about, but it kept me interested enough to play through three times once as Katerina, twice as Anjali. Its very different than the other DS games, so I suspect thats why it has poor reviews, at least in part.I think you can do better with 15, but you can also do far worse.Quick note  I played this game offline, not online, hence Steam claiming Ive only played it for 0.1 hours?!? Silly steam.
