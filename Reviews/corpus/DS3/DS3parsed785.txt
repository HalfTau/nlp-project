This game has its faults, like a clunky inventory, an inefficient notification system, and also forcing you to rebind your keys before getting into the game, but somehow this game still holds enough polish to shine. The gameplay is a great, hack and slash dungeon crawler. This adventure is also a fair example of how straightforward RPGs can still tell great stories without a load of optional, distracting, inconsequential side quests that require you to go out of your way and stray far from the main storyline. The land of Ehb is a rich and colourful one that more people should take a chance to explore.
