I was hoping for a sequal to dungeon siege 1 or 2. But as it turns out this game has nearly nothing to do with the previous games. Its more like a cheap version of darksiders. The graphics are nice, it has some good combat action, though I liked the versatility of DS1 more. Its a pity that in DS3 most enemies look like clones, all the same faces. And there is no diablo like loot system or a goal where you try to get good gear to showing, use or trade with friends, in fact the coop option is truely limited, but those who log in are forced to stay in the same screen as the host, so no wandering off and they cannot bring their own characters, gear and so on. The only thing they can do is use a free character slot on the host. So they dont gain anything for the time they spend on it. At least not for their own campaign. Its a pity really that they called it DS3, I can only hope there will be a real sequel for DS1 someday in the future.
