Meh...its average/slightly below for a generic hack and slash, which is part of the problem. DS 12 were damn good, and then you get this .   You could build your character how you wanted based on spells found and weapons used, now you are stuck in predefined roles as named characters. You used to have a fairly open world to explore, now its pretty much a guided tour...seems like things keep getting simplified for our benefit in many modern games.If you can get it cheap, go ahead...Its decent, but I wouldnt suggest paying full or even half price.
