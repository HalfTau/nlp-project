DS3 is a weird one. It has no right to bear Dungeon Siege in its title and is an obvious console port, yet it somehow redeems itself by the end when you realize that its moreorless a proper RPG masquerading as HS. Moral choices and other major decisions and not something you usually find in the aforementioned genre nor is lengthy epilog detailing the consequences of your decisions. Unexpected thumbs up.
