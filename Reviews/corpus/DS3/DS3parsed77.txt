The graphics are amazing everything else is boring.The artistic direction is truly wonderful I especially enjoy Anjalis design. Unfortunately, the rest of the game is terribly tediouskilling baddies feels unsatisfying, which is a shame for an ARPG.the loot system should not even exist since its main draw to customize your character according to the items you choose is not in the game. You can safely play through the whole game without looking at the items stats, instead just picking whichever ones have the highest gold value.the story is entirely uninteresting. No twists, no emotion.I played through the whole game on the highest difficulty, but on the last level I just skipped all the mobs and went straight for the final boss. Ive never done that before.Disappointing.
