Hilariously wooden voice acting with gravellyvoiceman doing the cutscenes and firebaby make for great laughs with friends. Just kind of annoying and awful without.This game is hilariously bad, its like one of those movies you watch with friends and laugh, a lot, about.Like, I dont care about any of the characters, the voice acting is halfwooden, switches between accents, and from time to time just sounds like someone ran Siri throuhg a Synthesizer.But its pretty frustratingly hilarious when you play it with a friend. I just dont recommend playing it alone, because as a single player game I would have just stopped playing after roughly 10 minutes.I also got it very cheap, so that factors into my this game was worth 5 dollars as a package deal with two other games that dont run on my computer because theyre so old.I havent gotten to play dungeon siege I  II, but dungeon siege III is a barrel of albeit unintentional laughs.6/10, with friends.Not recommended without friends.
