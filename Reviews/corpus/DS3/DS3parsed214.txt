The most challenging and satisfying two player coop experience Ive ever had. Its short but intense, the journey is totally worth it. Ignore the lackluster RPG aspects poor dialogs, underwhelming story and focus on the satisfying actionrpg gameplay.Couch coop is recommended.Edit for the I thought this game was cool before it got an award. It wont win any award and that really makes me sad as I do still think this is the best coop arpg Ive played.This is the best couch coop actionrpg experience youll ever have. Clearly underated game because of the way it broke apart from its predecessors.The challenge that this game offers matches the tightness of the control and the satisfaction of beating up some hard encounters in coop with your best friends.4 players coop is too chaotic, but 2 players is pure awesomeness.
