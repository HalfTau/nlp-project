Dungeon Siege III is rather curious game, in one hand is not good port to pc weird camera controls, have very little do to with the original franchise, lots of strange game mechanics that are barely explained. But also have some very good concept art even when the camera make very hard to see your character up close, rather good storycharacters with some choices that impact the end but dont expect much. It feel more like action rpg with some diablo like mechanics that a proper dungeon siege game, it could be said that its greatest sin lay on its name. So if you aware and wish to give a try, I might recommend, but if you seek something like Dungeon Siege II or I, avoid it.
