This game is one i thoroughly enjoyed. However, i am a fan of the genre of dungeon crawler. If you are not then you need not buy this game. It follows the path of every Dungeon game that has come before it. For those that are you find a very well polished experience. The graphics are sharp, the gameplay is standard, and the story intriguing. My only complaint would be the somewhat unbalanced form the 4 players you choose from have. The knight and the ranger are your best choice, and your only choice is you play alone. If you desire to play the other 2 characters. Then you need to be in a party as they are more geared toward helping, or assist party members than stand alone ones. Although this game is aimed toward multi play it shouldnt be neccasary. Complaint aside i enjoyed my time, and look foward to completeing this game again. Although i might enjoy it more with another to play with.
