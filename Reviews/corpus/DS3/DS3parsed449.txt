Not sure why so many people be hating on this game. I was a die hard fan of DS1 and I really enjoyed this game. They bring in all the lore from the first one. It is 150 years later, but the story line is still great. Im assuming that any bad reviews are coming from people who havent played more than an hour of the game or really suck at the new gameplay. They just a bunch of pansies. It does take some pratice to work the camera and hotkeys properly, but once you do it is easy to enjoy the game. I played as Katarina my first time through and had no problems once I figured everything out. The more melee style characters may be more difficult. I was definitely more disappointed with DS2. This one was a nice surprise, I went in expected to be disappointed. Definitely is an underrated game. I recommend you give it a chance.
