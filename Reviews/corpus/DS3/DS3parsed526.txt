prettie fun game. i dont really understand the ability and talents system, but thats because i suck at those things. the story is decent. two bad things are that the armour often has 1 piece stand out and you dont have to make decisions depending on your play style, but you always go for one, and i dont really get in what time this story plays. its a fun game
