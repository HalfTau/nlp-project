This game actually isnt too bad. Looks good, plays well and its challenging.However, i can completely understand a lot of the negativity. This game isnt anything like the previous titles in the series. And personally i also would have much preferred a real DS title. But if im objective, i can recommend this as a decent fun enough hack  slash title. Especially if you can get it during a sale. Gas Powered games is pretty much gone, so i dont think well ever have a real successor.
