Disclaimers this is not a flawless game.  The biggest issue is that its sometimes prone to targeting the wrong enemy. And I could have done with less cheesecake in the character designs. Finally, if youre a die hard actionrpger, youll probably find it too short and the character abilities not diverse enough.That said, I liked it.  Its certainly my favorite of the Dungeon Siege games, overall the combat was more diverse and interesting than in 1 or 2 though 2 had better boss fights, and the characters were given more depth.  Though certainly not the deepest tale, the story was also stronger than in the other games.  Most importantly, DS3 has a satisfying ending, with plenty of what happened to ... information about the postgame world.  I leave the game feeling pretty happy about the experience, unlike DS2 and the terrible nonending it offered up.
