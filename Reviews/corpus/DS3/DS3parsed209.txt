If you enjoyed the first two Dungeon Siege games and like Diablolike adventures in general... well, then dont buy this.  The mechanics are very different, the multiplayer experience forces you to share a small screen making movement very difficult, and the plot feels like it was stitched together in the same style as Unreal Gold.  We also were not much fans of the murdertheindigenousswamppeople level.I definitely regret having bought this game.  We finished it for a sense of completion and morbid curiosity, not fun.
