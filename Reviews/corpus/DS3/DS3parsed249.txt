Its a fun little action RPG. Not quite as many options as the originals in terms of choice and flexibility, and there is limited opacity in what each of the stats mean without digging into the manual, but hey. Its trying something new and it kinda worked. Not entirely, as it shifts from what I knew and loved about Dungeon Siege and replaces it with more hackandslashy gameplay, but it works. And for whatever reason, I miss the rather freeform nature of the older games.
