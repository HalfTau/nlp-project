Horrible game. Go watch a lets play. Itll be more satisfying than the game.The story is wretched. Has practically nothing to do with DS 1 or 2. Basically feels like an excuse from the developers to put their own favorite oversexed race into the DS world.And the story is so badly written and hamhanded.The combat mechanics arent half bad, but they are vanilla. Youll find a 2 or 3 button press combo and spam it throughout, spamming dodge and combo.And the story is horrid.I bought this game only because  it had DS2 bundled in it.Thats the only reason to buy this game  DS2.DS 3 sucks. Bad story. Vanilla combat, no multiplayer, no sandbox world of epic proportions.
