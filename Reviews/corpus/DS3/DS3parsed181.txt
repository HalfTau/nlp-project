After all the negative reviews, I started playing the game expecting nothing but with an open mind. If this was a standalone game it would probably okay. But they made it under the Dungeon Siege Franchise and they really messed it up. The first two games were all about starting out with nothing but customizing your characters looks and capabilities as time went on. You were the character, it was an avatar of you...With this newest installment to the franchise it is storydriven like The Witcher series. If you like The Witcher you might like this. But if you wanted something more like the two previous games youre gonna have a bad time. The two previous were more like a mix between Diablo and Neverwinter nights, while this seems like a bad Witcher Copycat.But if you havent played the two previous games, this game is not bad at all. Its only bad if you have played the previous ones.
