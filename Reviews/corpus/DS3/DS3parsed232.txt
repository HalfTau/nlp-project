This is a really really terrible xbox port, from the 360. I had it on the xbox, and enjoyed it so I bought it on Steam. Well, the framerate is terrible, and it runs really badly. Sometimes its steady, then just randomly drops for no reason when nothing is even happening on screen xD. Youre just runnin through a trail, no enemies on screen, and boom, it drops to like 15 fps outta nowhere.
