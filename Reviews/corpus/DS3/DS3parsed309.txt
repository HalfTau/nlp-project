Forgoten phenomen.Its Obsidian bug free game,In the world of hacknslash game but with more story focused.Which make it a bit strange or bit off.And combat is more than servicable.Believe or not, its playable with kbm keyboard and mouse.The only thing that reallly irritated me was targeting system. Pointing mouse cursor at enemy and pressing LMB, like in evey hacknslash, does not work every time and instead  attack something else barrels, minions etc..Some fights are unbalanced not only for Hardcore difficulty, forced me only once, on Hardcore mind you to use trainer.Im talking about Master Thief. Youre supposed to dodge missles and focus on the boss.What you really do is rollinrollinrollingrollindie. And borked targeting system also doesnt help here...I count it as cRPG because its better than other overrated AAAArpgs, but because its Obsidian game it dont get much praise.
