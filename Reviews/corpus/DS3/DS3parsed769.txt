While not as imersive as the previous installments of Dungeon Siege this sequel is still very good. The story line is compelling and the game play while not as versatile is still a worthy mechanic. AS has been the problem with previous versions the camera system needs work but overall it doesnt make gameplay more difficult. This game while fun is also not an elitist title where you have to have a top skillset to play well. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have
