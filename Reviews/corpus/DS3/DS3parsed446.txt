One of my favorite games of all time.An action RPG more RPG than ARPG, you mind, with an indeapth storyline and good loot tables. They did a fantastic job with the atmosphere of each area, capturing the feeling of darkness and turmoil in each zone while keeping the individuality of each location.The combat is challenging, and each playable character brings a feeling of uniqueness to the combat. The followers add support that at times is much needed. The loot system is decent, and upgrades feel exciting. Watching your gear change as you gain levels is as satisfying as it is in any other welldone ARPG.As long as youre not looking to play this game with friends, youll find DS3 to be a wellrounded, immersive game with a storyline that will suck you right in.
