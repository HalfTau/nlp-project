Incredibly bugfree for an Obsidian game, but its also rather generic and not terribly compelling compared to their usual offerings. I made it through most of the game enjoying it more than not, but I realized that I wasnt actually looking forward to it between play sessions. Im not sure if I burned myself out on side quests or its just mediocre, but Im guessing some of both. Strangely for an ARPG, seems to be designed with a controller in mind. Only weakly recommended. Unless youve completely exhausted the genre, you can probably find a game in it that does something more interesting to spend your time with.
