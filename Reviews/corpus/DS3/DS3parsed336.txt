I loved the first 2 games in this series, and despite some rough reviews of this game, I bought it at good price and I think I may have still been cheated. Not sure why they didnt let Gas Powered Games continue to do this series, but WOW!! What a mistake. This game has way too much talking going on, is way too linear very narrow paths with no room to move, horrible camera angles, and complicated controls. Every time your guy swings, he poses for a second while he is getting whacked. You cant use all of your abilities unless you use another ability to power up some orb thing that stores it and then you can use another ability after its full. The system to change your equipment is not user friendly nor is it quick. The game stops, the screen changes, and then you make your choice. Takes way too long to do. Tehn, when you go up a level, the screen changes you to your ability screen automatically you have no choice in this and makes you choose right then and there. Not sure why they made it this way, but having really liked the first 2 games, this game is a total disapointment. Graphically, the games looks nice. And it looked like it could really have been a solid game if they had just stayed with what made this series good.Probably wont ever see another Dungeon Siege game thanks to this mess of a game and that is just sad.
