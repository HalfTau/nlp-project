One of the best ARPGs Ive played so far 3Great game for a RPG fan. Controlling your character may look wee bit strange at first but, once youre set youll start to enjoy the game just like I did. I suggest you play on the hardest difficulty if possible because I loved the challenging boss fights. Story is amazing and the gameplay is challenging yet rewarding. Note that you need to build your character properly if you are going for the hardest difficulty level.All in all, If you are up for a good challenge then buy this on a sale and enjoy with a good coop partner.
