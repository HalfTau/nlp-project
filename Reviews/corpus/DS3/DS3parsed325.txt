Why the frack do they have to make games where you can not see where the hell you are going and what is around you. FFS, it is a 3d game acting like a 1d game, always looking at the ground. Mouse wheel seems to do some sort of zoom in / out, but it fails to let you look at the horizon.With it forever pointing at the ground and not allowing you to zoom out to any real extent, it is impossible to tell if you are approaching enemies until after they have already started attacking you. Sure, you can run away and come back, but why would any game force this on you as a constant way of playing!If you are a fan of this type of game, get it!
