I am very disappointed with this game! DO NOT BUY IT unless you have a game controler to use with your computer. The first and second games are click adventure simular to Diablo, this is not. Its a twitch response game with lots of button mashing. I found the keyboard contols far from useable and more frustarating then anything. I bought this game during the steam summer sale and am not regerting it. I should have spent my 10 bucks else where.
