One small step forwards with Dungeon Siege II, one GIGANTIC LEAP backwards Into a pit filled with ravenous bugbears, for Dungeon Siege III. How can you take a system that rewards the fluid growth of your character from repetition and decide to just strip away all the customization and talentry that was inherit with it? Whoever though that was a good idea? Fluid character growth is always better than the  tiered talent system. God damn this game, and god damn the stupid advertisements that flaunted it when it came out. Thank the gods I got it for five dollars.3.5/10
