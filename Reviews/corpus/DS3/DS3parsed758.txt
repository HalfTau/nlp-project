Horribly underrated game. The controls are a bit strange, but once you get past the initial learning curve, its incredibly fun. Beautiful graphics even on a lower end system, visceral combat, interesting characters/classes. The storys also a lot better than youd expect, though it may not seem that way at first. Gameplays a bit of a departure from the previous installments in the series to say the least, but most changes are for the better, and the story connects back to the first games much better than DS2s did.My only major complaints are that the audio can be buggy at times, and some of the voice acting is what I will politely call less than stellar. But even with those issues, its one of the best RPGs Ive played in a long time.
