Wouldnt bother though I wish steam had a middle choice between Thumbs up and Thumbs down cuz thats about where this game would go for me.Pros Has coop  tons of games dont bother integrating this anymoreCons Horrible port Xbox controller buttons are permently coded into the UI and doesnt show mouse/keyboard alternatives Couldnt select a different character with mouse/keyboard Hardly anything like the original Dungeon Siege/2s which were entirely keyboard/mouse focused
