I wrote a pretty anger fueled review on this in the past, only because I really was expecting a game like their previous titles, but I cant even begin expressing my disappointment in this game. I know I have only played for about an hour and I would love to try and play it again now that I have actually gotten alot older since I was still in High school and now im 22 so you can see the age gap, but I can not bring myself to actually play it since I remember howI was, so I am going to just highly recommend you play the previous dungeon sieges keep in mind they could run on Windows 98 so its pretty old but they are still a hell of alot more funner than what I remember from this game, idk I have nothing else to say other than, they ed loyal fans hard
