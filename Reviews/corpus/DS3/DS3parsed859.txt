Really enjoyed this game, although it didnt risen to the previous 2 games graphics are spectacular for a hns, the light/fire effects are amazing, the music is great the voiceacting is almost terrible. The hns mechanics are pretty good, there is plenty of loot, story is interesting and gameplay varies due to the 4 different classes. But somehow i got almost always a feeling of artificiallity or better put lack of life in the games world, this pulling down the atmosphere.
