I tried... i really tried but the game is utterly horrible. Please do not support a game like this. I got it for free and I still am annoyed that I even spent time on it.Plusses Graphics are ok... for a year 2008 game.MinusesControls. They are propably worst Ive ever played with.Camera angles, they dont show the enemies which shoot  you from otherside of the room etc.Camera controls, you have to rotate the camera while moving, shooting, doing spells etc... Really doesnt work.Rpgelements are none existing. You honestly cannot really customize your character when compared to any other even mediocre ARPG or RPG.Story is bad... it has no life  in it.Characters in game have zero personality.Enemies are the same... over and over again.
