While nothing like its two previous entrys, this game does have some charm. I recommend playing this game with a gamepad as it feels smoother. Difficulty spikes are here and there, even on casual, as some of the enemies hit hard and fast. Storyline is kind of blagh but it gets the point across. I recommend for anyone who enjoys a good action RPG and has nothing else to play. Pick it up on sale!
