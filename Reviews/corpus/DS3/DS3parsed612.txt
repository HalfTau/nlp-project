So i bought this in the dungeon siege 3 pack, excited to play the entire seriesnever played 3 before, and i went to play multiplayer and realized they took away multi from all except 3. so i just went ahead and skipped to it. Needless to say i am super disappointed. The camera angles blow, the controls are whacky as hell, and i absolutely hate the way they did the inventory and equipment menus. But hey, at least its pretty and looks nice. I cant even force myself to play over an hour of this torment. shame on you Square Enix, A plague on both of yer houses.
