ALL STYLE / NO SUBSTANCE.I give credit where due This game looks terrific. I really like the character design and the overall gothic aesthetic. Thats why I bought the game. But after only a few hours and a couple dungeons into the game, I am finding this game nearly unplayable. Its a drag. The gameplay is stunted by a real lack of diverse skills. Without interesting skills, there is no real strategy and character development is a waste of time. Many roguelike dungeon crawlers have more customization than DSIII.
