This is the most disappointing game ever... Dungeon Siege has always had character creation, this does NOT have it, and the way you save is REALLY lame I lose progress, Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 always had automatic save, why get rid of those most important features? And the controls are terrible, the style has changed immensly and just does not work at all.... I really tried to get into it, its way too difficult as well, potions only drop if you kill something, I mean WTF?! You cant heal, you pretty much have to do it without getting hit AT ALL... Dont waste your money buying this trash...
