Sweet game. Very awesome visuals if youve got a DX10/DX11 supported graphics card. Kinda different from the first 2 Dungeon Siege games, but its rich in DS lore  has an awesome storyline. Each playable character has their own background, own playstyles and tactics,  npcs can relate differently to you depending on which one you chose. Definitely the kind of SP game you can put a lot of hours into!
