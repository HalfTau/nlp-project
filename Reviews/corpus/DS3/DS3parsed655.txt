Using a gamepad this game rocks, I got my steelseries 3gc to work using x360ce!  There even a mod for the camera to untether from the host which makes this game much better than I had expected. I was looking for a 4 player coop action adventure rpg title that isnt too indepth for pick up and play... well this is it!
