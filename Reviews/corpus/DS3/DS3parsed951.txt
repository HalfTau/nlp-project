First, a warning This game is NOTHING like DS1 or 2. Nothing at all. If you were expecting a partybased Diablolike, you wont find it. Obsidian took DS3 in a totally different direction. The random loot/mobs has been watered down, the control over your partys development has been watered down, your ability to control your party itself has been limited, and your progression and potential has been reworked into linear specialization of your basic skills.When you get over the shock of realizing youre playing a game thats NOT really a DS title, you realize the game stands well on its own. It has a certain charm in the combat, the characters are credible and engaging, and the story is interesting. DS3 should be approached more like The Last Remnant and less like Diablo. Play it for the story and you wont be disappointed... even if the lack of character customization and the limited progression choices hamper replay value.Worth checking out the demo before hitting the Buy button.
