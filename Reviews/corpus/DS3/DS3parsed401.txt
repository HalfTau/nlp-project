Bought this game for 2 because I loved DS 1 and DS 2.I feel like I wasted 2. I played it for 30 minutes and it was enough. The story is boring, the camera controls are horrible, the assets are copy paste, the gameplay is just bad. Also, everything that was good about dungeon siege is just gone.Maybe its a good game for 2 if you never tried DS before, but if you did, its just a huge disapointment and overall a terrible game.
