Its not bad. But still a led through the nose adventure game. You cant deviate from the path.Playing as Katerina wasnt to bad. Pup to play with. And some plce spells.The mage great . Traps and decay spells. Not fussed on his sweep attack. Cant go around corners even though it looks like it does.Lucas what a joke. You get stamina and agility no attack. Or attack and no stamina and agility. And low armor. Teamed up with AI Katerina she may fire 1 every 10 seconds and call her pup a few times but not a lot. Yet she was fine with Anjali I think better check.Very Very frustrating. Doesnt raise the likability at all.
