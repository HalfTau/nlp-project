One of the best isometric action games there is. Definitely a really good game. Four playable classes, my fav being the mage because he has cool looking spells like clockwork bombs. I have beaten the game with him and the entire game was awesome. Now I am playing the dlc Treasures of the Sun with my gunner. The gunner can switch between a rifle and dual wielded weapons that include a one handed shotgun and pistol and she has some really powerful skills. The fighter chick can summon a fire dog to help and the warrior is pretty self explanatory with some good skills also. The voice acting is very good and the game has memorable sound effects. The mouth movement actually matches the words in most cases in cut scenes. Thats some pretty good detail for a topdown action game. The music is superb and always fitting of the place and mood. The graphics are really very good and hold up very well even by todays standards. The best thing about the game is its unique combat system. You get two sets of weapons with three skills each, and you can hold right trigger to activate more powerful versions of your spells or hold left trigger to activate healing and defensive skills. Obviously I play with a xbox 360 controller and it actually works very well because otherwise I would never even consider using a controller for a isometric game. A good example of a game that you can easily find somewhere on sale for a steal or could actually pay its regular price of 15 and that is still a great price, especially since the game will give you around 1416 hours of playtime as it did me.8/10 one of my alltime favs.
