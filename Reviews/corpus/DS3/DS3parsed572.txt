this game while decent in terms of an RPG really didnt meet the expected standards of the first 2 dungeon seige games. Both of those games are miles and miles above this one in all avenues from the leveling/skill systems to the way the game works. Having set classes and even a distinct lack of character customization really makes this game feel like they took the world and the name but not the actual game its self and improved upon it. It really is a shame since DS1 and 2 are imo some of the best tactcal/Action based RPGs of all time. I remember when the first game was released and they used the seemingly endless no loading screen technology for the first time. It blew me away that i could move from one point to another with out having to load and that i could complete the entire game with out a single load screen. Moving down into a dungeon felt like it had real depth and the same went for DS2.If you are looking for a decent RPG then this is an alright game, but if you are expecting the dungeon siege expience look elsewhere.
