7/10. If you are a fan of DS and DS2, this is not the same game. Disappointing in that regard, however, with a game pad, it is not bad. Between 25 to 30 hours of play with 4 selectable characters. Replayability is soso. Really wanted to give the game a 5/10 due to requiring me to spend 30 for a gamepad, but.. Hopefully, they will fix the controls or permit customization with a later patch.
