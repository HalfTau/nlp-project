I only bought and played it because its one of the few games my laptop could run. Its fun for a short while but its missing the variety that the other dungeon siege games had. For a given character, say Karina ? the only weapon worth using is her rifle. And you can only acquire different versions of the rifle. With the same 3 animations playing over and over again. It also isnt hard to make your character OP to the point where the game ceases to be fun in the slightest. My advice? If youre looking for a good dungeon crawler, this isnt it. Play the 2nd one instead.
