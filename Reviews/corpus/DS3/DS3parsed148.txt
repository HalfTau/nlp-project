This game is bad and the Devs should feel bad. I personally love Dungeon Siege, but this 3rd installment was terrible. The gameplay wasnt there for me, and the camera was god awful..I cant even. I do not recommend this game at all. Totally thumbs down from me. I know I dont show much play time for this title but thats because it didnt take long for me to realize this was terrible. For the most part..its mostly the camera..its so bad...ugh.
