As a fan of Dungeon Siege 2 I was pretty dissapointed. It took away the freedom to play your character as you like and to see him evolve and develop to a Character you can say to have forged untill he was a Master of his Art.But it still added something to the Universe of DS. You were able to have a plot which may not be the most diversed but stil enjoyable and even twisted from time to time. You have enjoyable and less enjoyable Characters and therefore you bind yourself more to certain characters and you see yourself drifting away from others.The Controls feel definitally better if you use any kind of ControllerI used a XBox 360 Controller and it felt quite wellThe Graphics fit the all in all atmosphere of the game and has a unique style to it At least i see it that waySo all in all I have to say its twosided. It may not be as deep and impressive for its age than DS and DSII were for theirs but its still an easygoing, from time to time very enjoyable and playable game.I recommend it for Fantasy/RPG first timers and people who didnt play DS/DS2 or to those who want a relaxed game with challenge peaking up from time to time.
