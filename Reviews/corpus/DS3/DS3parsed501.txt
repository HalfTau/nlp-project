When i got this game, I thought Cool! Finally they made a Dungeos Siege 3 and it will be good like the first 2 and support multiplayer so I can play with my bro!Oh how I was wrong...What happened to the multiplayer? it exists, but you have to look throught the same camera and you cant go out of it, you share inventory, and splitting up is impossible.Not that splitting up would help much anyway, they turned this game into a spamclick fight game were you occasionally buy weapons and armour and the game requires no thought at all. I played the first 2 games with my dad and my brother, but they screwed this one over, buy it in a package with the first 2 and maybe check it out if you like games were you mindlessly swing a sword or shoot a gun but other than that, I do not suggest this game 2/10.
