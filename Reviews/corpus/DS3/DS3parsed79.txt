Sooo since this game was one of the first games I got here, I thought I could finally share my opinion with all of you guys.Since I was a big fan of Dungeon Siege 2 I immediatly wanted to buy the following one too. The visuals were really nice, the fighting scenes were quite ok for me to play and the different characters were also the typical classes everyone likes to play like the Fighter, the Magician and so on... The story was nothing new for me, but mainly the fun was in exploring the area and the dungeons. So if you want fun for a few hours, then this Game could be something for you.For me it was not a perfect gem, but a enjoyable one!
