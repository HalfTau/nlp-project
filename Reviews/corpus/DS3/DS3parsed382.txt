I am a fan of DS III. If you havent played the franchise, I recommend that you start here, but there are a few things that you may want to know 1 This game is limited in how you customize your avatar. If it is important to you that you have numerous character classes with unlimited choices for hair color and skin tones, this isnt going to work for you. There are, however, both male and female classes. 2 Unless you have never even seen an RPGstyle game before, I would avoid the easiest level. Since it avoids a lot of combat, there is almost no one to fight, which is poor skill preparation for the game itself. 3 The cameraoh, god, the camera. The spinning is so obnoxious for anyone with video game motion sickness. Every move changes the camera perspective. Caveat emptor, if this affects you.Beyond those inconveniences, I highly recommend this one. There is a LOT of deep lore and backstory here, if that is your thing. Everything has an onscreen text that accompanies the narration so I can play this at night with the sound off and not disturb my spouse. This is my firsttime through on Steam with the DLC, Treasures of the Sun.
