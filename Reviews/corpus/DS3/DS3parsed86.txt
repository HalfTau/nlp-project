Very nice story, about 17 hours of gameplay for me on one playthrough completing all quests. Certainly worth the play, dont let the negative reviews fool you. I used an Xbox 360 controller instead of MK and I think it made a really large difference in gameplay. Certainly begs for multiple plays with different main characters, whether to take all the achievements home or just to experience the story in multiple versions, its a delight to play.
