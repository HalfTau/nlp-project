Gameplay  4Storyline  Got bored after 4 hours. Why should I be motivated to save the day if its hard to want it? Little quests also drag the game out longer.Did I like the first two  Not really.Diablo fan? Played the first one for days at a time. It was definetely a challenge in hell difficulty. The second and third seemed to be a do act 5 100Billion times to get good loot. Find your dead body... grrr.Why? Hack and slash, use same abilities over and over again. Point and click, cast this over and over and over again. At least in diablo it told you how far in the game you were with ACT 12 etc. Felt like this one can keep going another 24 hours of the same thing. At least the girls looked good.
