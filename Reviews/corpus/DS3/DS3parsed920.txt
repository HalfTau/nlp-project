I liked this gave very much until the moment I realized this game is not replayable. There is no new no way to continue develop you character after you complete the game. Still the game has great sound and great graphics. I think they are much better that titan quest. But titan quest still owns this game because is so much replayable. If you have 50usd to spare and live dungeon crawlers give this one a try. I have not tried the coop yet.
