Dungeon Siege in name only, this game has nothing in common with the groundbreaking classic, other than being an action RPG.DS1 was classless and levelless. Pick up a sword and start swinging it, you get better at using swords. DS2 added classes, but kept specialties. DS3 takes away almost all character customization by giving you four characters to choose from and a handful of points to spend each level.DS1s equipment system allowed anybody to use any equipment they had the stats for. DS3 essentially drops different loot for each character. This must have saved a lot on art assets but leads to some oddities, such as the witchwithagun character only being able to wear stockings, not pants.The only real upside to DS3 is that its not a grindfest like the first two. But this is mostly a sideeffect of it just being a much smaller game, both in terms of length but also in terms of ambition and vision.
