The loot isnt amazing, the story isnt really all the greatobsidian entertainment have done way better but damn I really enjoyed the core mechanics in this game. I dont typically enjoy the Diablolike RPG but something about this game scratched an itch I didnt know I had. Building around physically dodging attacks made the game feel more like engaging than anything than anything else Ive found in the genre. Just play the game with a gamepad though, it was how it was designed to be played.Ive also never played through Dungeon Siege I or II but from what Im told, theyre entirely different games. You might not like this game if you liked those. Might have been better if this game was its own IP.
