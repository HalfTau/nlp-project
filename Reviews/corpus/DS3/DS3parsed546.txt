this is my first DS game , i havent played any of the previous titles in this series so i cant compare but what i can do is let you know that this is a very good game except for a few flaws1. the loot is very repetitive , you get to a part where you stop hoarding items and ignore them if the name seems familiar which is honestly disappointing since in this type of games players are curious to the looks and advantages of loot and boss drops.2. sometimes the creeps become annoyingly op and you have to rely on your companion to revive you numerous times in one encounter.3. the story is somewhat simple although the game has great potential to become a diablo 3 competitor if develloped with more care and complexityi havent tested out the online tbh and it might show that i have very few game time on this game since i mostly played it in offline mode so it doesnt really add to the time played , if youre interested in buying this game go for it , its a nice game and it will amuse you since that is the point of video games instead of making them become a culture or point of obsession like WoW , CoD and other games and if you do buy it add me for online gameplay D
