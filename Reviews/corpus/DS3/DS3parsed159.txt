I should have known better after the Steam Dungeon Siege II pile of vomit, but due to pretty characters and hoping for a good game of this genre, I bought it. Its ridiculously, mindnumbingly linear and boring. You can level up to make your character unique but thats lies, you get exactly the same abilities and level up to create uniqueness is basically small  tweaks to your tiny handful of standard abilities.Furthermore, while having decent quality voice acting, it feels like they didnt care and werent working together, like all the actors were reading their lines in a vacuum with no direction or understanding of the story or the games tone. That alone kills the voices for me and breaks immersion, which due to the massive flaws of gameplay would be one of the only ways this game could hold my attention.Sigh Again the failure at multiplayer made me frustrated, since the main reason I got this game was to play with partners over LAN, but its frustrating and unweildy at best, a sloppy alphaquality afterthought at worst.Finally the gameplay. Not only is DS III slower/clunkier than other games of this type, but its also hard in frustrating ways, not good ways. Theres no learning curve, no ingame clues to learn from, and certainly nothing to be gained by being explorative and leveling up and finding hidden things before mindnumbingly boring and waytoochallenging boss fights. FYI devs, making you do the same really hard thing over and over again for 1020 minutes just to chip away at a bosss healthbar thats 8001000 too large is NOT the kind of challenging players want to go up against.I give this game a D plus, maybe a C minus overall. If you want a good gaming experience of this genre, or if you expect to mostly play multiplayer, avoid this game and spend your money on something better.
