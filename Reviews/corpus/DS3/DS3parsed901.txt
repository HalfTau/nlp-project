Ok, so my first reaction was What a complete and uttergame!Then i took a break, and got back and played a few more hours, and it was stillbut better.Now ive played about 9 hours and im starting to like it. Yes still many weird design choices, but somehow now it draws me back. I love diablo clones or loot games, and this all of a sudden works well. Companions are a nice touch. It feels weird to suddenly enjoying it, when the first and second impression was so bad.
