This game is a rather fun and interesting game, however this is not a Dungeon Siege game. As a stand alone game I would recommend getting it, but if you are expecting a Dungeon siege game you may not enjoy the game unless you change your expectations, you dont have to lower your expectations but you will need to change them.As a stand alone game 7.5/10As a Dungeon Siege game 4/10I was very upset about how much was changed, if you are selling a Dungeon Siege game it is best to make a Dungeon Siege game. The mechanics in the first game were great, the second game managed to expand and refine the mechanics of the first game...then the third game throws it away...not surprised fans are not happy. Maybe change the name and just have the game in the same world as the Dungeon Siege games but not as a Dungeon Siege title.I recommend this game as a stand alone game, but not as a Dungeon Siege game
