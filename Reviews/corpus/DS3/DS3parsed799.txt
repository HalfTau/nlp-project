Although this 3rd installment of the series is not by the traditional studio that started it, they managed to keep it intact for the most part. Satsfying combat mechanics, realistic plotline, fast paced and generally fun to play. The main downside in this game is the lack of variation, the relative short playtime until completion and generally doesnt honor the epic lands as they were depicted in DS1 or 2. Overall, id reccomend it if youre fan of the series, but overall it felt too short and linear at times.
