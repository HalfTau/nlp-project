Dungeon Siege 3 is one of my favorite games, I had a lot of fun playing this game. It shares some aspects that youll find on MMOs Diablo being one. Ive spent over 20 hours on this game and Ill gladly do it again.One downside to this game is it gets quite tedious about halfway onwards. Though over all it gets9/10
