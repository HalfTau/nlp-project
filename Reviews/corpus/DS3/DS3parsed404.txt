I gather that the Dungeon Siege fanbase for the first two games looks down on Dungeon Siege 3 as a departure from the very enjoyable gameplay motif. But I never played those two games. I started with Dungeon Siege 3, and its not really half bad. The combat can get stale and the looting isnt as enjoyable as say Diablo or Titan Quest, and if you buy the game with the Treasures of the Sun DLC youll get powerful items that will easily carry you through the rest of the game. The redeeming value in this adventure is the story and its lore, but if youre not the kind of gamer that enjoys that sort of thing, then you can skip this one.For me, I enjoyed trekking mindlessly from quest to quest with zero exploration since you can summon a path with the press of a button piecing together the game world and its history.Id recommend it for someone seeking an easy RPG to play thats something other than Diablo.
