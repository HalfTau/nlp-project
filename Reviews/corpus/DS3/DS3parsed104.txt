The system was dumbed down from previous versions such that you have very little customization. Combat for single players is made virtually undoable without having to stop and recover for long periods betwen each encounter and the gear system was confusing. With forced different combat styles for the characters, there does not have the chance to specialize and focus on one ability and run with it. Overall, a lackluster sequal to a great game.
