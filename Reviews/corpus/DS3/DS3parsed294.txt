Ive liked the Dungeon Siege games for some time. But Id never seen or heard of DS III before I got the collection.I really got into the game, it was very interesting and I was drawn into it through the character. I played the Archon.This was a very good story, learning the background and being key to the story.The combat was a bit tricky, as I had to get used to the controls. But it wasnt difficult to pick up after a while.The storyline was able to keep my attention and the side quests kept me moving forward.You have to choose from four characters, this usually is an issue for me. I like to customize my characters in games.But for this, I didnt have a problem. I liked the idea of the Archon and it seemed to turn out as the best choice formy playing style. I like fire wielding... well, any elemental magic really.So if it looks interesting, give it a try. Im really satisfied with the ending and really wished that there was more DLC thanthe one small expention that I did get with the collection.
