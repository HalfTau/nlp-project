With Diablo 3 around the corner, figured I should play this game otherwise I never would. Not a bad game in general, but it suffers greatly due to the fact that this game was made with consoles in mind. Sure you can at least customize graphics to a basic extent but for some reason you cannot customize controls and the default keyboard mouse controls are just terrible. Instead of having abilities 16 binded its 13 and you have to continually hit shift to switch to other abilities which basicly means you arent going to be dodging or blocking space when you need to. Plugged in a controller and suddenly everything made sense and I stopped dying every 2 seconds because i could actually play. The decision making, combat and story are actually decent, all else aside. Buy it for cheap, or just wait for Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2 if you like dungeon crawlers, and you might as well buy on console if you have one since the pc version is probably worse than it without a controller.
