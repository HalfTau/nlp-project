One of the biggest let downs ive ever had. I loved the first 2 DS games, and this came free with my old graphics card, a 550 ti. it looks decent enough, but plays boringly and has voice acting that grates on the nerves due to over accentuation. if you got the game for free, then no biggy. but paying for this load is a huge rip off.
