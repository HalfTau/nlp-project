A flawed game unlike the other Dungeon Siege titles, or most other Obsidian games either. I dont know how fun Id describe it as? Its... its actually MASSIVELY bland. And pretty short. And one of the systems I enjoyed most was apparently only in the game because I bought the DLC, so thats another halfstrike.I dont know whether to praise or damn this game. Its seriously some kind of limbostate. Very controllercentric action RPG gameplay, probably one of the worst coop setups Ive seen in ages off of consoles only the host keeps gear/save data/XP!  you, other guy! dont go trying to bring your character up in here!, but then it adapts some of my favorite quirks of the genre story choices and actions ingame giving you permaperks to stats, controllable evolutions of skills, solid amount of customization for your characters within their roles.If you buy this buy it with the Treasures of the Sun DLC. You may as well  the games a bit short, and TotS gives you some cool new toys and a rather fun new region. Just know going in that the game is not amazing by any standards. On the other hand, it doesnt really  UP anywhere that I can point out, either.I still dont know how the hell I feel about this, and Ive been debating it with myself for about a week now as I played it to completion.
