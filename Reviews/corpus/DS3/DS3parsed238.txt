For years I have heard bad reviews on this game. Finally decided to try it out and im glad that I did.Had a decent story and fun gameplay but the camera took a bit getting used to.If you enjoyed the other 2 Dungeon Siege games, you will enjoy this as well. Even if you havent played the former games.. its still a decent game if you catch it on sale.
