This game is nothing like the 1rst or 2nd. They completly went a different direction and killed the series. Shared screen multiplayer...seriously we went back to the nintendo? The controls are terrible if you want to use a keyboard and a mouse which a lot of people on a computer want to do...imagine that. It looks pretty...other then that it sucks.
