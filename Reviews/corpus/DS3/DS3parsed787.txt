Gah! You want to love this game after playing the first two but just like the other two the camera controls blow on this game. However lets not dwell on something so small as far as the story line of this game goes it is very well thought out and it really shows as you play it. I have yet to totally finish the game because I am playing with a friend and dont plan on finishing it solo until I have finished it in coop. However the bit of time I have spent on this game I really did enjoy it the game didnt feel like I was grinding my way to the end but rather enjoying a story as I progressed in the game. Which made the game even more fun to play but one thing that the game is not forgiving about is the lack of starting tutorials now while this might be due to the fact I started in coop rather than solo it left me trying to really figure out all the odd controls. Once I figured it out though I was rolling along without too much trouble. Well worth getting if the price is right for you just for the story and looks alone this game is worth it and should be considered when you buy it.
