This game takes on a slightly different format than the first two in the series. I would almost call it a Diablo III clone with lower production values, which is disappointing. If it had stayed true to the style of the series I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more. The first two games required strategy in combat and micromanaging a party of 4. DS3 combat is simplified and you only control the one character, so it gets boring pretty fast.
