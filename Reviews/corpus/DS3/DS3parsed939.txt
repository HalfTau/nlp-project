This game had beautiful graphics to it but that is honestly about the extent of it. The game was VERY short for the price tag that the company was asking for it. I would ask around 19.99 for this game and that is being generous. It had a great story line that ended all to quickly unlike the past dungeon sieges that kept you playing for hours. This game can be gone through in less than one day without breaks easily. The controls were absolutely horrible!!!! I did not get used to the controls up until almost the end of the game. For someone looking to blow some money for nothing it is great. For someone looking for a really great hard core game you can enjoy for many hours, It is NOT for you.
