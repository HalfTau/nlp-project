Nothing alike the previous DS titles  handles much better w a gamepad. Ally AI is stupid but u can solo thnkfully and the coop works in a weird way camera  saves but u get used 2 it eventually. Other than that this is a solid title. Tech looks impressive and is 100 stable  the story  dialogue options are suprisingly good 4 a HS title desicions influence parts of the game. Combat mechanics are also good and force u to be constantly active must block  roll 24/7, mana regens on hit,etc.Loot diversity could be better uniques look awesome however. Each of the 4 chars plays diffirently and the game is sadistically hard on Hardcore diff. All in all if you want a coop based, challenging HS title with engaging combat, great visuals and an interesting story then this is right up your alley.
