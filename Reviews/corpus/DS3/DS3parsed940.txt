SP is mediocre at best with its boring leveling system and attempt at making a good story line in a series that has never focused on SP or story prior to this installment.Something was taken from my friends and I with the release of this game.we used to be able to spend entire weekends Smashing thru goblin caves and leveling our characters as we see fit.now we are congested to the same camera as if we were still playing some Gauntlet game for nintendo 64, and reissuing our points each time our generic cookie cutter characters die.Square was once my favorite game Dev. Now they are a publisher known for defficating allover good game series and hopefully dont put thier hands in just cause 3 and Arkham city.
