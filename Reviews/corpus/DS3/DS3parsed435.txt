If youre looking to scratch that hack and slash itch like the previous Dungeon Siege games did, this is not the game to do it with. At first, I was very disappointed by that. However, once I got over that I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.While the gameplay is mediocre, the voice acting, graphics, story, and lore are all fantastic.
