This game is different than the previous installmentsGOOD This game has many types of stats a player can have. Everytime the player levels up, so does enemies, so there will always be a challenge. Lots of replay value, and graphics are not bad.BAD Although it has many replay value, it tends to become repetitive, making it boring after awhile.EITHER If you play by yourself, your companion tends to become stupid when you die. Your companion would have to revive you if you die. Although your companion is stupid, you can customize your companion to equip equipment as well, acting as if you have 2 players to control, but an AI is controlling 1 character while you control the other.SCORE 7.5/10 Get this if you got friends to play with, otherwise not a good singleplayer game.
