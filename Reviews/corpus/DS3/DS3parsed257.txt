Much better than expected based on the other reviews Ive read. Interesting story and fun gameplay. Just dont expect it to be an enhancement of the first two Dungeon Siege games, as this one is much different. It feels more like the Baldurs Gate and Champions of Norrath games which were released on consoles.
