i have been playing the dungeon siege series since the first one for pc. and the 2nd one, and the bonus content for 2. this one number 3 is a good game with great potential. however theres a few very negative features, or lack thereof. one is the camera angle which keeps zoning me in or out to the point at which i cannot see where the boss is nor my character in relation to the boss, which makes for harder fights than they actually are. and the other thing that really bugs me is all the new stats that are avaiable, warding/retribution/vampire...etc etc. they are in themselves self explanitory for the most part. however without the ability to mouse over for description or click for... it makes it rather annoying trying to figure out which stats to stack for. example block, L2 is the block button however there is a ability in your tree which increases your block. now does that increase the block amount? or does it make it an auto block without having to use the L2 block button? retribution, can mean any number of things as far as a stat is concerned, however instead of having to look each and every stat up online it would be nice to be able to have them detailed in game. overall this is a pretty decent game esp. like me you have been playing this series since the begining, and again it has great potential to be even better. just seems like the devs got a lil lazy in the details category on this title.
