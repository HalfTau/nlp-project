Horrible addition to the now three part series.DS1 was great with its freedom of development, varied items, and pause combat.DS2 expanded on those three core systems and made an even better awesome pause combat game.This game DS3 butchered the freedom of development system, destroyed the item progression, and absolutely ruined the camera controls.This game was nothing but and EXTREME LET DOWN following in the footsteps of DS2.I dont know how anyone could vote this positive having played either 1 or 2, or even neither. The game is just missing so many basic core fundamentals that are necessary for something this expensive and polished by a big name.If ever there is a DS4, I pray that it is made by an entirely different team.
