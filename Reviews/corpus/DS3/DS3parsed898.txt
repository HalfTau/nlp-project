As far as an RPG goes, The elments are all there. The player progression is very in depth and very well suited to created a very personalized character. Though dialouge leaves much to be disired, the gameplay is very original. The storyline is kinda runofthemil though.Dont expect much story, but the RPG of the game is great    Id say wait for a sale like i did and its worth it.
