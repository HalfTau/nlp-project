Wow!  What a gem, I purchased this game a few years ago and had wanted to get to it, but hadnt made the time.  Having played the first and second one this one blew it out of the water.  Its not open world, but very flexible in terms of moral and action choices  think Mass Effect  early Fable, at the end you get a great montage of how your actions impacted the future of the game.  It was hard to believe how good the graphics are for a 7 year old game.  Look forward to next edition.Only gripes are that they need a better inventory system selling and identfying what is on whom is rough and improve on the key mapping descriptions  Key 1 equals power 1 should become Key 1 equals what ever the contextual power you have set the slot too.
