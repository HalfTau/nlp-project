Just finnished this game and DLC with someone else. This game has an really really good stoyline, good voice acting for all of the quests, good look along with tons of items to loot. The most eye catching aspect about this game is that as you play this game you have to make choices that effect how the story plays out. Usualy the choices have to do with someones fate or what action should be taken. Combined with the voice acting this is very impressive. Over all a really good RPG game, looking forward to the other DLC that is sure to come for this game.The only down sides is that it is not what I would call an open world and in multiplayer the 3 legged race feel with the camara takes getting used too. But if you ignore thoes two things this is a game that is worth you time. Fully say to anyone who likes the screen shots to get this game.BTW..... Got 57 of the achivements, see if you can beat that.
