When I first came across the Dungeon Siege franchise, it was magic. Loved the style, loved the gameplay and got very taken in by the story. This was somewhat well adapted into Dungeon Siege 2, which I ended up spending at least 100hrs on.Then when the 3rd was announced, I was ecstatic, the trailer looked awesome, the graphics amazing... however, these feeling were not to last. I bought and play the game for nearly 2 hours and little by little it became very clear to me. The magic was gone. I understand the need to try new things, and since it wasnt even published by Microsoft, it makes sense, but I didnt get Dungeon Siege 3. I got something else. The story is dull at best, the gameplay is... not for me, and Im left with an empty feeling and a horrid excuse of a game.No go from me.
