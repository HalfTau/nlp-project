A fair adventure game with great graphics and environments, good voice acting and decent story largely ruined by a horrible camera angle which will have many ranged enemies shooting you from off screen and many ranged attacks by your characters hitting enemies you cant even see.An additional frustration is enemies respawning in areas youve already cleared.   This happens despite times in the story where you are blocking off entrances to areas to prevent that exact thing!  Combat is also a little too simplified to really be enjoyable.A beautiful game that just misses too many marks and has an enjoyment killing flaw.
