The game isnt as good as its predecessors but it still delivers very enjoyable experience. Story isnt amazing but its not bad/awful either. Its good enough to keep you interested in the game. This game is worth buying but only with the DLC which adds things that basic game lacks ehcnantments, respeccing.OVerall score 8/10 28 hours long on Hardcore mode, 100 walkthrough Nice graphics, Low system requirements, good optimisation A lot of action and humor Amazing OST Huge Replayability value, either SP or CoOp Great AI but easy to learn overtime Stupid partner AI. Yet, its good as cannon fodder. Camera could be more flexible. Camera in coop is shared so your partner has to stay in your sight.Neutral Demanding and challangening game  others may see it as downside, especially that the first boss to fight Rajani is the hardest one in entire game, others are just easy mode. Hardcore mode is very punishable for those who dont think on the run and rush blindly. 23 hits max and youre on the ground begging to be revived.
