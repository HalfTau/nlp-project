Nothing like DS1 or 2 at all, in no way. The story suposivly is a much later continuation...thats about it. This game is a prime example of the evils of current day companys. Designed forced really to play multiplayer  carrying nothing over from the franchise roots but name. DS1 and 2 were the creators of a genra like dragonage 1. DS3 is a forced multiplayer hack and slash with poor graphics and a badly done story.
