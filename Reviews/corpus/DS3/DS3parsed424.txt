I am astounded. DS1, DS2, and then this? We were lied to. I dont care how many other ways you want to cover up that fact, but welcome to the business marketing world psychological warfare. It had the name DS3 simply to sell itgrub some more cash. I have played maybe 10 minutes of this game, and I will not waste anymore of my time on it.I am angry enough that Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 are not multiplayerable in Steam someone should definitely be locked up for that, all by itself. Dungeon Siege 3 was a marketing lie. Lock this guy up. He had done some careless, selfish things with his merchandise, and should be slapped. I dont care how many people on here say, Der, this is not like DS 1 and 2, butbutbut... its the best game Ive ever played! Its an amazing ARPG!! Baloney and cheese, thats what that is.He failed, and should not get any attention. He should care more about his audience and gamers than this. He deserves the failure he received from trying to make a console game, and not being faithful to his gamers and followers he had. Fluffyfluff.
