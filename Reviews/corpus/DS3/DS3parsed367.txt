i find that it strays from the path of dungeon siege and if you played the first and second ones you know what i mean, i mean sure this is made by a diffrent dev studio but still they could have at least kept the large partys and made it so you were not a grand hero right off the start of the game i mean normally you start off as a merc, farmer, or child whose parents where killed when they went off to save the world guy that just gets asked to help out with normal stuff every so often, i find that the game is fun but not my cup o tea
