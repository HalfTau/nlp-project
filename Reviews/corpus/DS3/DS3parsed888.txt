If you havent played any of the previous games and you enjoy Gauntlet style combat then you MIGHT enjoy this game.However, having played the first two games in the series I am greatly disappointed. Square Enix not only destroyed the mechanics that defined the Dungeon Siege series but they also did a great deal of damage to the setting as well. Everything is completely different. As such I was greatly disappointed. there is little to no back tracking available in the game, if you miss completing a quest you cannot go back and do it without starting a new game.Also the game didnt take much skill at all to beat.
