I picked up Dungeon Siege the original made by gearbox from a thrift shop for 3 bucks. I cannot explain how entertaining the game was. almost every aspect was memorable and turned the game into one of my all time favs. At the time DS3 was set for release and I could not contain my enthusiasm. However oddly enough I COMPLETELY forgot about it. about a year and a half later I pick it up from gamestop for right around 18 bucks and began playing what was my first experience with a series changing sequel. I leave it at that because I still like this game INCREDIBLY. It is by no means the horrid game people make it out to be. It just has no similarity to the original series, which has since become famous among oldschool dungeon crawlers. But honestly this game has very little competition other than a few huge titlesDiablo 3, torchlight. If you seem interested by the type of game this presents itself as and stumble upon it during a sale I could not insist any more than I already do to buy this game. It has an interesting storyline and fun combat/ coop system. The only flaw in this game is its including of side quests, as each level is linear and the side quests consist of either backtracking to fight a freshly spawned enemy or checking every room for an item. if these can be forgiven than the game will earn your respect7.7/10
