I was very uncertain about this game at first try... I mean Ive played both old DS games and this one doesnt use the same mechanics at all !And Ive to admit that the beginning isnt very addictive. But I kept playing and... I loved playing mid/end game content. Once you leave that ing valley/forest and enter to stonebridge, the game is way more interesting !!!That is not the best actionRPG at all, but this title deserves some love.If you can get the DLC aswell, get it ! Its worth ! But only if you can buy it for a reduced price. It adds 5 hours of gameplay.
