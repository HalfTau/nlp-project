This is an incredibly awful change from the previous titles. The control and moving the character is so bad on a PC that I just cant do it. If you could set the controls to mouse look that would eliminate 100 of the problem but yet again we have a titled ported to PC from console that takes advantage of NONE of the pc control mechanism. Your keyboard is a crummy dpad and your mouse has the buttons.Is the plot good? Is the game fun? I will never find out because the control is so bad. Something simple like turning to your left to open a chest, looting the stuff that falls on the ground and then positioning yourself back where you were is just agony.Being a purely digital download there is another drawback  I cant take it out back and set it on fire for at least a little cathartic release.
