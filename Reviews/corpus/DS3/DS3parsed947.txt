Dont touch this game with a fourtyfoot pole if you are looking to get a Dungeon Siege open world experience, its not here. This game is on the other hand a great little Hotseat RPG in the spirit of Gauntlet. Graphics are Brilliant and the overall gameplay very satisfying in MP not so much in SP. 1/10 as a Dungeon Siege Title 7/10 as a Gauntlet title
