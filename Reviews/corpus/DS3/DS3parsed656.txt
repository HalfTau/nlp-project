While i enjoyed the mystery of the first game and i found the epic scale of the second game to be enjoyable i found the quick pace of the 3rd game to be a bit rushed. The character choices are pretty boring wit the exception of the female that becomes an avatar or something and the level design isnt very inspiring either. The bosses range from SUPER easy to insanely difficult and not in the fun kinda way. I feel like this game was rushed and they needed to take some time and up the scale of things a bit.
