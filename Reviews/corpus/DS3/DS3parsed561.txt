Good Story, Good Characters, Combat is fun and the game looks Great.A bit of a corridoritis, but the areas are mostly all unique and interesting My favorite is the Desert.Bosses are challenging, requiring dodging and stragegy on normal but also on the simple side.Time played was around 15 hours and I completed almost everything except one sidequest.Cons are definetly the UI and Loot system, its a bit tedious I feel.P.S. definetly use a controller.
