This game, ah, this game! Its not a bad game.Dungeon Siege 3 is not like its predecessors. Overburdened with strange, clunky PC controls and a horrible interface, despite its shortcomings, DS3 is a really competent Action RPG that deviates from the mold of its two older siblings and does its own thing to its own fault, since it disappointed a lot of people by not being... well, too much like a Dungeon Siege game.But isnt it? I believe it actually is. Theres loot drops, theres plenty of places to go though most of them consist of narrower hallways, something it got from Dungeon Siege 2, and its combat system, while strange and quirky, is fun and cathartic.No, you cant customize your character as you could before, but the characters you can choose from are classic archetypes of the characters we used to use in previous games anyway, so I dont know what the issue is. You always just stuck with a single specialization anyway or your character would not have turned out very good...Anyways, this game suffered a mixed reception because it carried the name Dungeon Siege, and it wasnt the same Dungeon Siege game that people remembered and thought this game would be. Instead, it is a relatively competent action RPG with clunky controls... but still, I think its worthy of praise for what it has done  not worthy of scorn for what it could have been.
