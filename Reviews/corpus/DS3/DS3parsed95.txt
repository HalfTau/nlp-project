Its an avegare action RPG, that wanted to be a JRPG, but didnt go all the way trough.ActionIts clunky, medium paced with isometric top down view with occasional extreme zooming due to camera funtions, and there is no pause option. The game does have fairly entertaining coop, but the camera has to be fixed first!RPGThe world is immersive, nice and lively, and the voice acting is good. However, you do not get to make your own character, and there is no of customizing your chosen character. There are a few instances where you can make choices, and choices do matter. In the aspect of RPG elements, this is closer to a JRPG than western RPG, as in, the story comes before the player.DS2 vs. DS3First games were less RPG, more action. This is more RPG, less action.First games had tons of options to customizing your character, this has next to none.First game was a diablo type, this is kingdoms of amalur, but, you dont get to make your character, you choose 1 of 4 premade ones.The game is average, not bad, but nothing groundbreaking.Also, if you are going to play coop, THIS IS ESSENTIALThe camera is almost literally unplayable without the console commands to fix it during coop.
