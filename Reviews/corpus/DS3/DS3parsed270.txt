I believe this games biggest crime was naming it Dungeon Siege III. I found the game enjoyable as an action RPGlite style game in a vein similar to the Overlord series, Dragon Age II, and perhaps Trine. Think Gauntlet and youll be on the right track. Its a decent bit of cartoonish fantasy fun that works better with a gamepad than the traditional keyboard and mouse setup. The game features a dialogue/choice system similar to Biowares. Its not quite as fleshed out, but not quite as pointless either. Decisions you make are neither good nor bad, just different, and will effect how things carry forth from the point they are made. With the excellent Treasure of the Sun DLC the entire game clocked in at 20 hours for the first play through including all but a few side quests. The previously mentioned choice system and four character classes lends the game a fair bit of potential replay value
