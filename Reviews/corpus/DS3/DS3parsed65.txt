One of the best couch co op games I have ever played. Dungeon Siege III offers a captivating story that can be influenced by the player during some key conversations with other characters  do you kill your first opponent or set her free? Do you chose to be open about your characters heritage or keep it a secret? Do you remove the sacred artifact from its resting place in the tomb or let it rest in piece?The game offers 4 playable characters with unique abilities. Abilities, armor, weapons and traitboosting artifacts can be upgraded regularly.The world of Ehb is so detailed, beautiful and manyfaceted, I can barely describe it. Especially including the DLC, your really feel emerged in this world.I bought the whole Dungeon Siege collection for 4 during the last summer sale. This third part alone would have been worth way more.
