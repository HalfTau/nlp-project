This game is not fun  camera controls are terrible, especially when playing coop, it basically ruins everything, very hard battles even on easy difficulty. Im not against hard games, but sometimes DS III is stupidly hard, without any reason. Its not a hackandslash, its not a classic RPG... its very hard to enjoy.I realy hoped it will be great, but im dissapointed.
