I have foggy memories of playing dungeon siege on my old laptop in highschool, I dont remember it super well, but I must have enjoyed it, because I saw dungeon siege 3 and said, yes, please.If nothing else, I am reminded that nostalgia is the worst reason to go in on a sequel.It is, in its own right, an achievement to create a game that I cant find any ruinous flaw or championing boon in. The controls are, while a bit different, damn well adequate, I like the stance switching, and the abilities make you very aware of their strengths and drawbacks from the top.But, and of course theres a but, it is doesnt get used in anything interesting. The characters motivations are cliched or straight up absent and the combat got old before the first chapter concluded.It is amusing to use the skill combo to whallop whomever is unlucky enough to be in your focus but you are going to have to do that a few million times and after the first two dozen or so, I just wanted it to be over faster so that a more interesting enemy could take the place of generic gypsy pirates, but I had to kill a few hundred more gypsies and the experience progression isnt directly obvious so I didnt know for a long time if I was even getting xp from my lackadaisical genocide.I love wildly out of place older wizard among three super sexy twenty somethings, he is in fact the most fun, and the voice acting is passable....usually, so I couldnt turn my nose up at my usual peeves. And I found myself playing for an entire evening despite my inability to say why, so with nothing else to hold me back I do have to recommend this game. I might suggest you pick one of the characters steam punk wizard, obvi and then just read the wiki to see where the story changes if you chose the other characters likely spoiler not much.
