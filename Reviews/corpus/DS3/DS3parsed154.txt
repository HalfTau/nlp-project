Worst game I ever played. No, wait, thats reserved for the new Neverwinter. Sorry. Bought this game in 2014, played 19 minutes. To say i didnt like it would be a major understatement. I just hate when game makers design a game and make the controls cumbersome, awkward, and impossible. Reminds me of the Witcher, another failure.
