The game is tight pipe run which is out now at 2015. The game is playable after fixing the controls wasd with move left and move right, and hold right mouse button for camera rotation. Combat is still akward just spam click the screen without proper aiming due that I kite and dodge a lot. The view is limited in distance, giving me a closed space anxiety. Cannot view player character in detail, for screenshots. Cannot preview clothes/armor in equipment window or in shop. I succeeded to buy expensive armor that Katarina cannot wear without the game warning me prior purchase.
