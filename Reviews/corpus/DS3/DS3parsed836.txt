Fun enough for some mindless dungeon crawling until you realise that the game thinks itself an epic tale. Well that throws the mindless fighting out the window. Now I have to pay attention to what people say and go where they tell me  or work out where the heck they want me to go. Loot drops constantly but its never realy clear why one item should be chosen over the other, unless the numbers are significantly higher. Costumes never appear to be anything more than palette swaps and remixes of the initial outfit your character comes with. Thus, depending on whos playing, all enemies change the useless clothing which they carry in their pockets to suit whos coming to kill them. How nice! And what kind of loot game lacks a means to examine your character. You have to get the camera jammed in corner so you can see youself properly.
