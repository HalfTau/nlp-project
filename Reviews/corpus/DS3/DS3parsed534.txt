Ill begin by advising fans and followers of the original Dungeon Siege to be openminded about this game.  Gone are the great partybuilding mechanics you can only have 1 follower at a time from a limited choice which only changes depending on which character you choose at the beginning.  Gone are the innovative levelling mechanics use nothing but bows and arrows and level up in only bows and arrows/use magic and swords and level in both/etc. to be replaced with a fairly standard choose your new stats and feats option when levelling up.The story is a lovely follow on from the events of the previous games and fans of the original will enjoy the nods to past exploits and occasional easter eggs.Lookswise the game is better than average, with some nice effects.  Music is nice, but nothing special.Synergy between party members is more a case of choose what works for you in a given situation swapping party members can be done any time out of combat so if you reach a certain boss and die, try a different party member.  Each character has the option to use 1 of 2 stances and weapon loadouts at the press of a button to make combat variable depending on your playstyle eg twohanded sword for swinging at lots of enemies vs sword and shield for singular, tougher opponents.Allinall I do recommend this game for the casual gamer who wants nothing more than a game they can dip into and out of without feeling like they absolutely MUST complete it now, now, now!  I got mine using raptr points I know, who uses raptr anymore D and it was on sale so I lost nothing by buying it... but what I gained was a look back at a world I once loved playing in and may just go back to again...
