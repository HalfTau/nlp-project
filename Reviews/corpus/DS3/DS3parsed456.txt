I dont understand the hate for Dungeon Siege III In my personal opinion if you like a little bit more action in your RPGs this is it for you. Ive only played it for a few minutes and I found it very easy to get into. Probably inspired by other successful RPGs its a tad bit different from the previous games but change isnt bad. If you like action RPGs this game is for you. If you like a customizable openworld story type of RPG then this isnt the game for you.This game is more linear from what Ive played so far. Ill update this as I keep on playing.
