For an action game, its not a bad title. Its just pretty average.The only thing in common with DS1/DS2 is the name. The game is quite different.Previous game had more freedom for building characters, more options and more spells.Here every character has a fixed role and althought they can have 2 different modes with different skills, the mages in previous version has a lot more spells avaible.DS12 click on a monster until its dead.DS3 smash buttons until the monster is dead.The number of options during fights are limited and the AI can be pretty dumb at some time.The ennemy attacks only the player, it never focuses on the frendly AI. I died a lot because of this concentrated fire on me.Equipment in this game, the stuff you find almost always give bonus to some stats and penalities to others. Mostly because of this, most of the stuff Ive found was garbage and felt like a waste of time to gather it.Conclusion it is worth a try if you can get it in a bundle with DS1 AND DS2. Otherwise, I would not really recommand it. Also, women are suggestively dressed and I found this unappriopriate.
