Just finnished it. At first it i did not like the fact that it strayed of from ds2 gameplay formula. But then 3 hours in to it, when you start getting all of those sick skills... the game bacame amazing. Graphics is awesome, maps liek in previous ds games have amazing atmosperes, just like in ds2. Combat, oh man the combat is soo smooth, dodges, blocks, attacks, buffs all have a realy nice synergy and so makes the combat very fun. I am a little sad that people do not like it, its story is very stong comparable to lets say dragon age origins, but with companions beeing a little bit to farr from the main stage. Overall, giving this game 8/10, if it had the companions beeing more engaging i would give it 9/10. if it had a bit more in terms of armor designs i would gve it 10/10. VERY AWESOME GAME I DID NOT EXPECT IT BUT IT WAS AND SO I AM NOT SAD FOR BUYING IT.
