I never played 1/2 and did not feel lost in this game.  The combat was fun and the RPG elements were flushed out fully.  The story was above average for an RPG.  The game is not a complete button masher, but it does have some button masher tendencies.  I think the combat did a good job of walking that fine line of spanning skills and still having some unique fights and play style differences.You might like this game ifYou enjoy depth in RPGs and live action combat.
