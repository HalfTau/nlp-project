First off I have played both the first two games and it is NOT the same.I will not hold that against the game and will rate it for its play, not comparing it to the others.Use a Controller, trust me it makes the game play 100 better. Solves any camera angle issues.ProsGood storyGood graphicsChoices matterPresetup for controllerConsCombat is to easy even on Hardcore.Camera is a pain if not using a controlerWorld is smaller that the story indicates, breaking imersion a bit.Note Combat isnt all about hack and slash... its abouit understanding the timing of your characters dead time before and after attacks, and dodging at the right times... Almost never have to use healing abilities after getting used to the timing. You can fight entire boss battles without taking a hit... Even dodging the lockon magic spells that cicle around till they time out or hit something. USE COVER if your a ranged player... Magic and guns will hit pillars that you can shoot around.
