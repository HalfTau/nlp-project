I tried it a second time b/c I couldnt remember why I stopped. Took me 5 minute of playing to remember. I really really enjoyed the first one, kind of enjoyed the second one, and well, this one continued the downward trend. Very dissapointing graphics, slim to no depth of strategy, confusing and forgettable storyline a killer for RPGs. Go buy the first one instead, youll get a good 50100hrs out of it.
