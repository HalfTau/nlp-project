If you are thinking of buying this hoping it would be a modern version of Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, please do not. It is virtually NOTHING like the first 2 in the series and almost every aspect of the game is miserable. The camera angles2 are both absolutely terrible. The controls feel like you are trying to use a console controller on a game that was designed for mouse and keyboard... even when using a mouse and keyboard. The stats have little to know clear meaning or explaination... that being said its impossible to know what gear is better. The maps are VERY linear, magnified by the minimap which is basically a straight line that you follow. Little to no customization of your characater relative to the previous versions of the game.Long story short, do NOT buy this game, or the 3game package.
