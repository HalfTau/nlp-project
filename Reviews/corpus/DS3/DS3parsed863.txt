Uh... I dunno. Its okay. DS 2 made a much bigger splash for me. The controls are VERY uncomfortable, and not at all intuitive. To whit this game is uberconsolized. Not as bad as Fable 3 sigh, and not completely unplayable. Just verey obviously meant to be played with a console controller.The story lives up to the series, the graphics are good, the controls are... theyre really pretty bad. Again, not unplayable. Just counterintuitive. The levelling system is different from either of the first two games, which is okay.I dont know why, but Im really feeling bitter about DS3 at this point. It just wasnt as good as its predecessors. That seems to be a theme with gaming franchises recently.UPDATEAfter playing Torchlight 2, Im never touching this piece ofagain.
