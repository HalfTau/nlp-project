Well, that was depressing.Pros Story what I saw of it loked good, if a bit generic. Graphics are nice. Music is nice.Cons Multiplayer coop does NOT ALLOW SECONDARY PLAYERS TO KEEP PROGRESS OR ITEMS. Multiplayer shares inventory. Completely. Camera controls are absolute. Crap. Theyd be better off without camera control. Mouse and keyboard controls are terrible. Gamepad controls DO NOT ALL WORK. Even with gamepad, you will have to use mouse and keyboard for SOME things. Multiplayer mode allows the appearance of voting on some things, but it does not work, and only the host player will appear in the story or cutscenes.
