Dont let the pretty graphics and promos fool you This is NOT the DS you know or remember. Dungeon Siege 3 is more like a horribly failed attempt at a Gauntlet game. If you can stomach the game past the first few levels then I think it lets you use more than one ability. This one is astonishingly bad, steer clear!
