So far the story is uninteresting and the characters are boring. Its somewhat sexist towards women and the mechanics are shallow. I found it annoying that when Im talking to others, I can only see the back of my head. Would of been nice if the camera shifted to show who I was talking to and then myself back and forth.On the plus side, everything looks really nice. Cool environments and the music is good. Biggest plus is that they have a really good engine to work off of if Obsidian wanted to make a more robust and deep Dungeon Siege game. Hopefully spend some more money on writers that dont constantly say the whole name of the bad guy like a 1990s movie high school bully and good character artists, not the ones that draw giant breasts on everything.I got this for a few bucks on Humble Bundle. I dont suggest spending much more then that on this game.
