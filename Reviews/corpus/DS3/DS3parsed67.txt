Play this game if youre looking to disrupt the basic Diablo 2/3 /Torchlight point and click game. those are awesome break from them for this I went from D3 straight to this and struggled mightly. Once I reset myself I found a rewarding game that balanced area effect, offense, and defense how I wanted to play.Try the different characters and play this game. Its not diablo and its not trying to be. Enjoy both.
