In many ways, this is better than Diablo 3.  OMG!  Yes I said it!  It feels like a game made in this decade and not in the 90s.  I could change the camera angle, I played it with a controller, there were actual cutscenes with dialog not just text bubbles, my character talked!  My companions were the other heroes I didnt pick.  I got to shape the world depending on my actions kill or save a guy, free or imprison another guy, etc so it had replayability and your choices mattered.  The classes were fun, I played the chick with the gun.  Cool abilities.  Cool story.  The game had different endings.  Its really worth playing and I enjoyed it much more than Diablo 3.   I give this game 4 out of 5 Whitestars.
