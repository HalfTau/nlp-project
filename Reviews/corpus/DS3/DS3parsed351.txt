If your looking for a game that resembles the mechanics found in Dungeon Siege 1  2 this is NOT the game for you. You are limited into a class based on which of the 4 premade characters you pick at the start of the game. All the customization and freedom found in the other Dungeon Siege games is missing here. it is a simplified game, Which is not what i was looking for in a Dungeon Siege game.
