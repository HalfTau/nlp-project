game cool, good looking and story seem to be good so far.But1 micropurchase is somewhatme off by that i spend 79eur to game and i see it has micropurchase on PC game. Micropurchases are used to upgrade gear... so u can have all best gear and whole maps and els revealed whit micropurchases..they are for phone games, and now they are gonna be on PC games .2 some contents are unlocked via phone app that what i understand it is unlocked, app is fine cool, but you have to purchase premium for full potential of the app, once again i bought the game for 79e, why not add the app premium too? punch of other stuff i get but no premium.3 PERFORMANCE problems, slow motion.. low fps... and CAPED 30fps whenever i even get that is on rare not so populated place hardware cpu fx6350 Gpu HD Radeon 7950 Ram 8Gb, Win 7. settings high or higher. Tested all settings fps improves only by 12fps by lowering settings. feels unfinished and feels like its not beta tested.update 4 BIGGEST thing i hate is that THERE IS NO SAVE SLOTS! how does the family member play if no save slots? okey moving files but that is quite hard reason i hate this the most is that all new games should have saveslots for another gameplayits not probably a thing which is gonna come any soon.
