Ive now played the game for 5 hours and Im already sick of it. This game is so boring. The main character is boring as and the storyline is not interesting at all. There are still some technical issues, which still are not fixed. Dont play this game, there are better Assassins Creed games out there. Ive played every Assassins Creed game and this one is the worst I have played. This may very well be the end of the franchise as we know it.
