Guys have any of you read the minimum and recommended pc specs for this game. stop ing that your computer sucks, read the requirements first. If you dont already know amd gpu are not as compatible as NVidia gpus are so this is why you are getting terrible frame rates. All of you are judging your review on how well you can run this game, review it on how good it is not how good your frame rate is.Now that thats out of the way i rate this game 8 out of 10.The goodAwesome graphics it looks better than real life at ultra 1440p. no joke i thought it was like the trailer.better smoother parkourbetter movement in generalfluid combat/ harder combat.the consit takes a long time for you to start the game and for you to finally become an assassin unlike brotherhood and revelationsthe controls are confusing because the logos for the buttons are weird and they dont specify how to do certain thingsno counter or kill streak while in combat. the kill streak thing i get for why taking it out, it was too op and made combat too easy, counter we need that  put it back in the game, also you need to hit a guy 50 times to kill them.unrealistic parkour Arno can jump from pillars that are 20 feet away from each other, tell him to go the Olympics daymdont even get me started on the enemy aioverall needs some improvements on compatibility with amd gpus, we need counter back and the enemy ai is complete  like all assassins creed games, you guys have a reputation for mentally challenged aiR8 8, buy? wait for it to drop in price
