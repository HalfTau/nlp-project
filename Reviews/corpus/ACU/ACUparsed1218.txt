ok main plot nothing great could care less about the charaters. Like the murder mystery side missions alot moregreat graphics but not dynamicbut the performance isnt great running a gtx980 with a i7 6850k  32GB RAM and constant crashing about the sequence 5/6 mark makes it pretty bad, but if you stick to the main story missions the game seems to be fine but if your exploring the city which is oddly fun just running around the game doesnt want to work.Also the upgrade system is kinda annoying to the end. Further content locked behind coop isnt great if you want to play this game solo.disclaimer havent finished the game yet doing all the side missions  causing a lot of crashing
