Now with the 30 gigs of patches Unity is now playable. By no means does it run well, but there are much less gamebreaking bugs but there is still a plethora of graphical hiccups and bugs and framerate issues. The story is alright, not the worst story in the world but nothing great either, the gameplay is standard fare Assassins Creed with some improvements to the freeruning. One of the primary issues I have with this game isnt any of the frame rate issues or graphical problems. Its the fact that despite this game taking place in France during the French Revolution, all of the characters that have any sizable dialogue have English accents, thats moronic to me and it just ruins my enjoyment of the game. The combat is terrible, there have been times where I will throw a smoke bomb so I can kill a few enemies easily but Arno will just stand there not responding even through Im furiously clicking my attack button. The controls are just bad, theyre stiff and difficult to effectively use while running and/or climbing, I get stuck onall the time, sometimes I just get stuck on air! I swear I have never had more difficulty getting through a window than I have in this game. All in all the is a tolerable game, its a 4/10 only buy it when its on a huge sale and dont expect much.
