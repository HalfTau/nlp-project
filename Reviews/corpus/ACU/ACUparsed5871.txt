Do not buy this game yet, or ever if Ubisoft doesnt optimize their game. Even with highend specifications, this game is VERY poorly optimized/not optimized at all for PC. Strangely, during cutscenes, the FPS drops even more dramatically than when youre actually playing the game.Its extremely sad since Assassins Creed used to be a series that had extremely beautiful graphics and it ran smooth as butter on the lowend PCs, but lately theyve been scaling up the graphics requirements exponentially and theres very little visual improvement at the cost of a metric fton of processing power.TLDR Buyer beware, wait for a performance patch or stay away from this one forever.
