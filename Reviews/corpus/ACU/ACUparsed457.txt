You need to unlock the ability to sit on a bench. Apparently this isnt obvious to a middle aged Frenchman?I only played this for two hours. Im normally a big fan of the AC games  I started playing them when the first one was announced back in 2007?. But this game is just.... slow.The beginning of this is way too cinematic. Theres more movies and me staring at the screen than me actually playing the game. If I wanted to watch a movie, Id pop open John Oliver.Many of the missions lack options. Theres only one way to complete a mission, and the player must follow a very specific path to achieve the mission. If you deviate from it slightly, a guard catches you, overwhelms you, or the mission abruptly restarts. Super annoying.The story is silly. So your childhood crush has a different political interest than you? Boo hoo. Break that tie, watch a sad romantic comedy I heard Les Miserables was popular around that time, and hop on Tindr. Or Grindr, seeing as how the protagonist spends so much time with long pointy things.The game play is really lackluster. The combat is really slow and unexciting. It feels like Im cutting through molasses. This game really ought to have faster combat mechanisms. Shadow of Mordor has a great combat system  this pales in comparison. When multiple enemies attack you, they huddle in a big ol circle and only one unit actually attacks you at a time. Real boring. In a real fight, you get yourwooped by multiple people simultaneously.
