Ive reserched on and everyone saids the bugs are done with.. at lest for me they are NOTProsOutstanding graphics. One of the games that at least looks like nextgen gameNew Parkour Animations and new tacticsBig and beautifully designed Paris of XVIII centuryNew combat system,that makes the game a bit more challenging in a good wayA lot of customization features. You can create your own unique assassin that can easily change how you playConsStory made no sense and didnt make a point in anything for the assassins rather then being a young rebel and thinks a templar is hot XP system that shouldnt be even in and feels like Im playing a RPG gameNew stealth system is good but about 75 of the missions you cannot stealth at allControls are not comfortable. Arno is not responding to my commands correctly. He sticks to the walls not climbing into windows etc feels like the glitches in ACBFSkills system is so bad. You need to unlock skills just to throw money on the ground or sit on the bench. Really?Economy system mainly you have to use irl money to get any missions done so in reality this game is maybe 100 even more if you get dlcs
