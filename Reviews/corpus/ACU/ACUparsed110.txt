I have enjoyed all of the creed games I have played and I think this game is fun but has some major flaws. One the coop is during missions only which I think is a waste should have just been you are their during the entire game would have been a lot more fun. And a second major flaw has to do with weapons specificaly the muskets and pistols. For those that dont know you have a limit to how many weapons you can carry such as if you have a musket thats all you get now sword no dagger nothing else but a pistol you can have a sword or something too. the flaw to this is that the best pistol in the game has much  more range and damage than the best musket which is very annoying since I wanted to be a ranged character with a musket but I get outdone by some guy with a pistol and they will also do a lot better close range since they get a sword too.
