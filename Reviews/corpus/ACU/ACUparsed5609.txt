After just 4 hours this game is probably one of the best Assassins Creed Ive played. It seems that many people are having issues but I have not had any. A few bugs with the civilians and AI movement but nothing major. I love the movement in this, it feels so natural. The missions are much better and havent been repetative like in previous games. Graphics are great and its just an overall great game!
