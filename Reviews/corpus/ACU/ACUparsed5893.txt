I really wish this game was better than it is upon release, because right now with the fps drops at cutscenes, and randomly out in the open world, it is annoying to play. While the return of the old combat system makes it have an up there, spinning cameras and freezing/crashing causes it to be a pain to play. All in all, this game needed a month or two more for bug testing and optimization.
