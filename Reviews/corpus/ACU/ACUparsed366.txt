The story is ok, kind of disappointing after ACIV full game experience. The graphics, however, were phenomenal! They captured the centre of Paris excellent. 2/3 weeks after i finished the game, I went to Paris and knew the details of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Absolutely stunning how they made this game! The buildings were much alike, the people I travelled with looked silly at me when I mentioned weird things like how the vent pipes were aligned and the blue/greyness of the buildings. Most of the time playing the game I just went parkouring without the game hud and walked between people protesting capturing screenshots. I recommend this game for its beauty, its much more beautiful than Syndicate IMO. Sadly the storyline didnt do it for me.
