ReReviewAll problems that I had originally were corrected within the month. I just wish the game had been ready for release ON release instead of a PreAlpha purchace. However, now that it has been bugfixed, the game is very fun and I look forward to future developments. Future developments that I will not be purchasing until about 2 months AFTER release.
