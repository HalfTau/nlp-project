After beating the game with 87 overall completion I felt that the game felt ok. I didnt see many of the bugs other people have complained about but I definitely did see the big performance issues and issues with the game mechanics as well. The freerun is not completely refine and at some points frustrates me as I am trying to navigate myself through paris. Overall the story itself was alright although I felt the interruptions with the real world the helix rifts made me feel disconnected from the game. The game is definitely not one of the best assassins creed and I kind of felt dissappointed even though the story was alright. If the story felt extremely short and I felt that Arnos character was not so great. Also, the game itself is different than what they were advertising as most of the revolutionary moments in the story were not so immersive. I thought there would be high profile actions you can perform that would insight a riot in the crowd but none of that existed. Also the coop was an even greater dissappointment as It wasnt anything like the trailers although the coop was not so bad and sometimes even fun. All in all, aside from the main issues brought up at the launch of the game, the game itself is enjoyable although it could have been much better.
