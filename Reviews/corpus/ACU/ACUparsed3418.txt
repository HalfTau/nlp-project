Im having a very, very good time with this game right now. It took too long to get it fixed currently patch 4, but at the moment I cant complain about anything. It runs near 60fps on my gaming laptop ASUS G751, 980m with everything maxed out without TXAA and Ive not experienced any real showstopping bug in my 19 hours of playtime.I love the fact that its back to the roots. One city, many things to do, but focused with not to much mini games. I am ignoring the companion app and the micro transactions, they are crap ... I dont need them, so I save time by not complaining about them. I rather focus on the smooth, streamlined gameplay, the good integrated stealth system, the new fighting mechanic, the living and breathing city and the stunning atmosphere! This is by far the most beautiful game to date. I loved Black Flag as a pirate game but I like Unity as the first real Assassins Creed like game since part one. Shame on you Ubisoft for the release desaster back in november, but also Thanks for this great game.Best feature after seven installments, the guards are staying on the ground. I repeat no guard in paris has a classAgrade in parcour  finally!
