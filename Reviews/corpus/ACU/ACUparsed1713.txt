Bought the game in March 2016.Uplay is pretty discreet now, so no issues there.However coop wouldnt work, which was the main reason i bought this. We simply could not connect with my buddies even after forwarding ports etc...Had the same issue with Anno 2205 which I bought sometime in December 2015.Very disappointed Ubisoft, issues with your games are way too recurring.I dont think I will buy another Ubisoft game in the near future as a result, since even months after their initial release they still cannot be played properly. There are too many good games out there to be losing time trying to get a supposedly AAA game working as advertised.I buy games to play them not to try and make them playable.
