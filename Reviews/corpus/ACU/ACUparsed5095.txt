Good game, really love the storyline and Gameplay. the one thing that kills it is the performance issues. they are really bad at the start of the release even though you have a high end pc. im running on a gtx 680 and im getting huge fps drops all the time. if they manage to fix this. id probably say this is the best Assassins creed game to date.
