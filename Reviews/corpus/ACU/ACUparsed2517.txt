Hi guys,When i first tried to play this game i was running it on my old graphics card the GTX 690 and it wasnt playing well and lived up to all the negative expectations as others have described.However i have since upgraded to a EVGA 980Ti SC and still using the same CPU i7 3770k and im getting a solid 60  80 FPS with all the settings maxed out including AA which i know i dont need to max out for this time but why the hell not.Game is beautiful and the story is fantastic. Im doing all the side missions now and then will do Dead Kings DLC as well. Loving the attention to detail with the buildings in Paris and this game really brings back the true meaning of Assassins Creed. Rogue and Black Flag are still great games but they are more open world an more about ship battles which is cool in its own way.But playing Unity really does bring back memories of Assasins creed 2 and Revelations. Climbing all those historic buildings is awesome as is reading about them to a certain degree. this game kind of overdoes the descriptions but its no big deal.Anyway guys TLDR if you have a good graphics card then youll enjoy this game, if you dont, it simply wont run well for you and youll be upset.
