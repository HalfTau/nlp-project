I cant explain it... Theres something off with Assassins Creed Unity, compared to the old titles in the series  and Ive played through all of them.Its like the developers of this game has done their work exactly to specification, but without pouring any heart into it.Their effords feels ... bland  is the best word that comes to mind. Comparing the old titles not counting Black Flag here to this, is like comparing a Ferrari 458 convertible to an american chrysler 200 convertible... Sure both are sports cars, and open convertibles  but the Ferrari has so much more finesse. The Chrysler 200 in comparison  well the parts hardly fit together, and looks like they were designed by a team of individuals not working together towards the end result.The development/code of Assassins creed unity has the same we werent really working as a team, rather as a bunch of individualists with specifications of individual parts feeling to it. Maybe there was a team of architects working at one place, and a team of cheap developers working from across the globe?Sure the graphics has been upped a bit there is much more details to this game, the graphic designers definately was paying attention. Sound wise  the game also doesnt lack anything.But the coding... psscht.There are bugs/glitches here and there, such as a guy with a pitchfork lifting hay up in the air, and then scattering it in a circle above his head, and the hay doesnt fall down  rather hovers up there, or one of the other bugs I found within the first couple of minutes of gameplay where I got stuck climbing, and couldnt move up or down  but had to restart the memory but its not the easy fixables thats the wrongdoing of the game, which I can feel.To gamers who has played the hitman series, they will know what I mean  by looking at the original Hitman titles which came out under IOI  compared to what happened once Eidos took control.The difference here feels exactly the same to me.
