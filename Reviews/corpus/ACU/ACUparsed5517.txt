This game is awful. The PC version is defiantly not worth the 70 CAD. I have a computer that meets all the specs recomended by Ubisoft for this game and I hardly cap 30 frames. I would not buy this game if you were thinking about it. There are many other game developers that still care about their customers who deserve it more than Ubisoft.
