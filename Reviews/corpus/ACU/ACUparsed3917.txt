10/10Do not believe the negativity about this game. Every game has glitches, Skyrim has some of the worst and yet its praised as one of the greatest games in recent years. The story is great, the game world is fantastically detailed and huge, and enormous amounts of stuff to do. A great addition to the Assassins Creed series that is unfortunately marred by hasty publicity reactions. You can use microtransactions to get stuff quicker however of course you dont need it, its pretty damn easy to make money in the game. Do I care that it has microtransactions and is it a moneygrabbing choice for Ubisoft? Absolutely not, who gives aas long as you can get stuff without the use of Microtransactions. After playing 5 hours I have not had 1 major glitch. Every now and then you may see a random pedestrian float or run a couple feet in the air but thats about it. Also for the system requirements, it works perfectly fine and I have a Nvidia GeForce 750Ti. Not the best graphics card and yet it plays incredibly smooth. Dont believe negativity bandwagon on this game, if you are a hardcore fan of the AC series then get this game.
