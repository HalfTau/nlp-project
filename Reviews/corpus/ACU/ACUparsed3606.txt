It really bothers me to have to say this, but dont bother with this game. Its broken from the word go. Random freezes, unacceptable and unplayable fps, and the worst glitches in a game since I cant even remember when. And thats just in the scripted cutscenes. I have contacted Ubisoft recently about these issues and any patches that may help and I was told, We are aware of the issues and are working as fast as we can to fix them.... Right.
