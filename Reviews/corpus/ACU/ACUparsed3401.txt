I have played this game since release and I never found that many bugs. Although there was a few at the time, I think overall the game play, story, and design are well thought out. They are displayed in a way that I enjoy and I believe you should enjoy. Out of all the Assassins Creed games, this is by far my favorite due to the story line and history of it. Im looking forward to the next installment and so should you.
