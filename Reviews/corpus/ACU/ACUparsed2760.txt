got the game when it was on sale, have to say, i was surprised i did not have many issues with the game. im using a i54690, GTX 960 8gigs ram. played on 1440p high to ultra 30 fps smooth no lag. have to say i love the main story right up untill the end. combat was fun and quests were good. one of my favorite assassins game
