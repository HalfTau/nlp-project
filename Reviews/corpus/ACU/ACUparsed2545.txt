This game was definetly not one of my favorites from the series. I find it difficult to see how Arno fits in with the Assassins at all. He doesnt care about the assasins main purpose. Hes using his abilities for a personal matter. I didnt really like the story, but what I dont like the most is the map. It gets repatative. I feel as if the developers copied and pasted the same part several times but slightly tweaked it in each district. Only a few districts stood out. The missions were repetative too. I blew through the main assassination missions because all I had to do was use my phantom blade or gun to shoot the target, then run in with a smoke bomb and finish him the target off. I only bought this game so I could run around as an assassin with my freinds, but if you want to play this game alone I dont think its worth it.
