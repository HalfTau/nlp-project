A good game. Great graphics, I also feel that the freerunning in this game is a lot smoother than in the old ones. It is my favoritte Assassings Creed so far. Love the coop. But could have been a bit better optimized, does not seem like you can play this game on any pc as it got some requirements.The COOP is very fun, but can be laggy at times, I dont know if it is bad connection that cause this but I have been in some coop games where im running around in a empty room and suddenly the enemy AI spawn in and I end up standing in the middle of them. Or that im following another player and when we are running in small areas he suddenly teleported far infront of me or i thught he ran right but then he lagged a bit and suddenly ran left instead. But mostly I really enjoy the coop also.
