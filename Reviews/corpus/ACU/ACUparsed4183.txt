Words cannot express how furious i am feeling right now...Ive recently bought the game even though i know there were many issues but i was like hey, maybe ill be one of the lucky ones experiencing little issues with the gameclick...click...click. 60 from wallet.Finally done installing it and excited to try out the game.Menu loaded, click New game...loading...saving game pops up top right corner..1.3 seconds later,ACU.exe Has stopped working pops up. reloaded the game and tried again but same outcome.ing i hate myself as much as i hate Ubisoft. Want my ing money back but i guess i had it coming...Me and my stupidity....SIGHHH.To those of you that havent bought the game yet, PLEASEEEE PLEASEEE DONT BE LIKE ME AND BUY THIS UNFINISHED GAME FOR 60. NOT ING WORTH IT IF YOU CANT PLAY IT.Just wait till they fix all the issues and even then DO NOT BUY IT!! Let others who already have the game test it out first before you spend 60 on this game.
