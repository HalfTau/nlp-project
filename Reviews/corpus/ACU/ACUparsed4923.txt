Amazing game. The graphics look awesome and the story is pretty good. By far the best AC so far. As for what people are complaining about bugs and errors, Ive experienced barely none. The minor gittery graphics glitch on some cutscenes can be distracting, but nothing as bad as what people are posting going through walls or the floor. I bet those peoples have outdated hardware that dont meet the minimum or recommended requirements for the game and their hardware cant keep up with the complex collision detection calculations. People dont understand that for amazing graphics, you need amazing hardware to run it. The game does look amazing. Im running on High settings and getting 4060 FPS.
