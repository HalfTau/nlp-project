After having AC4 which really changed the way people saw Asassins Creed, and was great for new comers, Unity is just boring. Whatever new players to the francise that started with this game, have probobly left. I know that my friend who started with 4 had a great time with the game as I did, but upon me showing him Unity, he simply told me that he wish he were playing Black Flag. Even though at this point most if not all bugs are fixed, the game is still boring as crap. I felt as if I were in one of my social studies slideshows. Also, the graphics arent much better than black flag. In fact, theyre basically the same. I ran them both on ultra and found little to no differance, exept for the fact that Unity ran like rhino balls being dipped in fire.
