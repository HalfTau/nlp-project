So my favourite franchise in games is Assassins. Some of you will be like Assassins are boring and some would say its a dope game depends on what the gamer likes. Lets start....1. Is the game nice?A1. I liked it alot, the map is well created and is very beautiful. You can explore alot of things and find new places and unlock new things. there are some things which are not so cool, like no transportation facility except Fast Travel that unlocks only when u visit the areas syncronizationis ok but if your internet connection is extremly bad, YOU WILL LAG AND HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES.2. Is it worth it?A2. Wait for sale and buy it.3. Is the DLC worth it?A3. I would say NO, but i got it with the game. If u get it for free then cool, otherwise watch a Gamer play it.4. Is this THE BEST AC GAME?A4. Not at all, some things like the Weapons, Transportation, Response to the pressingofakey basically Parrying or attacking someone and Parkour are one of the WORST!!!OVERALL I would say 5050 but i am more on the Recommending this game side so I would go with a Yes but otherwise, there are other Assassins Creed games like AC3, AC ORIGINS, AC2 which are worth it. If you like free  roam, this game is nice. but free roam isnt everything
