What can I say that hasnt already been said? The framerate makes me think I left powerpoint open on stills of gameplay footage. Also, when the game crashed just now, it said my game was corrupted and that I had to verify or something. So I did. And it was either missing 14 gigs of content from the game, or that 14 gigs was corrupted. Id go with the latter, though this is the second time Ive had to reinstall the game on  Australian internet speeds.
