This game follows a brilliant concept and is incredibly fun when its working, The rest of the time it is totally plagued with bugs, micro transactions, the reliance on 3rd party app which is just as buggy and occassional wipes of saves and character progression whiole UBISOFT releases patches to address the issue while only creating more.AC is tremendous fun and while the game looks great and is in all actuality fun it comes at at steep cost of poor cash grabs. They create legendary gear with literally no way to achieve them unless you play their social club contests which are not even available to play yet. If you even manage to stomach their crap for that long maybe it would be worth it but after nearly 90 hours of gameplay it becomes apparent that their business model was poorly designed and too reliant on interactive web pages, mobile apps and a lack of polish. they should have taken an additional two years developing this game for a true AC coop experience.
