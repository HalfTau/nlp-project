I have played almost every single assassins creed game and I was really hoping this would be one of my favourite ones. Unfortunatly it is definitely not and here is why.The combat system in this game is so poorly optimized you will barely make it out of a fight against five men, even when you have max armour and health. The NPCs will grab their guns and start unloading on you, they are maybe 2 metres away from you and they will just blast you in the face over and over again. There is no way you can block 5 pistol shots at once no matter how hard you try.The story was a bit overwhelming, jumping from one to another just leaving a total mess behind. It was just a complete chaos in my opinion. This is one of the worst assassins creed games I have ever played. I thought it would be fun because you can play together with a friend. But even that does not work.Not sure what I expected from ubisoft but this is just a steaming pile ofcompared the older games.
