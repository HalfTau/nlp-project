I actually dont know why people underrestimate this game so much. Its probably not one of the best games at optimizing cause even if u have a nice graphics card u almost always get low fps compared what you actually would have in other games that have higher graphics. Bad things appart, the story is very good for me remember its my opinion, I love the cooperative mode with my friends, I love the side missions, I love the character costumitzation, basically I love this game and I actually recommend it.When this game come out there were lots of glitches, bugs and but the time passed and ubisoft realized they needed to fix the game, and so they did! So now its not that bad optimized, theres not that much bugs and almost no gliches.
