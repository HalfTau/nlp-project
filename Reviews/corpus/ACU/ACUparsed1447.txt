Despite being released with an abundance of bugs and glitches it is now playable and pretty fun, the story is a little lacking compared to the old Kenway arc but the new coop system was very enjoyable. Overall id give it a 7.5, grab it on sale if ur a fan of the series and can afford a beastmachine to run it well, and if uve got a buddy who wants in to check it out. Definitely had fun playin this with my brother, but i missed playing as a Kenway
