I was incredibly excited for this game and put off buying when I read all the bad reviews about the graphical errors and bad gameplay. However I am a diehard Assassins Creed fan. If you are thinking like I was How bad can it be let me just stop you there. Its bad, really really bad. Im currently alpha testing games that are more put together than this game is. DO not buy this game unless you are a really diehard AC fan. Im very disapointed in Ubisoft, I really hope they dont  up The Divison like theve ed up Watch Dogs and This.
