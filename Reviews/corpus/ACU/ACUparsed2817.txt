This game had a terrible launch but I finally gave in and bought it today.Im running everything on Ultra except for AA disabled. Instead of AA Im running DSR1440p and getting 55  60 FPS. Looks like the problems are fixed.So far Im really enjoying the game. Its a good Assassins Creed story. Paris is beautiful and feels more alive than any one of the previous titles. I like the new parkour animations and the new combat system. I also spent a couple of hours this evening playing the coop missions. They were a great addition to this game.Its a shame this game got off to such a bad start. I almost passed it up but now its well on its way to being my favorite entry in the series.
