Let me start out by saying that i belive that a lot of these reviews are based on momentary rage. i have too encounteded a few bugs, but i still belive that this is an improvement from AC 3 and AC Black Flag. the AI are generaly more intelligent, the weapons are more optimized and provide a challenge, The freerunning is finaly done smooth enough to have a natural navigation feel, and i do enjoy that you dont start off as a high and mighty assassin with all the skills of the master you cant even do a stun attack in the beginning!For those who are not able to launch the game due to bugs, i feel that you have no right reviewing the game for you have not played the acual game for all those having problems in general, have you tried contacting any support? shoot some Email, usualy its something they need to be informed about so they can fix it sooner! it is as much of their job to fixing it as it is our job to tell them what to fix.Now here are my Pros and cons of the game.ProsFreerunning feels smoothNot much is given to you in the begining forcing you to work for itCombat is much harder and realistic, guns will acualy kill you in 12 shotsAIs are smarter in the sence of guards noticing you if you dont hide cleveraly and civilians relizing you killed a theif and they dont have to flipbrNew and old game mechanics explained well in the tutorial missionsRelateable main character I dont feel forced into a character roleConsI fell through the ground twice and shot into the air onceSometimes the camera skips and i end up loosing my place while running and slam into a wall.Sometimes i dont know who exactly the enemy isSometimes not clear whether i should fight the 12 guards or jump out a window to complete the missionI have not engaged in any multiplayer missions and im sure that is where i would find many bugs, but the regualr singleplayer champaign storyline hold more story than AC3 and AC4 ever did. When i do play online, i will amend my reveiw to reflect my opinions on it.If you dont not have a good graphics card and overall a good computer made to handle these types of games, do not buy the game yet. the Preorder is over, so there is no time limit. if you have it and cant launch it / its so buggy you cant enjoy it, please contact support if you have not already and try to resove you problems. if you have it and can run it, THEN you should post a review on your thoughts.
