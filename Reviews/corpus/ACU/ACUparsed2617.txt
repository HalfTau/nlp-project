this is a game that i am going to play for much,much longer than 3.8 hours.but in the begining, i almost didnt even want to play it.in the begining the graphics were ok, i expected them to be better.i have a good pc, but not geforce gtx 780 graphics.the only thing really wrong with the graphics is that arnos hair would go batshit crazy,bouncing continously,changing size rapidly,and swiveling back back and forth.eventually it stopped.finally, the fighting system is,as you probably have heard, completely different to other assassins creed games,and is actually harder.once you buy a new weapon and a pistol, it will be much easier to fight.there are more good things about this game,but i cant tell you all offinally, if you decide to buy this game buy it on a 50 or 75 sale
