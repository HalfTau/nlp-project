When it works, Im loving the story and the gameplay. Problem being though, is that it seldom works. If only there was some way to go back and have a smaller amount of generic AIs. I think including that small feature, the ability to choose whether you want the fully immersive AI or the justthere AI for those who dont have the hardware to handle the new engine would work wonders.Basically,  I recommend this game. But those without gaming computers beware.EDITSo far as of patch 3 to try and make a finished product playable, it is still unplayable. Framerate is too choppy to even get past the Bastille where you learn how to parry and such. Basically I cant get past the tutorial because the game is unplayable.As a note, my hardware is by no means good, but it should be sufficient 3.0GHz i5, 8GB mem, Nvidia GT 540. Especially with having all the setting down as low as they will go.
