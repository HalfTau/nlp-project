UPDATE I am updating my review. I originally recommended this game. It is beautiful and I really liked it. But to spend twenty hours and then have Uplay synch erase or corrupt my save file so now I am starting all over........ Just sucks. I dont want anyone to have the sinking feeling of being kicked in the stomach like I have.OriginalI know some folks dont have the computer to run this game but for those that do, wow. Its a truly beautiful game that. I was skeptical about getting it but glad I did. So far the cut scenes Ive never seen facial expressions this good as well as general play are quite good. If you have the computer to run it properly, I dont think you will be disappointed.
