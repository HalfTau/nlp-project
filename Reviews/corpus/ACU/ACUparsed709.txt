Ive played a large amount of Assassins Creed and this game is not that bad. The control are sometimes bothersome, where the char jumps onto thing or does not do what you want him to do. In my time playing this game I have recieved a couple of screen glitchs, but nothing game breaking. The gameplay is like all other Assassins Creed and so is the story. It feels over done, but if you enjoy Assassins Creed games then this one is not that bad, its not the best, but its playable. I got this on a steam sale, I would not have payed full price for it.
