No English language? Really? When I prepurchased this game on Steam, Enlish WAS in a list of languages, so does it now  WITHOUT any notifications of regional restrictions!I understand that UbiSoft CAN afford to neglect and ignore their customers. Alright then, in return I wont buy their products anymore.
