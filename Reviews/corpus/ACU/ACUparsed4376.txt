I bought this game until he could play it and was very excited to play it. the first day that could play it i download it and when i started to play it  the game wouldnt let me play the game and i follows even without getting the game and delete it and i tried  to download 3 times and still does not let me open the game. I personally dont recommend spending 60 just to have tha game in your inventory and dont be avel to play it. and steam begin to work on fixing the game that ti realy disappointed me and fuk you uplay you suck.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
