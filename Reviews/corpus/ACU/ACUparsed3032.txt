Its not the best game ever by any stretch of the imagination but its not bad either. The story could be better but the lack of music and overall intensity of the game just keeps it away from shining. Its still HORRIBLY optimized and unless youre running a 290, 970 or a 980 stay away from this game. I personally have an R9 270X and run the game on High settings at 1080p at 3045 FPS.
