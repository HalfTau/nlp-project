I bought a new GPU for this game, and its been a blast.They removed hunting animals  sailing which I hate in the previous games AC III  AC IV, its like back to Ezios world but with much, much, much, and much better environment hence the minimum requirements. And the combat system is definitely much harder, and it is good, but the best thing from this game is the new co op multiplayer.The only thing I hate in this game is the companion app, because you cant beat the game 100 unless you play this bugfest app. What a nightmare.
