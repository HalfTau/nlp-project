The game itself is great! But I maxed out the game on my GTX 780 and got a max of 2 fps. 2 FPS. ON A 780. no excuse for this.UPDATE With recent patches, I can now max it out at about 20 fps average. Still has crazy dips though. And for anyone saying its my PC, its about a 1400 build. FX8350 Water cooled / GTX 780 / 16GB high speed RAM / ASUS 990 FX R2.0 MOBO and I take great care of it. I ran Ryse Son Of Rome at an average of 35 fps maxed out with supersampling on. It can handle rough games.
