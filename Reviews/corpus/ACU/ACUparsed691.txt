Assassins Creed Unity is probably one of the best looking Assassins Creed games Ive played, and the customization of your character definitely adds some creativity and fun. The story, at least for me, was nothing too special. The only thing that really comes to mind that is memorable are the story missions, which most were more difficult than what they should be and kind of bland or just flat out annoying. like they added it there just to add more hours into the gameEdit After I died on some of the missions it would actually automatically skip a section of the mission, which to be honest I was fine with because some of the missions were either too hard, really annoying, or useless.
