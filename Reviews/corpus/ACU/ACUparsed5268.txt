I was so exited when i first saw the CGI trailer that I preordered this game and as it is now its not worth your money its actually disrespectful selling a product on its current state. I totally agree with people saying that this microtransactions crack it up the game immersion, the performance on my amds video card its the worst and from what Im reading so far its not happening only with me, I would truly love if they took this microtransactions out of the game and having the option for save slots, so when and if they fix it i could have that experience promised to all of us.
