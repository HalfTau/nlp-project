This game was so bad I felt the need to say so. I have never given a game a bad review, formally. Though I have come across bad games, I tend to keep my opinions to myself. This game however is so utterly terrible in every aspect of its execution, I would like to warn others from paying for it, and being, as I was, seriously dissapointed. Avoid it at all costs. How they get away with such poor craftsmanship is completely beyond me.
