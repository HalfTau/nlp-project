I bought this game and I spent FOUR DAYS installing it. However, when I finally got to play, its would lag up and crash when I try loading it! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!On a scale of one to ten, I give this game a 5, because it is a somewhatworking title on the xbox, but no the same on PC.Ask yourself, is it really worth it?
