to say that the state of this game at release was abismal... might be an understatement.  falling through the world, game crashes, horrid framerates, were all part of your first 30mins of playing.  at the time of this writing there have already been two patches, and a third comming soontm that will be addressing a number of bugs in the areas where youre telling us youre having the most problems.the story in comparison, so far just doesnt grab me like black flag did.  which given the subject timeframe i would have expected it would.the framerates given the similarity in how it looks visually to black flag, with the exception of a LOT more people and structures in the world... are definitely something i think that can be improved. as are all the other bugs that people are experiencing, thus i am sure this will become playable at some time in the future... but if your itching to play something new over this thanksgiving 2014... you might want to look else where.  for me, ill come back and look at this after new years and see how its doing then.
