ProsThe freerunning system is arguably the strongest element of this game. Getting from point A to point B has never seemed so effortless, and everything flows together in a very organic way.I honestly like the changes to the combat system myself, although if you loved the combat in AC3 or BF you might not feel the same way. A lot of people will probably miss the counter kills, but I always thought they made combat way too easy.Tons of customization options for your weapons and gear that are more than just cosmetic.I honestly like the fact you only have one weapon and a pistol or just a rifle. I didnt think AC3 benefited from being able to carry a whole arsenal with you.Not everyone will love multiplayer missions, but I really do. I think they add an interesting extra level to standard missions. I like the added variety to the single player missions too. Love the murder mysteries!ConsWhile Im glad they got rid of the counter kills, I REALLY miss being able to disarm/ pick up weapons.General lack of optimization/lag that has led to some really frustrating deaths in multiplayer, and even seems to crop up in single player at times.
