Well honestly the graphics are amazing. the gameplay seems to be quite smooth but is way too much. i mean i really enjoyed it. but it is nowhere infront of EZIOs series. Any of the Ezios games. the story is amazing but not something youll be blown away with.it is no where infront of black flag. the coop missions can be fun if you have people around you. to get your character upgraded is cranky. you need to get the silly sync points. like you cannot do double assassination without a sync point. so you have to play multiplayer. then you need upgrades. the combat is not that much good, rather its pathetic. you cannot fight freely, the hidden blade is restricted to only stealth kills. and then you need a hell lot of upgrades. the storymode and missions are quite simple. but it can be frustrating to just roam aimlessly findimg players for co op. secondly the gameplay is good but average at the same time, the parkour is something absurd. does not obey the laws of physics at all....and also the context of the story is decent. but its not like a regular assassins creed game.
