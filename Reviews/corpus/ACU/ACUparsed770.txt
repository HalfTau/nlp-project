I tried to get into this game. I really did. I love the Assassins Creed games but this one just did not stick.The story feels weird and uninspired.The climbing feels annoying and clunkythe fighting and quick select items feel downgraded from Black FlagOver all I feel like they went two steps forwards then one step back.
