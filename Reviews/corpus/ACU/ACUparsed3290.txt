Unity is the first AC game Ive actually got into. I think I stopped playing the others AC 1, Black Flag because I am a keyboard and mouse user on PC and I just learned to hate the consolelike 3rd person movement.For whatever reason, I am totally into Unity, and loving it.How sad that what looks like a labor of love for its fans to me, Unity turned out to be such a cloodge for many. Paris is frigging amazing, and I love running the companion app alongside. It does kinda feel like an engine demo, as a Kotaku article mentioned, but what a wonderful demo!
