When I first got ACU I tried playing it and it kept crashing, found this crash was due to Ubisofts own uPlay overlay crashing the game so I had to manually disable it.Second issue was upon opening the game a second time after playing a few hours the game no longer loads and locks my computer on a black screen and takes up all my computers processing power not allowing me to open up task manager and requiring a restart of the whole computer.
