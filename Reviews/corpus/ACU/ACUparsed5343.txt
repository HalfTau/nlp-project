I will start with the fact that this is not a true next generation game, as Ubisoft promised to provide to the fans.From the very start bugs, glitches, and engine issues present themselves in a way that even inexperienced Indy developers seem to be able to leave from the presentation.I have put maybe an hour into the game, and another hour just getting it stable before I just couldnt deal with it anymore. I am on a quite powerful system, sporting 3way Sli GTX780ti units, and Haswell flagship 2011 v3Intel X99 platform. To put it in the kindest way possible, this title seldom takes proper advantage of such hardware, and issues that are present should have never made it into the final retail build. It is like all testing was exempt, and Ubisoft wanted to release the game before the holiday season. Disgraceful performance. Attempting to run at 1440p is disgusting, the engine was obviously never considered to run at 60hz above 1080p.They may patch it, but I will remember this release as the worst in history from Ubisoft. I have terminated my order for FarCry 4, and advisted as many as I can to do the same.The once great company that gave us FarCry, is no more...If I had to evaluate the new inhouse engine it would be as followsTextures are washed out. Aassets look like they were taken from a game over 5 years ago. AI is comical. Landscape and texture popin is the worst I have seen in a AAA title. Draw distance was obviously built around console limitations as is the rest is the entire game presentation for the PC platform.Unity, in a nutshell, is a waste of money, time, and space. AAA title this is not. Buyers beware, all the negative feedback is true.
