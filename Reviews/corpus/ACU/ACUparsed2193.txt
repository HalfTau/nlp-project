I cant play 20 minutes without crashingEDITAs I saidI did try to play the game opening multiple times even if it closed every 20 min, I tryed every workaround and nothing worked.Disabling SLI and CPU overclock, deleting a System32 file and disabling some nvidia configs made it work, but it is not an acceptable fix.That fix was all I could get from Ubisoft forums, but I found another one, turns out DirectXs XAudio27.dll library conflicts with the Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service or TabletInputService, meaning any game using the library will crash, including Unity Anyone using a wacom tablet or using touch devices on the computer will face this problem. Therefore the problem is a Windows 10 compatibility problem, not the game. I still think a better support from Ubi was required.Using the Task Manager Services tab to find and stop the TabletInputService will fix the issueAlso, enabling 3D on nVidia will make the water of the game disappearGiven that I enjoyed playing the game even without audio on cut scenes because I deleted XAudio27.dll from system32 to be able to play I will change this review to recommended.I will say tho nothing special, but still entertaining. I kind of got bored after so much hassleGood luck!EDIT 2Alright,  this game, until Ubisoft fix thisI wont be buying any other game they release!The game is broken again, the last 2 missions are unplayable, laggy and stuttery to the point I cant control I dont even remember the storyline anymore. I cant believe I used to stand by Ubi when ppl talked smack about them!Yes, Im changing to not recommended again!
