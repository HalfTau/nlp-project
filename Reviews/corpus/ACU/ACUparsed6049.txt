RIP1 Review In Progress OnePerformanceRunning on a GTX GeForce 660 at the moment, And am able to run on high with little problems. Doesnt run perfectly, but runs alot better than i expected. Tip for people with Geforce Experience, update to the newest driver through that. It greatly helps your game experience. No crashes so far, loading is decent times. All you need to do is make sure you have the at least bare minimum specs, and you will be fine.Story WIPMultiplayer WIP
