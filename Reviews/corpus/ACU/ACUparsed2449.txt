This game now consistently crashes after I installed Windows 10. Ubisoft Forums are claiming that none of their games currently have Windows 10 support, which is a little ridiculous, considering how long the OS has been out for. Performance issues aside, I could at least play the game until now. I was even considering giving the game a positive review, considering how well it runs in 4k on my new rig. I might still do so if Ubisoft patches this sometime soon.
