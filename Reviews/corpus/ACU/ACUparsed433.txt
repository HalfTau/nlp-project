at first launch im not convince to buy this game cause my pc spec not recommended yet and all the review like this game is buggy, lag all the time, etc, then after 3 years saving up cash and got better pc, but still, not convince to buy it, but, its on the big sale, so why not try, and then im shocked this game run smoothly and the story on a ok side, but still good, the combat mechanic feels like youre a real person not counterkill instant, when outnumbered run or die, and the stealth really good but lack of whistle mechanic hoping in the future they add whistle, but still lacking of multiplayer its because of small player base and the bad review, so hopefully the community could revive this game from the junk yard.PS  if you want to play this game, you need to download Uplay first, because the uplay come from steam are the older version, so it makes the game unplayable.
