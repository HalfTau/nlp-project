Having played through and completed all previous AC games, it was a given that I was going to pick up and play this game. After the timbershivering fun provided by AC4, this has proved to be something of a letdown despite or perhaps because of returning to a more classic Assassins Creed template.Revolutionary Paris is a great setting, and the streets are more crowded than ever before. But there are so many things to do  It is impossible to see Paris on the game map through all the objectives and collectibles. And for what exactly? The Detective sidequests were a nice new addition but beyond that, they crowd out the map and drown out the plot.The plot is standard fare for AC shadowy figures, betrayals, and reversals but has its moments with some exciting setpieces setting fire to a grain silo, timetravelling through France. A welcome return is the ability to direct the assassination missions yourself. Run in and stab someone? Bribe a servant to leave a window open? Create a distraction with a cart of fireworks? Your choice.I would finish by saying that this game is probably better than Assassins Creed III  but it is just so damn buggy. Glitching and crashing all over the place. So very frustrating. If you are someone who must play every AC game, then nothing I say is going to stop you. If youre a fan but can wait, I would wait to see if AC Syndicate is any better first.
