When the game first came out and I finished my first playthrough, this piece of crap wasnt Assassins Creed Unity, it was Assassins Creed Beta just like Betafield 4. Ill never forgive this game for tainting the franchise and giving me the second most frustrating gaming experiences because of bugs and glitches next to Sonic 06. Now after replaying the game after its been patched a year later, honestly its one of the better games in the series. There are still occasional glitches here and there but nothing you cant handle. The game itstelf is packed with content and so much to do post story. I love the setting and concept but the plot to me was weak. Its okay but it felt lacking with a very disappointing ending. Arno feels like a poor excuse for Ezio but I still like him more than a lot of other characters in the series. The air assassinations are still frustrating for me but little things like that are found in different variations of the Creed series. I spent hours getting every collectable and finishing all of the coop missions having fun through the whole thing except on my first run which felt awful. Now that this game has been patched and the deadkings dlc is free, This game overall is alright, I recommend it. Its no longer the piece of crap I played a year ago. The story and lacking of a strong character plus a sour ending hurts it, but the core gameplay and extra features made it easy to pour 80 hours. 7/10
