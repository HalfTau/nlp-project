I dont get why people hate this game so much ...The only thing I disliked was the story.But they fixed most of the bugs, I had almost none so far after 60hrs play time, The graphics are amazing, its fun to walk and climb around since they improved the parkour part a lot, you get a ton of different weapons and clothes, I enjoyed the coop stuff, and theres a huge map with a lot of buildings to enter without loading screens.To me its one of the best Assassins Creed games.
