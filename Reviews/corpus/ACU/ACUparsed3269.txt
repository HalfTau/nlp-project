Review for old AC fansProsAmazing stealth mechanics.Deep customization with minor/acceptable limitations.Huge and well made map.Multiple approaches but not as good as promoted.Good graphics if your PC can handle it.Kinda good repeatable coop missions that turns into real solo challenges, especially for stealth gamers.ConsStupid AI, or not as good as it should for hardcore stealth gamers.Forgettable story and campaign Dead Kings DLC not tried yet.Dumb argument.Combat is, indeed, more challenging, but still easy.Phone app forced up yourInitiates.The game itself is NOT good. Please, remember this if youre planning on buying it. Its bad, ok?The memorable yet confusing AC story that we all appreciate is a mayor disappointment in Unity. ONE CANT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE GOD DAMN ENDING!!! Im serious here, by the end it feels like the story never actually moved forward as NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS.Coop is entertaining, but gets old really fast, even with friends. To prolong your experience try doing them solo in stealth, thats when a real challenge kicks in. Therefore, if youre not into stealth be ready to be disappointed as the new combat system also gets old quick, 2 hits with whatever last tier weapon you have, that ALSO youll have quite early in your gameplay, and you got yourself a kill.Nevertheless if youre a hardcore stealth gamers, like me, youll have tons of fun. Unity like no other AC before makes you feel like an actual assassin, allowing you to approach your targets the way you see fit without risking desynchronization. While the AI is not clever enough to feel immersed in the game, they still possess a challenge. Some situations, specially doing a coop mission by yourself, will look impossible, BUT THERES ALWAYS A WAY AROUND IT, you just have to use your brain and all your gadgets. And parkour? Is not only better, is encouraged!My advice? Buy the game when uncle Gave puts it on sale.
