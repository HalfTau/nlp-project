Im a fan of the AC series. With the dissapointment people have with this game, i was hesitant to buy it... But now that i have it... I cant really see why people are so mad. The framerate is fine if you have a decent pc, parkour is improved, is now highly customizeable, great story, fun missions, coop is a blast,  and the new item/weapon system works like a charm. 9.5/10 stoned gamer.
