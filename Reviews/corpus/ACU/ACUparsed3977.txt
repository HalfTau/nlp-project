I love this game, there isnt really lag for me, NOW, but if you cant even get button mashing correct then what the hell? I spent, I am not kidding here, 5 minutes straight pressing E over and over again, only to get the same result. And now I cant advance in the story because of it, I mean what the hell? How can you break a button mashing sequence??????????? Fix the game before your profits EA, I mean Ubisoft
