I started PC gaming in 1981, and this is one of the worst games I have ever played in my life.Loved the graphics, loved Paris, HATED EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT.In fact, this was such an abyssmally unpleasant experience, I could easily write 10,000 words insulting it.Suffice to say, every reason why one might play an AC title, this particular title fails at miserably.Bad parkour. Worse combat. Even worse mission design.Commoditization of character advancement.Flawed game design at the conceptual core.And the game is infested with bugs.Shove a carving fork up your nose youll find that more enjoyable than playing this title.Most players will agree that AC3 sucked, but this game makes that one seem like rapture by comparison.Ive never quit an AC title before in fact, I usually play them to full completion.I couldnt even make it 3/4 of the way through this.Bloody shame I really dug the French Revolution.Ubisoft should be ashamed for AC3.They should be sterilized for this game.
