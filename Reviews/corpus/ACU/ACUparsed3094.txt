Due to the initial bad reviews and issues with the games that was reported, I held off it. With the sale and finally hearing the patches have resolved most of the issues, I bought it. 13 hours in, great graphics, good story, no issues so far. I give it 7/10. Downside, Initiates still down, agent management is done only from app and not ingame.
