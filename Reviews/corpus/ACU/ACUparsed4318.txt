Extremely disappointed. To start, I have a decent computer with 16g ram, nvidia 660, amd quad core processore. Before you even get to the game, THE MAIN MENU LAGS.  The cursor is a good second and a half behind the mouse movement. The menu arrows are annoyingly small to try and lower the video quality. Even after setting the quality to low, the game hiccups ever 510 seconds and then the camera moves to a completely different angle when it recovers.
