This is the year that Ubisoft can now change their name to StuttersoftUPDATE 12/20/2014If you plan on getting this for the sale wait, Patch 4 made the game worse so please save yourself the trouble and wait until they get this thing out of early access.Do not buy this lackluster port, it is purely garbage. Ubisoft should be ASHAMED for shipping this game out in a broken state.
