Full of glitches, but if you can play past them its a very enjoyable game. The story for me anyway was intense and made me want to finish it to see what happends. Not going to spoil it, but if you are a true Ac fan, this game is for you. Once patched, it will become way more enjoyable and popular. And BTW, on certian missions id get a decent amount of framm rate glitching and about 1524 fps. But I still beat the main story, so deal with it for now. Anyway, this is one of my favorite games of 2014. 8/10 for now, once they fix the crashes and other issues, ill redo my review...
