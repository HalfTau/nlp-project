A lot of reviews are based off of a good framerate. Well i have a GTX 760 and i7quad core processor and i can not hold above 25 steadily even with the absolute lowest settings on all graphics options. Wasted my money on this game. Do not buy unless you have above the forementioned graphics card and maybe not even then. Now besides Tech issues, i have played all the assassins creeds and been disappointed since revelations. The games seem to go back and forth from good story and bad gameplay or vice versa. Black flag did not have a true assassins creed story but the gameplay was great, aside from a few glitches. Unity has the amazing back story i have been waiting for, but the gameplay has gone towith 3 different types of currency for you to try and collect for an rpg element that is not and should not be Asssassins creed.
