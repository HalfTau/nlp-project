Oh wow... People are having so many troubles with this game. Everyone told me that I will not be able to run it on my laptop, but they were wrong. Yes, the graphics are low, but its still playable. I have not experienced any bugs so far. Sometimes the freerun mechanics do get a bit weird but it is not THAT bad.I still believe this is a great game. I love the customization of your own Arno, I liked the coop and the story feels good for me. It does somehow remind of the ACII back in the day but with a lot more features.I have a Lenovo Y500 laptop with two Geforce GT 650Ms in SLI, i73630QM  2.4 GHz, 8 GB RAM, Win 8.1 64bit.
