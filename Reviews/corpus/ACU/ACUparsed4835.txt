Main reason to not recomend this game is that they have disabled combat in the game unless im attaced first. I hope this is a bug but as of the posting of this i literly cant attack anything unles they attack me first. Even if i should draw my weapon to scare them. And they dont even support ANYTHING in the way of graphic cards. Put it all on low and still lags. And i know my system can handel it fine. Im a fan of the AC games. But wont support devs when they work hard at preventing the player to do what he/she likes to do. Heard that there is loads of bugs in the game but had personally not encounterd any at this point. And have curently played 4 hours at the time of posting this. A developer should be working WITH the fans NOT against them! And launching a game knowing thats its buggy and broken isent cool. And its not cool to pay full price for it ether. Paying 60 Euro for a broken, buggy and unfinished game isent ok to me. Even less so for a consol port.
