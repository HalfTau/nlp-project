Assassins creed Unity has failed to empress. Especially on P.C. lots of us were really siked about this game, but it ended up as a big dissapointment. Nothing has improved from the previose problems in the previose games, and its not just for the p.c version. They said that they improved the parkour engine, but I think that its a lot worse. The game does not look as pretty in the p.c version as it is in the console version. The story in assassins creed games used to be very good, but now they are repetitive and so boring. There is no twists or anything interesting and uniqu about this game. Samething goes for the other assassins creed games that are AFTER Assassins Creed 3!
