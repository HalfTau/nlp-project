I own every one of the traditional Assassins Creed games, from the first one right through Unity. I also tend to complete nearly every game I purchase. Im not a 100 completionist, but I always finish at least the main story campaign and usually all side missions unless I ultimately dont enjoy the game.Nearly a year later and I still have yet to complete Unity. After each game bringing new and interesting features, Unity feels like a step backward in terms of setting and game mechanics. The improve free running system where you can influence whether Arno moves upwards or downwards during free run is a great addition. But after the addition of the Brotherhood, then hunting and crafting, and finally with the amazing sailing ship combat in 24, this feels like a stale return to the original AC2.The time sink mobile app interdependency is also an anvil around the neck.I have also been hoping for a change of scenery. Unity just feels like weve been there and one that before, 4 times now. I hate to say it, but between Unity, and the decision to set the next game in yet another European city setting has absolutely killed my interest in this series.I truly hope a day comes where Assassins Creed will provide innovation and imaginative settings once again. Until then, its back to the AC2 trilogy, AC3, and AC4 for me.
