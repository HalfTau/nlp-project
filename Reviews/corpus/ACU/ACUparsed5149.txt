Here is the reality of ubisoft new and totally not overhyped featuresNew combat system, 50/50 battle between lag and frame rate when online, enemies are easy spam left click and press e or spacebar when colours flash.coop, best part is when my friends and i cant attack, get stuck in walls and cant revive eachother.new unlockable content, 60 is locked unless you go on ubisofts wild ride and download apps, sign up for initiates and use there not yet unlocked club competition.microtransactions, If you even considered doing it for a second ubisoft did its job.Controlled decent, more like controlled dissapointment.overall great game would reccomend 10/10
