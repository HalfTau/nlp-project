I didnt buy the game since I heared it wasnt running well. But since it was 50  of and I read about steams refund policy I tought I give it a shot. And Im very pleased. Beatiful game, gives me the real AC games feeling, which I havnt had since AC2. I only have a GTX 660 but can run it at around 40 FPS on high. Dont know what the big fuss is all about, really.
