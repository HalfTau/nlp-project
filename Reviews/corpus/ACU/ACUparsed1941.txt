Have you ever paid someone to kick you in the testacles when that isnt your fetish?Thats kinda what buying this game feels like.I keep starting it over and over from the beginning since it was released, yet still have never finished it because I keep stopping out of boredom.I also despise being forced into multiplayer to get items and skill points.Also, why is it that Im in one year, then do a multiplayer that jumps 4 years ahead, then Im back in the previous time. Shouldnt these multiplayer missions unlock when Arno reaches that year on his own instead of jumping me all over outside of the story? It muddles things up.This is the game that made me give up on the AC series.
