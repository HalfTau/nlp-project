This game has a lot of unnessecary hate, even after the patches Ubisoft made to improve the games stuttering and FPS issues. I have a Nvidia GTX 970 4 GB VRAM and an ivy bridge i5 alongside 8 gb of ram and the game runs smoothly pretty much everywhere on very high settings, I will admit the storyline isnt a breakthrough but half the time it doesnt matter too much because youll be too busy unlocking the map and fighting guards/enemies, stealthily assassinating your foes and getting money with points.They have almost completely nailed the customisation, it is so hard to just get one piece of equipment that will match your standards between stealth, hp, melee and ranged. The enemies are a bit easy once you get your setup correct to your standards, armour and weapons will just be finishing foes in seconds, so the enemies are slightly too easy...Finding multiple ways to your enemies is a satisfying way of assassinating your target whether you are completing the challenges in the mission or just tanking your way through giant crowds of enemies it is always a fun and satisfying way of completing the mission no matter your playstyle, the customisation helps with this A LOT!!Anyway as a verdict I give this game a 7 1/2 out of 10 because this game has a lot of potential to work towards and the workers at Ubisoft are trying hard and the fanbase is really not helping out with this very much because of what happened in the past, GET OVER IT AND HAVE FUN WITH THE GOOD BITS OF THE GAME!!!
