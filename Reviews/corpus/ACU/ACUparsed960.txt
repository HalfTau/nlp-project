Worth it even at current nonsale price.I have a good system and run the game fine. Having aquired the game a bit later and after patches I actually have found few bugs.I admit that I was so used to the AC style of controls that I found the combat hard and frustrating and put the game down for a while. After coming back to it and actually watching some videos of people playing missions I began to get more comfortable with the new controls. After a while I began to get it and the combat became some of my favourite in the whole series.I loved the Rome of Brotherhood and Instanbul of Revelations in particular. Paris of the Revolution, however, is fantastic. It the busiest and most enagaging of all of the cites so far. The mechanic where you get creed points used for upgrades by completeing the random crowd events kept me wanting to jump in and make things right. The parkour animations are stunning and having a means to descend easily is a vast improvement.The coop was no real draw for me as I am too old and too cranky to play with snotty nosed twerps online, Stll, being able to play the missions in solo mode was a good thing.If you want AC to stay the same you wont like this. If you like the AC genre and dont mind a little evolution this may be just your thing. The worst in the series? No way. Play the first one again and see just how clunky it is. How boring was colonial America? Two kinds of buildings and no real cities. Paris is huge and interesting. Full of buildings you can move through as well as climb. Huge crowds give the streets a life unlike any other in the series.Besides, you can set the language to French and have English subtitles. Having everyone on the streets speaking French gave this game the most immersive feel to me.
