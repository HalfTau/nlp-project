While I didnt have severe issues as a lot of the people, ocassional frame loss and Arno doing whatever he pleases was more common than it should have been.Its not a polished game at all.The game itself is ok, not great. The story is not that great and the missions are decent, but the problem is movemnet in the game is not fluid at all. Most actions characters do have the impact a couple of seconds later, its extremely annoying. Overall not fun, even when game is not having severe issues.
