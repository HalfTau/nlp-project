I waited a long time for the fixes promised after the terrible release.  I never noticed a difference in performance when they were released.  But I still played quite a bit, despite the literally forgettable story I honestly cant remember any details of the plot, because climbing buildings and stabbing people still has its charms.  The final straw was when I decided to try out the Dead Kings DLC.  The opening movie just cuts out a few seconds in and then starts with the main character standing on a table, unable to move.  Not even the menu key works, so I have to force stop the game.  Because there is no way to move on from here, I am uninstalling this game and never returning.
