This game is very poorly optimized. I am able to run Witcher 3 at mediumtohigh settings at a solid 50 fps, while here I had to lower settings below medium to achieve stable 30 fps. Add on to that stuff like inability to easily start a new game, horrendous menu that actually somehow lowers the fps and poor controls and really, why would you want to bother with this when there are so many much better games out there.
