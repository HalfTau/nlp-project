After playing AC brotherhood, revelations, III, IV ... I really thought that the series are dead. They were so repetitive and story was always soooo boring. Gameplay terrible except ship battles. Now after playing Unity there is hope. I really enjoyed everything about the game and cant wait to play syndicate. I knew it has bad launch but now after two yeaars I was playing it on mobile GTX960 on hight without any bugs or fps issues
