Despite having only a GT 745M Graphics Card,I can run this game at High without lagging and have experienced crashes here and there, but an amazing game nontheless. Would reccomend, but id probably wait a few patches. Only major problem is that i cant even get online, but I can do the coop missions alone, so.
