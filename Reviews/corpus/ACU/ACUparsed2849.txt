great game so far till i got to the boss fight at the church where you fight your mentor but hay as soon as they patch that and we can get past it and finish the game it will be perfect in my book but as of right now i give it 5 out of 10 once i get passed that part it will go up a number and the ending and story line from there will make it go up or down
