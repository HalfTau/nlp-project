Im very sorry to have to write that this game isnt at all a good game. The plot is too short, there are a lot of early bugs and the optimization is horrible. The new freerunning thing is great, but its a bit too buggy. The only good thing is the multiplayer, which is cleverly put into the singleplayer. It would have been better if the missions could be played in chronological order so that when you are playing the game, it would put the players in the same category, missions could be more challenging and more mixed in the story.I would not recommend this game. Yet. I have no outstanding issues with performace since I run it on under the minimum requirements. If the game would be more optimized I could probably run this 30 Fps not max 25.6/10 would play through and probably try to get some side missions too.
