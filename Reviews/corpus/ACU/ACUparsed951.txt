It is not often that I take the time to review a game. But this game is an amazing piece of art, I must say. I played other A.C. games from this series. I very much liked AC Rogue, which is as excellent, if not even better. But as a European, I am amazed by the Detail that the city of Paris is depicted in, the songs sung in the streets, the revolutionary Paris, with all its factions and the historic persons I have met in the game. If you have any interest at all in the historic period of the french revolution with its exciting events and the beginnings of the modern society, then this is your musthavegame. The main story and many side missions are neatly woven into the real historic events.This game will let you travel freely through the streets of Paris and other places around like Versailles. I met Mongolfier, La Place, Robespierre, and other revolutionary people from siences, arts and politics. This game has amazed me a lot by just walking in the streets and watching the people, or jumping from rooftop to rooftop and enjoy the beautiful baroque architecture and Paris landmarks.If the game wasnt as bloody and gory I would give it to my children to get a feeling of the late 18th century. But unfortunately, this game is as brutal, ruthless and murderous as the rest of the series. You basically spend most of the time backstabbing guards, poisoning enemies or simply shooting other people to death. Only in a game, that this activity can yield so much fun and entertainment. Job well done, worth every single penny I spent.
