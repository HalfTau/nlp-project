Although AC Unity is known for its terrible launch it is now playable. The parkour system which is introduced in Unity which is also used in Syndicate is really helpful. This game is not very well optimized compared to other games. My R9 390 can only run the game on max at 40fps. Coop is fun and the stealth is better than previous games because dont have to continuously hide in bushes and shrub. Overall this is a good game especially when its on sale, but I probably wouldnt purchase it for its full price
