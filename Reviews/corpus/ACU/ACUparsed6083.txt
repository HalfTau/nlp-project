Great game so far and no major graphics or gameplay issues if you have a decent computer and a compatable video card/drivers. There are some of the usual graphics glitches that are around on launch day, but most of them arent immersion breaking since many texture loading issues seem like they fit the plot.I am having a lot of fun since I set it all at max settings. Sometimes the graphics look a little less than perfect next to photorealistic graphics in some areas, but again this doesnt really break anything or mess with immersion.Everyone complaining about the game not working should consider that it is their computer, not the game.Something that IS broken though, is the Uplay store, which seems to break at the launch of every game and then is fixed after a couple days.Sungod
