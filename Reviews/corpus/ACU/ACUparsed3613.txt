I like this game alot yea it had issues when it came out but they fixed it and now the game is amazing and yes it does cost you to have a beast computer but its worth it. what i mainly liked about this game was the new free running it was all nice and cooler looking and the fighting style was good because you didnt auto kill someone you have to try alittle harder then usual from the other assassins creeds. what i really hated about the other assassins creed games was the multilplayer.... i really hated the multiplayer it was boring and stupid. i been waiting for them to make a coop multiplayer because it makes it more fun to play the game with your friends. what makes the multiplayer great is that you got to have good teamwork to do missions and the missions get more challenging depending on how many players are with you. this is by far my favorite assassins creed game. buy this game people now that they fixed the game but 1 last thing remember if your computers not a beast then i recommend you dont get this lol but for the people who do have a beast computer go for this game!
