Love the AC franchise all these years and thus bought the game. Storyline is awesome but does not entirely focus on templars vs assassins. Its a solid campaign elevated by quality assassination missions. Expect low and choppy framerates if your card is not high end but it was playable for me. Patches fix most of the bugs that was encountered in the early launch. Customisation is awesome as each assassin is unique. Coop is fun with friends but not so with public as for obvious reasons Mass killings for no reason . However, playing coop will cause my computer to freeze so i think that needs fixing.So all in all, if your a fan of AC, just go for it but bear with the bugs for the time being.7/10
