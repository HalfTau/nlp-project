I had seen the bad reviews of other users and thought that people were bitter with Assassins Creed. Okay, there would be some bugs, but people have shouldve entered the game in a more immersive way and not focus on simple things that could be ignored if the game was good. Such naivette.When I started playing the game was smooth, the story line was quite good and I noticed that they wanted to create a likeable character such as Ezio. However, as the game progressed, we move from our first palace to a more vast area, thus overcharging the game. It starts, more and more, to lag, lowering your capabilities to play in a fluid way.As I have a good computer that alowed me to play any game I wanted without lag, I was really upset, but as I like the game series, I made an effort to play it with the minimum graphics, just for the fun of the plot and the gameplay. My frustration couldnt be bigger as I noticed that lowering the graphics to the minimum changed almost nothing to the FPS problem. The only way to lower the FPS was when I look to the ground or the sky.What infuriates more is that the game is in this state, unpolished, and they are working on the next game, realising content and videos for the next Assassins Creed. Ubisoft, has just lost a very dedicated consummer. I doubt Ill ever play another game from them. And heed my warning, neither should you. At least wait some time after the release and see the reviews. I ignored the reviews and now i feel as if I was tricked.
