I feel insulted for buying this, and Ubisoft should feel ashamed for releasing it. I keep hoping someone will find the hidden line of code that says this is PC  Who cares. but everyday I am disappointed. Seeing as how that hasnt happened yet, it seems like Ubisoft has learned their lesson from WatchDogs.If only they would put as much work into making a finished product as they would falsely advertising a multimedia E3 engine and deleting the line of code that lets the game run as it should...but that would be the right thing to do.Dont buy it. Dont waste your time. Dont embarrass yourself.Ubishit strikes again.
