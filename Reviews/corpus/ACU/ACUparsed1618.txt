Dont write often but considering the history of issues this game had, figured I would.All the launch problems such as bugs and glitches are, in my experience at least, gone. I have put in 13 hours now and have encountered no issues or bugs.Further the combat is alot of fun and I love I can pick one of six different weapon styles. A lot of customization too for your character with gear and skills. And, whats more, the online gameplay missions are fun and the sync when with other players is good. Furhter the ciy is dense! The crowds are great and the city is amazing. I keep being amazed at how MANY buildings you can go into. Its nuts. This is probably the first open world game where Ive been able to walk into so many buildings.Overall, I was a little apprehensive about getting this game at first. But I am loving it so far and if you are on the fence, I say take the leap hehe. I did and dont regret it.
