Another Assassins Creed game but with enhanced game play. This game adds skills which are unlocked by leveling up, which helps you build up your character. Stealth is a more important part of the game as enemies can be much harder to defeat in one on one combat. The story was quite bland and mediocre which was a little disappointing.RatingsStory 4/10Game play 8/10Missions 6.5/10Overall 6/10
