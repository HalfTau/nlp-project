Okay let me be one of the first to talk about the game and not its crashes or whatever. I havent had any of the problems other people are having. Except some minor shuttering and textures popping up. Lucky me So far, the game is very fun.Movement is so much better than previous games. Will sometimes be a little sticky near objects.The combat, I think, is a lot better because there are harder and harder enemies. Rather than throwing a smoke and getting an infinite killchain, you have to actually use the parry, dodge, heavy attacks, and your abilities as well.The added stealth button and cover system are amazing additions.Customization is great too. Makes you feel unique and each piece has meaning to it, rather than just for looks. And because of this, money actually means something!Im not that far into the story so I cant really talk about that. But what I can say is that I like where its going and I like Arno.All in all, if you dont have these PC problems like crashing, shuttering, or whatever is happening, this is so far the best AC yet.
