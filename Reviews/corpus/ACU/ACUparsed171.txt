I LOVE DIFFICULT GAMES!! this is insanely hard on any difficulty you can playwhile the fights are pretty much 2 buttons and the stealth is easy to achieve , this game is HARD AFThere is no way to play for more than 10 minutes , LITERALY my pc freezes Which is amazing i see what the developers did , they tried to make a unique game , they wanted to make you win not with gaming skills and try , but with a Monster Huge RoomFilling PC to run this without lag spikesLag Spikes hm .. it seems like it could be an anime I was playing peacefuly and without fear , but everything changed when lag spikes attacked my pc , it made my Arno unmovable , unable to do attack , or jump , once we saw it happen we knew.. we knew we had to press start and go to Restart Last Checkpoint10/10 unironicaly ironicaly oh i forgot to say , to play with less problems i had to Disable internet adapter and launch everything offlineEDITJust download Ragnos1997 Patch and it works like a normal game
