Its sad to see the AC franchise failing due to the company behind it Ubisoft.For me, ACU is completely playable and has entertained me for many, many hours. I am not one of those unlucky ones where the game does not even start properly or needs frequent reinstalls just to play again. Unlucky like my brother, who upgraded his PC to the recommended Ubisoft specs to play ACU, but ever since the DLC his game just crashes and dies. Meanwhile, after a few weeks, Ubisoft support simply has not responded at all to his support ticket.Its sad to see the DLC, which is given out for free and was meant as making good for all the bugs and issues ACU has had so far, has completely broken down someones game. After trying all of the advice on the AC forums to get his game working again, my brother simply uninstalled the game and has lost interest in AC alltogether. It seems lost my AC buddy. Thanks alot, Ubisoft.Meanwhile I noticed ingame that the new DLC weapons cant even be equipped after unlocking them. You simply cant use them at all. Whats up with that?...So, would I recommend this game?I would want to, but not for its current price. The amount of bugs and issues this game is having simply doesnt warrant a top of the line price. Meanwhile, all Ubisoft has shown its AC community this far are consistent fckups and this game is still nowhere near running without problems. Im really dissapointed that Ubisoft still manages to interfere and hinder everything that ACU has to offer. The game has great potential, but Ubisoft seems unable to release it.
