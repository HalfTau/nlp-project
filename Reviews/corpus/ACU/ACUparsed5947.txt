I feel very bad for the people getting all the bugs. I had a couple, before i upating my drivers and now i am playing it very enjoyably. The new parkour feels very fuid, and the combat system as well feels very nice. It has many aspects of the older games,  obviously  while very well managing to make itself unique. I recomend this game very well, but only if you have the recomended requirements and higher.
