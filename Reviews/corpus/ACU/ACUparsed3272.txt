You have destroyed a big game. The worst of the worst of the saga. I stay at least with Black Flag. Here, slow battles, whom has introduced this system has to get fired because I thoroughly enjoyed the previous chapters and this system is not even the shoe sole of his predecessors. Full of bugs, devoid of a good story and gameplay. I will not think bad, but it seems that money is calling you more than the satisfaction of your players. Both love and appreciation for everything that Ubisoft have earned to me, today has decremented to the point of never buy a Ubi game without having studied in depth analysis by millions of players.
