MY ASSASSINS CREED UNITY EXPERIENCEOk so this was my VERY first ever AC game in my life.. Okay so I wanted to get this game since the trailer came out because this game caught my eye. First of all I thought it would have horrible optimazations just like WatchDogs. I was planning to get this game because it looked AMAZING!The day it came out I read the reviews and they were negative because of optimazations and I was dissapointed about that. Ubisoft really needs to fix this because so many people bought this game to get a crappy game..come on Ubisoft get your game together. Anyways, I was dumb enough to buy it after I heard bad reviews about it. I just had to get the game. I bought it and I was worried about it crashing or whatever. But..I was that 5 of people who their game acually worked! I luv this game so much already..VERY INTERESTING GAME! Just love it!!Ubisoft fix this issue to those other gamers who bought your game because this really left a mark for AC Unity and thats a shame. It really is a good game, it really is but there bad optimazations to it.Btw I can run this game on high graphics but i prefer medium bc it faster Here are my pc specsRadeon HD 78508gb RamFX 8320 3.8 GHzWindows 7 Ultimate64 bit system
