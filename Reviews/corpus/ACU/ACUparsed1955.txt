I bought this game several days ago during lunar year sale. I read many negative reviews about ACU, and it is , in my opinion,  not comparable to even AC BF. Besides I am running on WIN 10 and the game crashes every 1015 mins just like what many others are complaining about.HOWEVER, I am a bit more patient and managed to find a way to prevent it from periodly CRASHING. So i decide to post a review for those still seeking a way to fix ACU stops working...The crash may be caused by a dll file located in C drive by default. Simply search XAudio27.dll in C drive and rename all found dll files to something like  XAudio27.dll.bak  OR cut and paste those to somewhere else. Run ACU again and you should be fine.There are some other ways to prevent crashing such as run UPlay in offline mode, which i didnt even try. Many said offline mode do works, however it disables achievements and multiplayer, etc.In a word, it is still playable, although buggy. You can still finish the storyline before moving on to rogue and syndicateMore details can be found in this post found in Microsoft Answers
