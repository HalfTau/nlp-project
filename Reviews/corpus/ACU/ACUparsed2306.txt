Really, Ubisoft? I got this as a Christmas gift and Ive played the rest of the series. Its been out for quite some time and just getting to the point were everything opened up for the first time, basically just past the tutorial, I encountered no less than three instances were I had to restart to get past a game breaking bug. Wow...just...wow...I love this series, but there is no way I am going to put up with this sort of crud to play this game.
