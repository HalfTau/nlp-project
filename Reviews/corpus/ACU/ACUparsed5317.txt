My specsCPU Intel i5 4460, 3.2 GhzGPU AMD Radeon R9 270X OCRAM 8GB DDR3.I have waited the whole year for this game, since the trailer and it was worth waiting, and worth the money I paid for it. I had some doubts when Ive read most of the reviews but I am glad I didnt take it in consideration. Those who complain, most likely have wooden PCs or the pirate version is messed up.I can run the game on HIGH settings and I have an I5, 3.2ghz CPU and a R9 270X.So. My advice is, do NOT take the bad reviews in consideration, its either pirated version of the game or wood computers, THE GAME IS WORTH IT!About the game, its more than other ACs, besides an awesome story I barely started, there are loads of sidemissions, such as murder casefiles. And the coop is brilliant, epic, legendary, call it however you want.For the third and last time, DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE WHO SAY THE GAME ISNT GOOD, that is false, I run it on i5 4460 and AMD Radeon R9 270X, high settings.
