I cannot recommend this game since its pretty much similar to the first Assassins Creed game ever, where Altair had to go from one person to another killing them to know their secrets and the other persons behind them.Very short and the only difference it had compared to altairs story was Eliese, story about avenging someones death, not about the Creed or the Assassins, matter of fact Arno doesnt even run into any assassins who are wearing full Assassins custumes except guards in the Assassins hideout.bugs are in all the Assassins Creed games, it never really bothered me, cause story line would always get into me no matter what, except this one, Eliese was a good touch just not good enough..Ubisoft should learn from previous games not copy them.
