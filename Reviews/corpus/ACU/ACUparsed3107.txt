Well... I checked all the negative reviews and thought sod it. Its half price on Steam so i went for it. Played it on both low and Ultra settings and apart from the glitchy UBSoft logo intro, the game plays very well on my system. I have an ASUS 7970 Direct 11 card which seems to like this game. I cant see all the problems players are having. Maybe im just lucky. 15/09/2015  Utter rubbish. The controls are non responsive and all over the place. Gameplay is boring and lack lustre. Waste of money. The worst Assassins Creed ever. No more please.
