TL/DR An excellent AC game that suffered from an abysmal launch, but which is fairly playable at this point.The story of Unity is nothing special, but fully adequate. One doesnt necessarily play AC for the story anyway, but it carries along nicely from the more recent games.Its pretty easy to get around. My one complaint involves getting down from a roof. Arno simply doesnt like it, no matter how many times you push the buttons, causing me to constantly look for alternative, nonlethal jumps.Of course, theres still that My assassin is an idiot feel when you are running down the street and suddenly jump onto an urn someone left behind, sitting there perched like an imbecile. You jump off, but instead of landing on the ground, you make a magnificent leap onto a bench across the street. Jumping from the bench, you now grab onto the beams over a doorway. Arno, you idiot. I just want to be on the fricking ground!Combat is fairly nice and responsive, but somewhat repetitive. You mostly just swing, parry, etc.Stealth is difficult, as the AI can see you in the most unlikely way. Still, successfully going stealthy will usually make your life easier, although in most instances you can get caught and just slaughter everyone, regardless.Coop is a blast. You can do free roam together and there are quite a lot of coop quests. Some of these list as being for 4 players, but weve handled all of them with just 2. You continue to get rewards for completing coop quests even after youve done them a time or two.Its highly unlikely that you will get 60fps on Ultra. I have a 980m with 16 gb of RAM and a 3.,5 ghz processor and get about 45. Medium graphics still look nice. Low graphics look...awful.I havent encountered any bugs.
