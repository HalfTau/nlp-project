just a buggy piece of trash terribly optimized and its glitched beyond belief, I actually bought this game on console because i was really hyped for this game and I thought it would work fine without all the lag because back then i had a  computer it did run fine on my console but it was still buggy and it had a boring story line and the multiplayer missions could be xploited so easily you could make all the money you ever need in the game in a couple of hours.BAD GAME avoid it
