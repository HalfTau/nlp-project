This game is great and I dont know what people are talking about when they say they have FPS problems. I have anI74790k and a GTX 760 superclocked acx graphics card. Im running everything on high with no problems what so ever. Gameplay is a lot harder and I love it. You cant take on 20 people at a time like other assassins creed games because this is more realistic. I definitely recommend this game.
