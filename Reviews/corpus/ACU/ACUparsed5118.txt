Awsome game, with built in coop in free roam aswell as coop missions makes this one of the best games of the year for me. Combat is a touch unforgiving and the graphics are amazing. yes the game is poorly optimized but even with this, at high graphics i still manage 4560 fps with an amd 7870 at 1920x1080.With that said I have run into a few bugs that have caused me to fall out of the world forcing me to exit and reenter, but even with that, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the series.
