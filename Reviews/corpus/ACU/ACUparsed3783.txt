once  there was a man, who wants to play an open world where you can kill people stealthily, ALAS he found AC. he played ALL the AC series, even the stand alone ones. After playing all the AC games, he found out that theres a new AC coming out, called the ASSASSINS CREED UNITY. To much excitement, he used his visa to load to his steam wallet and bought the game. whilst downloading, he thought to himself  this must be better than all of the AC games cause it came back to its original theme which is in the city killing people. after a seemingly endless download, he clicked play. it started, fortunatley for him. but then the main menu comes.. he had just bought a new comnputer, costs no more than 4000, it has extreme graph card and stuff, but he wondered why the main menu lagged balls. he then click the play button and starts the game, to much surprise, he couldnt move his character, why? cause of the lagginess. he then turned of the game and waited.. waited waited.AFTER 4 months, he came back to the game to see if there was any fix. but none, none changed the lagginess of the game. he became a sad sad man. so sad that he had to write a thrid person story for a review. dont be like this man. this man has done it, the biggest mistake after adma and eves.
