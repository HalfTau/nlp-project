Lots of people have been complainging A LOT about performance issues. I run a GTX 760 and an I5 with 8GB RAM which is basically the recommended settings and I run the game fine on high. But nobody can run it on anything higher.The story line and the game in general is a lot worse than the other AC games.You get random glitchy npcs walking up to you and asking you to join your friends game or buy a DLC while youre playing which completely ruins immersion. and microtransactions?! Really ubi? !.Sometimes you spend an hour or so getting to an awesome chest just to find out that you HAVE TO DOWNLOAD SOME ING APPLCATION OR SOMELIKE THAT TO USE IT.No recommended until ubi fixes it and realizes it doesnt need money THAT much.
