I very like the game, especially the story line and the history background you ve chosen. However, before patch5, I can have a fps around 25, and after patch 5 it goes  down to 20 or less under same graphic setting. My laptop is 3610QM670M, and the setting I used are 1080P and medium.builtin option I want to get good graphics and 25fps is enough for me to play the game. I would recommend this game if u have an outstanding gamming pc. 980 or higher PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM WE JUST WANT TO PLAY THE UNITY NOT THE VICTORY OR SOMETHING ELSE!
