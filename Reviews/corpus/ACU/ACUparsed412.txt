A piece of garbage. Just every single aspect of it. Gameplay is painfully bad. Every improvement since AC 1 was stripped and replaced with either nothing, or a single mechanic that doesnt work. Graphics and optimisation? poor. Storytelling? Id rather spend 20 hours reading through toddler bedtime stories than go through this disjointed ing mess.As plain as possible every minute in this game will contain something that frustrates you.
