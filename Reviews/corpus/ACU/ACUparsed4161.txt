Okay, Ive read a lot of hate for this game, and would like to throw my voice in.First Im going to state my honest opinion.I like this game.I think it is a step in the right direction for the franchise.I dont think its as good as Black Flag, but it improves on many aspects of it.Note that Ive played many AC games on my Xbox, but this is the first for my PC, therefore I cant comment on controls.First off Pros Fluid and interesting parkourInteresting storyline, I recommend you read the official novel while playing, as it helps to flesh out the characters a lot.Lots of side misssionsI think its wonderful that the side missions all have historical links to real lifeStory missions are a return to the franchises roots you get a feeling that youre building up to the big assassination at the end of the sequence. Coop is very fun, yet there are often problems with matchmaking which Ubisoft are working to fix THE STEALTH SYSTEM. The stealth mechanics in this game are amazing, as this game has lacked a dedicated crouch button for ages. Mission design. Assassination missions are MASSIVE with dozens of ways to get to your target, completely nonlinearly.Cons Buggier than Black Flag. I havent had any major bugs, but others have. The worst Ive seen are coop bugs due to                     connection, however Im used to that in my country. I have confidence that Ubisoft will work hard to fix bugs quickly and effectively. Stickyness to walls and objects is often infuriating during chase missions but this has been around since the first game. I cant remember how long the sequences were in the past games, but the ones in unity are generally 3 missions long. I very much enjoyed the outoftheanimus firstperson missions in Black Flag, but they are not present in Unity I think theyre in Rogue, though I do not like the replacement for these missions, being the Server Bridge where you are transported to a different time period of Paris 14th century, WW2, etc. because although I liked seeing Paris in different ages the gameplay was a bit arcadeySo there you go, my review for Assassins Creed Unity. I enjoyed it a lot more than Brotherhood, Revelations and AC3Now, I assume my review is going to be downvoted to hell by haters, but at least I wrote it.9 out of 10
