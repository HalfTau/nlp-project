I think Unity gets too much hate. Many people, especially PC gamers say its the worst game in the franchise, but I really liked it.ProsGorgeous graphics and big beautiful cityIntroduced the AC games to crouchingIntroduced the AC games to free running downwardsCombat is fun and challengingCustomization is amazingFun and challenging storyPlenty of side quests and things to do once youve completed the gameConsThere are some glitchesIf you want to get a suit or weapon or piece of armor thats expensive the game forces you to grind for hours if you dont want to spend real moneyIn conclusion I love Unity and I think its one of the best AC game so far. My opinion might change because I havent play origins yet. I love unity and I recommmend it to you if you have a good computer, I can run Unity at 5060 FPS on highest settings.
