0/10Suffered through literal days of downloading I live in the countryside, only for the game to crash every time i play for any longer than five seconds. Not to mention having to mess around with Uplay, which reguarly doesnt work and consequently locks you out of the game.EDITAfter finally managing to get the game to work, I was expecting something similar to Black Flag  just a little less piratey however, the gameplay has been severely toned down Cant fight with your hidden blade in combat anymore, assassinations only and the story feels utterly hollow.Ubisoft seemed to have been trying to mash together Ezios charm with Altairs moodiness, when making Arno. The only thing the main character makes you feel is satisfaction at when he falls off a rooftop to his death. Arnos reason for joining the assassins are never really explained too much  you kind of get the impression he was just bored. The unlikeable protagonist, and the rest of the twodimensional cast, coupled with a story that has a plot about as coherant as a 90s action movie, will most likely lead to you uninstalling it before even halfway through
