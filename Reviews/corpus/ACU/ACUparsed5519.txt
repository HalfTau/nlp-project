This looks like it has the potential to be a good Assassins Creed game. Unfortunately, I have trouble telling because I cant get past the fourth mission. Does the game crash? Is it too difficult? Is there a bug preventing me from passing? No. The game is just terribly optimized. The framerate is horrendous even at the lowest setting and I dont have a poor PC. The textures have trouble loading, the game freezes, the loading times are terrible, and the game is just overal poorly optimized.If you want to get this game, please wait until the issues have been fixed. As of this moment11/12/14, Ubisoft has said they are working on a patch. It is unknown whether this patch will actually fix everything, or if we will hvae a repeat of WatchDogs, with fans needing to patch the game legitimately.TLDR Looks like a good game. Wait until a good patch comes out or youre gonna have a bad time.
