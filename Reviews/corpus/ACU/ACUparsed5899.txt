I was looking forward to this game a lot. I dont have the best gaming computer Ive got a lowerend laptop, but Ive played all the other games with decent graphics at decent speeds. This is absolutely horrendous. The game has very little graphics options and it lags so much that the game is nearly unplayable. Even for a game like this, like Assassins Creed, the gameplay is horrible. I cant even make it past the tutorial level before I just cant take it anymore.In short. I would not reccomend this game at this stage. If the gameplay and performance issues are not cleared up fairly soon, this game is just getting uninstalled. Waste of money at this point.EDIT From what I saw, the game looks good from a gameplay and not a performance standpoint. If the game is ever fixed, I feel I will really enjoy this game.
