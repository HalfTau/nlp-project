bad graphis flitches and framerate right from the start, then i saw a post mentioning Nvidia drivers then i found this...Ill update if it plays better after graphics updateEdit the graphics card update REALLY made a HUGE difference in the playability of this game. still have large lag spikes occasionally but thats not SO bad. Game was flat unplayable before i updated.
