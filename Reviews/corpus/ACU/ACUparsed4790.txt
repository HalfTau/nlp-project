I have played games in alpha stages more polished that this one and without DRM, I know that Ubisoft is going to fix the technical issues but they deserve a bad rating for releasing a very unfinished product and the Uplay DRM, this truly shows the lack of respect the have for their clients and the fans of this series, Im not going to play this game until it is truly finished and Im never going to trust Ubisoft without a tons of reviews before
