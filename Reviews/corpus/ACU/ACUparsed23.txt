Piece of garbage that is not worth 10 let alone 30. This game offers no good story, and instead focuses on some load of bull focusing on the sage from Assassins Creed 4. The gameplay is atrocious and is extremely inconsistant with the movement and stealth mechanics, what should be polished beyond all belief due to the kind of game this should be. The graphics are great, and thats it. That is literally all this game has going for it. Save your money by not purchasing this game but instead literally any other Assassins Creed game.
