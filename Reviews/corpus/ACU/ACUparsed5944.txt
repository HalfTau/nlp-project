I dont recommend this game in its currrent state 11/11/14There is absolutely no reason this game should run so poorly.The game stutters on medium while I have an AMD 8350 with a slight OC to 4.4GHz, 2 GTX 770s in SLI, 16 Gigs of RAM, and the game installed on an SSD.Ubisoft yet again, fails to have a good release on an Assassins Creed game.I will gladly redo this review once the game is in a playable condition.I feel like I should learn my lesson with Ubisoft games and wait 12 months before buying a  new game from them.Review redone 2/22/16The game seems much better after a few tweaks simply renaming files removes the SLI stutter.  The game still has glitches and bugs but I assume Ubisoft has given up on Unity and moved forth onto Syndicate.Even though the game still has some minor annoyances, the game is finally enjoyable and playable.
