I have played every Single Assassins Creed games, as a fan. Unity i have found more better amazing Graphics and details even compared to later syndicate. I have played already before nonsteam, after few years, i had played again with  a Better Graphic card. Seems, Yea there is a bug alot, you can found and notice in side mission or in Story Mission, But still i ignored and i enjoyed every single time and story. Still seems it will remain always not optimized.Assassins Creed 3 Next will be now Syndicate and later Origins. xD
