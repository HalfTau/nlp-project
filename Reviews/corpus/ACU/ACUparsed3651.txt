Out of all the bad reviews is people complaining about performance issues, I say you look at the recommended PC requirements before you complain about a games lagginess.This game runs absolutely beautifully on teh highest settings on my computer, a little laggy in, and im saying about 20fps or so in the cinematics. The gameplay is glorious, each weapon has its own animations and finishers. The AI is insane and the immersion will keep you playing for hours and hours. I have reached about the 6th section of the city and the combat is intensifying constantly. The addition of long rifles is awesome for when you have a target thats surrounded by 20 guys and  so you can knock them out with ease. The game gives you a constant flood of things to do, when youre done with one thing, you have no problem finding something else to do.All in all, this is the greatest Assassins Creed is have played and i highly recommend it to anyone that meets the PC setting requirements.I got the game on sale for 40 bucks, I would easily buy it for the 60 dollars it is selling for again and again 11/10 an amazing game. and i havent even played coop yet lol.
