absolute worst i cant tell you how many times i raged quit in this game, I bought the game seeing that it would be fun after its been patched for a year now and boy was i wrong, Such potential wasted. the french revolution was rich in history instead we explore hidden tombs in the dlc there was no option to exit the dead kings expantion which lead me to restart my game and Napoleon was just ignored and the character wasnt up to full potential. The controls are terrible making arno climb a wall intead of going down
