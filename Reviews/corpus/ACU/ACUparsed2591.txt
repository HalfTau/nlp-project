Assassins Creed Unity has really dissapointed gamers. At first I thought that all the bugs and framerate issues couldnt be that bad, so i bought it. Worst. Mistake. Ever. At first, the game seems fairly good. You start in a sort of tutorial mission which teaches you most of the mechanics. Then you become an novice assassin and start with some weak gear. You then look at all the things you can customize. Cool! Not really. Most of the items you will probably never acquire throughout the game, due to lack of steady income, unless you fully renovate the Cafe Theater. The main storyline was actually okay, probably one of the only good aspects of this game. I remember the game bugging me and saying that i should upgrade my gear before I started a quest. Yeah, thanks game for reminding me that I have to get better gear with money that I dont have. Paris Stories were awful. Literally no different from one another. Go steal something, go assassinate one guy in the streets etc. ONE GUY. Come on Ubisoft, at least make the paris stories even slightly more interesting or different. You wont come back to this game once the main storyline is finished. Why? because there is absolutley nothing to do. Multiplayer is empty. Noone plays it, so you can forget about that feature entirely. Any side quest there are is usually drab and boring. Overall this is a game which can probably keep you occupied for a short period of time. Its definitely not worth the money. Go get Black Flag and save some money for another game. Seriously its a real shame that the newest AC game is so terrible.
