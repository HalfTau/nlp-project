Worst gaming experience ive had. Crushed my dreams and made hate every single minute i have played.I prereserved this game  like the fool i am, wont do it again and at first it went smooth. Besides the expected control jerkiness at some points and the weird popup effect on crowd and scenery it worked completely fine for me. No framedrops, no bugs. Surely it could be better optimized, making better use of my 24GB RAM and my brand new GTX 970 but it was ok. I even played some coop missions...Then They started patching and fixing the game, leaving me to only be able to play it offline and then they introduced a cheap solution for the LOD  awfully resolved smog al around Paris, like a modern day Hong Kong.Dont buy, make Ubisoft sweat, wait until the unavoidable price drop. I would if i could.PS Also, i really hate the tablet app integration and the initiates  profile that wont recognise my previous efforts on the othe AC titles, paid and played either on PC or PS3.
