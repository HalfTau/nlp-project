Played it for 5 hours first night no problems. Next morning the game wont make it past the Start Menu without crashing. Im running a very high performance PC.  Intel i7 8930K  3,5 GHz 16Gigs of Ram Dual NVidia GeForce GTX 970s for video cards. Sooo yeah...Im going to be getting a refund because Dealing with crashes 20 times on startup is unacceptable.
