Big fan of the AC games since 1 through to BF. However......framerate is terrible and is playing up no matter if I set it to low settings.Theres also still glitches and bugs going on stopping me at times in completing missions.Trying to get a refund as I find it too distracting even though I tried for 4 hours play.
