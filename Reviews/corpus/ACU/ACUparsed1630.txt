I like playing Assassins Creed games. I like playing what I call, collecting games. I like running around cities or places collecting things, doing missions, ect. I have played every Assassins Creed game before this. Black Flag was easily my favorite, with Assassins Creed 3 being a low point for me.I do not like this game. I am not a 100 sure what it is. Could be the crappy framerate I am getting compared to other similar games. It could be that the game feels like it has no substance. You see, in order to push the multiplayer part of the game, the non story missions feel much more shallow than before. You go talk to someone, there is no cutscene, just them talking to you while you stand there. Then you go and do some task for them pick up x, kill y, ect.. That is pretty much it. I couldnt bring myself to continue playing this game.The combat has changed a little bit, it is a little bit harder in a good way, but my camera felt so zoomed in during combat that I would get hit by guys off screen because I couldnt see them so that I could counter them. That was pretty lame.The only innovation I saw was the detective missions where you go and look for clues for a crime in several locations. That is pretty cool.Overall a pretty bland game in my opinion. You are best skipping this entry to the Assassin Creed series.
