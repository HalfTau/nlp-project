The reason I bought the game was to experince how they reflected the ambience of the late 18th century Paris. It was much better than I expected. Eventhough there are not much interactions with NPCs, you cant deny the fact that the city is almost alive.Pros The city is amazing. Landmarks look really gorgeous. Running, jumping animations are not that fluid but once you get use to the controls, you can enjoy the free run. Textures and modelling are quite wellmade. Cutscenes absorb you more and more into the story.Cons Repetitive sidemissions, it gets quite boring after a while. Less sidemission and longer main story could have been much better. Optimization is okay but not as good as Syndicate.Nevertheless, I recommend the game. I did enjoy it and plan to go for another playthrough.
