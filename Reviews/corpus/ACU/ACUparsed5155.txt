What is it with all these comments on people not being able to run the game. Check the minimum requirements people. The game has several bugs none of them rendering the game even close to unplayable. Sure the very few times it crashes gets annoying but the gameplay overrules that. The story has to be the best since Assassins Creed II and the coop is a game changing addition. I have spent the last 3 days with about 60 something games in my account untouched with only playing Assassins Creed Unity. In my opinion Assassins Creed II was the best in the series but I have my doughts now.9/10 Best since Assassins Creed II
