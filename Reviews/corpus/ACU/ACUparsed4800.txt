I really liked the idea of French Revolution setting, but this game is really broken.I can get over some glitches and I can avoid places that can crash the game, but framerate reaching slideshow level, especially indoor is really annoying.And on top of that there are constant reminders that even though I paid for this game so much, I always can pay more.Aside from that and lockpicking, map with too many dots, some broken missions, cover mechanics and some lazy writing it will be a great game... when its done.So, If you are fan of AC, wait until Ubisoft at least fixes the technicall issues. If you are not, save your money, this game is not worth the pricetag.
