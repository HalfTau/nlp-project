I see alot of complaints about this game. Personally, as an AC fan, I found it truly awesome. I never saw so much stuff to do in an AC game, the city is gorgeous and amazing to explore. All the horrible bugs people are screaming about are not at all consistant, and it never altered my experience in any way. Dont bother about the microtransaction stuff everyone is whining about, it does not cut you any access to the content of the game, just dont use it. The story is ok, the new combat system makes the game a hell lot more difficult than any previous titles, wich makes it a better challenge. The new parkour is very nice, needs a little adaptation at first and its fine. The graphics? Incredible. If you are a sandbox type of gamer, this game is for you. Its big, its beautiful and detailed. One of my favorite AC yet with Black Flags.
