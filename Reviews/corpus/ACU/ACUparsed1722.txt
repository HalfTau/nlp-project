The game lacks the fluid movement and feel of the previous games. The skill and gearing systems are tedious and unimaginative but also problematic in that they hinder progression.There are far too many bugs, graphical issues and npc behavioural problems that interfere or outright prevent progress and a smooth game play. Ubisoft has a terrible record of managing its games once theyre no longer new so dont expect these issues to be resolved. Buy Black Flag if you already havent and skip this one.
