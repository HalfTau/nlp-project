its such a pity. the artists did a great job with this game. it looks amazing. models, the characters, the clothes, the animations and the atmosphere. however the game is not optimized and ready for launch. I recommend this game, but not at this moment since its barely playable. they should basically just have called it a beta release. even though thats quite expensive for a beta
