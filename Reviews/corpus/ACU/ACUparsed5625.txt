I dont reccomend this game for the time being. november 12th, 2014bad FPS even on the lowest graphics settingsabundunce of lagI am not mad at the game for these problems, but i would not get the game until these are fixed, i can understand how the game had these problems because it only was worked on for a year. I will enjoy this game when ubisoft can get these problems fixed. When the glitches are fixed, this game will get the love it rightfully should get. please dont dog ubisoft for unleashing the game with the state it is in. All companies make mistakes, this is one of ubisofts mistakes.
