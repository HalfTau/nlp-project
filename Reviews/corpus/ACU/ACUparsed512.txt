Purchased the game as my first game from steam as im new to pc gaming. As a long time AC player i think this game works great. Its tougher than on ps3 in my opinion and makes the game fun and challenging.The only downside is coop missions are tough with the lack of people that still play. I play regularly so add me on steam and ill roll with you.
