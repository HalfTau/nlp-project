In one sentence great decor, bad designed running and fighting. Although I have played all assassin creeds before I never had so much trouble navigating and fighting. It gives me headache to see the image of the screen go zigzag. Sometimes, even with B pressed he tends to grab all object he encounters or just attacks a guard. When I want to take a ladder up, it he tends to climb up next to it. Fighting camera angle is bad. In a fight with more guys you need to turn the camere while fighting and this is too sensitive I swichted to low sensitivity to x and y axis but still. Fights, chasing, runs, are all hard because of the camera issues. I hate this game because of that. If you would only walk around then this is great. If you want to fight, run, chase, it is a mistake. If I had known that movement and fighting were so difficult I would not have bought it. Sometimes I lose so much time in all the furniture, walls, pillars and such that the guy tends to hug... disappointing .Furthermore, bugs... apart from clinging to all object I meet I have a char I need to steel from that is burried half in a fountain so I cannot do anything, restart mission, another example I had to chase a boat and got stuck in the floor.In a nutshell good graphics and environment, story great, but chasing, running, fighting is one of the worst games I have played. I regret having bought this sequel.
