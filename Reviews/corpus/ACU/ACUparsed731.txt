I want to make an honest review about this game, sure the graphics is amazing, optimization is very poor, there was a lot of bugs and glitches  initially, looks like ubisoft focused more on the fighting mechanics and rpg style gameplay with this, but storywise the game sucked, i would recommend someone to buy this if its on sale
