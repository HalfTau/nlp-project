I liked to have thought that after two years of being on the market the game would be playable.However, what started as repeated crashes to desktop in every cutscene turned into repeated crashes ingame, followed by UPlay failing to start at all and culminating in a grand finale of the game refusing to launch.Long story short Still buggy, possibly moreso in Windows 10 and the only useful official advice I found from Ubisoft was to delete my contacts in Uplay which, when  I bought the game for the coop, is a nogo. Some people may still have have luck with it, but for me the price tag of 12 was definitely too high which is why I signed on for a refund.
