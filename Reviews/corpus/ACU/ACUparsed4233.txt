Its even worse than AC3. I cant say that game is completely awful but buy it ONLY when price will drop. And even if you wont buy it, trust me, you are not missing anything, except co op, that is probably one of the few redeeming qualities of the game along with Paris. They finally brought back assassination missions like in first game but they didnt even try to put any creativity in them. Story is weak, so weak, that Shauns notes in database are more interesting than overall plot.
