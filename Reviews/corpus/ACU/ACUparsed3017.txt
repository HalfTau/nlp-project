Though this game engine is terrible for play, it still a good game and worth to buy. By the way, Arno is the est assassin I was played ever xD. During combat, without smoke bomb he is just a little rat and waiting for die due to he can only dodge range weapon, and his melee attack needs more damage to kill an enemy. In addition, an assassin even cant climb the wall correctly, thats really funny.All in all, Detective Arno, rest in peace body xD.
