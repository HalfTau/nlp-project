I dont usually write reviews but I have to say this game is getting a lot of hate. A lot of the hate is coming from performance issues. I feel that unless youre going to review a game it shouldnt be about performance, it should be about the game itself. Performance wise, the game needs to be run on a good computer, and there shouldnt be complaining, because the recommended and minimum specs are there. If your pc cant handle it then you shouldnt be buying the game. The secs are outrageous, I have to admit. But its still there as a reference.In terms of the game, it is really good. The conflict is there, it has character development, the voice acting is great, and the gameplay is fun. Its not an average assassins creed, they completely redeveloped the stealth and customization so that you feel more in control.overall a great game. I would give it an 8/10 due to the outrageous specs.
