AC UNITYIts ok I suppose.The game itself has its pros  cons with the whole hold space to climb up  hold E to clim down thing, its kind of annoying sometimes, but it works I guess.The game looks georgeous on highultra settings but is unstable as . It manages to top out at around 55fps on ultra with my old 960 card but usually hangs around at high 30s low 40s. If you have a system well above the recommended specs, Id recommend this game if you really love the assassins creed series. If you dont have a system way above the recommended specs, just leave it. It feels like its still in early access.Full SystemIntel Core i7 2600k OC 3,8GHzGIGABYTE GTX 960 2GB8GB DDR3 RAM3x Samsung Syncmaster S22B300 1920x1080Windows 10 Professional
