Good job ruining the game!The combat system sucks donkey balls.The counter kill is gone and the combo kill too.And 10 people shooting at you while yourefighting one of them doesnt make it any less annoying.I wish I could take a human shield but thats history too.So if youd like to know what Assassins Creed looks likewithout the combat factor, try this.Because everybody fights dirty and you cant.
