Not really sure where all the hate for this game comes from. Storys decent, the combat system is awesome and much more challenging than last installments, graphics are really nice, customisation of players character is great, lots of different equipment and weapons/weapon types to choose from, minimal amount of bugs now anyway, and theres alot to do in game. Definitely recommended.
