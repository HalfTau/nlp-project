Since Im about to uninstall this one I figure I owe it a little review.First, it should be noted that Ive never played any of the other Assassins Creed games and I downloaded this one long after its infamous bugs had been patched. I also bought it specifically as an 18th century Paris parkour simulator and historical tour first, with its murder n mayhem gameplay a secondary consideration. As a result, Im coming at this with very little baggage.I enjoyed my time in Unity a great deal. Wandering its surprisingly accurate, slightly scaleddown recreation of the city was eyeopening and informative, like stepping out of a time machine. Killing awful people was a nice bonus. I played it with the French voiceover, and I was impressed by its quality and gravity. The story was servicable enough to follow all the way through, but its the set pieces that leave an impression rather than the characters.Tracking down the glowing Nostradamus riddle symbols was a fun subquest at first, but its quite long and unfortunately the reward for completing it was only aesthetic, so Id suggest skipping it.Although the game makes a big deal about its multiplayer function, it ultimately wasnt important to the experience, so I mostly skipped it, did my own thing, and never felt anything was missing.Overall I feel it was money well spent. Id keep it on my hard drive as a museum, but it ties up too much memory.
