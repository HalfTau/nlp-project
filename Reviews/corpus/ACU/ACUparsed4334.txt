Ok I never did this review stuff before but Im so disappointed with it that I just cant be silent.More than 2 weeks in and there are still people flying above the streets and little things like that...Weak storyline and soundtrack.Many useful things had been cut off. None usefull things had been added IMO. Or am I the only one who thinks so?Bunch of really dumb skillsMicrotranscations even! And Im pretty sure there are DLCs ahead. I think this is too much for an incomplete product. And yes, for me its an incomplete product.Thieves and bandits EVERY 5 METERS. And game want you to stop/kill them. Come on, this is just annoying!Dumb AI that STILL cant see things you are doing like in front of their faces. Next Gen?This game lacks many things its predecessors had and adds pretty much nothing new...I really hope Rainbow Six Siege wont be as bad as this one or it will be the last Ubisoft game I buy.... /
