Games way too buggy nearly 3 years from launch. Cant go 5 minutes without encountering some kind of glitch.. Hands and feet going through objects, swords of dead enemies flying in air, things like that. Coming right from AC3, AC3 felt complete. Even the movement in AC3 was better..Even the story in this game is boring. I completely lost interest near the end.. But gotta admit some missions were fun, but they still felt repetitive Im talking about main missions alone. Overall, I wouldnt recommend it at all. The game has too many frustrating things than good.
