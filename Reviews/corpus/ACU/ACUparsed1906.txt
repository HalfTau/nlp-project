103 hours and 100 sync!! And I enjoyed it.I purchased the game for half price after it was almost 1 year old, so it worked well for me. I know they should work on launch date, especially on console but as we all know Ubisoft collapsed under the pressure of annual releases in the series.Things I likedBetter ParkourAwesome graphics even though I could only acheve 40fps at bestWeapon and equipment customization, including the melee, health, and stealth boostsMurder MysteriesHelix RiftsCoop missionsMore of a focus on strategy when it comes to main missionsThings I didnt likeFight mechanics, sometimes it takes way too long to clear 10 plus guards, cant assassinate with hidden blade while theyre defenseless under a smoke bomb.Story wasnt done very welllack of performance optimizationNeeded more variety of envionment
