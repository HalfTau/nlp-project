If you like Mint Icecream, you buy Mint Icecream.If you like Assassins Creed, you buy Assassins Creed.More of the same, but with added story.  The setting feels more alive, and the weapons balanced enough that you wont feel shoehorned into one type over another.I really dislike that there are microtransactions in a full priced game though.  This isnt a phone APP.
