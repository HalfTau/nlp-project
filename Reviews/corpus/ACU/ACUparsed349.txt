The mixed status doesnt do this game any justice. This is an underrated game. Yes it has some bugs but I still enjoy it a lot. Only 2 AC game Ive really enjoyed so far which are AC 2 and AC Unity. The other... not so much. This one is different from the other AC game, you cant Rambo your way through the game, enemies can kill you easily, especially if they have guns.And what more? yes, Paris, I have a big love for Paris and seeing old Paris back in Revolution era is wonderful.
