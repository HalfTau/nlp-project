I agree with a few of the negative reviews, although most of them are for a big partion not true. I kind of feel bad for Ubisoft, because they did a great job on the mechanics. Yes, the performance issues were a big problem for me too, although eventually it got fixed for me, because Ubisoft is working hard on releasing patches for this game. Other bugs have already been resolved, which I actually never had problems with, so I didint worry about that.For the mechanics, I love them. The skill upgrading, descendingmechanic when parkouring, its all very clever and adds more to the game. Ive also spent some time editing my outfit, trying to look badass, which was also fun for me. Ive just completed all the 12 sequences, which was quite a lot of fun for me. The plot was a bit.. less than I expected, yet I still did enjoy it.Ive also had a lot of fun in coop so far with my friends, just messing around, completing crowd events and just having tons of great moments with eachother. Coop missions are also fun, trying to synchronise assassinations with your fellow assassins to gain more points and just having that amazing feeling when it looks so cool to take them out together like you were wellprepaired.Notable Skills Parkour mechanics Greater loadout customization Coop is very enjoyable Active city, with change frequently A lot of things to do crowd events, side missions.. Bugs getting fixed! Framerate issues for most getting fixed! A lot of the same sort activity/mission Companion app neccessary for completionistsId give it an 8.5 when they end up fixing most important bugs and issues, for now.. a 7.
