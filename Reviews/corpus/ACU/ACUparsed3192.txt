Last time,  I buy a Ubisoft game. They laugh at PC gamers everytime they release a piece oflike this.The optimization for PC is really bad.I got  a FX8350 OC  4.7ghzAsus R9 270XRunning on Windows 8.1I know that Ubisoft recommend an R9 290 for this but it doesnt make sense that you cant play the game over 30 FPS when you have already lowered some of the ressource consuming settings!But the story is nice.
