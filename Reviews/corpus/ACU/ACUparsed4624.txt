I have seen a lot of negative reviews for this game so far and their main problem is that the game isnt well optimised sadly but it is getting better through patches and updates. The gameplay is still pretty solid and I have personally had little to no problems with the game. Now the story for the game is pretty good and also the game does feature a lot of replayability with the free roaming aspect and also the coop missiojs as well as many other cool things to do in the game.  Also the customizations for your character are pretty sweet between all the ourfits and gear you can use. Overall I would give this game a 7.5/10. Itt not perfect and I would recomend having at least a gtx 770 4gb gpu or somthing equivalant to it to properly run this game. But more and more games are requiring more powerful cards so if you havent already, upgrade if you can and I would highly recomend a GTX 970 or an R9 290x with 4gb of vram which seems to be becoming the new standard for games now days it seems. Also try and judge a game for yourself because we all have different tastes so it may not be wise to trust some reviews that are bad and even good.
