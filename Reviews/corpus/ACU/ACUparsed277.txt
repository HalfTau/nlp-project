I really looked forward to playing this game, which is wellexecuted Assassin Creed game! I move slowly through the series and have to say that this is my favorite so far. There are some little things, some errors here and there, but its far from anything that spoils the gaming experience. You get a great insight into the French Revolution and the tensions that are in the capital of Paris, where the nobles live a life of luxury while the people on the streets starve.
