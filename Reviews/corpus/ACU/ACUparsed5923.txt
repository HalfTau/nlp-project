I must be playing a different game from everyone else...or I have a better system perhaps..My system is a 4 year old Alienware  but I do have a new 970 card. I personally find the game to be astonishingly beautiful  probably the more gorgeous game Ive ever seen in all my near 30 years of gaming. Not a framerate issue to speak of.Havent seen these floating, buggy civilians some folks have mentioned  or really any bugs for that matter. A little gfx flicker from time to time around highly reflective surfaces  but thats really about it. Played for 6 hours so far and just enjoying the hell out of it  so eh. shrug
