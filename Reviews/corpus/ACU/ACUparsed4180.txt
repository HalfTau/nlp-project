 Beautiful graphics... if you have the system to run it Customization options Coop Random events Side objectives/missions for assassinating people A button for climbing down and climbing up/ Dynamic missions werent a complete lie, but there are still plenty of missions that require a restart if you dont meet a specific condition like getting through a mission undetected/ Combat is definitely harder frustrating even, but also very boring Buggy, glitchy Despite having seperate buttons for jumping and climbing the character still didnt always do what I wanted Poor performance Microtransactions Just not as fun as most of the previous AC gamesRating 72/100
