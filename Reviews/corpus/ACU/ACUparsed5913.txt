I have a GTX 480 so I gotta play on MedLow specs and it bugs like hell, but it is still a pretty fun game1 Nice story,2 Revamped combat,3 Gorgeous characters even on low res,4 Great free running eventually sends you under the map, still pretty good5 The hack to get cash and all doesnt really affect the overall progressionIll recommend for now, at least until I get my GTX 970.If it still bug and lag like this then Ill kinda regret buying and reviewing this game hehe
