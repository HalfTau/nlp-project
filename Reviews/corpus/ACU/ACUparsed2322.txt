It is ze bad game, but it was fun with COop Creed. Too bad the Assassin train crashed and everyone died. What a shame.Stay Away from it unless you got friends to play with. Because then you have some one to share alle the wierd shit happening, like Arnos furniture fetish when he grabs the furniture and starts humping it or the F up save Napoleon from assassin mission, which sucks. Buy Rouge instead, its more Fun
