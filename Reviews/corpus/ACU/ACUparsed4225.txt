In version 1.3 its pretty stable  after I downloaded new drivers for my video board  and Arno is the best character in the franchise since Ezio and Paris is a great upgrade from Assassins Creed III Slam York going from Rome, Venice and Constantinople to Wood cities in the US was the greatest mistake possible and it nearly made me never play another AC game again but a good friend of mine showed me Black Flag and I simply had to play it so here I am.But once they work out the kinks of this new engine the game will truly be awesome even if you cant actually free the city and restore it witch was something I always looked forward in a assassins game.
