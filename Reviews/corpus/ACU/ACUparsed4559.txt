This game was big disappoint of me. Because controls are terrible, the game has A LOT bugs, I have almost rage quit because them and story isnt very good. But the visuals are really NICE, voice acting is quite good. Its sad to say it.. but AC Rogue is still a better game. AC4 BlackFlag is still the best entry since AC2, AC Unity feels like a mess of the options avaliable in the FIRST AC game entry. I really hope they fix this... or start to take better use of the time to Q/A the games before releasing them. The series needs more than a few months to make... Take the extra time to make it worth the player cost.
