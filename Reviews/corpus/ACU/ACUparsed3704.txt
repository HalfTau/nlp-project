The story  Youre probably not going to fall in love with Arno like how everyone loves Ezio, and the story isnt as rich as Ezios or even Edwards but youll probably get a laugh or two out of things Arno does or say. While playing as Ezio, I felt like there was a point to every mission. With Arno, I just feel like Im killing people while doing fancy parkour. I havent felt any connection to Arno or his story, whereas with Ezio and Edward I loved those characters and it was amazing playing through their stories, I never wanted it to end and when it did I wanted to do it all over again. Except for the ending of Black Flag, if you didnt almost cry you have no heart.Would I recommend this game? Yes, I would. Not at full price, 33 off or more would be a pretty good deal. Theyve improved on quite a few things, sadly the optimization is just not where it should be. Hopefully they can patch it some more and get ride of the random stutters.
