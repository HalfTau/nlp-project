i5 4670k OC 4.2GHzEVGA geforce gtx760 4GB OC 1160MHz gpu clock/1802 mem clock8GB RAMRuns perfectly fine on high settings 3050 fps. No major issues besides minor screen tears and one bug during a coop mission where I got stuck to a balcony and then got booted from the server. Not really sure how Im feeling about the new parkour control though...may need some getting used to or it just may not work as they planned but it hasnt affected me much yet.Great game but does need some work to run like I expected it to, but if youre an AC fan and have a decent rig, its worth a look.Overall score as of now  8/10...if they fix the issues and it runs as smoothly as advertise, 10/10
