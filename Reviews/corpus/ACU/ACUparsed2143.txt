I wanted to like this game! It was exciting to be back in a big city for the first time since Revelations, and there were puzzles again! And scavenger hunts around the city! Unlike most people, I actually had very few technical problems with the game, a couple bugs, a couple crashes.....Anyway, the glamor wore off about 12 hours in and I decided that I would just power through till the end.I realized that I actually hated this game right before going to kill the final boss. But I was so close to just beating the game! So close! And I was hoping for some kind of phenominal ending that would make it all worth it! I mean, there was no way Ubisoft would just put in another filler ending to the modern day storyline like they did with Black Flag! Hey! What the  is Juno doing? Anyway, I accidentally started the DLC on the way to the boss fight and couldnt get out of it. I did that for an hour and eventually I ended up EXTREMELY furious and just closed the game. Yes. My first ragequit. A milestone in my personal history.I havent tried to finish the game since then a year ago since writing and I have absolutely no intention to do so ever in my whole living life or my afterlife, unless I am in hell and Satan makes me. I wish I quit earlier, becauseTLDR this game was unfortunate
