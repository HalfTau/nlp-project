I purched this game during a special offer. I wanted it for my PS4 but half price was hard to pass up. What a big mistake Ive made.This game is SOOOoooo buggy its borderline unplayable. Constant glitching makes you switch directions every few seconds, the cut scenes are even worse with glitching hair, facial features, clothes, audio. You can be right on top of an item you need with the Press E to interact you can spam the button, adjust your position, even walk away and back again, it takes several tries just to interact with anything. Combat is the worst, with everything jumping around you have no idea whats going on. Im not even going to talk about walking through crowd, but if I hadnt played money for it, it would be commical.This bumms me out because the story and graphics are amazing, it just means that if I want to play this game I need to repurchase it for the consol. PC gamers... DO NOT BUY!!! I wish Steam would allow returnes for situations like this.
