Too many glitches, Too mayny crashing. too much headache.Just for your info, I only bought the game yesterday and started playing today and currently regratting every cent I paid.Ive been trying to run the game for over 5 hours but it keeps crashing. I lowered the graphics and every possible thing to lowest and i could barely play 10 minutes continuously. I kept calm and thaught to myself maybe because I have the minimum graphic card requirement but still if I have the lowest i should play at the lowest settings without crashing. after three time crashing at lowest possible settings, Im not sure who could possible have finished the game.How long should we wait to find adecent patch.
