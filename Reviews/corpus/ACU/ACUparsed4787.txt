Do Not Buy this worthless pile of game crap. A sad waste of  60.00 USDEDITI was steaming mad at ubisoft at the time and should have explained better. The game itself I LOVE, but Ubisoft has seriously dropped the ball with this game. Bugs, performance Issues though my pc specs are not fully up to par for the game Server Stability You will find login servers down alot. The save game cloud repeatedly corrupting saves, constantly dropped coop, 99 features not even online STILL 7 days after launch, ETC. And a new one for me since the Patch 2 I have been unable to even play the game. Before patch 2 I averaged 2030 frames, after patch 2, 5 frames with spikes up to 10. Completely unplayable for me. So its sad and frusterating for me that I spent 60 on a game in a franchise Series I love for a game I never more anticipated, Only to not be able to play it for many reasons some being my own fault.
