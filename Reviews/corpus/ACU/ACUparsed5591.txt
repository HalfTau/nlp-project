This game would probably seem to anyone who hadnt played an AC game before to be utter rubbish. Coming from somebody who follows the series, its.......Well it seems to run far from perfectly for a vast majority of us. Bugs left right and centre, a start menu screen that is seemingly just a flashy white light in front of the logo that has less than 10FPS, and the ingame....I did the first bit is all I can say. Watched a really poor quality cinematic, ran to a place, climbed some stuff, chased a guy, fought the guy, then cinematic. Walks through a door, game crashes again.Other than that I reckon this game can be fixed! We wait around and Ubisoft, if they want to save the PC version of this game, will maybe debug and run patch after patch.
