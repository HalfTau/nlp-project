I bought This Game because It Looked interesting, and I met all of the system requirements, on my new computer I bought this SUmmer. I Have not yet even been able to enter the game, and steam will not give a refund. I would have done better throwing 60 into the trash. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BUY THIS GAME.As a side note the steam support system has been highly unhelpfull, I feel like I live in a communist country, where I have no rights, and therefore I have nothing but bad things to say about steam as a whole.
