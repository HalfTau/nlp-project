I would love to play this game, it looks like a fun story and good gameplay.Graphics I dont care about... but graphics dont turn me away from a good gameplay.However, What on earth were they thinking before releasing a game that has as much issues as this game does.I preordered this game, and I was excited...I play Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor on ultra graphics, and my computer plays the game very smoothly.But this game, I get lucky to have it on med. graphics, and it lags and the crashes!Not only that, but since their latest update, it made it worse. I cant even load the game without it crashing.Im dissapointed. and they didnt even give me prepurchase benefits like they showed in the video.So, I asked for a refund from steam. And I will get that Refund.
