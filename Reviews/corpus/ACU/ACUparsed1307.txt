First impressionsThe Assassins Creed franchise would do well to focus on developing highquality, engaging content, rather than scattering monotonous tasks with overzealous liberty throughout the streets of Paris.In that regard, the detectivework quests to compensate for the lazy police chief are a refreshing addition. They could have been great, had effort been spent on further development to their plots and character narratives.I think most people arent drawn to hundreds of meaningless chests and tokens that are rarely difficult to reach, but that more often left me with the feeling that my time had just been wasted. If youre like me, and you want to try everything in a game, I suggest you think carefully about buying this one.If there were, say, 10 chests on the map, where I had to solve a complex puzzle to access them and the rewards were... actually rewarding, this would certainly appeal to me. This game could achieve great things were Ubisoft to abandon quantity as a metric for success over quality.If I can be bothered, Ill update this when Ive played more.
