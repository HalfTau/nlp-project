Finds glitch in Witcher 3 The wild hunt laughs it off and continues to play game.Finds glitch in Assassins creed Unity immediatly writes bad review of the game due to the fact that ubisoft had a few bad games in the past cough  cough watch dogs.I genuinly recomend this game to assassins creed fans, to those who want to get into the franchise, and those who just like playing video games in general. However I do not recomend the game to those who are gonna  and moan about the game not working IN THE PAST. I bought this game late, as a birthday present to myself near the christmas of 2014 and it was working perfectly fine on startup, no bugs, no horrifying facial glitches and no god forsaken crashes. It pains me to see how quickly this game got bad rep just from a poor launch, lets face it, worse games have had a rougher launch and are revered as legends in gaming libraries. So for Ubisofts sake and YOUR enjoyment, show this game some love and check it out, it isnt a masterpiece its just fun.
