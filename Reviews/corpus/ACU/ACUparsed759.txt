At release, yes, this game had many bugs and glitches, but eventually everything has taken cared by Ubi. Ive always been a fan of Assassins Creed series. I love the online mode in this game. It is nothing like before and it is addictive and indulging. But sometimes the same online game can be a bit annoying because of server disconnections. But hey, accidents happens. Worth the money.
