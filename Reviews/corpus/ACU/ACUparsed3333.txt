Though I did enjoy the story and the gameplay was enjoyable, this is, without a doubt, the last Ubisoft game I will be purchasing.Pushing for a release date far before the game is ready is irresponsible and the consumers suffer as a result. Bugs. So many bugs. Even after bugfixes were release my framerate was, and in some cases still is, terrible.The DLC, though free, has also been terrible in terms of framerate drops and bugs. Upon downloading the DLC, I watched the openning cut scene, fell through the ground after trying to air assassinate an NPC, CTDed, and finished it all off with watching as the camera circled Arno more times than a vulture circles a carcass on a busy interstate. Eventually I completed the DLC but not before, during the final leg of the final sequence, Arno spawned in on top of a roof with no way to get down. on your customers with a beta release posing as a functioning game is bad.  on them a second time by putting out DLC with the same issues is inexcusable. So long Ubisoft.
