HORRIBLE game engine... You will not only be transported back to the French Revolution, you will also be transported back to the beginning of the Computer Revolution. Ubilag has found away to bring back the experiences of the Dail Up connection era. LAG, lag, and more lag. Disconnections constant. and if you buy the game after all this, you have only yourself to blame.
