There are ALOT of BUGS in the steam version of Assassinscreed Unity if you would have a better chance of playing if you just bought the disc version instead of the steam version. Just because it has bugs in assassins creed unity doesnt mean that the game you buy will be unplayable on the Steam downloadable version. So be carefull and once downloaded try the game out just dont play 20 minutes of the game. if you find out that it doesnt work you can always get a refund but if you have the game for a few weeks and then try to refund it you WONT usaually except the refund. Heed my warning! And many other people that have played this game! P.S. If I were you  I would just buy the game at Target or Toys R us right now 12/1/15 because they only have the cybersale for this week only now is the time to buy the game at one of these stores!
