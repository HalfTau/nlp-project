Disclaimer I use an AMD graphics card, if you own a Nvidia card most of this review doesnt apply to you, because they optimized the game for Nvidia. If that is the case I recommend it ans have fun, if not keep reading.Performance  Assasins Creed Unity is a fun game if you can run it at all. I had decent framerate, on medium, at release with some lag spikes.However, after update 2 it is barely playable on low. They fixed some glitches like falling through the map 30 of the time you jumped to the ground, but tanked the framerate. Also, it seems as you play the game, the longer you play it for in one session the more lag you encounter.Gameplay  The game plays good with an exception of a few bugs with free running, trying to jump to a ledge right next to you that the game doesnt think is an option. I found the fighting with some options. For instance, Super sneaky assasinations, smoke bomb attacks, kill and hide, Shoot them in the face, and many more. My only problem with combat is I have found body shots with guns underpowered at pointblank range.Story  I have had trouble keeping track of the story because of the lag, but i have no problems with the story. There are also side missions that are loads of fun.Conclusion  I like the game in most areas, but the lag as of Patch 2 has killed some of the fun of free running and combat. I would suggest waiting until the game is patched further until you buy it. However if you have a beast rig that puts hal to shame, or just have an OK Nvidia graphics card, then try it and you might be able to run it.That all being said I believe the game is still fun because of my lack of care about being on low graphics, and my tolerance of lag spikes to an extent. Remember your prefrences to framerate being 30 or 60 and if you can stand low graphics or not should be put into account aswell.
