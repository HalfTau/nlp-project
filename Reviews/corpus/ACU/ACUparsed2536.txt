I should have listened to the reviews, this game is buggy and annoying I didnt even finish the story. 1 Because the story is bland and lame with an exception for some parts. 2 Its aggravating and annoying redoing something FROM THE BEGINNING after a aggravating failure in how they based their parkour system. Example You are climbing roof tops and try to get down, so sorry did you want on that ledge? I thought you wanted in the middle of all seven of these enemys. 3 Multiplayer SUCKS, even if you connect to a game and it takes a while you will find yourself aggravated over a lack of communication and bad decisions made by you or your partners. 4 Although these new addons are interesting they seem to serve little purpose. These addons are half done and lack in real effort, clothing seems not do much at all, especially as your enemys level. Although weapons seem to, yet the phantom blade and other additions are just seemingly useless. Also the cafe was completely useless.
