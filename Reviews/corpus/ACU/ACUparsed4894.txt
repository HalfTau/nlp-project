People please i suggest to you to update your Nvidia Driver if you havent done so and look for viruses in your task manager proceses. I was limited to playing on 1280x720 and had everything on low and even then i had FPS drops. But then i accidentally discovered that i had a virus that was using 90 of my processor and when i scanned my PC last night and cleaned it then i started Unity and i ran it on 1920x1080 and didnt get any FPS drops and got everything on ultra high except antialiasing. So please look for some little details that could be impacting your gameplay. I totally recommend the game it is worth a price. Didnt get any crashes or bugs except one time it quit the game for no reason.My specs areIntel Core i54200M 2.5GHz with Turbo to 3.1GHzNVIDIA GeForce GTX 760M8GB DDR3and as you can see i am running it on my laptop with these specs so you dont need some ultra beefed up PC to run it on ultra. DUPDATE The game is stuck at sequence 7 memory 3 when i need to kill Bellic and i cant get pass passing E i saw many people complain about this and this is the campaign mission.
