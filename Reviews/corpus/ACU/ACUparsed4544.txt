I dont care what people say . I played Assassins Creed francise sicne the 1st game other time i started thinkign AC2 will be the best AC game with the best story and landmarks and the beauty of buildings and that AC3 was the best for the combat system. But when i got my hands on THIS masterpeace i simply have no words . It beats out every ac game by every part . the graphics are really next gen . parkour better then mirrors edge cobat is amazing more then anything . I RECOMMAND THIS GAME REALLY FAST 10000000/10 i am looking for word to see when it gets GOTY . And just make sure u get a good pc becaues u cant expect an amazign game without improvments .
