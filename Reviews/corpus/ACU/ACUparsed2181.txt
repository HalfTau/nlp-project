I wish I hadnt bought this in a bundle with ACRogue so I could get a refund. Save your time and money and just buy Rogue it is the only good one from this AC cycle.Even on Medium settings the game is choppy. They changed the freerunning system so a button must be held to either go up or down while freerunning which is similar to how the older games worked but it just doesnt work. The climbing animations and jumps seem terribly unrealisitc even for an AC game giving the feeling of flying rather than climbing. The game still runs into the issue of to much stuff to climb on leading to back and forth jumping between two pieces when you really just want to go up. They introduced a cover based stealth system to the game for staying hidden which is a neat idea but it just leads to more stuff to get needlessly stuck on.I tired it for a short session and couldnt deal with the poor animations and quit. I tired again and shortly after had to stop again because the character handles so poorly. Literally the entire time I was playing I was not happy with how it was working.But they managed to fit a ton of people on screen so thats cool I guess. Worth breaking the game over? No.
