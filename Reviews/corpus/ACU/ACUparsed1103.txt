Played dead kings....experienced armed men attack a military battalion and win. men dodged bullets, i became the exact replica of a man and he didnt respond, walked through a restricted area with a surprising lack of restriction. enemies didnt react to me at all. i played coop and learned that arno cant open doors. so yeah glitchy and a mess. 10/10
