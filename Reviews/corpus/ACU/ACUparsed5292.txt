I cant play the game right now. Every time I step into a building everything just turns white and I cant see anything. The moment I step outside, the world looks fine. Ocassionally, I will see a half second flash of what the buildings are supposed to look like. This makes the game completely unplayable for me because I cant navigate through the first couple missions. This better get fixed.Specsi7 core  3.6 GHz12 Gb RAM2x nVIDIA GEFORCE GT 60 graphics cards
