The only problem Ive had is that FRAPS is how people are measuring their frame rates and it isnt a very good thing if it breaks the game itself.Im sorry, I know many are having issues but, the Graphics are awesome! Yes theres a few hints of screen tare here and there but, overall... Im running this game in Ultrahigh everything 1080P and Im not having slow downs at all!My system specs areIntel Core i53570KSapphire TriX OC R9290 4 Gig16 Gigs of RAMThe Whole System cost me about 900 to build and I dont consider that ultra highend.Oh and Im on Windows 8.1 but, I dont know how much that matters.No Overclocking, No Liquid Cooling, just a straight up build.I upgraded my drivers to the AMD Optimized drivers for this game Which are the Beta drivers before installing it but, overall it runs awesome!So, dont believe the hype, yes some people are likely having issues but, I can say it isnt everyone as my system runs this game great!Oh and it is running heads and tails better than the PS4 or XO thats for sure!One more note, While the game runs great on my machine... I found that enabling FRAPS made the graphics go crazy and as soon as I turned FRAPS off, everything went back to being beautiful again.
