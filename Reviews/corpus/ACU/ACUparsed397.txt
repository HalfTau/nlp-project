I bought this game on sale for around 10 and I think its worth it for the money I paid for it, of course there are still some glitches and bugs and probably they will stay there but on the positive side the game never crashed once on my pc and it is running surprisingly good on my i5 4460, gigabyte r9 280 oc windforce graphics card and 8gb RAM, it actually never drops below 45 fps and most of the time it is running around 5460 fps with almost all settings set to ultra at the 1080p.
