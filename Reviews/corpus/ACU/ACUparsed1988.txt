Unfortunately I have to say No to this game. I would be able to recommend it if I wouldve been able to play it properly. But now the state is like this. If you have a decent or less good computer. You wont be able to run this game. If you have the minimum requirements you probably wont be able to play this game. You need to have the Recommended speccs or even better to be able to run this game, otherwise not. Not even on the lowest graphic settingsBut for someone with a good computer I could probably recommend this game.The story is decent compared to other AC Games.Hope this review was helpful.
