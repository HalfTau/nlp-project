As this is one of the newest additions to the Assassins Creed Franchise, I would have expected it to be a good game. To my surprise though, this game is HORRIBLE on the PC. Its not that bad on a PS4 or Xbox 1, its just glitchy and frustrating on the Computer. I dont recommend anyone to waste 60 dollars on this pile of rubbish.
