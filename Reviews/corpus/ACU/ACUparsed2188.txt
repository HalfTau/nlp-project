As an experienced AC player played and replayed every game before Unity multiple times all I can say is that I have mixed feelings.Good points stealth is amazing. last known point is cool and useful story seems quite all right, but havent finished yet. at least not as boring as AC3... sorry AC3 fans. just no. interesting characters. at least not as boring as Connor nope. initiate system seems pretty cool to me with all the achievements and challenges a huge and lively city with a bazillion secrets fight is dynamic, interesting, pretty and sometimes challengingBad points ungodly requirements. I had to wait a whole year to start this game because of this no need for stealth. really, there are no dont get detected challenges or objectives long queues for coop. probably because practically noone plays this game anymore... I miss ships. god I really miss ships...summary way better than AC3 but not quite as cool as Black Flag. still recommending to any and all AC fans
