Yes I know, im the only positive review on here. But thats because i didt just give up and cry about the game lagging, I acctualy found my sweet spot where it looks the best and plays the best, I have an nvidia gtx 750 ti, intel i7 cpu, and the 750 ti isnt the best card, my point is ,is that all these bad reviews about it is because every one is lazy and they dont try to find their sweet spot. I really love this game and once you get passed the fact that its poorly optimised which i realize and you find your sweetspot, you realize that this isnt a bad game and infact its almost revolutionary in the series and the whole gaming industry.
