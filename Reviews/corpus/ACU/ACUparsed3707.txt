Long time fan of the Assassins Creed games and recently from the past few games in the series I have been dissapointed, especially with Assassins Creed 3, but for this game, Im really enjoying it and it is very fun. The game and story feel like Assassins Creed 2 which is a good thing. I also have to say that when I first installed the game and started playing it was laggy with low frames even on the lowest setting, that was until I updated my driver for my graphics card and now it runs nice and whever else is having framerate issues I recommend checking if your graphics card has a driver update.
