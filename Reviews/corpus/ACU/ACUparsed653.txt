I will be honest with this.This game tells a good story, one we havent seen in an AC game before and it intruiged me, for the most aprt this game is solid except for the giant lingering shadow thats there when you play. This game, called a full game, is riddled with glitches, bugs and horrible, horrible parkour. I had did several missions that required parkour and failed several times ebcasue Arno decided it would be a great idea to stay in one area and not move because he likes hanging on a rope. This game has amazing graphics, great customization, and in my opinion a really good story. But what makes me want to press uninstall more than anything is the horrible and rage inducing glitchiness and bugs in this game. Half of the time I refuse to go up on roofs or parkour because Arno will get stuck. Taking the streets is easier and better, it may be longer but its worth it to avoid running into glitches. So unfortunately I will be exploring France from the streets, and not from the rooftops.
