IDK why alot of people think this has some problems, but for me with a GTX 660 which is below the req it runs surprisingly good on high settings. It got a few graphic glitches and bugs at coop but trust me it is worth it to buy AC Unity. I preordered it and i am so proud of myself lol. So buy it! You wont be sorry.
