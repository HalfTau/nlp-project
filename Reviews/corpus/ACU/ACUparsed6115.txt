Very, very, very, very poorly optimized. Buggy, broken engine.Running an i7 2600K with 16g of DDR3 and 2x 290xs. The game can get up to 40 frames per second on low. This is absolutely unacceptable. This has to be the laziest release from Ubisoft yet. How much worse can they get?update 11.11.14 12am AMD Catalyst 14.11.1 drivers yield crossfire functionality with no performance increase. A single 290x in use yields even lower frame rates at roughly 2030 frames per second.
