Kay lets be honestThis game is awesome. I know, I know it has some weird stuff going on, sometimes gets a little buggy but I think thats pretty normal, every single game crushes sometimes. If I would have to choose from all of AC games I would definitely pick Unity. I like literally everything about it, an awesome story, graphics good, and I also like the way we can customize our BaguetteMan.
