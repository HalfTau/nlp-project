ASSASSINS CREED!!!! I fricken idolize this entire series and enjoy every single game except Liberation, which is awful. I dont understand why people cant get past the glitchy nature of Unity, and just love it as I do. Plus it would help if you arent trying to run the game on a toaster oven. Also, play the fricken game before you review it, jerks. 100/10 AC UNITYI seriously cant wait for Rogue to release on the master race.
