Okay, Ive tried, god ing knows for how long.Unity isnt terrible because of the constant glitches, its terrible because everything seems so slow paced, missions and assassinations dont go as smoothly and now your enemy can stab you just like you could to him. Its terrible because instead of learning the skills through the game, you need to actually purchase them. Its terrible because this game is more about Arnos love life than it is about him being an assassin.The French revolution could be such a cool game to play through, and Ubisoft failed that miserably. I want to follow the gameplay and the story, so I might just watch lets plays because theres honestly no hope for me to keep playing this game and enjoying its content.
