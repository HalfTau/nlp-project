I didnt have as much problems with the game like everyone elase had. It was buggy and glitched at first, but it is occuring less. The framerate was pretty bad at high graphics, that just might be my computer. Turning the graphics down the medium helped a ton. The game does freeze up sometimes and take a minute or two to start back up.Overall, its really not as bad as people say it is. Just be patient with it and give it some time.
