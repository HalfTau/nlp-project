Although it launched with some showstopping bugs and performance issues for some people, the games been cleaned up quite a bit and is pretty functional.It looks absolutely astounding, so for all the issues it had, the art team was on their A game.Combats been dumbed down, and at times can be a little frustrating. Youre going to miss the human shield ability every AC game with guns has had up to the this point.While the animation looks phenominal, as a result the overall flow to the whole game has been slowed down considerably. Gone are the quick jumps from building to building, tree to tree, ground to building and building to ground. Its not gamebreaking, but in my opinion slows the whole affair down a little more than Id have liked.The storys typical AC fare, and the jumps to Nazi occupied Paris are a fun diversion, as are the Helix rifts. Side missions are plenty theres no lack of things to do in this game.Overall, while the game got dumped on pretty hard at launch, its worth a look.
