I have been playing AC games from their first series. I thought AC3 had lots of bugs when it was released. But this game at the moment should receive the worst reviews and score imo.I think the game itself is poorly optimized in general. When i first started the game, the framerate made it unplayable. Lowering my graphic settings did little to no help to improve framerate, which is a big sign of a poorly optmized game. Not to mention shuttering all the time. Checked my CPU usage and found that it was also bizzarely low. I was able to run Shadow of Mordor, Ryse Son of Rome on High settings with no problem at all, When it comes to actualy gameplay, it is sluggish as hell with huge amount of mouse acceleration. Lots of bugs and Glitches even during the cutscenes. Overall my impression so far on this gameProsOpen World looks so promisingStopped playing, there might be good pros later on. Havent checkedConsVery demanding on HardwareCant optimize at all on mid range gearAwful Frame rate problemsRandom Texture popin on charactersCant recommend this to PC users until a fix has been issued. btw make sure to download the new NVIDIA driver exclusively released for the game. It might help a few who have the higher end PCs
