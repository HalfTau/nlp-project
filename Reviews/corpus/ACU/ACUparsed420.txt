I find these mechanics nearly unplayable.  Im willing to put in a good amount of time learning how to play a game, the ins and outs of the rules and mechanics.  But 5 hours in and Im constantly getting stuck on walls or jumping past my objective.  I feel like they dumbed down the controls so much and have done so much path scripting that half the time I dont know where Im going to end up.  Im pretty frustrated because Im feeling the story develop here, but I realy dont think Ill be picking this game up again.
