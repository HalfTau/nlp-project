Worst piece of trash released in recent memory.Ive been gaming since 1986. Theres been some awesome releases, and some bad releases. This ranks in my top 3 worst releases of all time, and it all relates to stability and performance.When the game first came out, it was a bugfest. Ok.. sure whatever. I gave them 1 month to fix it. I cant even run it with my 2x 780 GTX in SLI which scores 14,780 in firestrike.Now here we are almost 6 months later, I now have a GTX TITAN X I cant even get past the logo screen. CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH... and absolutely no end in sight. Are  you kidding me?Last Ubisoft product EVER.
