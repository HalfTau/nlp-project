The requirments of this game are far high above what they should be, even top notch Computers have trouble running this game and the French Revolution setting may or may not appeal to you, it is really just your personal tastes. Having optional microtransactions that can let you level yourself up to a God of an Assassin makes what Unity talked about, talking about having to learn your skills again and restart in a way compared to previous games it takes all of that and throws it in the ing garbage can. The story You play as possibly the LEAST interesting lead role yet, Arno Ezio wannabe Victor Dorian, a very English sounding, looking and acting french man. The new parkour system comes more as confusing than useful and this may be the weakest main plot story of AC games yet! Ubishit really took one down the crapper on this one. If you want a REAL AC game go to Assassins creed 2, Assassins Creed Brotherhood and hell, compared to even Assassins Creed 3
