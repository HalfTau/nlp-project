Ive had no performance issues whatsoever.  It runs perfectly fluid at maxed out settings for me.  I like the flow of climbing and jumping, the stealth aspect and general game play of this title.Combat is harder.  The multiplayer aspect is not completely terrible either.Thus far its not my favorite in the series, but its still a good game.  Glad I waited for a sale and the patches.
