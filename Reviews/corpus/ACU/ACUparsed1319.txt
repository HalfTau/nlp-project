I think this is the first game Im reviewing. For 11.99 on Black Friday sale, This game is more than worth it! Like everyone said, it was a garbage launch. Fortunately, I didnt get to experience how bad it was because I bought it during a summer sale for 30 a year later. I graduated University, bought this game and played the 56 hours. I then played Witcher 3 and it was the honestly the best summer spent on gaming before committing myself to a fulltime career.This game was a truly amazing experience. Ive always wanted to travel the world but finance and school permitted me from achieving those kind of goals. Im currently in the process of saving money to do just that, but graduating fresh out of University, you kind of need to prioritize where your money goes. I was fortunate enough to have a 970 in SLI and playing this game gave me a truly immersive experience of being in French Revolution Paris.  I also have an interest in historical fiction so this game definitely was a perfect fit.Tip Playing it in French with English subtitles gave a better immersive feel, but the mouth sync is off so keep that in mind.12/10 LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS GAME
