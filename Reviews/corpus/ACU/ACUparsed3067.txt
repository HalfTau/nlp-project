the hate for this game is too strong and has turned into a bandwagon,yes the game is poorly optimized and yes it has a quite a few issues but it does so much right, the AC series can not keep using the ships over and over and thus unity did something new and tried to improve and upgrade the classic town based AC style and it a lot of ways it works, the movement system is better, the new eagle vision is cool, the animations and graphics are just beautiful and the story is somewhat decent while nothing spiecal,despite all that there are thousands of people wanting uplay and unity to burn in hellfire for what? being the first game out of SEVEN to have some big issues? oh sorry mr perfection i had no idea that a company has to make at least 14 flawless games to have a free break.
