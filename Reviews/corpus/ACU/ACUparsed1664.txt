Negative reviews all likeURGH, GAME NEEDS UPLAYDOESNT RUN ON MY  PC, CANT BELIEVE ITDont listen to that, this is personal my favourite Assassins Creed game and doesnt deserve all this unhappy customers.I mean, yeah you have to deal with Uplay but its seriously only a sign up and youre done like what the hell is everyones problem.I must admit it doesnt run as well as most games. Although if you hit the minimum requirements then youre good.Love the parkour, love the combat, absolutely love the huge weapon selection.10/10 no joke
