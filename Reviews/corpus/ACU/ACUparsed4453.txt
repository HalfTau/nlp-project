Absolutely love this game, I am shocked to see so many negative reviews for this game. I am truly convinced now that we are completely spoiled in games now, nothing is good enough. I understand, the game has a bad launch, they should have pushed it back another 2 months or so, fix bugs and add horses! Man i wish this game had horses..Anyway, Unity is truly advanced in all ways, making combat much more challenging encourages the stealth system! Which I welcome the cover system addition it does need work. the graphics are fantastic of course, this lighting system is so damn noticable, best lighting in gaming right now hands down. Characters are very well done, well spoken and well written, nothing to jaw dropping happens but a fun ride! But this game is all about the city, and Paris is a master piece. Massive and alive, things to do around every corner. You can upgrade your character as well, really make him look however you wish which is something I didnt expect them to tackle so I was plesently surprised. Co op was a wonderful addition as well, having a blast playing this game with my friends finally!Anyway, the games awesome if you can run it. the haters, they are spoiled and jaded. Let them enjoy their COD.
