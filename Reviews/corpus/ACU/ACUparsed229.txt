As much as I would like to recommend this game, i unfortunately cant.Even though I liked the story and setting as well as some of the made gameplay changes, the game is barely playable because of ridicoulously bad controls.I currently own 170 games of steam, some of which are Early Access, but Assassins Creed Unity still is the game with the worst controls I have ever laid my hands on. It is frustrating on a degree that I would like to compare it to Human Fall Flat, which should give you a rough idea what you are getting yourself into. Not to mention countless glitches, bugs yes, still and weird AI behaviour, like getting stuck inside sic! windows or at corners, or spotting you through walls.
