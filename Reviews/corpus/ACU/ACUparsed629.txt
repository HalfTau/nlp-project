Overall this game is good. I didnt think I would enjoy it, but it turns out it really isnt that bad as to what I was hearing about it. Yes at times there are some bugs, but they are nothing major. I know many werent fans of the coop but I really liked the system, was great to play some activities with friends and even randoms. Definately worth buying when its on sale.
