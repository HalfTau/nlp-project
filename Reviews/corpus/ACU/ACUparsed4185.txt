Honestly, I wanted to like this game. It looked like it was introducing new ideas, plus French Revolution seemed like an awesome place to run around in to do cool assassiny things. But, it was a let down for 60. The launch issues with the framerates and performce were bad. Arno constantly STILL gets stuck on things or jumps to objects you dont want to go to, which makes escapes and chases a pain in the butt. The story is mediocre at best and has a ton of holes in it. The map, while quite large, is splattered with collectibles, some of which you cant even get without using the mobile app.It seems like this game is trying to do too much at once without focusing on story or character development. Arno is a weak character, and doesnt hold together well. Even Connor from AC3 was a better character development.That being said, the game itself is gorgeous to the eyes. However, since the framerate stutters constantly, its hard to appreciate it. Ubisoft should have pushed this out a while, and now theyre trying to scramble to patch it and apologize for screwing up to save face with the community. Too late on that front for several people. I regret preordering the game, and honestly cant recommend this to anyone. While some ideas are great, such as the new movement, both up and down buildings, or going inside of buildings, or the murder mysteries the overall feel of the game is lackluster.Wait for a year for them to fix it and pick it up on a steam sale. Cant recommend it until then.
