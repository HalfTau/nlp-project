First off I would like to say this game is very broken. Poor optimization, repetiveness, and very frustrating. Every 5 seconds I get micro lag spikes which slightly pause the game and when the game comes back from the lag spike hair flies all over the place. I wish I could really enjoy this game being my first game I played from the series but the constant lag makes it very difficult. I have also heard that people on PS4 are also getting lag. This game was released 2 months too early in my opinion.5/10
