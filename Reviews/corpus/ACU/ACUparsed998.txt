Thats a big surprise to me, I was prepared to play a notbad AC considering all the reviews but hey! Did someone really tried to get into Paris immersion? The main story is not great but far from being bad, Arno doesnt have a great charisma but hes good enough and I personally like him, and the side stories might be a bit repetitive but thanks to the history context its always interesting and entertaining.Of course you need to care about the database and the history. If you dont give a f and just run around, without taking time to enjoy the monuments or read the history then you will not fully appreciate that game. I guess thats why so many bad reviews were written... many people hate to read, they just want action. Maybe I wouldnt recommend that game for them, especially because the fighting system has changed and its far more difficult to charge in an army with a knife the infiltration was enhanced too, more challenging so really more interesting.
