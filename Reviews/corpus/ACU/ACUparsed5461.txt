its beautiful.. my comp runs it on high everything and it works great... until there is a crowd, or a fight, sometimes a cinimatic.... but usually works great.... but  a lot of crashes... otherwise good, just a lot of crashes..... i know this is the first day release... but i mean i thought the beta testing was done months ago... or atleast before now... also,, from all the reviews im reading most people seem to be having problems with this game running on thier computers... so i dont know if everyone over and ubisoft who playtested  if they playtested this game used teh same over powered computer,  and i mean they would have to be over powered to make mine and others on the reviews computers look like crap  but im hearing a lot and seeing a lot of problems with this... hoping there will be some patches soon to fix all the problems fingers crossedlooks great, when it runs it runs well... but most of the time it crashes... sorry but again with the uplay bs... got the gold edition dont even know where those benifits come into play, probably somewhere after all the crashes.... oh well...  will check it out again in a couple months when theyve hopefully had enough time to iron out hte bugs....  sad when 2 person startups can successfully launch a game, and when you got multimillion dollar startups hundreds of employees and enough money to do it right and they still do it wrong.....  .... sigh...
