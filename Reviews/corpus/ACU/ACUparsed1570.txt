So the game ran fine on my computer on ultra high and mine is only a 800 dollar rig. Encountered no bugs.However, this was still my least favorite Assassins Creed game so far for a few different reasons.The combat really bugs me, you dont get that same rush of power chain killing 10 enemies at once. Because you cant. You are going to get hurt in this game. You also cant use the assassins blade in combat.Combat is just a lot harder and not as fluid as the others, its hard to dodge gunshots and those guns will kill you in one or two shots which gets very annoying.This game forced me to utilize stealth, through the whole game because I just wanted to avoid the awkward battling as much as possible.Without spoiling anything I can also say the ending left a sour taste in my mouth. Did not enjoy the ending,I still recommend playing through it because all Assassins Creed games are worth playing, but this one is definitely skippable and not worth 100 percenting.
