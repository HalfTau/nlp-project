Talk about a shstorm on here. So many people going on about the specs. To me specs have always been a guide line. It almost always seems like the specs are way over, what you really need to play the game. My setup is a ....GeForce GTX 660 tI                                                                                                                                                                                         IntelR CoreTMi73370 CPU 3.40ghZ                                                                                                                           Memory 16 GB 15.95 usable                                                                                                                    OS Windows 8.1.So that being said, Im playing this game on the Very high graphical setting not ultra. And Ive had no major problems. Such as crashing. The framerate does suck in this game. But to me, its playable. And yes it is unexpectable for game to have this bad of framerate issues like this, today. In some reviews on here that I read. They were using a 960GTX. And there having the same problems as me. And at times they would experience NPCs disappearing / reappearing. And textures poping back  forth. This would almost always happen in big crowds. Which I have experienced. But it only happens in a really big crowd. When your going down the streets  passing people or running on the roof tops. The game plays fine. But my point is its not the specs thats messing up the game. I believe the problem is, there rushing a game for the Holidays. All for the all mighty dollar. And of coarse this game still needs work. It just seems  like uplay doesnt have a quality control. And like other companies they say...Oh well fix that later with some updates  patches. Whatever happened to making sure a product worked right, before they release it to the public. The dollar wins out again lol.Im sure this game will be sweet I hope after a couple patches. But almost every game I get. The required settings are way over,  specs for my set up. And until now I have always played games on the highest settings ultra possible. But playing this game on very highsetting is not to bad. I wont lie I was like everyone else.... that my rig is getting out of date. I spent close to 2,000 on my PC  that was 2 years ago. And the first year the computer was bearly usable, thanks to Windows 8. Im sure there in cahoots with this graphic card companies. To force the consumer to run out  upgrade there graphics card. Its a dirty business, like everything else in this world. It all comes down to money. Well back to this game, the cut scenes on this game are kind of choppy FPS. The game does look down right beautiful. Sometimes its hard to play it. Because you just want to stare at everything.And these people complaining, dont they want games to look as good as they can? If they had a better set up, would they still be mad about the specs ? Yeah it does suck that there trying to force us to upgrade our graphics card. It seems like gaming PCS arent lasting as long as they used to. But I guess Im cool with that. Because it keeps the lower class gamers on consoles. If gaming PCs lasted a long time everyone would have one. And I for one dont want that. Xbox  PS can keep the poddy mouth little kids on there. I for one dont like a troubled 12 year old talking trash to me online. Thats why PCs are the master race! So this is to all the reveiws Ive been reading about this game. I believe this game is worth the money.But does have some issues. If you want a smooth running game. I would wait a couple months. I believe its not so much the specs, that is the problem. Its some bugs  frame rate issues. But as a AC fan. the game was expectable to me...for the most part.  And it will be one of the games Ill be playing the most this holiday season.The only really bad thing I can say about this game. Is get rid of the uplay. Gamers just want to play the game they bought. Without having to jump through a bunch of hoops. Well, thats my 2 cents
