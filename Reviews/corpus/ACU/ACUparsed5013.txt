unfortunately until they get the optimization and frame rates under control I cant recommend this game to anyone. Its hard to give a positive review on this as its difficult to play and im certain its probably as fun as the other assassin creed games. Like I said until these two issues are fixed and resolved I dont forsee any great changes from various peoples comments and reviews for awhile So my advice do not purchase yet.
