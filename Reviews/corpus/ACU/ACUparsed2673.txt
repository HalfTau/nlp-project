I really shouldnt have to fiddle with control panels and outofgame settings to get it to stop studdering and run almost okay with my superclocked gtx 970. I mean at least I didnt have to install an outside mod for the game like I did with WatchDogs. The games okay I guess though. Framerate is still very bad for what it is, the graphics arent good enough to justify the framerate honestly. You cant run it on anything less than high end graphics cards, back when I had my 750ti I could only get 40fps with lowest settings at 720p, and even then the studdering didnt stop.But because Im an idiot I bought it anyway. I guess I was hoping maybe I could start to enjoy it since I have my new graphics card, but honestly, even at 30 this game really runs way too  to justify buying it.Im not suggesting you download it illegally, but Ubisoft, really, if you want people to actually pay for your games you should maybe consider making quality products that are worth actually paying for.
