A lot of people might say that this game is sht! A lot of people say that because of the parkour system! A lot of people have not played this game after the patch they did! The parkour now feels really fluid and easy to control. Theres a lot of customization and weapons to get and as the cherry on top of the cake Coop! Get a few friends to play with and there you have hours of fun! My PC can barely handle this game so Im playing on the lowest settings, but the game still looks amazing! Yes, it has a lot of glitches, but think about it. A game without glitches is a booring game! BTW, the Dead Kings dlc is really well made!
