Story was cliched, weak, and unsatisfying with no followup on important aspects and no real buildup to any character. The game is essentially chase, break in, kill, repeat. The stealth mode was a great addition, and the interiors are awesome, but all that bull about the crowds being alive never came into play. Paris is nice to look at, but I would have rathered just been given a free camera through the world than waste my time on such a lousy storyline. It felt like a revamped original AC, but I wouldve prefered the original.TLDR  Weakest AC story, best mechanics
