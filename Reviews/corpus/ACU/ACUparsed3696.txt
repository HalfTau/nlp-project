Well now more then ever I can indeed recommend this game.1. Im a fan of AC2. They actually did fix the game with the latest 1.4 patch3. It looks amazing, and with the right rig you can get to 50fps on max settings with fxaa, I did with my gtx 970 MSI.So yeah the gameplay is different from the other games in the series. new parkour system, combat, graphics, side mission, and more but for me its different in a good way, its fresh, the gameplay is smoother, and one of the main things that ive liked about ACU is that you have plenty things to do after the main mission like the co op missions. I do feel that the money ive spent gives me the fun Ive expected from this game.
