Assassins Creed Unity is really not that bad as everyone says. It only got bad reviews because of the FPS lags. But I decided to buy it a week ago, and I must say, one of the best games I have ever played. So if its on sale go buy it! really cool game! And for everyone thinking there is still FPS drops and lags, I dont have any of them anymore, its fixed, dont worry. I play on a GTX 970, and I get 7080 FPS when roaming the world.
