Okay so just to make it clear  I have hella more hours than it says , I spend the majority of my time playing offline down to my amazingly bad internet  so my game time isnt counted.But as for the game however, wow.I feel although the previous games were great Ubiosft out alot of effort into this game in contrast to some others in its previous series. The map itself is extremely large with so much going on at one time  hundreds of civillians are dotted around the streets, fighting, talking and even stealing which in effect makes the game seem that more realistic.The graphics are beautiful, so much detail has been put into your surroundings which placed the game that one step up from Assassins Creed IV Black Flag.I feel another part of the game that makes me love it more is the element of customization implemented by Ubisoft into the game. Your given a large selection of armour to buy, unlock and find  ranging from Hoods, Chests, Legs, Forearms, colours etc along with a seperate outfit section allowing the player to wear costumes worn by previous assassins from older games.The story I feel could be the biggest let down, although I enjoyed the story, I feel it becomes very repetetive very early on  but Its still a change from constantly sailing about like you were in Black Flag.Physcially, the game is quite difficult to run for PCs at a low budget  with the mass map to render along with the in depth textures and the many bodies to load whilst moving at speed. Another downfall is the bugs and glitches found in the game  I find them hilarious to watch though XD.To get a sample of hardware benchmarksat the time of this review, my PC was made up ofi5 3470GTX 9508GB DDR3 1333MHzI hope this review helps you, I love the game.
