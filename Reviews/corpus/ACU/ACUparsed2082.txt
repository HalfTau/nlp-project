One of the absolute worst examples of anticonsumerism in the games industry, hands down. It is a buggy mess more than a year after release, with incredibly floaty and unprecise controls that only work half the time, in addition to online features crowbarred in for no reason other than justifying an alwaysonline system backing it.It is also padded and drawn out with collectables and sidemissions that are literally on the level of go here and kill this guy for a few pennies.In short, its a typical Assassins Creed game. I got this at a hefty discount, but I wouldnt recommend this at any price. Ubisoft doesnt deserve to earn anything for developing and publishing this mess of a game.
