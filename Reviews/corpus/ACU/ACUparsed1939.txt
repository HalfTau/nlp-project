So far i saw this game has the best climbing and fighting animations by comparing to Syndicate or Black Flag. But sometimes the frame drops unpredictably. The graphic is very good as well, Paris architectures have been made with detail, exactly the same with reallife version, for example the Notre Dame. The Pantheon. Moreover, you can play with your friends in this game through the coop feature. This one has made the game become more attractive than any other version of Assassin Creed.
