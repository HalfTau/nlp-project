Honestly I want to say I reccommend this game as I love the series, but this is simply too much. I cannot deal with all the bugs and game breaking framerate issues. If they would polish it up I would reccommend it but from what Ive seen button mashing scenes and various other cutscenes are rendered unbeatable when the FPS drops below 6 which is almost constant even on a gaming computer.
