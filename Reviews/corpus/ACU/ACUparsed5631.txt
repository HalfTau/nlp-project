This game is a disgrace to the franchise! Yeah, the story might be good... IF I COULD FREAKING PLAY THE THING!I have to restart the game every ten minutes becuase of crashes and graphical glitches! Seriously, save your money until they update it a few times. The ammount of bugs are ridiculous! I have a masterful PC and I cant even play long enough to hear dialog!
