I hope whoever made this game as hard as it is stubs his bare toe into a metal post and falls down 20 flights of stairs. Seriously, not everyone is a goddam Hitman Perfectionist. I dont downright suck at stealthing, but jesus man, how can I sneak when theres 50 dudes in one building who flip out the second they see you? I dont want to spend 4 hours on one mission because they instantly recognize me when they see me. The difficulty in this game gave me nothing butgrief.Why the fck are Phantom Blades so freaking expensive for a new player? Whos idea was that? Are these darts made of platinum or some sht?When I saw the new trailer, I thought this game would revolve the romance story of Arno and Elise. Ezios romances were interesting in the past, so hey, why not? LOLOLOL NOPE, DATSHT. Elise barely shows up for most of the main campaign. I felt like the only reason I understood the romance at all was because I read the book. The game doesnt tell you why they love each other, or how the came to love each other. It just glosses over that by having Arno reminisce about stuff.Microtransactions, Ubisoft? Really? Gofkurself.The ONLY REEDEMING THING ABOUT THIS is the freerunning. THATS IT. I want my 60 dollars back.
