So my initial review was the game wasnt optimized, ran buggy, and was broken in anyway that included Multiplayer. I am happy to say that my review still hasnt changed. This game is a great example of how Ubisoft can just drop one big pile ofthat was glorified through hype. I would suggest not playing this game at all because youll just be dissapointed. I still cant make myself play the game because when i get in and the first time i see people pop in i get sad. this game took the trust of its consumers and said  you guys, im going home. DO NOT BUY..... instead if you really wanna try it but are concerned you cant run it, or will enjoy it........ Yar Har, tiddly dee.
