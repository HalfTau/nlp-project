I fell in love with the addition of equipable heavy and long weapons. The parkour is jsut assasins creed  Though the downparkour mechanics are little bit weird sometimes and dont always do what you want to! The story istnt that special or exciting but it definitly isnt bad at all. The viewpoints on towers and churches... are very well made and beautifull but they all seem kinda too bright even when I put down the brightnes level.
