I jumped headstrong into this game. My last Ubisoft purchase was the Black Flag game, which was very enjoyable and fufilling.I had preordered this game, blind to what was to hinder my good opinion. The inital gameplay demo of this left me very convinced, with the new aspects of numerous crowds, character customization, and a completely new combat and parkour system. Upon release, the games promise was shattered, as the continuous amount of horriying bugs became the majority of discussion about the game. Well, two years later, I come back to change my opinions about this game. Most of the bugs have been fixed, and we can now play the game.My only regrets to buying this game was buying it sooo early, and not realizing that even my 3.8 GHz laptop could barley pull out 30 fpsTLDRA little more than a year from release, the game is void of the cancerous glitchesFirst and bestIMO Assassins Creed game to incorporate the character customizationJust make sure you have a supercomputer to play it
