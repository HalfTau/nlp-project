Hi,     I love the game, it taks alot to make games and most people dont understand that games have problems, I got the new COD for my ps3 and it freezes all the time, doesnt mean Im stop playing it. I have been playing ACREED for years and I found that the story rocks and not a big fan when people talk down to programers it took them 2yrs to make this game and I was proud to buy the early copy and season pass but never give up on what we love playing games. Want to say thank you to the people who work hard to put this out thank you Steam for beening the best software for computers and over all STOP BASHING HARD WORK  if we could all understand why they go threw to put out a game u would understand.......
