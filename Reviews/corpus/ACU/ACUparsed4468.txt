i realy wanted to play this game but when i start it it immediately crashes anny fixes i try on the internet appear to be fakes so had just completely wasted 100 euros on the gold edition and seasons pass prepurchase.... i would realy like that fixed because my laptop should be able to run it acording to its stats.
