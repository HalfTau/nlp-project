Im writing this finally after many years of severe annoyance to the point of insanity. After all this time, still uncompleted. the culprit of the game is just so bludy awful with appaling control systems especially whilst climbing, and annoying bugs like gamebreakers and only knowing constraights after youve screwed it up. and just the general crappyness of never, ever having a nice decent freerun because, ok with time one can judge the rooftops quite well, but ALOT of time... and on the streets no chance, some idiot gets in your way or youll leap atop a flimsly market stool for no reason.... some may argue the amount of people add to the realism.... yes yes it does, but when was Paris rush hour ever considered fun...i could generally go on but im not going to. Just felt like a rant to be honest. Awful design
