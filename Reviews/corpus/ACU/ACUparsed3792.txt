I originally gave this game a thumbs up, but that was before I actually really started on it. I had framerate issues from the start, not the unplayable 15 FPS people were talking about, but right around 46 FPS, if even that. Even with that small issue in mind, I still liked the game. It was beautiful, with the wonderful image of Paris. That all changed, however, when I couldnt complete missions because of characters I was supposed to follow falling through the ground. It is a pain, also, when I jump out of a window only to find myself levatating in the air 30 feet above the ground, and have to restart from my last checkpoint. Dont get me wrong, I still love this game, but with still some glitches unresolved and the like, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who didnt want a horrible work of progress on there hands. Of course, It could be just me having issues... If you are insisting on getting it, get when its on sale. I made the mistake of PreOrdering it back in October. I had low expectations but I was ready to deal with whatever came when I finally took the time to download it in late December. That all changed. I just hope that Ubisoft made a New Years resolution to fix the game. I still love ACU for some reason after all this...
