I really recommend this, the game is great sometimes bugs can be seen but I just ignore them. Graphics are amazing and the 17s France is a great idea. The story was fine, a bit hard to understand what you where doing and it was kind of short. Other than that this game is amazing and I highly recommend it to every Assassins Creed player.
