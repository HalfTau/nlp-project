well im glad to see im not the only one thats had grafical problems and BTW ty UBI for takeing a total crap on a good series  how and why would a company such as this even release a game in this condition i mean seriously do you guys not even look at your product before you put your name and release date on it anymore ...... such poor FPS when ever you engage enemy it just gets so choppy. i hope you guys stop having your kids make video games for you out of your garage cus it shows in the quality1st patch came through still faild to fix a thing that i can see still choppy as hell. i mean the older Assains Creeds were so much fun its sad to see this happen to such a good title.
