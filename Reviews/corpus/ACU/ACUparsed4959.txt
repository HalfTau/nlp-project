Assassins Creeds ports to pc were never too good but this one is the lowest they have gone. This game suffers from fps problems. Would not recomend buying this title just now if you dont have a 780 ti or better graphics card. The day one patch was released one day later then it should have been released. The patch fixed cut scene fps drops but the gameplay fps is still a bit wonkey. Had to turn AA off and graphics to high with my TITAN. Story is intresting atleast to this point but a little bit predictable at times. When they fix the fps  problems then I would recommend this title but until then I would pass.
