A dissapointment in the Assassins saga. Broken controls, confusing directions and very buggy from textures, to controls and movement. The story failed to grasp my attention like the previous titles and the map was soon filled with repetetive and uninteresting sidequests to help the 15 hr story line feel...better. I am continuing to try and finish the story so my review may change. So far 4.5/10.
