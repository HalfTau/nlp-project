Good game, fun to play with friends. Its still in work as we speak it has a lot of FPS problems, an asortment of glitchest whilst opening chests/unlocking doors and so on. Its always fun to see a couple of glitches/bugs here and there, as long as it doesnt completely annihilate your experience with the game i.e duplication glitch, invinsibilty, ect. Still hasnt happened to me, any of that I have listed, and dont expect those kinds of glitches as I play.. Still, it can happen. Fun game over all, enjoy playing it!
