So I finished the main sequence like 10 mins ago. And I feel the urge to write my first review.I dont get why most of you are hating on ubisoft or what not.First to the gameI kind of liked it. In my oppinion, one of the best ACs although the story is not that emotionally intoxicating like AC2 or Black Flag. I think there could have been a somewhat more intense story setting in the french revolution please do not get me wrong, it IS a great story, but I had a different feeling after completing Black flag  I was kind of sad. Lets see what the dlc will bring.Second the technical asprectsyeah, i did not experience anything negative  hardware related  at all, but to be honest my rig is relatively new i74790k 8gb ram 780 it is sufficient for ultra settings with hbao  although you have to accept some frame drops but i think they are more related to my hardware and not to optimization things.Most of all, I want to say something concerning the bugs and whatsnot in the gameif you EVER were into coding you would know that even something easy like programming an address book or what not is hard enough. so what i want to say is that i can not imagine how a company  even ubisoft, ea or whoever  is able to test the software on all combinations of hardware and driver versions, so i dont get why so many people are hating on that. do i apologise companies publishing incomplete games? absolutely not. but i think with even greater software projects it is impossible to test said software on all possible machines. excluding ps and xbox because the publisher KNOWS the hardware so no excuse on that front. so yeah, i dont want to know how much money is spent on debbuging a game like unity. Hope you agree at some point with me
