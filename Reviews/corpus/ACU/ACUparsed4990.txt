Spend your hard earned money onto another game. This game, Assassins Creed Unity is really Lame, The game has gotten away from what it could have been as for the story line and the only city worth being in for you do not have an option of other cities to visit. Laggie, lag sceens failed story lines. Not true to form of the Creed soma. I do not recommend that you spend your chips onto this Miserable Game.
