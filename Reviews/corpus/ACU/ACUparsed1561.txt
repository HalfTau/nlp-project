One word to describe this game  boring....  Just not fun. If you want a simulation of 1789 Paris that you can run around and say Wow. Look at Notre Dame and St. Chapelle! Then this is the game for you. If you want interesting quests, side quests, and combat, well then you better keep looking because those aspects of the game are just... like I said before... booooooring. Go talk to this person and then this person and retrieve this object! YAY!!!!!! Go grab a bunch of these chests that are just laying around in plain site... YAY!!!!! Accidentally run into some guard and then kill him like he has no clue you are even attacking him.... YAY!!!!!!!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRINNNNNNNNG! Your money is better spent elsewhere.
