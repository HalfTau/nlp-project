To start with, i like this game... so far. Please note I am only on sequence 3, however I have played over 30 hours of the game. I like to roam the map and explore. It is smooth and easy to get on with, The graphics and fluid motion of the gameplay make it very enjoyable. However, the controls are not very user friendly. Now I am a die hard AC fan and have played every single one of the AC games through at least twice, but this one is very different. With AC 3, Black Flag and Rouge, the combat controls were good and easy to grasp. Unity however... well I dont like it. To parry and counter is not easy and I end up losing a lot of health, or even dying,,. a lot. Even free running and climbing has changed. Again, I do not like it. I cant climb in the direction i want or even jump where I want. In order to play this game you will need patience,,, and at least 7 thumbs for all the buttons you will need to press at once. I play controler btw.All in all, good game. not great, but good. I would say 7 out of 10 overall, but the graphics and attention to detail with the architecture and population... excellent. 9.5 out of 10.I hope this has helped any of you on the fence about getting this game. I read a lot of bad reviews, but I love the AC franchise so just went for it. And Ubisoft... keep up the good work. Just maybe keep things that work as they are. IE controls.Peace out baby.
