Assassins Creed Unity was, in my opinion, one of the most promising games of this year. It still is. Great, highresolution graphics, amazing aesthetics, and a breathtaking world perfectly uphold, even surpass, the already high expectations for the franchise. Coop play is a genius addition, and the interactive AI seem cutting edge.However, this potential was immediately destroyed by severe performance issues and gamebreaking glitches in almost every stage of the game. Instantly, the title screen peaked my frames per second at 2, which is, in retrospect, the best I got throughout the experience, despite my uptodate system. NPCs teleported around me in the tutorial fights, and my character would randomly turn 180 degrees when running. I had looked through the reviews before purchase, but dismissed the glitches as the price of playing a new, unpolished game. However, this was not the case the game is absolutely unplayable and unenjoyable. I realize that the team behind this game is working to solve these problems, and I do not blame them for the issues but game is CLEARLY not ready to be released to the public. From the reviews, I know I am not the only one to be let down by this, and likely wont be the last. Until these MAJOR issues are solved, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.I am a huge fan of the AC franchise, and I have loved every game in it. However, this is not acceptable. Whether deadlines or poor testing is the fault of this, it is not what was promised to the buyer, and this is not what I paid for.
