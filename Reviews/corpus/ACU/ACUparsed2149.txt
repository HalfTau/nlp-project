As a fan of AC series, I will recommend you to grab Blag Flag instead. AC Unity has some great game mechanism reworked, such as up and down parkour, but the other parts, for example, ALL THINGS WHICH IS MADE FOR MULTIPLAYER, arent quite work out. The storyline is terrible without deep story background and weak motivation for characters and the ending, OMG! !.
