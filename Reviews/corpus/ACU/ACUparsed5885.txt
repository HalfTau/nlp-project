Insanely good. Best AC game to date actually. Im blown away at the tiny details Ubisoft implemented from scuff marks on the tile floor when the light hits it at the right angle, the interiors of buildings, the unique personality of each character even in the massive crowds, the fluid free running, the realistic combat, the stealth mechanics, hell even the way the sun hits a character and makes them glow  it looks real.Graphics are INSANE. Hands down the most beautiful game Ive ever seen.I dont know what everyone elses issues are, maybe theyre missing a patch? Cutscenes produce a little lag but they roll straight into the missions so I assume there is background loading. Aside from tiny drops in fps during cinematics I have no issues.MSI GT70 Dominator895GTX 870 3GB VRAMi74810mq8 GB RAMI am currently playing on 1920x1080 all settings maxed with the exception of antialiasing which Nvidia recommends to be set at MSAA2x, however I am playing on FXAA.This game is gorgeous and extremely well done. Stealth, new navigation experience and ease of travel with free running, beautiful setting, awesome combat... what else can I say? Would I recommend this to a friend? Already have to them all.Assassins Creed Unity Overall  10/10
