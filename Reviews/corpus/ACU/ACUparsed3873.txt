Donestly im dissapointed in myself to have spent 60 on this game. Its buggy, constantly crashes and worst of all it includes microtransactions somthing i had hoped ubisoft had left in there mobile games. honestly if they fixed all of the problems the comunity has BEEN REPORTING it may be a good experience i have enjoyed the story with what i have played, but with the state the game is in now i would say go get farcry or some other nonbuggy, nonMicrotransaction game.
