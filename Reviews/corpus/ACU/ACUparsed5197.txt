Dispite all negative reactions on performance, this is a great game. If you have old hardware, buy new hardware.If you could play AC4 Black Flag on high/ultra settings you can play Unity. On my i3 3.3Ghz, 4Gb Ram and GTX760 Unity runs fine in high/ultra mixed settings at 1280p. Sometimes there is a little delay in the cutscenes.Combatsystem and stealth system are greatly improved. Parcour is much more fun now you can descent smoothly.Whole Paris is beautiful, very nice detail and a lot of activity. It looks like a real living town.If you entre one of the accessable buildings you see people at work etc. And the interiors are like people really live there.Lightning is wonderfull. Especialy in churches when the sun comes thru the colored windows.Sure there are some glitches in gameplay, i.e. sometimes hanging on a ledge and not able to get down. Then you must go up a little to go down another way. But that doesnt spoil the gameplay.So if you like the AC series, this is a must buy. If your hardware is not good enough, dont buy this game or better, buy new hardware. The game is worth it.
