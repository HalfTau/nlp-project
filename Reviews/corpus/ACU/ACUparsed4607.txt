i was worried when i saw all these negative reviews about this game. i was trying to buy it since the first day it came out and i NOW regret nothing. the game is totally playable on my GTX 670. YUP, under the MINIMUM requirements.i am getting a solid 30 fps with VERY HIGH settings with FXAA and SOFTSHADOWS most of the time  Sometimes above 40 to 50  which is not that bad considering ubisofts crazy requirements.If you have an outdated GPU like mine and you insist on using very high graphics in this game, you might wanna cap your fps to 30 to get rid of the annoying fps stutter because the fps wont stay above 30 all the time and you might notice the difference in speed when the fps drop, though i never got my fps below 30 so far.Dont forget to update your Graphics card and download the patches for the game!im still playing it as you are reading this, and I. AM. HAPPY!PS Do Not use the Companion App of the game, its bugged and might get your saved game deleted, Altairs outfit and the blue boxes can wait til everything gets fixed. Arent worth losing your progress for dat. And also do not add anyone in the Ingame Contacts, there is a bug that gets your game crashed whenever you look into the contacts. you can do anything except looking at your contacts lol.they are working for a fix.My Computers specs are.GPU GTX 670 OCCPU i7 3770 3.40RAM 16GB
