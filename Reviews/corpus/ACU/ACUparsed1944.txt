well after a launch one can only call pathetic and shamefull. people didnt have high hopes for this game. but after a year and a half you would expect a game that would be glitch and bug free well guess what yo  u      ar  e     s   o      wr o    n   gt  h  i   s   so g l i tchy its  fuc    king up t hhe r  evie wwith the new of ubisoft not publishing a assassins creed game this year lets hope they spend the time to fix this absolute pisspot of a game. the game is a very good medival fashion simulater though so 4 out of 10and 10 out of 10 for medival fashion sim
