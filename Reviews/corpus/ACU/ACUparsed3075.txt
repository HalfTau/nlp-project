I held off on getting Unity for ages due to all the bad reviews and posts about the bugs. It was with some trepidation that I tried it  whilst the main story isnt great it is still on par with Black Flag as my favorite AC game I have played all except Rogue so far. For all the initial teething problems it had, it does get a lot right.The Coop gameplay is a dream and even gives you more content if you just want to play the missions single player. The cover system works for the most part too but they parkour system in this game is much better than previous versions. On top of that the game looks absolutely beautiful.I have so far over 100 hours played admittidley a fair bit of that is AFK waiting for funds to roll into my cafe chest and Im not yet done with the Dead Kings DLC and I love trying to nail the heist Coop missions solo so will likely still get a fair few hours of play.
