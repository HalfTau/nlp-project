 dont know why people hate this game for its imperfections. that was launch day. now the patches have been released and it works flawless with me. now this is the best game i ever played, even better than AC3. note that my game runs fine and my computer is old and weak. money worth it!Update Couple of months later, some patches, an i got a high end gaming PC. I can play the game on ultra now. My old review still counts but now you absolutely MUST buy this game. Do it. if you are poor then just go and play Hello Kitty Fun Adventure. Oh wait, you dont want to? THen buy this game.
