If you enjoyed previous Assassins Creed games, youll probably enjoy this one just as much. But be warned the rumors are true, the game is a little buggy, and the framerates drag from time to time, even with a brand new beast like a GTX 970.Youll find the same things in this game, that have drawn you to other games in the series. Lots of free running, lots of sneaking around, and lots of side quests additionally, they brought back the idea of giving you an objective, and letting you accomplish it how you see fit, be that via brute force, stealth, or by taking advantage of numerous distraction opportunities. Im not sure how anyone else has reacted, but the coop is quite a bit of fun as well...Its something that this game series should have had a long time ago, in my opinion. The graphics are also pretty fantastic in this new installment.Take this for what its worth. Im enjoying the game, but am disappointed with its less than stellar release, however I am contented waiting for further updates. If that doesnt sound like your cup of tea, I recommend passing on this one, and maybe grabbing on sale in several months when more issues have been worked out. Ill be honest, Ubisoft kind of pisses me off, but Im glad they have been sticking with it so far, and continue to release update patches.All in all, given that I love this game series, Ill give it a recommendation.
