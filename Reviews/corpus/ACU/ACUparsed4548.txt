ACU was great at the start...of the first cinematic. After that you may still find enjoyment and the ability to look past the few bugs. I.E. randomly falling through ground, watching random people appear in places they shouldnt, and low frame rates. All that sounds minor for a big fan like myself, until you are completing a story mission and a random silhouette shows up asking you to join Coop. This should never even been allowed, but you avoid the silhouette to focus on your story mission only to get a loading screen. Cut Scene?! Nope you just loaded into a Coop mission which you exit only to have the game lag and then corrupt your save file after you try to restart. No support from Ubisoft after almost a week of wait for your ticket to be answered and there goes a weeks worth of play time. Since this is the second time I have lost a save file because of glitch or server sync issue, I have no issues warning other buyers of this game that bugs and glitches are to be expected, but if you release two patches within seven days...you might have well just called release a beta launch.Bottom line Game was not fully developed, mobile app does not sync always, game can corrupt itself, Coop is limited to only the free roam and specified mission, and most Coop mission glitch to point where you cannot complete them. Save your money and wait till all bugs fixed or just avoid. Get Shadows of Mordor or something else with that money.
