Well, at first view i was agree with the othres saying that the game WAS unplayeable but now they have launch a lot of updates and the game now is Fully Playable, maybe not at 100 performance unless you have a Nasa Computer Joking but nowadays the games is fully playable without the lost of FPS.ATTENTION If you want to use INITIATES in game please check before if its running cause if its on maintenance the game will freeze.Las for all,being a HUGE fan of the AC series i give the game a 10/10 because Ubisoft fix the game as they said and gift us one free game as reward
