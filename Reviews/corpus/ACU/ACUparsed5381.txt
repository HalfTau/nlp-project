This game seems to be getting a lot of negative flak. Personally I think has the best mechanics of the series and the CoOp is done really well. Graphics are also amazing but extremely demanding. Sorry a lot of people cant seem to enjoy this because it really is a fantastic game in all respects outside of performance.
