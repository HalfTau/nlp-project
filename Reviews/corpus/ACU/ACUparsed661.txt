I cant find any fault with the gameplay which always remains the same, but unity did not fulfill my expectation for something new and unique like Black flag which has pirate battle and Ezio franchise which has building your own brother hood and exploring unique places. so fare i have completed the main story line in unity and lost interest to play there after because the isnt any other interesting side quest to keep me motivated to play this game.i am just loosing more interest with AC franchise after desmon dies. because the is no link to the following sequels there after, but i still would recommend this game.
