Seriously disappointed in Ubisoft for their lack in quality control. This game seems like it would be enjoyable, but given that it crashes on me every 3045 minutes even with the graphics all the way down I just cannot get into it. It is especially frustrating when I am midmission and I have to restart due to a crash.If you seriously want this game, wait until the new patches come out to fix the many, many issues with this game. Or else youll just hate that you bought it.Im done with Ubisoft. ACU is a middle finger to the fans.
