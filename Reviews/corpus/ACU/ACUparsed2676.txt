The game may have, at some point been as unoptimized as people say, but i can asure you as of the recent patches the game runs fine. Ive been playing 6 hours straight on my single gtx 760 on all highest settings and the lowest my fps has gone is 39. Yes 39 Frames per second on a single gtx 760. Message me if youd like to know if you can run it. Or if you are on the fence about buying, ill gladly help you come to a conclusion, to all of those negative reviewers. you should try the game out now and update your review because i held off on buying this for a while because of that, and after purchasing im a bit mad nobody bothered to tell me they fixed 9 out of 10 bugs they had. Yes i would recommend this game.
