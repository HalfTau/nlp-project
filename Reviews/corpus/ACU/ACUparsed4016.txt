Ive always been fond of the AC chronicles.  Black Flag, this games predecessor, I believe, made a huge leap in terms of graphical improvement and immersion.  Ive always been fond of gimmicks, because, well, for gimmicks sake why wouldnt you find fun in something that was created and implemented to be anything other than being fun.  Ive also been fond of the eyecatchingly stunning that minute visual  that engulfs with something new and enticing.Do I recommend this game?well...ask me again when Ive finally found a way to play itOn a serious note though, concerning updates and patch and furthmore playability  I was able to play this game unhindered from release day.  Ive found no troubles and didnt know a forum even existed on how broken the game itself was till...Patch update...thats right, after many complaints I guess manpower decided it was unfair that some got to play their new game.  So they decide to patch the game so nobody, including myself, can play the game without at the very least, run into a hurdle or just not be able to play at all.  BUT...more complaints came in, they had to think fast make the game slighty the same it was before so some, not as many, can play the game... honestly I dont truly believe this kind of mindset, but just the thought of it   pause   ALL OF MY RAGE!    you can have it.Patch 4    broken dream my friendsSo they upgraded this situation Ive been having with their game.  before, it was just random crash to desktop now its the new and improve crash on menu stall.  A new kind of immersion I believe, not only can you not AltF4 out of the unresponsive void, but theyve somehow managed to disable the ability to CtrlAltDel from this gameor at least mous function so youd be able to hit that End Task button, brush up on your keyboard commands.tldr  Recommend?  The game in its current alpha stages....                  NO
