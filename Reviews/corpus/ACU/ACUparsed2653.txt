Graphics are beautiful. the game is not very well optimized. i have a GTX 780 overclocked and it runs at 30fps or lower at max settings at 1080p. the gameplay is okay, but sometimes i fell like Arno is mentally  because he doesnt understand that WHEN I WANT HIM TO RUN AWAY FROM THE GUYS FROM THE GUNS, I DONT WANT HIM TO HANG ON A WALL FOR 3 HOURS WHILE GETTING SHOT TO DEATH!!! basically the movement is good, but can be pretty shotty at times because it is trying to hard to predict where you are going instead of actually going where you want it to.
