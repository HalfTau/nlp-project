Just cant recommend this game, first assassins creed game I have completely failed to appreciate since I took a break from the series after Black Flag. Story is dull and missions are oversimplified to the point where your hand is being held. Enemies are boring and combat lacks interest. Stealth mechanic is interesting but fails to compete with games that already have stealth implemented.
