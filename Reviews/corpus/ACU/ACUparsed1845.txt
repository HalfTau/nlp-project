Semifun storyline, the graphics are okay, gameplay is a bit shotty, some bugs and glitches, overall it is kinda oring and Ive lost interest, its nothing new, the combat is the same as the other game, the badguys are the same, just French, its the same old good vs. the evil tyranny........ Its not worth the mony its asking for. If it was 5 yeah, thatd be a better price.
