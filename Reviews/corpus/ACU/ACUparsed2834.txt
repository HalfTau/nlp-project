So the first 10 minutes of gameplay nearly had me request a refund... but then I decided to give it more of a chance then I got into the main story and gameplay and wow, just wow, this is becoming my favourite AC title already. The story is as good as AC 2 60fps at Ultra with GTX 780 Slower more artistic sword fights The sheer scale of the game, it is back to basics but with a living vivid city to explore. Some minor clipping when climbing buildings Characters faces could be more detailed, still look very AC 3ish
