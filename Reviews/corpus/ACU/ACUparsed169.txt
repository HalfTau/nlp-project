Honestly, Ive been a Assassins Creed fan, since the beginning of the ride, and still it tasts so good.  dont know what people are complaining about but, My favourite was AC2, since then i didnt had a favourite AC game,  played them all till on Unity, but something changed and this game has its ability, the game is just perfect in any way, and the actions of Arno, reflects almost the same thing of Ezio, trust me you will agree with me. Ezio wanted to have revenge of his familiy, well Arno is there for Revolution, they have a goal a objective to go, the money you gonna waste for this game deserves everything trust me its worth it, people are complaining about FPS, you got my word i didnt had any kind of issue even my specs are not on top notch, and i played on High settings, anyways there might be a few combat issues like a bi glitchy but overall damn the story is so good in this game, so from now AC2 and ACUNTY is my favourite one, lets see what sydincate has to offer.
