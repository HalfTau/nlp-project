Yes, recommended, IFDo you like history and geopolitics through the lens of occult societies? Is this game on sale right now? Are you playing it after Patch 5? Are you willing to spend a day tweaking drivers, AA, AF and quality settings? Do you have at least a Haswell quadcore i7 and GTX 960 with 4GB VRAM or equivalent? Are you familiar withHave you played Assassins Creed before and like the general gameplay style? Are you willing to accept that the screenshots shown on the Store Page are most likely only achievable at the very highest graphic settings requiring at least a GTX 980Ti with DSR, etc.? Can you tolerate UPlay long enough to actually play the game?If you answered yes to ALL of the above, then this game is for you!If you answered NO to any of the above, then check out Dishonored, a bizarre but beautiful tactical stealth as opposed to open world per se gaming experience without all the monstrosity of a modern Assassins Creed game.Update  I finished the game, played more hours than on record because I set it to offline to avoid all the UPlay and other stuff.Overall Experience7/10 for AC fans Ubisoft certainly put a ton of effort into this game, that is unfortunately also the drawback, too dense contentMain Storyline6.5/10 too many Grand Masters can spoil the broth, but interesting nonethelessDead Kings Storyline8/10 compact but classic AC experience
