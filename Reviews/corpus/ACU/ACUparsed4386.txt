So, I made a review of this game, saying it was all good and just fantastic etc... At that moment I was too much of a UBISOFT and Assassins Creed fan. I still do consider myself an Assassins Creed fan, but Ubisoft? They can go suck aPerformance is complete if I am lucky I will reach 30FPS. Never higher, mostly less. Paying the price I did for this, I regret this buy, with all my heart.Pretty much like everyone else is saying, you need a Companion App to unlock certain chests, just the setup of the whole system they got going on in this game, is Horrible. Gameplay itself is amazing, story is amazing. Optimization is horrible, support is horrible. I have been able to complete 2 out of I dont know how many Coop missions, some of them I even had to play alone, because the game, as said before, cannot connect to uPlay. And also the fact that they have certain gear in the game, which you need Helix Points for, which, GUESS WHAT! Cost money! I , like many others , are done with Ubisoft games. They used to have amazing games, I refer mostly to the Splinter Cell series, or the beginning of the AC series, because back then they actually gave a damn about their community. Unfortunately today Ubisoft has just become one of many money hungry companies. I wish many more could see it the same way that I and a few others do.If we could make a point towards Ubisoft, meaning DONT BUY THEIR STUPID ING GAMES, CUZ THEY WONT GET BETTER. We may have the good old days back. Unless they just give up out of pure laziness and shut the company down. To be completely honest tho, I think that would be for the best.Dont buy this huge piece ofgame, youre going to be disappointed, unless you are one of the FEW people who can actually run this game with 60 FPS and have the RARE LUCK being able to play coop games. If you want to play it just for the sake of trying it out, download it
