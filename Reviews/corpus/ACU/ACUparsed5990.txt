I agree with the performance issues, i run my game at high setting with 4050 fps, but no matter how much i lower my settings it doesnt really helpExamplesUltra45 fps averagehigh 4050medium4050low4050Im guessing this is just a mixture of numerous bugs and poor optimization, but i do highly recommend this game who has a gtx780 or higher and an i7 3770k 3.5 GHz or higher because the story line is very entertaining and very well put together. I am, at this point, a bit disappointed with the performance but i would give ubisoft a little bit of time to get their stuff together
