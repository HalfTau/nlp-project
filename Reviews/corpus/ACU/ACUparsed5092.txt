Despite all the bad reviews about this game. Ive been able to run it perfectly fine with Frame Rates easily capping 60 fps. Im running an 8 core 4.1 ghz amd processor, 32 gigs of G. Skill ram, crossfire r9 290xs. However I did run into a problem when I installed it on the Mechanical HDD where the game seemed to be a little bogged down, since then ive reinstalled on my SSD which has fixed the slowmo feeling and making the game visually enjoyable.Other than that, Im only eight percent into the game. Ive been playing it for about 1020 hours now but ive been mainly  doing side quests and just having some fun exploring Paris. Im still quite new to the AC experience but i find this highly enjoyable. I played AC3 and AC4, soon to try rogue on the PS4. I would say comparing gameplay to the ones ive played i dont see much of a difference other than storyline. but none the less, I give this an 8/10 for where its at now.
