Well the game simply falls into the bottomless pit of buggy triple A releases. After the typical AC two hour introduction sequence and another four hours of real gameplay Uplay made the spontanious descition to delete my savegame entirely. Unfortunatly i will not be restarting untill the game sees significant updating.
