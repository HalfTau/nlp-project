I have been wanting this game for a long time. When I got it, it wouldnt even load. Sometimes it would only make it to the title screen before it would crash. I spend two hours on the Dell phone line before I could actually got into the story. once I got into the game there were floating characters, faces wouldnt render and Arono would vanish form time to time. this game is not worth your money.
