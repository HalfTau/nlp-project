Honestly very underwhelming. As a massive fan of the AC franchise I was sorely disappointed by Unity. The story starts off ok with a little background of Arno and his joining of the Assassins but after that theres nothing. Except repetitive missons that are way too easy to achieve 100 sync.A total lack of current day story line and very little continuity in the story itself just feels wierd.The free running system has been changed for the worse, it feels clunky and unreponsive. Also the AI is worse than AC 1, enemies cannot scale walls and the combat system is very poorly thought out.Not to mention Unity has one of the worst endings to any game I have ever played without any closure or explaination to the story line or current day events.
