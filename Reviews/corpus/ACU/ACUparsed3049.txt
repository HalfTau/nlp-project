Going to have to disagree with a lot of people here, this is actually a pretty good game now that the initial bugs are fixed. It performs well on my computer. The game, however, unfortunately has kept its reputation because of the horribly glitched start. It looks great and plays great now however.The environments feel MUCH more alive than with previous Assassin Creed games or Rogue as well it is less bland and has things happening all over. The historical information is also much more abundant, and side missions like investigating murders are quite interesting and again missing in Rogue. The gameplay is improved, the combat feels more weighty with much better animations. There is more challenge to the game as well, which is welcome as other games are laughably easy. Things like Parkour and Stealth are improved as well. The missions are plentiful and they have the true assassin vibe to them as you plan out your route and then take the opportunity to kill your target.Do not pass over this Assassin creed game if you have the computer to handle it. It is quite enjoyable, and I hope the gameplay stays for Victory.
