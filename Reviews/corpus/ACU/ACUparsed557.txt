This game has been patched so hard its surpisingly not asanymore. Still full of bugs and a lot of things dont work quite how you would expect them to but its enjoyable. There are microtransactions in the game but its for singleplayer items that are all unlockable with the regular in game currency Is it still called florins?, if you feel like its drip feeding you money then just download cheat engine and edit that value right up. The game is saved by the sheer amount of things to do, there are so many side missions and coop is ridiculously fun, even though the game lacks any way to communicate with the other players so unless youre all on discord or teamspeak then its just too chaotic. It also respects why you play AC, nothing was worse in the previous games where just as you started having fun the game would pull you out and force you to play through some boring story sequence outside the animus. 8 hours in and they havent pulled me out yet.5/10 its enjoyable but microtransactions feel forced in, the amount of content is the sole savior of this game, buy it on sale.
