Due to the recent patch, most of the bugs are fixed. Also, the sheer amount of missions and objectives give you so many hours of gameplay. Coop in an assasins creed game is amazing, and the progression system is fun. But when more than 50 of the high teir stuff is from club competitions which you cant even do, and if you could, you would have to win to get the stuff. But Ubisoft is making up for the rocky release by giving us all free DLC! Also, if you already had the DLC they will give you a free game. I mightve forgot to metion some stuff, but the last thing I can remember about the game to put into this review is that playing in a friends Paris is super fun.
