I was at first questioning whether i should buy this game because of all the bad reviews. After playing for about 20 hours now and completed the Main story and Dead kings, i can honestly question why so many people are complaining about all the small things. Yes, their are glitches in the game that i experianced but i didnt get mad at them, i laughed. Sure, sometimes it was annoying when Arno was glitching, but it was over quick and i really enjoyed this game. It may have not been as good as the other ones, but it is now in my personal favories. The online can suck sometimes but its really fun to play with friends, expecially trying to all stay sneaky at once xD Dont worry about people saying that their are glitches and it ruins the game, because i can say that there are glitches as with any game, but if you guy this game and are a fan of the series or a new beginner, you will really enjoy this game and get over any problems.   10/10 Would assassinate people again. Note You will need a high performance PC to play this game.
