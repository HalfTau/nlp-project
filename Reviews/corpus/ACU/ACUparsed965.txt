Finished the main story and some of the side missions after about 20hrs of playing and here is my thoughtsProsGreat graphicsParis, it is just beautifulUpdated stealth gameplay Sneakbutton, new animations and moreCombat is more interesting nowStory is good and long Maybe a little bit too repetitiveNew ranking systemA free DLC Dead KingsConsArno is little bit too faceless, like Connor in AC3Still lot of bugsServer bridges between the sequences are boring and waste of timeRequires a good PCOverall, this is a good AC with pretty nice story and gameplay. I give 7,5/10
