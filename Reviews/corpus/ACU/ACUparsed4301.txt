So far, the best AC in years! The city is rich and deep and packed with sites to see. It really makes you want to explore and mingle with the people. There are certainly graphical errors but none that really bothered me or broke anything. Its to be expected in a game this massive. There certainly does need to be optimization done and im sure they will soon. I am running things on low w/ antialiasing on. It is mostly very smooth like this. I would love to see the world on high settings but for now I can bite the bullet and play with less. It really still looks great and from what I can tell there is not much I am missing out on. The story is good so far, Arno has alot of personality and is likeable and well voiced/acted.
