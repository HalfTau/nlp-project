Despite all the unfortunate hate this game has gotten, so far, I havent encountered any performance issues while playing this game. While Assassins Creed Unitys main story is far from being one of the best in the series, the game was still enjoyable for me at the very least. Having played through all of the Assassins Creed games in their respective order, the enormous city of Paris with its high roof tops felt extremely nostalgic. I have spent hours free roaming because of how gorgeous the city is. The parkour is a bit different this time around. The controls do take a while to get used to and it can be a little frustrating at first, but once you get the hang of it, the majority of time it works well.Unity, in my opinion, has some of the most interesting side missions ever introduced in the franchise. The Paris stories, Cafe and Coop missions are very intriguing as they provide a lot of context for tackling your objectives. Muder Mystries and Enigmas on the other hand can be quite entertaining if youre in the mood for some problem solving. But what truly makes Unity different from all other Assassins Creed games however, is the sheer amount of customization. It is extremely satisfying and rewarding when youre finally able to unlock the gears and skills youve wanted after playing the game for a period of time.All in all, this game is definitely worth a shot if youre a fan of the series. If not, you should try it when its on sale. The immense amount of content will be well worth the price.
