Horrible is the only word I can think of. I am running this game on a relatively high end system. While I do not expect to be able to play the game on ultra with my current hardware, even on low or medium is terrible. The framerate and performance of the game is an atrocity, and I know that many reviews by people with system spec far higher than mine are having problems. This is all too common with Ubisoft, and GOD FORBID you should run an AMD card. Do not make the mistake I did of forking over 90 for the gold edition right now. Wait for Ubisoft to fix this monstrocity...if they ever do.
