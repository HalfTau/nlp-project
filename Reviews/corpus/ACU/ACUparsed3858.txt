Good enough if you can play it, I do not see much crashing or buggyness in the game that others see even after 16 hours of contenuous playtime. the problems I find is when I want to go somewhere or run somewhere, arno sometimes jump on to boxes and wastes time. the companion appp worked for me except now its a bit slow, I sometimes cant connect to ACInitiates. over all its goodok.
