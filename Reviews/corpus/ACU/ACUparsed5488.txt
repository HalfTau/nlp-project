I almost didnt buy it because of all the bad reviews. Runs fine on my PC. no crashes .. in 9 hr .. out of thousands of npcs, i saw 1 halfway in the ground. Have not fallen through the map yet. The game is pretty hardware intensive so it doesnt run very fast but it is playable. FPS between 30  120.HardwareIntel Core i5 4570  3.20GHz3071MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 78016gb ddr3Settings1920x1080144hzEnviroment  very highTexture  highShadows  highAO  HBAOAA  FXAABloom  On
