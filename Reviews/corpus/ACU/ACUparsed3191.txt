Strange as it may sound, especially due to all the problems this title had at launch, its close to being my favourite Assassins Creed of all times!Sure, it cant compare to the overall greatness of AC Black Flag or the story and character progression of Ezio in AC2/Brotherhood/Revelations, but it has what I enjoy the most about these games A huge city.It also basically ignored things, everyone hates about AC games Present day sequences and space angels.The story is the usual mumbo jumbo, its a gigantic collectathon I cant help but love this, action is fine and graphics are stunning if you have the hardware.I missed the stealth parts, but it kind of added to the gameplay that you needed to be careful where you took out the enemies, as you couldnt move the bodies anymore.The game has also received a bunch of patches that should take care of most, if not all bugs. I should mention that I only had 2 side missions bug out on me triggering an event didnt happen and a quick restart of the game fixed them, though I know lots of people have had really bad experience with all sorts of bugs and glitches.The most annoying part though, is Ubisoft insisting on players using the Initiates website and the mobile app to unlock everything ingame website went offline after 2 months and unlocked rewards ingame, and app rewards unlocked for everyone after 4 months, and of course that there is absolutely no Steamworks integration.If you enjoy big open world games, definitely check this game out.
