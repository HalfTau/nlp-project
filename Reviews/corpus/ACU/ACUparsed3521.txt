a bloody mess of a game, poor performance for nothing spectacular.i like that they get back to the roots of the series and all the details in the game..... but its not worth it.what people say is true, 23 SLI is a must to get this game smooth.crappy port esp when other games look atleast close to what this does yet runs smooth as hell on lesser hardware.
