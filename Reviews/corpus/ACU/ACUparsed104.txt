DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I cant belieave I wasted my money on it and I am only finishing the game because I have already spent my money and I want to see the story. I find myself getting mad constantly durring to game due to bugs and control issues.PROSCool storyits an Assassins Creed gamegraphics are niceCoopCONSis no where near as good as any other Assassins Creed game.TONS of glitches and bugs that make you have to restart from checkpoint or reset your character by fast traveling.Massive frame drops. yes I have a very good computerthe game is made extremely hard so that you buy the microtransactions.Controls are awful. Your character cant step of a bench without jumping 5 feet in the wrong direction and starting a giant fight that you will die from.There is no way to dodge bullets. In other Assassins Creeds you could use an emeny as a shield but in this one you just have to charge everyone holding a gun and hope they dont shoot. 1 bullet does 75 of my health and I bought tier 4 items with health on them.Overall the game is not worth it even when it is on sale. Buy Rogue or Blackflag for cheaper and a more enjoyable experience.
