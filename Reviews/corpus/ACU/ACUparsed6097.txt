idk where to start..... The frames are a joke and i keep falling into the buildings and through the floors. I had to restart a mission around 8 times because i kept falling through the world or land on an object and get stuck in it. The game is buggy as hell. Almost unplayable. And the required specs.... Go fck youself Uplay. Assassins Creed STEAMING HOT GARBAGE EDITION
