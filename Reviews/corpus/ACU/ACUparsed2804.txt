Such a  game. Some missions wouldnt even work. I tried to get a refund but since ive played for 6 hours which is because of the long loading times rather than gameplay, I cant. Not to blame steam for this but goddammit this game was horrific. Ubisoft will never get another dollar from me ever again.
