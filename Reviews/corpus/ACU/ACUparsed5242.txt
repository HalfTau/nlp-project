Boring, recycled content. Uninteresting characters, bland mediocre enviroment, glaring bugs. I bought this game as a faith buy to Ubisoft because I thoroughly enjoyed Black Flag, but Assassins Creed Unity is an unfinished, ugly, boring game.The main character, Arno, is a bland regurgitation of Ezio, the plot is narrowminded and many times the characters will do things that are only done to further the plot.Paris is pretty, but any of the intricate beauty that ACU has to offer is almost immediately stifled by the god awful control scheme and Arnos apparent desire to constantly examine walls up close, as 75 of the time Id find myself forced to meticulously pry Arno away from a staircase,  picture frame, window, or too large a pile of gravel on the street, that he would be ever so desperate to cling to.Combat is unresponsive at best, the tools youre given to play with are boring and bland, and the immense customization is relatively nil as regardless of how well equipped you are, all combat boils down to Spam Melee Attack  Wait to Parry / Dodge  Spam Melee AttackThey like to tout that you can approach missions from many different perspectives, but in reality you cant. Most assassination missions will be spent going through the motions of trial and error. Now, that may sound good, right? Figure out what works and exploit it, right? Wrong.Trial and Error here doesnt mean examining your prey, stalking them down, and slowly whittling their reinforcements before you deliver a final strike as it did in other AC titles, in ACU it means figuring out which of the 2 to 3 clearly laid out paths to the target Ubisoft spent the most QA time on, and then desperately hoping that some random and unexpected bug, awful clipping, idiotic enemy, or any other design failure in this game doesnt rear its ugly head and force you to restart the mission again.I will give them one thing, Paris is huge and their famous fetch objects are a plenty. Unfortunately, the Parkour system in this game is so buggy, unresponsive, and sometimes even disobedient, that theres no joy to even gain from running rooftop to rooftop.I regret wasting my money on this obviously rushed and underdeveloped game.
