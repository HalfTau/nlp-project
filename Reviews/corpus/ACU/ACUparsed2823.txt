This is the worst game support i have ever seen....the game is by far no ready to play....the patches didnt work...My Computer is way good enough for this ing game but it is simplywork from ubisoft or whoever created this game....myself, i have played maybe an hour or so....than i came to thisparis 1898 mission in the ing metro....the hole screen went white but i found out that i can see at least a little bit by using the vision...but just after 10 minutes or so in this, worst one so far for me, mission the game just crashes and brings me back to desktop...this is unbelievable and simply not acceptabble...i have always been a fan of assassines creed but this game is just a joke...nearly nothing works.to round it up thiswho call themselves creaters even didnt make to fix it in nearly 7 months or so??? ?are u kidding me?? ?everyone who reads this and hasnt bought this game yet...dont do it...wait for the next or go back to black flag or what ever....thats ityeah i know i sound angry but i rly am....
