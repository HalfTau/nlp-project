Very good game with a perfect TrailerTo all the Assassins Creed fans I can say that this is one of the best assassins creeds because of the story and the weapons you can choose between. The gameplay is like a new version of Assassins creed 2 but the graphics are more like in black flag.The map is big enough because there are manny buildings and you can reach everything only by walking. The sidequests arent perfect, because there are too manny quests about things you dont care about, but some are fun to play.But in the end unity is a great game which you can play 2080 hours without getting tired of anything.
