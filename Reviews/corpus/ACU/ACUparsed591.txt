If you have Windows 10 and dont have an extra 50 then dont get this game unless you have two seperate hard drives because this game isnt compatible with Windows 10, and the only way to play it without it crashing every 10 minutes is for you to Dual Boot and install Windows 8. But if you have Windows 8 or other Windows systems below then Id recommend it when theres a sale as I think that 25 for this game is too much, you should buy it when around 15.Edit I have solved the crash problem.
