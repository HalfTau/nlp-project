Its a step away  from boat simulatorthe AC game and the way it plays is legit if your computer can handle it. When I first got the game it was poorly optimized and I had it crash a LOT, however they did patch enough that I can say its a game worth having if you have a computer to play it.ItemsAt first I didnt like the item system they put in, on first look it would apear that all the good stuff is behind a paywall, however its not that much in game currency that its a paywall after you do the missions for increassing your social clubs and unlock all the social clubs. You will need to do that or farm the ever lovingout of the multiplayer missions, so needless to say do the theatre missions. DO them. DO IT! DO IT NOW!Story... its a thing. Its not super unique, but captivating, reminds me of the start of AC2 for plot but not the same.Gameplay In my opinion, the most fun to play AC game Ive played, smoke bombs are your bread and butter, use them.My finishing thoughtsWhile this game is solid, it could be better. In my opinion it had gameplay that is a step in the right way for the game series and I know some people like the boats in the 4 and rogue, I do not. If I wanted to play a boat simulator Id go find a boat simulator, I dont play AC to captain a ship, I play it for the gameplay that built the tittle to begin with.Edit fixed a T being where it wasnt supposed to be. Ill spare you the longform speech I ragewrote about the growing use of boats in AC games for signifcant portions of gameplay, point is it has been a while from the last time Ive looked over this review, still hate the boats  at least in 5 the character was AT LEAST A PIRATE! That I can over look, but seriously, less boats  more acrobatic killing please? is that really so much to ask for in an AC game? This game seems to show it isnt too much to ask, doesnt it? oo I cant stop the rage flow at the boats, its the water they ride on... a river of rage.
