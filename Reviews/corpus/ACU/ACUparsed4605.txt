Poorly written main storyline ruins the game for me, not worth it as in the end not only the most of the questions are not answered but there is no realistic ending at all as the main character becomes an atheist preacher.See the storyline on youtube or something in case youre interested in what happens cause the price of this game is too much considered that this end product isnt complete and lacks alot in its plot/story telling.
