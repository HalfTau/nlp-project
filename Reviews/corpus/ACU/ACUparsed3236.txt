I will not recommend this game.I bought it off Steam and I was semiexcited but the game is immediately unplayable, because the game is installed in Chinese. I dont understand why. My computers language is English, my Steam language is English, my region is Denmark, so I would understand Ubisoft installing it in Danish, if there were such a version.But ing Chinese...This game would be unplayable to the casual kid who wouldnt know to look in the lang file, or google for help.The standard installation language for ANY game should be English. I ing PICKED English when it installed, and still it is Chinese. I havent played any other game thats done this. Pirated games, sure, but a licensed, paidfor game.No way.And I havent even gotten down to playing it yet, and I already hate it.This is not an indie game, this is a game published by a huge, rich company.These things do not happen.This game is the proof that Ubisoft and everyone else linked to this game are lazy, and hungry for money by spitting out a  game like this.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
