1 Im lucky  not rich. I play on a midlevel laptop. YET...I dont have any glitches, frame rate problems, crashes, etc.2 I liked AC IV more. A LOT more. Still, this is several notches better than 1, 2, 3 and the various other AC side releases.3 CoOp is hours of supplementary fun.4 The story line can become dull/repetitive here and there.5 Working through the rare lull in narrative excitement is instantly rewarded with action and fastpaced plot progression.6 The multifaceted gameplay is expansive and immersive, and intrinsically rewarding.7 The game is gorgeous.8 The parkour mechanics are superbly streamlined and intuitive, more than ever before  thus, just intermission exploring is thrilling and addictive.9 As always, I wish there was more than the default difficulty level to choose from.10 I strongly recommend using a gamepad. Keyboard and mouse controls are a veritable nightmare and interfere with the supple freerunning mechanics that are central to all aspects of AC gameplay.11 The system for learning and accessing Assassin abilities, tools, and weapons adds anticipation and a sense of accomplishment that lasts from beginning to end.12 The storyline is long and fulfilling. Sidequests and unlockables are expansive and overwhelming  as they should be!8.7/10
