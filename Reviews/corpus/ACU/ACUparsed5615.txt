The in depth customization and complete freedom with your character is amazing, and the fact that Ubisoft listened to us in the community is amazing as well. I hope to get the software to play this, and when i do i will never stop playing it. I personally like the fact that you can play coop with friends. I payed the full 90 for the gold edition and i bought the season pass. I personally have never seen a game so well made and i hope more games like this happen in the future. I say Kudos to Ubisoft for making such a brilliant game. Furthermore, I hope to see you all on the streets of Paris soon, goodbye my friends.
