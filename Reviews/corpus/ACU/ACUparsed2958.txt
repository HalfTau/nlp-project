Unless you plan on playing with friends dont play. It was meant to be a multi player game as I see it, and is way to hard for solo play. They changed alot of the game play to which in my opinion also makes it harder. As for the map... LOL so congested you cant make out most of the items on it. It does not clues or help as the other Assassins game did. The game as a whole is too congested, and can be overwhelming. As for eagle vision it has limited range and only lasts a few seconds, with a cool down period of several seconds. The game is so congested this is the first game Ive come across that lags my PC. You would be better off using a gaming system over a PC
