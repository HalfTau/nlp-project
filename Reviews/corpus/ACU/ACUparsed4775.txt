On behalf of the entire French community, Id like to sincerely apologize for the current state of Assassins Creed Unity.I am not going to complain about all the flaws the game presents. I am just going to point out the bitter irony of playing a game about a revolution conducted by the people and aiming at getting rid of the aristocracy as well as sharing out wealth among the people, when only gamers with enough money to buy a cuttingedge PC will be able to play it satisfyingly, whereas the plebs and their midrange computers get beheaded by the greedy blade of Ubisofts guillotine.It makes me sad that French honour was ruined by this game, and by a French editor on top of that. This act of national treason is an insult to French culture and the very spirit of our beloved Rvolution.I hope the game will be fixed soon, so that I may stop feeling ashamed of living in the most beautiful city in the world and speaking the most sophisticated language of all.Im am going out now. According to my current DNA sequence, I need to go buy a baguette and a croissant. I hope I dont come across to many people lining up in front of the backery, as it is well known that French people always make the framerate drop.I also hope that I will not fall throug the ground, like one of my sorely missed friends did, I hear it happens more and more often in this time of year.Then I will go home, wake up my girlfriend and French kiss her. I just hope that her skinface does not disappear this time.Finally, when I join her for an intimate coop session, I hope I will not be disconnected, as it has happenend many times before.On this cheerful note, I wish you all, mesdames et messieurs, an excellent day.Vive la Rpublique, et Vive la France.
