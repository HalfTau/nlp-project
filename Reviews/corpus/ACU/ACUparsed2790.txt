Im very surprised at how far this game has come. Yes, it had a terrible launch and lingered for a long time, but Ubisoft reallys tepped up their game with the updates and improvements theyev made. The gameplay is incredibly fluid, the locomotion and general animation of all the characters is done perfectly, the freerunning is the best of any Assassins Creed yet. The story is a little lacking, but I still found it more than amusing and worthwhile. I didnt like that they sold the game out to be one where the campaign was cooperative, then made it all just a bunch of missions instead, but the multiplayer is still loads of fun, whether youre robbing a series of buildings or just racing around the rooftops with friends. If your computer can run it, I more than definitely recommend this game.
