This is a game with a good deal of potential but one massive flaw for people who enjoyed the previous games, this one will be hard as brass balls. It seems as though the devs took complaints that AC IV could be too easy personally and decided to punish us gamers. Counters can be a pain in the and checkpoints for memories are few and far between. Each chapter ends in a special mission where you have to infiltrate a location and carry out an assassination. These are quite fun, until you spend 10 to 20 minutes preparing and clearing the area of guards only to be detected and have 50 guards swarm and kill you, sending you back to the start. In fact, there arent even checkpoints after the assassination but before the escape. This can be positively maddening when coupled with the difficult combat and the controls which, somehow, have gotten worse since AC IV. Die hard fans of the series would love the story as I have played it so far, but even they will have trouble playing past the difficulty which I should say is not challenging, but arbitrarily difficult and the numerous glitches that still occurr even over two months since the games launch, which range from crashes to graphics glitches. In addition to this I must warn that the graphics are still not optimized, and even with my MSI GTX 780ti in a low overclock can be choppy with textures taking a longer time to load than in AC IV. In short, let the buyer beware with this game.
