All in all crap. I have played all the AC games, and this is the worst. But putting the series experience aside, Unity is just a mess. Its so busy IMO, with crap all over the screen, blasted with misc. junk and popups everywhere.The storyline is horrible, and Im not really getting it. Although Im too busyoff about the crap popping up, the map littered with crap I understand theres filters, and the skiddish and clumzy  character movement. Its always been a task to stop from jumping to a ledge you didnt want to jump to at times, or hopping off something without grabbing on to something else. The other games were manageable with this issue, but Unity is a huge step backward on this front.I dont really know what to write to be honest.. Its just a mess.. Im forcing myself to play it, which really sucks.. Crossing AC off the list..
