Ohhh where do I start I pre ordered this bad boy as the gold edition 90. This game was and still is a broken mess from day 1 but it seems to have gotten worse in the performance. As the devs were fixed the optimization issues in each patch they let out my fps was dropping so much more that its not even playable any more. It went from lowmedium at 5060 frames to 2025 on low. Other than the fact I cant even play the game anymore I had fun while it worked. Coop was not the best but I still had a few laughs... Will this games fps issues be fixed? Probably not so unless you have a pc powered by a nuclear reactor I would advise not getting this game.Also this game corrupted my save at the very last mission.10/10 would waste 90 again
