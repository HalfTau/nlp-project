I would not recommend buying this game a hundred times over. After playing it for less than an hour it had too many glitches to count. Though the game and graphics are great. It really doesnt do the game justice when you fall into a never ending abyss in the middle of the mission. Ive had to replay simple missions ten times over because arno would just stop moving and be stuck in mid air ,or he would just pass through a wall while free running, or jump to his death when on a roof. Not only that. i have realized i cant finish the game since ubisoft has essentially refused to fix a glitch in a main mission that customers have been complaining about in THEIR forums since june of last year. Patch after patch this issue is still not resolved. If you are a big Assassins Creed fan i would advise you to stay away from this game so as not to be disappointed. Ubisoft has failed big time and i think after a year its about time they either fix their mistakes or give out some form of refund to make up for this unfortunate  up.
