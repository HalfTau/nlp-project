I have played every AC game ever released and loved them all and was looking foward to Unity. 60 and 40gigs later the game is so sluggish on my PC High end Alienware that do anything. I never thought that AC would ever be in the catagory ofpoor console port, but it has happend. I hope everyne else has fun with ACU but you better play it on a console because this games managment team could care less about the PC gamer. I hope something improves.
