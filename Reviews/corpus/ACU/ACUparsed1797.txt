I remember playing this game back when it came out. I was hoping to experience some of the Assassins Creed nostalgia. The only thing I experienced was a game that should have been marked as Early Access. The frame rate was ridiculously low regardless of what graphics quality settings I chose and there were a slew of other bugs that I encountered making the game unenjoyable. I stuck with the game, just to see it through to the end trying to find different workarounds to each different bug that would stop me from progressing. The ending itself was not even memorable. I saw one of my friends playing it earlier, and decided to finally give it a try once more. Well, suffice to say, the game crashed to the desktop after playing it for no more than five minutes.It might be a long time before I pick up another Assassins Creed title.
