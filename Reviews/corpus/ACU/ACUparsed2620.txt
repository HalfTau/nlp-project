I recommend it to fans of the franchise. It has many improvements like a new parkour system, easier stealth, harder combat and pretty graphics. But with these improvements there are quite a few bugs still months after the initial release. The game is playable there are just animation glitches such a skipping an animation while climbing walls/fighting enemies or continuing an animation on a dead enemy. Clipping errors with people in wall and such. The one that frustrates me though is a glitch were mid game my controller will desync with the game and I have to unplug and replug it in. Overall id say its worth 6070 for a hardcore fan of the series but for most casual players id say buy it on sale
