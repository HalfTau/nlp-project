Almost unplayable still..... My game has crashed wihtin the same 5 minute pay period no matter what I am doing. Its not my computers fault as it can run arma 3 on high 60 frames without a hiccup. I was excited to play this game, hoping the bugs were worked out but it seems I made a mistake.Do not buy this game, you will not get far before restarting over 10 times in the same sequence. Ruins the enjoyment of the game.
