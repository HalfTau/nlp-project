ACU got a deservedly bad reputation when it launched, being riddled with bugs, glitches, and game ending physics, but since then has become one of my favorite Assassins Creed games.  The visuals are stunning, the setting amazing, and the story, while not up to par with some AC games, is very well told and acted.  The combat is great, except you cant dodge gunfire while not in active combat.  Nothing is perfect, right?
