enough glitches to be annoying? yeah Id say so.As a long time AC fan, still enjoyed this game. After patches and fixes its a gorgeous game and feels very alive. Arnos story is nothing amazing but its fun and still enjoyable as a story.The game is gorgeous and the added aspect of RPGs is fun twist and would have been great to see continue to Syndicate nothing I miss a lot but it was a nice twist on how gear works in the AC world Im a fan of gear having actual pros and cons and not simply reskins.If you want to know the whole story of this series definitely pick it up, but its skippable in light of the whole Assassin vs templar story arc.
