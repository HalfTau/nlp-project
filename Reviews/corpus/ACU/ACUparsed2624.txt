Nearly seven months after this game has been released and it was still incredibly unstable for me never got to play more than 1 hour without the game crashing on me. Tried to contact Ubisoft for technical support and apparently laptop GPUs are not supported for this gameHowever, I was able to play this game on a PS4 and am appalled at what this series has become. Assassins Creed Unity which should really be called Assassins Creed Elise, as the entire single player storyline revolved around revenge for the killing of Elises father included an almost nonexistent storyline outside of Helix unfortunately continuing the trend of ACIV, lack of innovation in gameplay these collectathons are getting out of hand, and a rather pathetic ending SPOILERS the main goal of the game was to find the remains of a Sage before the Templars do, but at the end of the game when you do find his final resting place the woman whos guiding you from outside Helix basically states that the Templars wouldnt try to extract the Sages DNA as his bones would be likely too hard to find amongst the others in the catacombs. So was the entire time spent in the Helix system pointless?Its really sad to see this series go the way of Call of Duty.
