PROS I heard that Unity was a gorgeous game, and, between the flashes of 7 fps, I can see it.The story is good I read the Bowden adaptations, so maybe that makes me like it more than I otherwise would have.Its really pretty, and set to French with English subs its great.CONS After trying every fix on the web, Ive given up. I cant get more than 10fps during gameplay, and then it crashes, claiming that I dont have enough RAM I do. I never get more than 5 fps in the start menu, either. The Ubisoft startup animation, however, runs at a blinding 61 fps, naturally.So, Im bitterly requesting a refund.
