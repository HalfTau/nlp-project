Looks beautiful, plays well, main story is short and sweet, detective mysteries are fun and congruent, Paris side stories are typical AssassinsCreed awesome with cameos by historical figures, Multiplayer is dead so good luck if you wanted to play this online, but coop missions are great fun on single player too.I bought this in 2016 so did not experience bugs or eyes without a face, although parkour navigation isnt fully solved yet, but thats par for the course on all Assassins Creed games getting stuck on random chairs or corners being the most annoying.I liked it as much as Black Flag, with the only thing missing being the better sailor songs, because the Caf hymns just arent as good, 9/10
