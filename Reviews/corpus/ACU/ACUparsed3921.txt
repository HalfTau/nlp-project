Bought this game. Didnt know it was Ubisoft. . Had to login my pwmanager had my username and pw for a years old account but it wanted an emailaddress while none of my addresses worked.  Failed. New account and Im serious here My steam name didnt work because its a forbidden word. Seriously? Forbidden words? Are you the church? No you are not at least THEY stopped enslaving people. dieubisoftdie, dieubidie, ubisuffcteforfckssake were already taken again, serious here. Started game after unchecking all the spammailcheckboxes. Didnt work. The Play button did NOTHING. Started it using Steam why? because  YOU UBISOFT! thats why. Did work. Game was in german because the local market dictates crappy synchronization and ubisoft was already kind enough to allow me to avoid spam. Skipped the intro to survive german dubbing  looked for settings to change that afterwards but apart from an achievement because I started the game it was a hurdle, after all only mission selectors. Selected first mission TAC.exe stopped working. Lets see how long it takes to get my 60 back and get a pirated version. It will be a burden on the developers in the end, but then again I was forbidden to pay for their art. Final impression Ubisoft must have played the latest sim city on meth. There is no other way I can explain spending so much money on a huge  YOU to all of us stupid enough to pay them for some mindrape. I seriously want to hurt someone  but Ill do it in a game not a ubisoft one of course.
