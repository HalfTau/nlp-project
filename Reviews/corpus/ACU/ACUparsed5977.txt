I will never buy another Ubsoft game EVER..... between this game and watchdogs.... Ubsoft can suck it... it would seem they have designed their games to run EXTRA  on AMD processors... Everyone i know that has no problems with this game have and intel. Secondly....I have an AMD 9590 .. runnning at 4.7Ghz. and two 7950 HD 3gb. and I am getting 10 fps on LOW graffics settings....Unless you have a Super computer overclocked to 8ghz. with 64GB ram. and and AMD r9 300x  dont bother buying this game.
