Although its hard to run, and has technical problems. If you love Assassins Creed gameplay, this is pretty much the best upgrade to the core gameplay of the series. Parkouring is better and Paris is wonderfully created with a 11 scale. Climbing buildings and running on rooftops has never been better. Combat is refined, although its not too different still. And mission structure is a lot better no more instant fail states and now we have more openended missions. Graphics are awesome. And to top it off, animations are among the best in the industry. Watch Arno run around and climbing is smooth and impressive.The game is quite huge, and long. Finising the campaign and doing around 1/3 of the side missions/collectibles, I have 38 hours clocked. Though I take my time with some missions, or sometimes restart them.If you are an Assassins Creed fan, youll fine much to like. If youve grown tired of the forumula, Unity wont do much to draw you back however.
