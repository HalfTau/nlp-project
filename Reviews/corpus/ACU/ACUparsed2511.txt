The weakest of the AC games, the story lacked the depth and surprises I have enjoyed from the other games. They also tried to make the combat less rock, paper, scissor, but that just made it more of a hassle than a fluid obstacle you have to pass around. Makes you feel less like a badass as well.Still recommend it for the other gameplay elements at play, its still AC at its core.
