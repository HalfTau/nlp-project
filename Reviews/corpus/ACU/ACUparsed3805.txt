At the start I was verry excited for this game, so I ofcourse preordered the gold edition.I was probably one of the lucky ones not really experiencing not that many crashes.I did on the other hand have some frame rate issues, and also the problem with the game freezing for 1020 seconds ever so often.These things are mostly fixed now, but Im still experiencing the game suddenly crashing when I join coop missions.I have now played this game more than 30 hours and, I love it.But if you play Ac for the story, I would not reccomend this. This games story is verry short In my eyes. but Ive finished it and Im still at 40 I. so if you are looking for a game to play for a long time with ur friends or without if you are forever alone and fun for a long time to.
