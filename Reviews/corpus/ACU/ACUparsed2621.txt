There is not a lot of love for Unity. I will admit it does indeed have many drawbacks, many small IMO.The Bad 1.Arno apparently cant whistle. The game tries to say.. use cherry bombs to lure targets.... It even has optional goals to accomplish.. like  lure with cherry bomb The problem ... is you CANT LURE with a cherry bomb, I sat to side of door ways and threw them in front of their feet, at my feet, and even at their face. They just shake it off. The only way to get them to you is to show yourself and hide real quick.2. When I assassinate someone I expect Arno to assasinate them.. NOT POUNCE many times I saw assassinate as option I clicked X on my pad only to have him pouce the person and let them get a scream off.The Good 1. I miss crafting, especially when I want to carry more items, but I also like to have a reason to do things in the game. In Rogue I got all the money I needed from investments that I felt no need or want to do more chest hunting, collectable finding I like to have a reason to need money. So Its nice to be able to customize your chracter with the many different outfits. Each bringing its own thing to the table, and even making it intersting to replay levels.2. THe visuals are AMAZING, If you have the PC to handle this game then its very enjoyable, the sheer amount of NPC characters walking around is jawdropping.In the end this was a welcome change to the Ship sailing/ pirating that has taken 3 games up. It really felt like I was playing as Ezio again. I never experienced this game with its problems on first release, but with its latest patch Ive nver had ONE crash .In another note  SPOILER? I enjoyed the time jumps that the character experienced throughout the game. I actually wouldnt mind if we had a AC game where that sort of thing happened and we spent more times in those different places.
