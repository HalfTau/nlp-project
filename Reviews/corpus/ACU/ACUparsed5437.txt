IMPORTANTIf you are an Nvidia Graphics card user you are in luck, becasue Ubisoft said that the most bugs and problems are in AMD cards. At first I was not sure should i get this game, because I did not know if it will work. IT WORKED PERFECTLY FINE. I have a Nvidia Geforce GTX 745 and Intel i7 3.6 ghs There are some frame rate issue, but the game is playable. AMD users should wait a little bit, because Ubisoft is working with AMD right now to fix the glitches.
