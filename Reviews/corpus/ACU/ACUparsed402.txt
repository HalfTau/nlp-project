I once played a bit of Assassins Creed and Assassins Creed Black Flag, but this was my first time finishing the whole story and actually buying a AC game. I really liked Arno and his background. Despite the bugs, its still playable. I recomend Assassins Creed Unity, specially because steam offers a free DLC at least i got it for free, and the extra missions are pretty cool. This game was on my wishlist for a while and i got it this Setembers Sale Week of AC. So worth it!I really like AC and I plan on getting all the main games one day. Really enjoy playing it.PS Id also like to say that I find the Companion App usefull. My minimap was bugging and before it was fixed, I used the app has minimap!
