I have definetly enjoyed this game, Although unlike AC IV, the controls are better, you can modify your characters fighting style, Which admittedly, is awesome and Its graphics are better, it cant beat AC IV or most of the other AC games. If you are thinking, Hey, Unity is newer, so that means it is better right? Nope, I have just saved you 20 bucks, go buy Black Flag you bloody , your welcome. Unitys map is confining, and after the campaign, and a few other missions, it gets old real fast. The bugs are mostly fixed, but I have come accross a few that resulted in my having to restart the game.8.5/10 I would only buy this on sale
