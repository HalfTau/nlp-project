Despite what everyone else has said about this game, i would give it a thumbs up BECAUSE my friend built a pretty powerful PC GTX960, 8GB RAM, i5 Processor, etc.. So it runs Unity pretty well. I am a big Assassins Creed fan so i may be a litttle biased on liking the game. It has never froze or gave me major problems. You do see random NPCs appearing out of nowhere and the AI needs to be fixed a bit.GAMEPLAYCombat is great and the story was pretty short at least i thought it was. I spent a lot of time running around and doing the side quests and cocop missions Yes they are pretty fun.You have to rank up and obtain beter weapons and armor before embarking on a higher level mission. As the game progresses, you do need to do this. Otherwise the game will be incredibly hard and almost impossible to pass.My PC makes the game look beautiful. The lighting, shadows, textures. There are some moments when i look at the buildings and walls and think how realistic the game looks. Truly, nothing i have played has matched the texture quality.STORYThe storry was good and easy to follow. Im quite dissapointed about the ending, but still a fun game to play.RATINGId give the game a solid 7/10. Thats beacuse i took away a point for Uplay, a point from a dissapoint ending, and a point for Ubisoft for rushing the game to quickly. If they took a little more time and werent so pressed on releasing two games on the same day Rogue then they might have done a better job in making a better story and better AI.
