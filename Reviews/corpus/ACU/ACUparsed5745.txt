Game is fun when its playable. But its plagued with constant slow down and choppy frame rate at times for no aparent reason, even on the lowest settings and my upper end rig. A lot of it you can ignore but it hits hardest when precision timing is needed when climbing or fighting and just straight kills the experience. Not to mention the online is so laggy and unreliable  that when combined with the frame rate and pop up bugs, its pretty much unplayable when you can join a game at all.Ubisoft should be ashamed for releasing a game in this state, but I know they arent, because they already have our money.There is also a portion of the game locked behind a Companion app that forces you to to DL an app on your ipod/phone/android in order to experience the content, but its also bugged as hell with frequent progress loss and such, not to mention people without an ipod/phone are SOL and miss out on that part of the game completely.If all that werent enough even more content is locked behind an intiate system that requires you to go to their website and sign up and half of that is still in closed alpha and inaccessible/buggy.And if all THAT werent enough the game also has a bloody real cash shop with Day One DLC.Good God its like Ubisoft was so sure this game would be successful they looked up all the Do nots of game creation and said, I bet we can be the ones to make this work and well get even richer.But I digress...IMO there is a solid game some where behind all that mess, so I say wait before you get this game, cause it needs a  of patching.
