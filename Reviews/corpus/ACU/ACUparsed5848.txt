Love seeing the mostly negative user reviews. I get some people may not have problems running the game but thats no reason to blast all the negative reviews. I dont think gamers are that spiteful to diss the Ubisoft game they just bought to play. I know its my fault for blowing the 60 bucks when Ubisoft has a horrible PC port rep but Im gonna wait and see if the game gets fixed at all. If not... jokes on me I guess.
