After seeing all of these reviews, i feel like one of the few that hasnt run in to any real problems yet.  Fair note, i do have a high end gaming laptop with a gtx 880m 4gb graphics card.  Im running on ultra high settings though, and aside from an occasional glitchy npc, everything has been fine so far.  No crashes, a nice steady framerate that hasnt dipped below 30 so far, etc.  I love the gameplay, and yeah, to me, despite naysayers, it does still feel like Assassins Creed.  I would say as long as youre fairly confident in your specs, go for it.  I can only base this review off of my personal experience so far, but theres my two cents.
