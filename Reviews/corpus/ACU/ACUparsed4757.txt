Micro pay Micro Pay and more Micro pay!! Want to feel like a winner? Got money!!! This is the game for you!!! pay 90 dollars for a buggy game! Why? Because your an idiot!!! then get the free mobile app to play games that unlock stuff for you in game! Oh Wait your limited? Upgrade the app for 2.50 and get more options!!!! Having a hard time in game winning battles with our new fighting system? Pay money for Weapon and armor upgrades!!!!Yes i fell for all that. I feel like such an idiot now also and to top all this off The save game progress just disappears after a while. So i hope you like the opening sequence cause your going to play it over and over. Contact support and you will hear nothing. no refund. nothing. . . This is my last AC Game. what a shame i have loved this series. R.I.P Assassins Creed.Oh and I contacted Support and they told me i encountered a glitch and to use a Third party Software to manage my saved games. How Incompetent is a company they cant even keep your save game and recommend you running a totally different software just to save your progress!!!! Did EA Buy out Ubisoft When i was asleep??!! WTF! So basically no refund in sight for a game i cannot even play unless i want to play the beginning over and over again.DO NOT BUY. FULL OF BUGS AND SUPPORT COULDNT CARE LESS. DONT BE A SUCKER!
