Honestly, this game is really fun. People bag on it because of poor performance and glitches, but I have yet to encounter game changing glitches and they probably have poor performance because their GPU is This game is seriously, very graphic intensive. I have a GTX 750 TI and I can play on medium with some lag. Low is my preference though. But what this game sadly lacks a bit is a better story. Arno is a bit of a lovesick puppy. None the less, I reccomend this game to all Assassins Creed fans.
