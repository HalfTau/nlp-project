Never played this game but I can tell from what I saw in the teaser and my own friends who have played this game as well as the people who did reviews, not only on steam but other places too, that is game is just a new feature and the same recycled nonsense.I mean. All the AC games are pretty much the same but for the first 5 of them they were not only just that. It was the story of the AC order and connecting things together, the journey of the games was much more interesting to me rather then going around and stabbing people. Trying to figure out what the hell was going on.These games are just the opposite. It is just taking an call of duty route and that is good for a company that takes advantage of the people who just dont know what a good game is and just play because the name is iconic. Ubisoft should have let this game die after ACIII there was no point in continueing it when the entire story based around the first 5 games was about desmond. It should have ended after that. But Ubisoft and their fantastic gaming dev team just want to push out more and more games to get more and more money to tarnish this once great series more and more.Remember folks.You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villianWhat ubisoft is doing is becoming the villian like they always do when they see green. Just take Assassins Creed to the back and put it out of its misery and ours.Then again. I never played this game, and steam thought I did. So I am just gonna put my opinion out into the void.
