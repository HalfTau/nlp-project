I do not agree with most of the people saying this game is terrible. Its not terrible, its just ing bad.The performance is terrible! The FPS drops are ing amazing!When I first bought this, I played it for about 10 hours, and finished it. In 10 ing hours. Thats really low for a game costing this much! I only played main story line with few sides, but still its really short The game was pretty much OK only OK, NOT GOOD with the performance and FPS, I played on medium graphics with my 16gb ram, intel i7 and 6gb graphs. card without any problems, expect some bugs that happened later in the game. But what reallyme off is the latest update. They did NOT do any performance upgrades what so ever! They only ed it up more! I started a game about a week ago again to play coop yes, coop is pretty much the ONLY good thing in this game, but i still sucks with my friend, but it lagged af. I turned the graphics to the LOWEST resolution, and I still had terrible FPS about 15 fps. I thought its the problem with my PC, but NO! My friend has a better PC then I have, and still it was lagging for him as well well maybe he had like 5 fps more!I do NOT recomend buying this. It has a really boring and linear gameplay, it just SUCKS!Go and buy Black Flag, Rogue or AC III For this money, its more worth it.4/10
