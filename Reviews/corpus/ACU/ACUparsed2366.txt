Ive just updated to windows 10 up dated everything and now AC Unity crashes all the time after a few mins of play this sucks cause I cant even record my game play footage, have no idea why I bought this game in the frist place even knowing there were big problems with it, Shame on you ubisoft maybe you should stop with the Assasins Creed if you cant deliver a good quality game. Maybe you should take a page out of konamis book and stop making AAA games altogether and go moblie instead
