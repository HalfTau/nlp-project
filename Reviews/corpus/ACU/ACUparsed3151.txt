Assassins creed unity oh where do i begin.Anyways so unity showed great potential before release but then ultimately came out as well....poop nonetheless the recent patches has made unity playable. Alot of bugs and glitches some really funny and some just rage inducing.The coop itself is really fun although there is alot of things to unlock from it not a bad thing i accept the challenge and then there is the story...the story has its up and downs bt mostly quiet a good story so overall this game is on a tight rope i dont recommend buying it but i do recommend buying it
