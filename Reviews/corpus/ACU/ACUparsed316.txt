The parkour system is ing painful, its so ing bad its painful and Ive taken my time to get out of the game to write this review just to let it out, I had to tell someone how ing painful the parkour system is, it makes you feel so impotent and useless when Arno decides to jump around and you just stand there like what the  man, Im telling you to jump up and you jump to the left? what the  man, im pressing E, get the  off that chair already, the target is escaping, get the  offfff so  you Ubisoft for even mentioning next gen controlls in the presentation, go  yourself sincerely. Other than that, the game is good, I do recommend it because despite the controls, I enjoy it and I kinda feel like everything else makes up for it
