Ive been playing Assassins Creed since AC 2 was released. My friend recommended it to me, and Ive been an avid follower of the series since then. I loved Brotherhood, Revelations was good, though it had too much to live up to, 3 was a bore, and Black Flag was a blast get it? its a cannon pun. So, I was sorely disappointed when I found out Unity was an uttershow on launch. 2odd years later, I decided to see if it had gotten any better.Im happy to say that it has.The Coop is fun, most of the bugs have been patched out, and the game looks great.While not the best Assassins Creed game, far from it, its not the worst either. Id put it between Revelations and AC 1. Lets go into some pros and cons just to show what I mean.Overall, I think you should get this game. If youre looking for a good story, youre not going to find it, but the gameplay and mechanics themselves are solid, and give the game justice. If you have friends looking for a new coop game, take a look at this one. Its pretty fun, and I really enjoy my time playing it.Id give this game a 7.5/10
