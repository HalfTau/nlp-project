Ive always loved the Assassins Creed Franchise, and I have been really excited for this game but I was quite majorly disappointed with it. I wish I could get my 70 I paid for this game and put it towards something better.The story is great so far for what Ive been able to play, I think it would be great if you are able to play it. As I have read this is not only me, but I am having issues with low framerate on medium settings which my computer I know can handle, the game crashes atleast every 10 minutes now for me. There has been no updates yet, there are graphical glitches during some cut scenes, the all talked about coop is hard to talk to your allies and some missions are uncompletable when some objectives are missing. Im sure many others are experiencing other issues but this is just what Ive had to deal with so far.The game starts to crash so often it literally becomes unplayable.My System SpecsCPU Intel Core i72700K Sandy Bridge 3.5GHz 3.9GHz Turbo LGA 1155RAM G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 12GB 3 x 4GB 240Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600GPU EVGA SuperClocked GeForce GTX 680 2GB
