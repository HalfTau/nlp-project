Its now playable at last!! !My NB is GTX 850M, i7 4710 2.5 GHz, 4GB RAMOverall is ok, a bit lag on those massive crowd.And my first impression for this game is...Die in combat...Yes, seriously. ACU is the first for of AC that I got killed in combat even worse, got killed by a Military lol. Not to mention those Captain hit like hell and Sniper One shot kill. You can forget the thrill of Edward jumping and rampaging on enemy ships. ACU turn towards a more stealth approach. Combat has raised more difficult, no more streak kill. Now have a head shot hell yeah!. Spear is available as main weapon my favorite.I highly recommend do check your PC spec before purchasing ACU.
