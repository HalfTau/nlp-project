Because there are so many bad reviews for this game i was a little skeptical about getting it in the first place. If this game works for you that is awesome, if not sucks to be you. I do have to say that the graphics were so damn good it hurt my eyes and i had to lower the quality. They solved the issue with this game being too easy and made the combat more like the Batman Arkham Games but instead of being a badass your a chump with a sword and people have guns and decide to drop an ax on your skull while your down. I have yet to try out the Multiplayer but after what i have played this might end up being one of the best designed Assassin Creeds with a protagonist so charming that he could seduce Ezio and a love interest that is SOOO damn fine.
