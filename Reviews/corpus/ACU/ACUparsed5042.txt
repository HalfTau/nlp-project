I have everything on ultra high and I have no framerate issues. I am always online with it and the game is great. The combat system is hard then the older games and being able to be choose what type of an assassin you want is a great concept. So far the story line is interesting not likeing the Rift sections and the character you play seems a lot like Ezio from assassins creed 2. The muliplayer coop is very fun but to get the best experiance out of it i would recommend playing with people you know and not just finding a group. There is a ton of stuff you can do other then just the main story as well you so you can get side tracked quickly and then realize on your way to start a main mission you wondered off to the complete other side of the city. I do recommed this game.Also my computer specs areIntel I7 4770k Processor16 gb ramwindows 7 64 bitAsus 87z Sabertooth mother boardGforce gtx 7702 TB Western Digital hard drive
