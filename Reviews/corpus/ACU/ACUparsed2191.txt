Ubisoft needs you to incorporate their HEY BUY THIS GAME FROM US, TOO crap.  I get helpful stuff from Steam, I dont need another marketer trying to sell me their crap.And, yeah, Intel 5775c i7 with an EVGA 960 and the textures load like crap.  I think that the first two Assassins Creeds did so well that they got full of themselves.This game breaks away from the first two so much, that if you liked the first two, replay those, ignore this one.
