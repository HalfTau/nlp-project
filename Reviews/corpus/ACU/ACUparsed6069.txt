The game is fine, but the framerate is unbelievably horrible. Hopefully some more patches will come, but wait til then.Edit 2 Yay! More problems! NPCs appearing out of nowhere, camera jumping, NPCs going through structures and floating.Edit 3 To clear some things up, THE GAME ITSELF IS NOT BAD, IT IS JUST HOW POORLY IT RUNS. My PC isnt exactly topoftheline, but Im able to run most games at medium to high settings but this game is just okay on lowest.See
