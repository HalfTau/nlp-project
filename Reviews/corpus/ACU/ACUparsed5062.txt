Game has potential if I could even play it. Very poor PC Optimization. I run a GTX 760, not top of the line but should still be able to handle medium settings, since they look worse than the very high settings I was able to run in black flag.Very choppyLow FPSScreen tearingLock upsIt makes climbing and fightings difficult a lot of times. Even if I reduce the resoltion to 900p, which the ps4 is running the game at, it still is bad, and my machine is stronger than a ps4.Will never preorder again, would return the game if that was an option.
