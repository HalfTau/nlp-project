I am a hardcore fan of the AC universe, but after playing this game, it makes me not want to play any additional games by Ubisoft. I have a decent enough system to run almost any game on High, but this is the most choppy, memory hungry game i have ever seen. Something as simple as running in a crowded area will cause much of the game to slow down and freeze and crash. Even after all of these patches, my game is still absolutely horrible. I dont recommend purchasing this game through Steam or on PC for that matter. I havent heard much about the consoles except that have a patch out now. Before, even the consoles were unplayable.The Pros for this game is the free run capability. Finally, they got something right with this game. One of the only good features is that you can now go almost anywhere.The Combat system is nice, I do like the direction they took us in, but the ease of fighting multiple mobs at once has diminished. Its not like Revelations where you can sit back and kill everyone easily.ConsI still cannot believe that they released this game with so many problems. Nothing worked on release day.BuggyFramerate issuesGame CrashesIngame App will lose progressFPS drops near huge crowdsDouble Air Assassination doesnt always work.Oh and you dont have multiple profiles anymore. You have to phsycially delete save files to start over and that doesnt always work.My advice Save your money or buy it on a console. Easier fix with them.Update I decided to give this game one last try after Patch 5 has come out. Every setting I have is on the LOWEST and I am still finding my fps below 30. DO NOT BUY ON PC!!!!!!
