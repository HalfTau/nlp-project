The minimum and reccommended requirements for this game are extremely high, so I was worried that I wouldnt be able to run it, but when I started it up it ran relatively smoothly, especially considering that my computers specs are way below the minimum requirements. This is even more impressive considering that my computer is a 2012 macbook pro and im running the game on bootcamp.Let me repeat that Assassins Creed Unity runs smoothly albeit on low graphics settings on a MACBOOK PRO.There have been some framerate drops, mainly when I go inside buildings or into the huge crowds, but on the whole it plays smoothly and looks good.The only really annoying issue Ive found is that on the menu screens the mouse is really laggy.
