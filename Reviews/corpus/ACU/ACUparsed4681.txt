Preordered the game thinking to myself  Easily one of the best looking games of 2014 On launching the game i noticed in the main menu the mouse lag! nothing that bugged me too much... until i began a new game and experienced the ridiculous frame rate in the region of 10 to 15 frames per second and many other bugs that have defined the game as virtually unplayable! Definitely has thought me to think twice about  preordering a game... especially from ubisoft! unfinished game!!! stay away until huge patches are implemented
