I wanted to like this game... I really wanted to enjoy it and justify the 30 I spent on it. I really really wanted all the negative reviews to not be my experience.But its crap. This game is just complete crap.There are plenty of reviews explaining the exact texture of the crap, so go read those. I just hope this whole crappiness isnt going to become a running theme of Ubisoft looking at you, WatchDogsEdit okay, time for an update. Since the last review Ive upgraded to a GTX 960 4GB and its now tolerable to play. Not great, but workable. And fun. This is miles above AC3. I havent been able to touch the multiplayer, so Ive no idea how the coop works, but Im enjoying the rest. It feels like its taken several long strides from Black Flag back to AC1, which Im all for. I liked the combat and mechanics of 1.But the Mixed user review speaks for itself. Youll either enjoy it or want to tear its code apart. Ironic how the game that divided the fanbase it called Unity.So even though Im enjoying it, I still cant recommend. Its trash. I just so happen to enjoy bits of this particular pile of trash.
