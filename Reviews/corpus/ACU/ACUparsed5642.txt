people are talking about crashes. I dont have this issue. but yes, there are some bugs like AIcivillians appeared outa nwhere, not really a big deal, didnt happen to enemies and some minor bugs in movement as wellreally not a big deal, Im sure small update will fix this. I highly recommend following the hardware requirement for the game. Im currently playing on i7 3770, gtx660 ti. I dropped down all the graphic settings to all lows and 720p to reach just playable stateyea fck Ubisoft. Im getting r9 290x, hopefully by just upgrading my gpu everything will be nice and smooth.
