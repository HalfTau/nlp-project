Many have said things regarding how premature this game was on release.  Although even as of this writing, the game still has issues, it really wasnt that bad.  The only real major issue I had is some of the missions were rediculously and unnecessarily hard.  The story was good and I would recommend playing it, but at the current price of 59.99, I would not suggest buying it unless it is on sale for 50 or more.Actually, the glitches and bugs I experienced in this game made it more enjoyable.  Seeing ragdolls spaz out or go places like they shouldnt gave it some comedic value.  Alas though, they shouldnt have been there and although I liked the story, the following rating is lower than it could have been if it was set in the incubator longer.  6/10
