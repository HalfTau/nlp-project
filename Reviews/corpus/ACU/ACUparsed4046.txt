I really want to have a minor rant, but ill stay breif here1 Beutiful Game  serious eye candy here! but its very demanding  I get roughly 3050 fps average. I dont really dip much lower, even in crowds.2 AI is fairly finicky. Combat wise, its pretty good, they team up now and you cant go on 20 guard killstreaks! however, stealth wise its that of a coconut. enemies hear you stealth assassinate 3 blocks away, but cant see you down the hall.3 contrary to popular belief, I enjoyed the story! I liked Arno and Elise, but the other characters were pretty lackluster.4New parkour ideas are more than welcome! window entering can be awkward though...5 I personally havent had any game breaking technical issues, but they are common to many people. Im sitting here with an i54670k backed by a 970 and 16Gb of RAM and am holding my own pretty well.Overall, I say wait. wait until the major issues are fixed for everyone. Once this game gets some polishing, if it gets polishing, it will be generally review for the better. It just needed more time in developement. I reccomend this game, in a month or two at a slightly lower price. at elast I got far cry 4 for free because of preordering!
