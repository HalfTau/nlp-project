Might be a case of incompatible and outdated hardware but for me, recently upgraded to an R9 290X before picking up this game and I am able to run the game just fine on high settings.  No crashes or anything else to speak of yet.  Im thoroughly enjoying the game, especially after just having played through all of Rogue.To be frank this game does a lot right that the previous games could have done better and theres two very important things that I can mention1. Offering a reward system for 100 synching a memory.  If you have more incentive to do the optional objectives, it makes the experience more enriching and it makes you actually want to accomplish those objectives.  Putting optional objectives just for the sake of doing them for a  completion doesnt offer much incentive.2. Changing the combat so that every weapon isnt an instakill monster and this goes hand in hand with number 1.  You will actually want to obtain and upgrade armor and weapons and the such now that theres a different impact on combat and youre not tearing up groups of 20 enemies with relative ease.
