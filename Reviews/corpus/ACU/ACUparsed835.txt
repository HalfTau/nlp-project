It is clearly far form the best games created, but it is also far from the worst either  at least in current latest version.StoryGuy meets girl. Guys father is killed, girls father is killed. They take revenge.Positives Very nice graphics and animations, well optimized Good art direction Good voices, sound effects Very good music Likeable characters which I found to be no the strength of the series Coop is funNegatives The story is acceptable, there is an OK idea, but it is not that good, overall it felt forced in the way that I almost felt they had the count of the missions, and needed to come up with something supporting that Ending felt as a let down  no interesting thing revealed Stealth gaming without quicksave/quickload and a more forgiving visibility system is not very useful, many times it is just way more efficient to just kill anyone between you and your objective Way to much killing, way to much enemies  it would be much better if it would have fewer strong enemies, Arno the protagonist is a killing machine, I am quite sure that the body count is many thousands, Game design by the numbers  many things to spend time on, but mostly repetitive Many mission types are implemented very primitively no mocap, or properly animated faces for dialogs, useless rewardsWhat could make it better? Making it an RPG  really, if they would add RPG elements, e.g. weapon and armor stats, crafting, inventory, that would make the repetitive feeling greatly reduced, as there would be always change for great look Or making it a shorter, more fucused actionadventure Or by making it proper steath game  with much less killing, and much more hiding from enemies etc. Dialog trees, instead of fixed dialog, characters to talk to even if does not affect the story, just to make it feel more detailed and interactive Add more detail to the word, more interactions Even if cannot mocap all dialogs, at least do a character closeup while talking More dialogs  especially for side questsHow to play the game for most fun? Do main missions, coop / heists, and side missions which pay well Can skip all collectibles, lowly paying single player missions they are not that interesting The murder misteries are OK, but if you do them from long, they start to feel boring and lifeless Upgrade the caf quickly as it manufactures money for you
