Meh.... thats about all I can say about it.I waited until it was only 19 to buy it and once most of the horid launch bugs were fixed. The game ran okay on my pretty powerful rig 4770k, 780 SLI and looked really nice. However, the gameplay was tedious and didnt keep my attention. Would definitely buy this for 5 if you have decent specs. Otherwise, it should be a pass.
