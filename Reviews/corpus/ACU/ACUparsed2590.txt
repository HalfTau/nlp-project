I would say its not the best AC in the market, but its still a great game. If you have a bunch of friends to play with, the coop missions can be great fun. The graphics are great, but then again it may lag depending on your pc config. Ok, the storyline is not the best either, but sometimes we just want to kill kill kill !!! My advice is, wait for a special and get it!
