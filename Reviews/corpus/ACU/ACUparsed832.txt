I cant believe so much more people prefer AC4 with its repetitive ship combat and long distance sailing.I can run it on high unlike AC4Not too easy combatSemiinteresting storyline so far havent finished yetCool customizationCoop is fun asfCoop is kinda dead asfSlightly buggy but nothing too badLooks better than its successor, SyndicateGreat setting and atmosphereI do highly recommend this game.On a sale.
