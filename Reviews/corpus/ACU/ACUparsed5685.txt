Ive put about 7 hours into this game, 3 of them may have been loading screens, but besides that Im pretty happy with it. With my Nvidia 770, Im getting 2030fps I think, I havent checked but honestly I prefer that, it is much more cinematic than something like 60fps would be. I couldnt stand the Hobbit. Anyway, I bought the 99 helix credit microtransaction to reward them for all the hard work they have put into this obviously next generation title.  Good job Ubisoft, keep up the hard work!
