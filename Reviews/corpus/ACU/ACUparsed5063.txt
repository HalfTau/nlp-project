After playing 4 horrible hours of this garbage of a game they call Assassins creed I truly saw what it was and it was I luckily did not preorder this time learning from Watchpoop but I didnt take the reviews to seriously. After I bought it I downloaded it for 12 hours in which I was able to play the next day when it downloaded. Upon playing the frame rate dropped and horrible graphics. I bought this game primarily for the Coop in which I though me and my friend woul be able to play but of course he could never join a game and ubisofts only excuse was that it could not connect to the servers. One mission for about 5 minutes was the only time the game ran at 1080p 60fps for me which was remarkable and looked beautiful. It truly was a shame how I saw the games potential and realize how bad it turned out everywhere else. Ubisoft says that they are working hard to release another patchThe second patch did nothing still could not connect to a co op game and it did not adress any issues but the damage has been done. The amount of thumbs down reviews that this game has had has shown that we are tried of their crap and their stock shows for it. Hopefully my purchase will help you decision to buy it or not. There might be a patch later on but like I said the damage has been done and this game goes down in the books as one of the worst launches in history...
