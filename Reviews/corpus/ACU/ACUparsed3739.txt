Amazing dynamic environments, open world freedom, character animation, and fun easy but deep combat with skills. Best single player game made.Ive beat the game and only had a hung npc that wouldnt continue on a quest, one out of the hundreds I played through.Ubisoft needs to create an random loot generator to give their titles more reward for combat. The rewards are the only lacking area keeping me from playing for years. For an example of a good game that makes you feel rewarded endlessly study Champions of Norrath.This game redefines the triple A title and I could buy Shadows of Mordor even on sale as I knew it wouldnt compare technically.
