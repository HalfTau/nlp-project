I will admit this game was very unplayable when it first came out which displeased me. Apparently they updated it and now it is a little more optimized I am actually able to play it. I have played all of the ac except black... i mean flag, and ill have to say I really do enjoy Unity alot more than the others. The story may have threw me off, but the gameplay is just amazing. I have read most of these reviews and a lot of people complained about it, but to my I enjoy the new finishing moves, armor customization, the skills, the enviorment, and the new weapons. I will admit though the pricing for some of the items are a little bit ing crazy, but their are some coop missions the gives you 10k if you do it right. So for someone who really enjoys the gameplay, but also the story which I rarely play because coop is amazing id so purchase this game and enjoy it. Also has anyone seend my inhaler
