11/27/2014So far the game has promise but after the 2nd mission there is a huge bug that will make you just stop at random in the game. You cant run you cant jump you cant move. This so far has made this game nearly unplayable. I have been having to exit the game and reload it each time to be able to spawn in a new point becouse after the 2nd mission there is no veiw points to quick travle to. If they can fix this i will change my reveiw. Until then dont waste your time or money.Update 2/12/20172 year to get this game to work and still unplayable.My specAMD FX8350 4.0 Ghz, 3x 1TB HD, 24 Gb DDR3 ram, GeForce GTX 1050TI. anyone that says my rig cant run this game is full of it.
