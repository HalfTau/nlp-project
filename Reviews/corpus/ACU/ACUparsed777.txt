If you can get past the bugs and glitches, the game is really good.Graphics are amazing.Parkour feels good when its not bugging out.Really fun to mess around in coop with friends.Story wise, it is decent. Might not be a OMG moment, but it is good enough to keep you interested, for an AC fan that is.So unless you are really a fan deep down, this game would look like a buggy mess to you. And if you look at it that way, just uninstall and refund.
