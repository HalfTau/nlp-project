I will write a complete review in time however I thought I would include a quick summary here.This is one of the most impressive cities/sandboxes in a game ever. As an assassins creed game it is merely ok.ProsGorgeousMoving around the city can be funExperiencing the city is greatCharacter CustomizationA few very fun assassination missions and some good side quests.ConsHuge amount of bugs i didnt get many of the bad ones but this is still buggy, mainly I encountered broken sounds, characters getting stuck etcUplay/Constant in game reminders to spend creed points etc makes for a cluttered hudMicrotransactions optional but cmon!Boring one note characters that come with little to no introduction and leave just as suddenlyStiff controls with mouse and keyboard controls often lock up or dont do what you expectTHE WORST STORY of any AC game to date. Full of plot holes, loose ends and mumbo jumbo jibber jabberCombat has also been changed not sure if this is better or worse.The game is fun as an open world sandbox but story and character wise it has lost all its sense of personality and charm. Combined with a lot of the bugs and poor controls I really hope this is not the new direction for AC.It is a really a shame that they couldnt do more with the base game and the time period. I would recommend this game on sale with a very good rig.As an AC series fan I would still give this game a 7/10 its fun but not great.As a video game fan or if you are new to the series Id give this a miss until its patched and even then please excuse thepoor excuse for a story.p.s. ref bugs I should point out other than a couple of CTDs and Arno occasionally getting stuck on something I didnt have any game breaking bugs and the game ran very well with decent FPS and everything maxed out.I do understand I am in the cast minority on this front so please take my review with that in mind.
