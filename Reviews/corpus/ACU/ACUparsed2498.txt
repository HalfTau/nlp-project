This game was in my opnion the worst AC game ive played, it is literally filled with bugs, as sometimes it really felt like i couldnt even click one button without the game bugging and requiring me to restart to last checkpoint. Some of the gameplay mechanics were also very badly made, such as every enemy in the game having a pistol, although when you kill and loot them, not even the snipers will have any ammo for your pistol, and onther enfuriating meachanics such as that.On the good side, the game has plenty of variety for your characters customizations, allowing you to customize each piece of your outfit, with each different piece giving you some sort of bonus, so that was a good mechanic  taking away the part where to unlock some of said pieces of clothing you are forced to do coop mission. I really enjoyed how this game allowed you to pick what kind of weapons your character uses, letting you pick between one handed weapons, long weapons and heavy weapons. The storyline is decent too althoughThe bad sides to this game greatly out number the good ones. So end of the line is This game isnt God Awful, but it Definitely is NOT worth the cost.
