I was SO excited for this game and the chance to explore Paris.Now Im stuck trying to steal an apple as the game repeatedly crashes.The menu is laggy. The controls are wonky. Theres frame lag all over the place.And then the little matter of an unskippable quest bug in the first 10 minutes of gameplay.Man, Im disappointed.
