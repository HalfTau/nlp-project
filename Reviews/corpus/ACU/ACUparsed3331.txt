Great game and lots of fun. Nice to finnally have an AC game that i can play with friends but like all games it has its flaws. For example, I have a top of the line gaming laptop that can run Crysis 3 with max settings at 30fps but when i play this at max it bairly runs at 10fps. Thats about the only thing I dislike about the game.
