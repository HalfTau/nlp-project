While I wish to not take a negitive mind set to this game. Ive found the story rather...lacking and far fetched then some of the others. Take it as personal opinon, but I found the games after Black Flag were starting to take a downwards drop in quality. With the first Assassins Creed I was almosted hyped up and always excited to play it. No matter if it was 2007 on its release date or even today Im always excited with the story and game play. That I keep that mindset all the way up to Assassins Creed Black Flag but with newer games such as Unity and Rouge. I found my self unterested and rather lost in the plot. Does this mean you shouldnt buy it? No! Its all up to you. Just my thoughts.
