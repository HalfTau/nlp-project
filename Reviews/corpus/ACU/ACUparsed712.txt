Im not sure why this game was considered so bad. Maybe its my nostalgia talking, but I had enough fun to see the game through to the end. fun little story incoming I got this game on day one so I decided to check out the online. I was matched up with an actual game developer. So Im not sure you can say the people who made this game were entirely apathetic about it. Im not sure if this game is worth 60 dollars but its not a bad game still sadly not as good as assasins creed 2. I highly reccomend you play assasins creed liberation first I feel its one of the best yet the most underated games of the series.
