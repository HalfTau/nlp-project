First off, I have never played any of the games previous to this one, save a few hours of BF at a buds, so take this from the POV of a firsttime AC player. Let me just say, the game was great. I played through it in 30 hours, I dont have that many due to my routers shennanagins, and I felt like it embraced the role of assassin well. Playing as Arno was fun, climbing around, finding secrets quite a few to find, learning about revolutionary France, and most importantly teabagging thieves/murders. The fighting sequences werent your typical button mashers, requiring agood deal of dodging/parrying in the later game, but didnt involve complex button sequences. The mysteries were fun, with some actual sleuthing and much puzzling, and while the rewards werent amazing, it helps if you arent farming for money. The initiate chests gave me a few preset outfits, which did look better than the mixmatch outfit I wore previously too. One thing though, look out for a bug that freezes your character if he climbs on something he normally shouldnt be on.If you are a first time AC player and are looking for a cheaper version with better graphics, I highly reccomend the game. the storyline screwups, I enjoyed the game on its own. A great game to pick up on sale, and get the Dead Kings DLC for a little extra spending money and mortar axes. I give this title an 8/10, and hope to play Syndicate as soon as I can get it.
