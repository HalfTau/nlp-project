4 Months in and the game is still broken!I waited until patch 5 before even trying because of what I heard. I even built my current gaming PC just to play this game. I get it booted up, and play for a few hours, and stop. The next day, the game crashes on load. I write to ubisoft support, and they claim it has to do with my system which I know it doesnt as I play many many games on this PC through Steam...Unity is the only one from Uplay.Needless to say, not my machine, yet they are still acting like it was. Then one day, I try again, and theres a Uplay update  and magically the game starts to work again! Then I get into playing it, and this is where the review really comes in.The game is basically unplayable. One of my favorite things about the assassins creed franchise was how fluid the movement and parkour was....and in this game I can almost never make Arno go where I was planning. This is SUPER evident in the 2nd main campaign, where you have a time limit to get to a point, and 1  i cant control Arno well enough to get there becuase of how he climbs so instead of following the path, i just run to the ground and try and climb up to where Im supposed to be from somewhere else, and 2  when I finally get to the right spot at the right time, instead of doing the standard game play button combo for diving off a roof, it makes you hit this strange combo...and then it doesnt work! the door stayed open, I lower myself down, and jump in, but the animation goes back to what would have happened if it let me jump from where I was before!? !The worst is in speaking with Ubisoft, wondering how a AAA game developer can let this happen and not try and produce some good will with their customers, they responded by saying that the free DLC they gave us more than compensates for a 60 game being unplayable 4 months in...Its going to take me a long time before I can trust any Ubisoft game again...and I definitely will not be preordering any of them anymore.
