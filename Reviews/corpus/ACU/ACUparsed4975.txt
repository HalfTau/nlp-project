Unlike some people, i can run this game. the game is actually really fun and coop makes it even better. i think i can free roam with a friend, but i havent checked yet. combat has a fun difficulty and if you want to be stealthy you kind of have to work for it.the CONS are that npcs can glitch a little, even in cutscenes. and that the game needs alot of power to run. i have a really good cpu which is brand new an all that. but the game uses 98 of it.Tldr good game. people are butthurt. need a strong computer to run.
