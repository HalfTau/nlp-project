Assassins Creed Unity  In every single one of the other Assassins Creed games, you may fail once or twice on a mission before you figure out what you need to do, to get it right. In Unity, they apparently threw that design philosophy right out the window. Some of the missions, and these are starter missions, I failed more than a dozen times. Unitys missions, many of them any way, appear to be based more on luck than skill, too. You wont succeed because you studied the mission and planned out your moves  you will succeed because of plain stupid luck. And unlike the other games in the series, when you fail you get to groan in agony as you get thrown back a half hour in gameplay, instead of a minute or two like ALL the others in the series.Unity is the least enjoyable game of the entire series. Do not waste your money. Buy any or all the other Assassins Creed games like I did and enjoy.
