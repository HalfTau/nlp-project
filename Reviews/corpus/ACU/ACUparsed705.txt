I played AC since it was released and Ive played every game ever since. This one is the biggest disappointment. The most confusing thing is the British accent in a French setting. Why would people shout your  instead of quotquot? The first game managed to capture the accents of the French templars. Also, the story was extremly boring. Most of the previous games had awesome stories. When playing the old games, I try to finish an entire game. This time I just wanted to get over it. It is defitnily not worth the money. It is more like 5 poud game. The price they charge for Unity is not justified at all.
