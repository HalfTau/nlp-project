Parkour controls very poorly, often getting stuck on walls I didnt want to climb, downright idiotic AI, and shoves DRM and multimedia down your throat the whole time.Game is buggy as hell, frame rate drops consistently, and the amount of popins and poor quality models on anything further than ten feet away is disgraceful.By god they fixed the microtransactions on that first patch though! Avoid it. Last Ubisoft title I will be buying.
