After third patch, game save does not work at all for a month and after fourth patch, Nvidia SLI stoped working. Game is still unplayable since release date with my computer specs.Update after patch 5  game is finally playable in SLI and stable, save is working, no texture flickering and frame rate is very good and stable.
