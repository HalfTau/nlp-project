Bought this durring the Summer Sale, reading other reviews that the game has been fixed.It is anything but. Especially if you run it on Windows 10. This is one of the most poorly optimized PC experiences Ive ever had.Putting things into context I can run The Witcher 3 at a smooth 60 fps. ACU on the other hand runs below 30, is prone to crashes. Dont waste your money.
