I dont care how god the game if it still unplayable. After the third patch.I really want to play with this game, but i cant, i cant enjoy this...I have about 20FPS, and the game is lagging at least 45 times per minutes.config i52400, 270x, 8gb ram, low graphics, 1600900, yes i know that this config is not enough for the minimum requirement, but come on, i use it with low graph and lower resolution, btw i can play every 2014s AAA games on high/ultra with full HD resolution, so this is unbelievable and annoying.This was the last ubi preorder game in my life...
