Besides from the fact of fps drops and bad optimization on both consoles and pc and the amount of bugs at release the game is also....Alot more slower in pacing in both fighting and parkour, none of wich feels as fluid as they did in the predecessors.Seems like they paced both of them down for the worst, remember getting slightly amped running around in the other games cus it would feel like the movement was fluid and fast!?!? THAT SAIDUNITY!Inunity you dont feel like that even without the fps drops on high end pcs, the game pace is still alot slower then the other games, the so called is customization is a Fkin joke with micro transactions for cash in reasons.The story is ok, the animations are great, the gameplay is horid and slow, and the release optimization is the worst ive seen in years... Fps drops and random crashes is lovely!Hey maybe oft, could test their game a bit more instead of using prebuyers and paying costumers as beta testers? thisrelease wouldnt fly in the old days on the older consoles since releasing a broken game back then was no fix but to rerelease the entire game.But hey now in the days of the internet, developers get away with this kind of t without any bigger knockbacks and they are probably laughing all the way to the bank on release day.As we all pay for unfinished halfway done and in a couple of months the game might be enjoyable, but the release days hassle will have sucked all the joy out from playing it!
