This is  a great game. While it is true that you need a dedicated gaming computer for it it makes of for that with the story and the gameplay. I use a geforce gtx 660 and it works  fine. I do get lag every other minute but I dont mind. Just get a better graphics card, there is nothing wrong with the gameEDIT///I recently got a new graphics card  a gtx 970  and the game works perfectly, no lag, bugs, glitches, or problems. The game is taxing and takes up 95 of all cpu procceses and nearly all of my memory. Do not listen to the haters this game is perfect as long as you have the proper components.
