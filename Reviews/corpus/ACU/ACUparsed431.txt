Finished the game, heres up and downs,A lot of sidequests, assasinations, collectiblesHuge map where you can free run/jump as your hearts contentNice graphics, minimal fps drops on my computer high endGood story but there are a lot of gaps in telling it, quite predictable endingA MASSIVE AMOUNT of sidequests, assasinations, collectibles that gets repetitive after a whileNow the two big points that makes me not recommend the gameGame is hard and i mean not the kind of rewarding hard, its the annoying hard. If youre a completionist like me, you want the complete all assasinations and heists and multiplayer quests right? Anything for the achievements. But even if you finish the storyline which is required for strong gear and upgrade yourself to top gear, you can still get ONE SHOT from snipers. The random guards and brutes are too powerful as well. Im not a fan of earlier AC combat where 1 vs 50 is no problem, but this is annoying. This makes you play the side quests over and over again and gets pretty frustrating for a while. I dont want to plan every heist mission like its the final boss assasination, i want to have fun which i cant at the momentIm an AC fan and played all the games. This game struck me with the graphics....Thats it, everything else was meh. Main character was likeable but not a legend. Story with a stroke of forbidden love was an original idea, but it felt uncomplete because when you see two lovers only seeing each other from mission to mission you just cant feel the emotion. The game tells you theyre in love but doesnt show you. Free run is allrightish, there is a 50 chance you go to where you like. Honestly after 49 hours i want to complete the game 100 percent but it feels like a job now.So buy it on sale, because im not recommending the game on full price
