Initially, the game simple crashed constantly and the frame rate was horrible.  It was unplayable.  While my graphic drivers were up to date, I tried reinstalling them and that fixed all of my problems.The game generally is above 50 fps with a 780.I generally dont write reviews but I want to address the plethora of complaints I am seeing.Bugs all games have bugs.  After reinstalling my graphic cards, I have seen 1 instance of bugs in roughly 8 hours of play.  It had no impact on the game.Frame rates the game is advertised as being very demanding.  They made a game that pushes modern tech.  That is a good thing.  It means if you feel like coming back to the game 2 years from now, it will still be beautiful.  If you do not yet have the hardware to play it on max settings but really want to enjoy it that way, sorry but that is your problem and not a fault with the game.Parkour changes  They changed it.  You now have an up and down option. It takes a bit to adjust but its undeniably a smoother experience with far more control.  I believe the vast majority of complaints are simply people not adjusting well to a new system.Yes, they botched the launch.  No, its not a horrible game.However, I dont particularly like some of the story/style changes.  It is more about stealth and less and less about combat.  Its a bit more niche.The graphics are gorgeous.  However, some of the characters get in to uncanny valley territory.  They look just realistic enough that the flaws become creepy at times.If you liked assassins creed 1, 2 or 3, I would definitely recommend this game.  If you liked the pirate aspect of IV, you may not like this game.
