This was a great game. Minor technical difficulties aside anyway. The worst part is that you have to use uplay. which is worse than originand thats saying alot I finished the game and one day later uplay lost all of my progress. Every part of the game completion gone. So I wasbut decided to give it another shot and i got to sequence 4 again last night. So I log on last night and it lost it all again. So the verdict is is that the gamplay is good, but dont get on pc. Its extremly hard to run and you have to use ucrap.
