Ok, so for this game I will actually make a proper review. I have to warn you that I suck at writing reviews like this cause I never can get to the point.My expectations for this game was not high at all, in fact the only reason I bought this game was because of Rogue which was for me, one of the best ac games hands down. But we are talking about unity so Ill stop praising that game for now.The French revolution is such an interesting part of history and I wished unity wouldve interracted more with it  for me, the story was good, but not as extrodinary as it couldve been. I wished there were more interraction with the residents and a bit more with the historical characters  but tbh the scenes that we got was pretty entertaining. When it comes to gameplay I have to say I miss the old interface that was in ac4 and rogue. I got ofc used to the new one but for some reason I miss the little sync wheel at the end of each mission lmaoOther than that the controls was a good change I think, but it felt very clumsy using them  there were several times where Arno got stuck on a wall and would not go up and times where he didnt want to jump down  and again that can be me at fault, you see, I suck at video games                             ... or it couldve been a bug cause you know, unity isnt exactly bugfree at least theyve fixed A LOT, I only experienced like three minor bugs which wasnt a big deal for me But dont get me wrong, the little change in the games parkour is AMore good things  the multiplayer concept was a very cool thing I enjoy it a lot and will probably play this game more later with friends. The upgrading system was cool too, even though I cringed hard at the micro transactions theyve added in the game.If this game is on sale then I truly recommend it cause its not that bad. I enjoyed it.In the end I just want to give a huge  you to all those guns each stupid policeman and guard had. Seriously, they cant get more OP than that
