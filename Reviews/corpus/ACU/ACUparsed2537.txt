An absolute nightmare of a game. Freerunning, the very core of the entire game, is riddled with glitches and bugs that leave one fast travelling and starting mission phases over just because they become stuck in the ground. And that is just ONE of the problems with the game. Ive always loved the Assassins Creed games, but after playing Unity I will never buy another one. When something is wrong, Ubisoft, fix it. Dont move on and make a new game instead.
