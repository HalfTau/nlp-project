3/10 sadly this game realy let me down i tried to tollerate this game for as long as i could i finaly beat it but with a angerd face, the game was and still is very glitchy some missions rift areas when i get enuff points sometimes i nocliped thropugh the wall another i fell through the ground, iv also had a fatal error my computer trys to solve but when i go to control alt delte or alt  f4 the game will not shut down forcing me to press the power button on my computer to fix it, iv always noticed that the entire assassins creed seires always had a grusum experience with me makeing it feel like this is more of a rage game then an open world game, speaking of which the entire games map and world is sadly very small probly the smallest world out of the entire seiries. and lets not forget when the game was first relased the faces.. ooooh the faces and textures were so broken when i finaly upgraded to a GTX 780 Ti video card it finaly fixed the problem but i still have constant random lag spikes that will throw me donw to 27 fps to 0 for up to 5 secs at a time very fustrating do i recommend this? NO if i were you id rather jsut watch someone on youtube do a lets play of the game belive me this game is not worth your money i first thote somethign was up when it had only been 912 mounths after i beat theyre previous game that i heard they were alreddy talking about the new one, my thote was.... this is too early the game should still be in way beta and while playing the game even after tis full reales it feels like im playing a game and its still in the fetus form of a child aka it felt like a baby was born 3 mounths before it was due being shoved out into a harsh new enviornment and if your wondering if in this game you see some more of the old civilization people no you dont i just finished the game while im writing this review all you see as a hint of them is a sword at the very end of the game so basicly i dont recommend this the world was to small the laging issues for no reason given and stuff.. idk i jsut dident get a good experience of the game and ill probly bet most everyone else had a bad expeirnce as well
