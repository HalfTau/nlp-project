Playing on Windows 10  manage around 4050 fps. Not bad but prefer it to be better as I can play Rogue on Max settings getting nearly 90 fps. Also, the game does feel a bit like a port from Console so the draw distance Which is unchangable is fairly poor as things up close look amazing and great but as things get further away, a distant memory of GTA IV on low settings comes back with distant objects becoming weird bloblike outlines with a miss match of colour, texture and shadow. Also, random NPC drop in, so watch out for that! One women scared me so much when she appeared right in my face.Anyway, bad bits over.The game is beautiful and amazing and looks very realistic. A sort of L.A. Noire feel to the mouth movements as the actions are very good and match very well to the voice acting. There isnt too much frame rate drop either, even when there is a scene with over 100 NPCs, it ran perfectly.The bugs Okay, so there are still a few bugs and the climbing of buildings is not perfect on the Xbox controller, and far more accurate on the keyboard and mouse for me. The bugs are still there and sometimes noticable but lets just say, Ubisoft learnt there lesson with this one and it damaged preorder sales of Rogue. The storyline is fairly good but lacks the modern day feel but the sequel to Syndicate is suppose to incorporate the modern day again and in a better light.If you are a fan of the Assassins Creed series then I would say buy it in a sale. At time of writing it is 50 off Obama  Not Bad and that makes it worth its money  not the full price. But still a nice feature to the franchise.
