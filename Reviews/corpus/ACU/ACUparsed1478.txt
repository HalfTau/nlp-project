I do like the game, and the bugs and clitches makes for some insanely funny moments, but it can be annoying from time to time. The parkour in this game is sometimes a bit clunky and sometimes most of the times actually but that is the only major bad thing about this game. And yes, i know some people expected a solid game without any bugs and a smooth game that does whatever you want it to do. But sometimes its impossible to do. And i know ubisoft ed up multiple times, but still, i did like it. but i do recomment waiting till some sort of sale. I just think the game isnt as bad as most people say it is. Its not what they expected, but it isnt terribleSorry for my bad english, im not born in ingland or something. Just a dutch guy who wanted to speak his mind out is that even a real thing, speak his mind outXD Anyway, imma go now. Bye
