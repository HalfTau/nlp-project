I dont most of the people talking about the game not running good, not loading things correctly, and so on. I on my current normal grade gaming laptop ran the game fine for my taste at about 2735 FPS constantly, for the record I expected much worse. Plus I never really ran into any gamebreaking stuff to be honest.While I agree that the story, narrative, and the main character are pretty bad and dull. I found the game somewhat enjoyable. If you have some friends to play with and the Ubisoft servers will let you play then its really fun to run around and doing all sorts of cool stuff together. There is not a better feeling than coordinating a quadassassination with your friends!ProsLots of customiazation option. You arent limited to just blades and guns.Decently fun coop and coop missions. If you can play with your friends that is.A few likable characters here and there.A very cool map of Paris to explore, plus there are some more cool stuff to check out.A new more neat combat system. I really like it at least, cant wait to get my hands on Syndicate soon so I can try that!Lots of side missions and events to check out as you explore Paris during Frances darkest period.ConsFor some people it may run like crap. Didnt really happen to me.Textures and models may not be rendered or initialized for some people. Again, didnt happen to me.A dull and unlikable main character. Didnt think much of the story anyway.Lots of AI in one area does not equal good. Performance may vary.The new combat system may be hard to get used to for some people. Surely it was a bit for me.It takes up around 46GB on your HDD due to the extensive patching this game has had.8.5/10  Pretty much the Rosetta Stone and Sword Art Online of the gaming industry.
