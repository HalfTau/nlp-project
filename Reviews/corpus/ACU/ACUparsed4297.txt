What do you know, i still cant play this game even after the patch. Its even worse now! It runs like crap, even though my pc meets the recommended spec requirments. Its a waste of money for now. Oh and dont forget that kickass Give me money dlc.  First AC game i ever preordered and i wish i didnt. Most missions are broken on top of all so yea dont waste your money!
