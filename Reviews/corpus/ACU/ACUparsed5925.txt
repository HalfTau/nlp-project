Dear Ubisoft,Heres the thing. Been a hardcore fan of the series AC since the first one. Played them all several times. Love what you have done with the feeling and attention to the actual game. The textures and motion capture for the story scenes are incredible to say the least.Problem is, we all cannot play your work. Its so laggy and stuttery that I had a hardtime enjoying Arnos first intro memory sequence. I can tell that once the bugs are fixed, it will be a fun addition to the series.Of course I am mad right now and I am actually shocked at the state the game is in right now especially since the release was delayed to polish the product. I had even considered of upgrading to a shiny GTX 980 just to play this little beast, but I dont even that would help right now. I feel that as a gamer with an i7 3770k, SSD, ASUS HD7970 and 16GB of Ram I assumed I could play on High settings, and also came to terms with the fact I would not play on Ultra settings.Yes its quite fashionable and also lame to talkabout your company, and I have always defended you against those over entitled neckbearded morons, but I am horrified at the state this game is in. If I were you, I would be calling an emergency meeting with all my programmers and bug chasers and get out a series of fixes ASAP to recoup your reputation as a game company.Sincerely,Horrified Fan of AC
