the only problem i have really encountered besides falling through the map or getting stuck between wall is a white screen that makes everything look like its covered in dense fog or smoke when i go into buildings. otherwise its an amazing game in my point of view. Everyone Has to realise that a game when first released is going to have lots of issues because you have more people playing it so its easier to find those issues. If you Choose to buy the game, have some patience.
