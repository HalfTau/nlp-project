assassins creed unity, in this day in age of technology is THE most beautiful game i have ever laid my eyes on, the shadows, textures, anti aliasing, sunlight, every little detail. honestly i cried because its so ing beautiful. looks just like real life. but of course im gameplay over graphics. when this game first launched holyit was horrible, not in storytelling but jesus christ the glitches, of course being nearly 4 years old, the game is....finally polished to say the least, not saying it took 4 years to do so but still, its an amazing game. my favourite of the franchise honestly...and the fact that you can play multiplayer, as in 4 assassins cooperating with eachother? its ing great.graphics 100/5gameplay, still slightly buggy but 4.5/5
