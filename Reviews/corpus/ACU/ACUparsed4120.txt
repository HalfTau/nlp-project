CONSFirst and foremost the microtransactions, and dlc for this game makes me think that I just got some demo on my phone and to enjoy it I need to pay even more money for something I already paid a full 60 for. It feels so lame.I have not encountered as many glitches as there supposedly are but I have fallen through the floor and gotten stuck before. There are issues with cutscenes where characters become one or bounce up and down uncontrollably and the game has crashed before.The story is honestly the same as all the other AC games. This is not original at all and it is VERY predictable. I was rather disapointed with Arno as he started off strong with humorous dialogue, but that died off very quickly and he became bland. Actually none of the characters are very interesting except for one guy I dont know his name, but he is the eccentric party guy making weird quips with half his chest showing, but he is in the game for a total of five minutes.The frames on PC are positively terrible. I have a cutting edge computer and I cant play on higher graphics levels because the frame drops are near unbearable.PROSThe COOP is VERY fun, although the lack of communication between players is upsetting because it prevents planning together.The gameplay is certainly improved from the last games because its actually hard! I feel inclined to run away from many fights out of fear of dying unlike the last few games where you could honestly destroy Earth with nothing but your fists.The city does feel alive and it looks nice and the parkour design around the city is well done with the exception of falling through things which I have not encountered for some time now. The updates have helped but they are nowhere near where they need to be.Despite my recommendation, I would buy this game, but UBISOFT needs to make changes to ammend for this rushed product, such as releasing updates to fix the god awful graphics issues, getting rid of the annoying and stupid micro transactions in a AAA title, and giving us DLC for free because honestly we deserve compensation and UBISOFT doesnt deserve any more money from the overhype they gave us in the supposedly flawless gameplay videos.
