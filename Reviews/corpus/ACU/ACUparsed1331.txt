This is one of the truer next gen games to first hit the market. Each interior of buildings are detailed, and you can enter several buildings seemlessly. A huge amount of detail on objects with enough polygons. The gameplay has gone more towards the style of the first game, no more instakill execution streaks.Now the bad, NPC popins are intense and bad. Textures on distant objects is PS1 quality. Not to mention the game might bug on you quite often. Apart from that, if you can look past it, there is a wonderful nextgen game hidden beneath.Also fun fact, ACUnity was one of the few games which werent downgraded so kudos to that too.
