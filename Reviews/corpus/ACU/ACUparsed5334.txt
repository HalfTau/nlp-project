Drivers Why is everyone complainging about how sh!t this game runs when most of them didnt get the right drivers?If you have nvidia just get the new drivers, I was running it babysmooth on Ultra high getting about 50 FPS with a GTX 970.As for the story/gameplay Ill have to get more into it to review it but dont listen to anyone who hasnt got the right drivers.
