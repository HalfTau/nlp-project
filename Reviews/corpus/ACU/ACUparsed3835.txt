I would reccomend, but before buying make sure you have a strong enough computer with minimum or reccomended atleast, mine can bearly run it, with minor lag. the way the character is much more fun, the way the character and movment is diffrent and not the same as the perviouse games. the graphics have gotten much better as ubisoft has gone along, the models arnt as stiff but much more flowing with the way that the cloathing ect falls giving it a more realish effect. as i am writing this im not that far into the game, but the story line so far i like.But playing with a contoller is relativly smoothe aswell with a keyboard and mouse.Although it still has some bugs, which will be fixed in patches at a later date it over all good.
