Let me start out by saying, This is a very good game but the problem is that UBISOFT have made this game. Therefore it inherits key UBISOFT features likeSudden LagSudden Crashonly when playing Dead Kings DLC thoughGlitched out charactersMultiplayer broken as which also happens to be a key component of the game apparentlysome othersThe game does have a nice story with much improved mechanics and combat then previous AC games but it often does not feel uniform. The CoOp functionality of the game frequently refuses to workALL HAIL UBISOFT!. Despite submitting a ticket to Ubisoft about the issue, they simply didnt seem to care, in fact so much so that they did not even bother to replyNow thats how you get a booming Fan Base.If you want to buy, buy it for the Single Player which is great by the way.I liked the game very much but I couldnt enjoy it.THANKS Ubi.
