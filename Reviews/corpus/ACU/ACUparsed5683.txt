it looks that ubisoft dont care much about pc gamers  same thing happened last year in ac4 black flag also in far cry 3 on the pc version  they are more concentrated on consoles than pc  this game its a good but extremely poor optimize and thats to bad cause i paid 89.99 for it and i feel i just got robbed  i just hope that some type of law enforcement government agencies start to get into this gaming industry robbery and false advertising  cause ford dont release a car half way finish to the market!
