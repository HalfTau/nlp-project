I was really dissapointed when it first came out because of all the bugs, however since patch 4 got released its fixed almost all the issues and i am now really enjoying the game. The AI is HEAPS better than previous AC games, this game is actually quite challenging now and the map is HUGEEEEEEEE so much to do. I am loving it!!
