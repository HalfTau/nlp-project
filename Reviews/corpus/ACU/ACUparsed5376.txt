Hi,My first impression of the game is slighly disappointing, but let me start off with the good points.I must say well done to the graphic designers of this game, beautiful cinematics. Also a great job done by the historians who gave the game a realistic positioning within historic facts. These compliments exceed the ones I gave to the previous games of this series on those matters. Truly amazing scenery!What I dont like. The gameplay is not as smooth as I would of liked it to be. Very unsmooth handling of the main character and the climbing of the different buildings is not good as well. I hope Im wrong and that I just need to get more used to the movement, but nevertheless, these are my first impressions. Also I noticed some bugs Camera point of view shifting uncontrolled and unintentionalley to the left, mission scenery that is missing like Im walking in a void. These are the things I do not expect to be happening of a 60 euro game.Overall rating of first impression 2 out of 5. Not enjoying the game at this point, but I will continue to play.I hope the Coop features in the game turn out to be realy nice.
