Settings on High looked likeand stuttered and lagged. Went to change them and the game crashed my Computer and Steam wouldnt start. Obviously malicious, notoptimized cash grab, just like Watchdogs. Thanks Ubishit. I paid 60, I expect a great game, notEdit 1 Patch 4 made it even more unplayable. Ungodly load times and a tendency not to start the game itself for minutes. 0 FPS when resuming the game. Computer had to be shut down to stop the madness. Its been months Ubishit. Fix your ing game or give us all our money back.
