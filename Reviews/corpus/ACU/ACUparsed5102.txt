You cant pet the animals anymore. 0/10EDIT On a more serious noteThis game is good in the sense that the story is OK, the technology implemented is amazing, but the performance is really poor.I know my PC is technically the Min specs for this game, but it still runs likemost of the time even though it shouldnt. This game could have been optimized to run so much better, but the people at Ubi decided that they should rush the game.If they had taken a few more months I wouldnt mind, I just want a finished game this game could have been so much better.
