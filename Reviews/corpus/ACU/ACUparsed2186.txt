Game still has minor bugs with controls intermittently but gameplay is pretty flawless besides that. Only writing review to defend against the people claiming the game cant be ran without a supercomputer. I have a gtx 960 4gb i5 processor slightly over clocked and 16gb ram, game runs beautifully at max settings. 60 FPS in videos and 3237 FPS during gameplay. Need more people to play online its a lot of fun. Only real downside to online gameplay is there is no chat and join times due to low community
