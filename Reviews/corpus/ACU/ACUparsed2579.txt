Despite the game being out for some time now there are still endless glitches and random crashes. Its always comical to be some clothes with a sword waiving ahead of it fighting mobs that should just be terrified at this point of the ghost in front of them made by the many glitches of AC Unity. My final point which ruined it for me was when my saved data both cloud based and local became corrupted after 12 hours of play. I was really excited to play this game as someone who has live in Paris but it was instead a huge disapointment. If only game designers understood we would rather have a complete finished product instead of rushed BS for a launch date.
