Do NOT buy this game!I will keep it simple, cuz I am no blogger or whatever. I bought all the previous AC games and I have always had fun.Even AC3 that many people did not like...yes even AC3 was fine! But this thing here is an abomination!LOTS of glitches, the fps is poorer than Donald Duck and you have the same amount of luck as he would..crushing and bugging everywhere in the game, being forced to replay missions over and over again.You cannot enjoy the game, knowing that if you jump to that balcony over there you might get stuck somewhere in the air or in some wall nearby. In the end I was forced to walk, cuz maybe then there would be no glitch on the ground, but NO! There is always smth that will go wrong until the end of the game. And the fps...oooooh that devil.....Skip it! Buy Syndicate if you want and do not but this crap unless they publish that they released a serious update fixing everything. But, I guess they have abandoned this game since last year.
