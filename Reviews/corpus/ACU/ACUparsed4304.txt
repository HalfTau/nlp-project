I like parts of this game  I have played the whole story and most of the side missions. In some ways this is the best AC game yet. The story is awesome, it stays away from the annoying  to me first civilization stuff and focuses on the struggle between the Assassins and Templars  with some character driven conflict thown in there. In this way the game stays true to the creed.In most other ways though this game is a complete failure. It is very buggy. There is a game killing QT event I had to use cheat engine to slow the game to .1 speed. It freezes in random places. I can be in the middle of a crowd fighting 15 enemies, with all kinds of particle effects going on and run at near ultra settings despite the fact that my pc is officially below specs, but then walk into an enclosed space with nothing moving and no complex geometry and everything comes to a standstill even if I drop everything to the lowest setting  windowed  with horrible resolution. Then there is the issue that at least half of the equipment/missions are unavailable to me because they fall behind some Uplay setting that does not work for me  no coop, no multi etc. Then they try to sell you things using microtransactions.Oh well.. so mixed review, but Im most likely going to get a free copy of Far Cry4 out of the deal so I am happy. Maybe after a few months  when everything is ironed out  Id recommend getting this game. Until then do yourself a favor and wait.
