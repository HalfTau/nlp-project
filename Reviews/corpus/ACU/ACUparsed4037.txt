Bought ACU with all intentions of playing.. yet laughs on me it wont even play. I restarted my computer 6xs now and still wont launch it crashes everytime I try..Wasted money hopefully it will help front the pay for some real programs so that one day the product being sold will work as described.. Some really bored lawyers would love to get a hold of this issue..
