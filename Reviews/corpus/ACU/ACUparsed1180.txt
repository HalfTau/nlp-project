Aesthetically this game is jawdropping in 4k, one of the best ever.. The gameplay is fresh and challenging but overall is sort of shallow, the game has shortcomings in regards to the series as a whole. The story is nice and interesting, kept me playing for hours on end.Overall I recommend this game, it has amazing graphics, good gameplay and a good story.
