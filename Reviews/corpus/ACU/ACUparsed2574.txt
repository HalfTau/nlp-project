First, dont buy this game,Second,I hope ubisoft learns from this mistake, they have ruined one of my favorite franchises. I am a huge AC fan i even loved revelation  even though it was a rehash of brotherhood, but it was an all around great game. This isnt.Tips Remove Uplay please, Give us multiple save slot. My saved files were lost twice!!!! i am not going to prepurchase syndicate until i know that it will be worth my money but before they deliver another AC game they should fix all the bugs with unity.and please stop it with the longintro. i wanna play as an Assassin and carry out missions, yea sure give us a little bit of a back story but i felt the back story here before you get into action is way too long.Coop missions what you on about m8! what coop, i waited for a long time in queue and got nothing.
