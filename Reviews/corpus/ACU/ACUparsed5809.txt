3770k  4.5GTX 980 sc16 gig ddr3  2400ssdGame is running between 58 and 83 FPS for me at 1920 x 1080 at ultra custom settings with msaa x 4. I have no idea what stretching is for forcing 1610 maybe. Lots of little glitches that just made me outright laugh involving the population in game.The game play reminds me of AC2 although I dont know if I like the leveling skill system yet.The main protagnist reminds me of spiderman with his little quips and banter. So far its fun.The online server just doesnt work for me yet so no co op or hacking my weapons, just error codes.In game e store doesnt work either if I cared. I really wish the draw distance and lod could be increased further, when you go to sync on a tower and pop pop pop, it looks awful.Im going to finish this on thursday when I have time, maybe I will see all this horrible frame rate and game ending glitches then.
