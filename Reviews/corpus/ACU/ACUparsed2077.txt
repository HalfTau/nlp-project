If you find this game on sale at 20 dollars...you will get your moneys worth. I cant see paying anymore than that. That being said it has great lenght and a pretty good story. There are certain aspects that dont make me happy...such as flashes in the screene that hurt my eyes. It is a part of the game where the main character is experiencing issues with the program he is in. Targeting system is a bit messed up. All in all buy it when it is on sale.
