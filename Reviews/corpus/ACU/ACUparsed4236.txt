I am enjoying this game a lot, I really love the setting and gameplay. It has probably the most new features of all AC games besides the first one.It must be said however that at launch this games was buggy and still is relatively heavy for mediocore machines.Also ... requires Uplay CoopThough not available in all missions, coop is lots offun and generally works good  if you can connect to your partners new engine of movementvisible in movements that no longer look the same as those of ezio and altairAlso a downward button makes climbing a lot more easy and fun French revolution!bit personal though, the chaotic ambiance of the time period is very clear, also makes it a bit more believable when   people are randomly killed customizationBrings player choices to the game, around 57 clothing parts per level 6 levels for each slot head, body, legs, wrist/gloves, 6 different weapon types, including ranged, 6 levels as well Graphics look pretty sweet imoits apparently debatable, but the large collections of people next to the level of detail of the buidlings and people is great. AI is a better, fights are a lot harderNo more taking the whole crew of a manowar on your own, as far as Ive seen 45 is the max.AI searches a little bit better when theyve lost you, still pretty easy to vanish though. buggyMainly at launch and mostly gone, but a few persist. Connection issues was my biggest problem.Also got stuck in the floor 2 times in about 20 gamehours.Uplaynuff said Availability of microtransactions and randomly expensive stuffthus far only seen useless weaponpacks and boosts doing more damage for x mins for purchase/ Companion app and AC initiates Not Requiredwould be horrible if it was required to play all missions or unlock all gear. However companion app is not required for those and initiates seems to work automaticaly. In the end they give some fun customization options, that you can miss I could, at least/ Club competition required for most highest level equipmentFirstly, club guild/clan competion hasnt been released yet, might become  or  ...Not sure if winning is required, but these items seem to be unobtainable for people not member of a club or even without a competetive nature.GenerallyRecommended to everyone with a love forsemihistoric adventure gamesassasins creedcoopClearly not recommended for whiners and people want to play an optimized bugfree game above all else, unless one of the above applies .
