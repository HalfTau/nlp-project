Originally played on PS4 when it released, picked it up on PC to play with a friend.Its definitely changed for the better but is just unfixable at this point.Pros A beautiful huge city. Very nice animation. A fairly good story with nice characters. Parkour is fun when it works. Great RPG upgrade elements. Loads of customization. Good combat.Cons Still incredibly buggy even after multiple patches. Miserable stealth gameplay. Repetitive mission design.Lots of good about this game but even now I cant recommend because of bugs. Its a shame because this game is really good.7/10.
