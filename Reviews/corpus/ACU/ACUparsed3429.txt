PerformanceACU is a really good game and the graphics are amazing but the big problem in perfomance lies in your processor. the game tries to render hundreds of NPCs but most processors cant handle it, thats why I think the game has low performance for MOST people, I have a quadcore processor and its was very laggy, If you turn antialiasing to low or off, your performance will be improved greatly. my friend has an 8core processor and has no lag issues so if your thinking of getting ACU make sure your processor can handle it. I will recomend this game to everyone but like with most games, make sure you have the propper specs. Its a great game.InGamein ACU stealth has be overhauled into an amazing system, and also having a stealth button helps to. combat is now much harder so it gives the user a reason to stealth. The perk trees they added now lets you do more in what playstyle you like, combat or stealth. customization is also much better too, change your armor for your playstyle.with all that i highly recomend ACU, just make sure you can handle it.
