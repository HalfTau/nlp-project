it has a few downs like not whistiling, unarmed or hidden blade open combat, and most sad of all....no more human shields for saving you from bullets isnt that a pity? BUT....the game is quite interesting and fun....and you can get to wear the previous famous assassins....you get to wield many weapons theres also non lethal in case your wondering....quite alot of customization of gear.....its quite fun for people and friends to play...
