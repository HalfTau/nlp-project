I would not recommend Unity as it was released and in its current state. Its not inherently a bad game there are flashes of brilliance throughout the campaign and coop is a welcome addition. Paris looks stunning. Theres only a handful of characters that stand out, which is unfortunate. Especially Black Flag had much more engaging characters than this years release. If the game was technically sound, I would still recommend it. However, the game runs really poorly, and theres macrotransactions in the game as well which are quite inyourface in the menu the store is the second item! Are you kidding me? Theres even chests that cannot be opened without a companion app which doesnt work half of the time and costumes locked behind their ridiculous AC Initiates system, which isnt even fully functional.This game1 was released too early should have had more testing done2 is gameplaywise  unlockwise flawed e.g. macrotransactions, weird unlocks3 has annoying reminders that theres other things to do but play the game initiates, companion app, uplay, etc4 has a rather disappointing story e.g. Napoleon doesnt even appear more than THREE times, even though he was cites as a major character some parts are good, some parts are just... boring5 runs poorly patches have been promised but you will most likely still need beefy hardware avoid for now  still poor performance as of patch 4Its not all bad. If you enjoy AC games, you might want to consider it down the line if its issues are patched!. But for now, it was a major disappointment, and I wasnt even hyped that much. Its a beautiful game with a lot of flaws and annoyances. So, unfortunately, for now, I cannot recommend this game.
