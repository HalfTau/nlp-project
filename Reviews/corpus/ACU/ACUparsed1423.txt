Not even gonna touch on the optimization, Im gonna gripe about the multiplayer. I tried to turn multiplayer on and found i couldnt connect! Ubisoft is doing jackabout it and the solutions are complicated at best. Im used to these kind of solutions, but not everyone is. And it is tedious to go through. Dont get this game, I beg you.
