A lackluster story and characters certainly dont elevate this title but the game mechanics and the immersive world of Revolutionary France are a fantastic achievement. If you are a series completist or are interested in exploring a world like this its a fun way to spend some time, but not a must play otherwise. No issues with bugs for me.
