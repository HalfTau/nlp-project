This game sucks, 7 hours into this crap and I cant take it anymore. The story is so ing bad and all over the place. Too much annoying HUD clutter, icon diarrhea on the map and just for some reason out of the blue the game decided to throw me into the DLC instead of the main game and now I apparently cant get out of this until I finish some missions and sync all viewpoints. Ive had enough of this Game does not look as good as people mentioned, constant sound dropping in and out and on top of everything else this is hands down the WORST free running in an AC game to date. What a ing travesty. Ive played and finished all AC games up to this point but I cant take another minute of thisOnto Syndicate if I can work up the nerve. ME!
