Barely runs on AMD systems and has a huge memory leak for RAM it uses 96 percent of my RAM32 gigs of RAM as of writing this, I will write an actual review when I can play the game without fear of burning out my RAMEdit Still broken beat the game running at 1520 frames per second just because I felt I bought this garbage Im going to beat it I still to this day dont recommend this game it runs poorly no matter what rig I play it on and to top it off Arno has to be the least interesting Assassins Creed character ever seriously we went from Edward Kenway and Aveline de Grandpr to this cardboard cutout I say wait for the next game and ensure that its a working game even before you buy it
