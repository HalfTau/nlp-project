Let me Start off first by saying i dont review many games,only the ones that i think deserve it.Now, i think this game has got alot of flack for the launch and the following 12months, and rightly so.the game now is very playable with little hick ups  here and there. nothing game breaking anymore.Ive loved the hours so far ive put in to this game, its also the nicest looking AC game i still havent played Syndicatethe Gameplay mechanics are better than the previous versions  and the main character is quite likeable.Would recommend
