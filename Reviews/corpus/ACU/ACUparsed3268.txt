Now even though this game didnt start on the right foot, as time passed and the patches came in, the game did acheive the state it was supposed to be in. Overall, AC Unity is a great addition to the franchise. Arnos story was an interesting one that included lots of interaction between the Assassins and Templars and good character build. The new parkour mechanics felt great and fluid, the increased difficulty in combat promoted stealth, the way AC games are supposed to be played Even though I believe a true Master Assassins should be able to take out a bunch of guards with ease anyway, and the new RPGlike character customization definitely played out better than I expected. Paris is huge with tons of content and places to explore! I have over 50 hours played and I think I still havent visited every section of the metropolis. The only thing I didnt like about this chapter of the series is that it had almost no Modern Day Story. I felt like Arnos story, even though interesting and important in itself, had no connection to the modern day problems Junos ultimate goal, the remaining Assassin camps, and Abstergo Industries next step. Maybe well just have to see if any of Arnos story actually is connected to the modern day through a sequel cough AC Victory cough. In conclusion, I definitely recommend this game to any AC fan and even newcomers since there really isnt much of a modern day story that you wouldve needed to know about details from previous games in order to understand.
