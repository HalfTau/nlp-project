game looks amazing gtx970 everything ULTRA with vsynch ON and 4060fps constant the game plays awesome!!! BUT..BUT... The story and the ability to keep you interested are completely gone.... you dont feel like a real assassin you feel like a somewhat good swordsman with a hood on and some gadgets.... the story is bland and not interesting with no emotions whatsoever.... It seems like they put all their focus onto the graphics and the revamped game engine which i will admit are super amazing BUT what is graphics when gameplay is poor?..... Iv played every single AC game since the very first AC game when i told people about it and they said it sucked WELL I LOVED IT!  That makes me a true fan and i can tell you... this game is a let down.... im sad... and then ubisoft rolls out stating We would be stupid to not release a game every year  ..... SERIOUSLY???? This is turning into a Call of Duty hell hole, im.....
