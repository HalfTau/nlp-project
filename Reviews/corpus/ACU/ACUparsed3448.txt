The customization, the combat, the stealth and movement, its an overall great game with all the patches its had.. No more gliches and this is a very good port. Feels like the assassins creed we use to play back with AC1 but with all new game mechanics. Im glad i purchesd it on sale.. online coop is quite addicting, 4 assassins running around need I say more? So dont listen to the critics and go watch some gameplay and see for yourself mates.
