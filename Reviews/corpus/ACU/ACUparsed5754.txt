This game takes my computer and turns it into a second space heater. A pretty worthwhile use of my money given it costs about the same as one. If you are a Canadian, Russian, or living in otherwise cold places I would strongly recommend this game because it takes even the most highend computers and makes them give off enough heat to make your bachelor pad a bit warmer. 10/10 would recommend Space Heater Simulator again.
