I think its bad that Ubisoft released a buggedgame.I have allways liked the AC games and I bought this before release, and now I really wish to get my money back. First the starter screen was broken Was only to update the engine Then I got HORRIBLE FPS and I even put all the settings to the lowest, didnt think so much about it and started playing. Still horrible FPS, unplayable even. I know its ALOT of other bugs as well, but thats what I got. I thought that it was gonna get fixed after the update, so I waited. The update came, still fcked. So I dont know anymore. If anyone know if its only my computer, tell me 33I do NOT recommend this before we know its fixed.xoxo
