This is the worst assassins creed yet. It glitches often, even on a highend pc.  The gamplay is choppy and I have just about warn out my mouse sensitivity button switching from gameplay to map.  Do Not buy this game.For a better use of your time and money, get a stack of paper, a pack of pens, and play tictactoe with yourself.This is the reason I will no longer pre ordwer anything from ubisoft.  They are incompetent, idiotic morons who cant keep their word.
