Honestly, one of my favourite Assassins Creed.Rarely ran into issues thoughout the game and the story was fine. Game is receiving way more hate than it deserves.Going back to AC4/Rouge, AC Unity actually felt like an improvement to engine, graphics and freerunning overall albeit needing tweeks still however especially optimisation for a majority of players.The only issue i had which many would agree is how they changed combat. It really made the game too difficult in some areas and clunky in others. Unlocking skills however was the worst part of this game.Looking forward to what Ubisoft will bring to AC Origins!
