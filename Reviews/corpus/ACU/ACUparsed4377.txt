I have been a strong supporter of ubisoft for years and have owned most of their games ether on pc or on xbox and assassins creed has been one if not my favourite game series, but this game is absolutely appalling i cant belive how unfinished this game is. The fps is all over the place no matter what settings im on, even at the lowest possable settings im getting 1040 fps and it constantly jumps back and forth. Even looking past that the game crashes constantly I dont think I ever got more than a half hour with out a crash. This game ruined ubisoft for me, for them to allow a game to be released with this many problems is discusting. The worst part about all of this is the game accually has great potental, the story is great, the best I personally think since AC 2, and the games absolutly beutiful. The art designers really went over board with this game everything from the buildings to the people look amazing, it is probably the best looking game I have ever played. I really want to like this game and recommend it to other people but it is just so broken I couldnt recommed it to anyone. I hope that ubisoft fixes these bugs because I really want to like this game.
