This game is amazing and is defiantly worth the money. Just finished the story and it was AMAZING. Im not sure why some people dont like it. If you have a good enough PC you can handle it with 50 fps on High settings. I have a GTX 970. The interface is amazing and so is the whole game. In my opinion it is the best Assassins Creed game in the series so far.
