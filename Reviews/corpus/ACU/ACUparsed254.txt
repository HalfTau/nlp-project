This product is awful Im literally sitting right across from the router and it lags like crazy no offense, but i doubt steam even updated it other than the deadkings they put none of the bug fixes so im getting stuck to the ground, floating in mid air, and the game crashes like every time i try to do a mission how can anyone like this? Dont spend money on this I heard of refunds  only had it one day but i wzs on it 7 hours cuz i was desperate because i didnt have an xbox one so i deserve a refund!
