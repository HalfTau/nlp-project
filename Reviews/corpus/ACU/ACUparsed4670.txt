Cons Performance optimization can be challenging for non technical users. Character does not always move as expected. Some lag, NPC rubber banding etc. Uplay interface is a downer as always. Game was released too early.Pro Very impressive project. Finally good coop! Great open world play, lots of things to do. Excellent voice and story line. Graphics are outstanding if you are willing and able to optimize your settings and/or upgrade your system.Summary Buy this game, but be aware that it will not run perfectly at all times. Show me another game ON THIS SCALE that does run without fault and Ill modify my review.
