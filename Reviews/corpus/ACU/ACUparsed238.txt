Unity is my favorite and Ive played almost all AC releases.Coop missions, are the best part of the game while trying for the perfect mission run.The game play, story, characters, fight methods, beautifully designed and rendered world, voices, history... everything about it is fantastic, highly detailed, beautiful and incredibly well done!I could think of a few improvements Id like to see multiple game saves and a photo mode would be nice but I could go on endlessly about all that I love about this game. If they added more Coop missions as DLC Id buy them.Have never had any bugs or play problems at highest settings on my Asus ROG G20 w/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970
