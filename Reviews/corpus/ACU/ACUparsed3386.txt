Could be a great game if it wasnt Ubisoft. Their games feel like a masterpieces which been 3050 done and released. You will probably enjoy it if you have GTX770 or better gpu and if grab the game on sale. Otherwise youll regret paying for it. Story is real rap, there are lots of side missions and activity, but its not really worth your time...For me its something between ok and good with real bad optimisation. Id give it 5/10.
