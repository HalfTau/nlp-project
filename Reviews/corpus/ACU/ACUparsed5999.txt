Currently this is a messy bug fixYou easily clip into walls, rails, and the like becoming stuck forcing you to exit the game or fast travelYou easily fall through the ground, forcing you to watch as the avatar of your character becomes smaller and smaller until after a couple minutes you dieGame has CTD Crash to desktop issues related to Uplay and the Companion ap as well...Game has terrible performance issues on the ps4, xbone, and pc Which does make me wonder that they are some serious coding problems rather than system specs...Furthermore, Uplay is a messy piece of crap DRM that isnt working 70 of the time which causes problems in the game... including the aforementioned CTDs...Maybe, once those of us who purchased the game are finished prealpha testing it for Ubisoft then the game wont suck... For right now, save your cash.
