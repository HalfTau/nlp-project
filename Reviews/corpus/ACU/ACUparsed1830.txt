A great game, when it works. I have all the requirements to run this game, and I run other games like it perfectly. The problem is it doesnt seem optimized for PC. but if you have a good PC mine will run it a reccomended but I do have the bare minimum graphics and I am on a laptop I would pick this up on sale since your going to be spending a lot of time towards the beginning agusting everyrhing so it can run.tldr good game if you can run it, I cant apparently.
