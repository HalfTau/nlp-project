THE BAD First off everything bad youve heard about this port is probably true it glitches, crashes, even at highest ultra settings the textures screw up, and a lot of little things that made the world more engagin were left out, worst of all you can no longer pet dogs THE GOOD Besides all that though the game is really fun and the side quests give you a decent amount of time and interesting content making you solve puzzles, crimes, or good old fashion steal and kills. The story this time around is unique too without giving too much away lets just say you may enjoy the new take on templar/assassin relations. The new weapons are okay, not really anything new but having a choice about how you equip you character can let you make a tank for one mission and a stealth killer for another pretty easily with the right amount of coin. The coop missions are great fun too, you can even play them solo if you feel like you cant handle it if your a collector than you most likely will end up doing this if you dont have a crew or jump on with random ppl and torch a mission together Honestly I had so much fun with the coop I neglected the main story until I beat them all.Great game, even with its issues.
