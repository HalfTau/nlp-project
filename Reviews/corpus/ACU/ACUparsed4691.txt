I dont understand what negative comments are about... I can run this game at Ultra Settings in my Rig... Pentium 4 Hyper Threading / 512 DDR Ram / Nvidia 5500. The Story is great... The Main Character Arno did not end up in a Guillotine. So what are you waiting for? .... Fork out that money for a Gold Edition, heck it already reached Gold even before the Mother Lovin Steam Preorder began...
