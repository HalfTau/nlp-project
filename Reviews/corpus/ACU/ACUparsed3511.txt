PC Rig Nvidia GeForce GTX 750 tiIntel i7  3.2GHZz12 GB RAMI dont see any reason for this game not to work, even on the lowest setting, but it does. Right after starting it up for the first time, it would barely work with the setting as low as they get. Now I get I dont have a super computer, but this is just ridiculous. My computer is not so bad that I shouldnt be able to run this game. Bad move Ubisoft.
