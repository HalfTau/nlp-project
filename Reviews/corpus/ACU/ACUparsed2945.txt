Fantastic game, extremely fun, BUT Ive lost my memory twice already. I was max rank which takes a good ammount of time and I lost all my memory. Im a pretty easy going guy so after trying numerous fixes I decided whatever and started a new game. Now Ive lost all the memory of that new game, thats when I got So in conclusion, I highly recommend this game because its really fun and has tons of stuff to do, but be prepared for bugs and crashes.
