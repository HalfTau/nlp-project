So I see all the reviews for this game, and all the other users beating on its quality, but I would in no way give this game a thumbs down.This game, set on medium graphics, looks absolutely stunning, and actualy better than some other games out there on Ultra settings. My computer runs this game very well, although I will admit to a quick FPS drop every once in a while whenever I run into a larger croud or a riot. The thing is, my PC specs arent the best in the world! I have a AMD FX6300 3.6GHz, 1 x 8gb stick of DDR31333, and a Gigabyte Radeon HD 7870 2GB Video Card. These might be good parts, but I see comments with people miles above me, complaining about the quality, and I fail to see what all the crap is about.As far as game concept goes, I think this is the best AC game yet to be released! A coop gamestyle has been on the top of my list for years, and Its story line and setting seem to just slide right along with everything else. The freeruning system is at the top of its game, and controlled descent is one of my favorite additions to the series The best part is, for once, I am actualy interested to follow along with the outer story, rather than just the period time setting!Maybe its just cause I am just such a big fan of the Assassins Creed series, but I wouldent give this game anything less than a 8.5/10 overall. This game is really better than all the crap its getting.
