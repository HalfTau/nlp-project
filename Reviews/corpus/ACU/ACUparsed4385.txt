Are you a fan of the Assassins Creed series? Then its ok for you to bu... You know what, no. Even if you love the Assassins Creed games. Dont buy this game, its broken as hell. Its so broken i dont even dare to continue playing this game. The game crashes almost every goddamn time. Almost everytime when im inside a building, the screen goes blue so i cant see a thing. The game is unfinished. This is a big game that should take more than just 3 years to make. It would actually be alot better if Ubisoft delayed this game to TBA 2015 instead. Dont buy this game, ignore it. If you want a great Assassins Creed game, then i recommend Assassins Creed IV Black Flag.Now that i think of it, im actually really glad that Rocksteady delayed Batman Arkham Knight because they know that the game can have alot of problems if you release a few months after its first announcement.No, skip this game. I just recently downloaded the third update for the game, the game is still broken.1/10
