I have preordered, played, and enjoyed every Assassins Creed game, sense the first one. Some of them may have had their issues, but theyve always been playable. I preorder AC Unity, and AC Rogue, and pick them up the same day. Rogue runs just fine, Unity? Riddled with bugs, freezing, crashes, and of course the insainly slow framerate. Assassins Creed Unity is unplayable. Seems like my wait to play through this game will be even longer. I highly suggest not paying for this game, until Ubisoft fixes this issue.
