Ive played all the Assassins Creed games, and so here we are at Unity.Short version Id recommend this, on sale. I didnt encounter any gamebreaking bugs, and performance was good enough on my Nvidia GTX 970  Windows 10. I was expecting much worse, but I suppose by the time I got around to it, Ubisoft had fixed the most notorious issues? Dunno.Anyway, the game is more like AC2 or AC4. Namely, its back to walking/running around the openworld. Naval stuff is entirely gone, which is a shame to a degree  that was welcome fun in AC4. The story is midlly interesting, which is the worst sin I dont care about Arno. Elise is easily the most interesting character here, and her involvement is...not ideal. Id gladly have played Unity if Elise were the main character but here we are.Graphically, the game is very easy on the eyes. Paris looks great and felt alive to me. Arno not so much.A bland entry in the franchise, recommended but barely 3 out of 5.
