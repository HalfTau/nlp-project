This is my revised review, the game is hands DOWN TRASH! Laggy, unoptimized, this isnt. I dont.THIS IS NOT TYPING ENOUGH! I AM AT A LOSS FOR HOW CRAP LIKE THIS KEEPS GETTINGSHOVELED ON THE PUBLIC!!!!!! This game was CLEARLY rushed, that is an understatement.THE FRAME RATE DROPS HAVE FRAME RATE DROPS! It is like Ubicrap took a page from thatrapper on, pimp my ride and said, Yo dog, I heard you like frame rate drops, dog we PUT FRAMERATE DROPS, on those frame rate drops, AWW SNAP ! AWE NAW! This game is HORRID!Challenging combat? Yeah, because the lag results in me DYING NONSTOP! Calling his gamegarbage, well, that is the centuries BIGGEST understatement. Takes me an hour to get around themap, not because of the size, but because of the frame drops. I hope ubicrap never names their kid,Frames Per Second , seeming as they would drop the poor thing constantly. Assassins GreedScrewing me is what this game should be called, I would ask for my cash back, but I have a betterchance of Barak Obama NOT doing something that makes me hate to be an American. I mean thatguy screwed up his presidency, as much as ubicrap messes up their games. People only defend himbecause he is black, and they are scared to oppose him, or it is, racism just like the people likeubicrap because they are black... Flag. Ha, got you, you thought it was a race joke! All merrimentaside, I only joke so much to keep a synonomous nature with this game! IT IS A JOKE!I effectively paid someone 40 too heave out a bowel movement on me. Sorry if my spacingaggravates by the way, I only wish to help people read this better. This game, IS GARBAGE! IT ISTRASH, WORTHLESS, FECES, REFUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stop buying games from lazydevelopers!!!!!  I am DONE with Ubicrap now! EA, and a few other companies. I will only buy actualQUALITY products, or nothing at ALL from them. I only bought, Mirrors Edge and my PS4 copy of,Dragon Age Inquisition from EA. I also WAIT to buy DLC, unless it is QUALITY maps, modes,etcetera! We as a gaming community WHOLE need to be more stringent, and tight with our money.I cannot believe there are people that defend this crap company. COME ON! No matter HOW GOODyou think the game is! THIS IS INEXCUSABLE! People are defending a broken game, with an okaystory. I am done with Assassins Creed. I am done with Ubicrap, I am DONE with, Electronic Tarts Iam done with buying  games now. This is ridiculous, I am actually cursing, and throwing aroundunbridled obscenities. Save your money, for gods SAKE, save your money. THE START UPSCREEN LAGS! What does THAT tell you? THE DAMN START UP SCREEN LAGS, YOUR MOUSEWHEN YOU SELECT OPTIONS, LAGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It actually somewhat takes talent for lagto have lag.
