Pros  if you can run this game it is visually stunningCons  Note I said if you can run this game. The hardware required to run Unity on the PC is absurd compared to most other titles out there. Unless you have the best possible Nvidia card coupled with the fastest possible intel i7 the abysmal framerate drops and graphical bugs make this title utterly unplayable.Note I cant say more than this because my playtime amounted to about 45 minutes of trying various settings to make it run before ultimately giving up. Also, I purchased this game after the 5th patch, seeing the awful release date reviews I decided I would wait to play the latest in my favorite franchise, thinking the patches would fix it. NOPE.
