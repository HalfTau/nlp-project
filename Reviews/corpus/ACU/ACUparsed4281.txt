I love this game. no bugs or gliches for me. its a blast. Theres so many bad reviews but I havnt had any trouble with it. I think lots of people forgot that this game is next gen, as in on the console versions you have to have an xbox 1 or ps4, so if your computer is a bit old school then you wont be able to play this game. me and my friend bought the game at the same time to play together and his computer could not handle it but I had no problems.
