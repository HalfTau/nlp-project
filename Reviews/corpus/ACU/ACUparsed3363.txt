I love Assassins Creed. Poured dozens of hours into each entry, and still own all of them today. This game is more of the same. If you have played any of them from AC 2 forward, then youve played this one. Saying that, has some pretty sweet addiditons, like the modular armor, where you can customize each part and build a fairly unique assassin. The Coop is good too, with rewards like cash and Armor peices that you cant otherwise get. There are also Murder Mysteries that you can play dectective and discover who commited the crime, which I throughly enjoyed, except that you can just run straight to the culprit and accuse them with no evidence and still get the maximum reward, so dont know what thats all about.As of this writing, 1/22/15 there are numerous bugs and glitches in the game, from what I understand a lot of them have been hammered out, but one that I keep falling prey to is a strange 5 second lag, where the game locks up, and when gameplay resumes, all the cloth and hair physics move like they got pulled 5 feet in the air, and bounce back to normal. If you happen to be climbing or walking on uneven terrain when this happens, you can be stuck in the ground, or in the air, completly unable to do anything, forcing a reload to last checkpoint. which can get VERY frusterating.All in all, despite the glitches, I am finding myself enjoying this game, and playing with friends with the Open World CoOp. Just give it a little patience.
