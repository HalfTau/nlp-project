The game overheated my CPU on low settings causing my computer to crash.Other than that, the game runs terribly, has low fps, keeps bumping to really low fps all the time causing my mouse to twitch. Dont bother with this game before they have heavily patched it. Also encountered some really stupid glitches as soon as you do something the game doesnt expect.Game seems fine gameplaywise, though I feel they could have kept the old controls as the new ones are somewhat annoying. Downwards freerunning is nice though.Long story short, dont bother buying this game before they have patched it and optimized it a LOT.
