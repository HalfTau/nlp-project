I bought this game on sale around Christmas at half the price and I hoped for the best. I read numerous reviews of people complaining about this game, however, because of the coop option that only Unity has , I took the risk I had to convince Robert too, and I did.Hint  I knew from the beginning that this game was released in a very bad shape, full of bugs and all, but I thought  hey, almost 2 years passed from launch, things change, and change they did.I was not dissapointed. Not at all. The game run almost flawlessly on my computer, and on Roberts computer too. We did find some minor bugs, not many though, nothing really annoying, no deal breaker here.Truth be told, f you want to buy this game for the single player option, I wouldnt know what to tell you. Frankly, I played very little Unity in single player just the first missions so I can unlock the coop option.But if you want to try some very fun interesting cooperative gameplay  this is your game just watch the video I made with Robert on my page.Very, very good coop feeling and experience! For a good couple of hours, we played and laughed and did all sort of gimmicks in free style roaming, and we did some of the missions too!I highly recommend this game for the coop option  absolutely amazing! Great fun to be had wth a friend or two!Enjoy!PS After Unity, I bought Syindicate too, Ive played a little, but Im so sad that Syndicate has no coop, thats really a shame! London would have been great to explore with a friend!PSS Ive seen the Assassins Creed Movie too  amazing, you have to see it!PSSS When you play Unity, do yourself a favor and change the language to French!
