When the game actually functions properly, this is the best Assassins Creed game to come out in a long time, at least machanically.You have more control over your movement still needs work though, the combat is actually a challenge at times, and youre not the overpowered demigod that you were in previous iterations of the series. Its the only Assassins Creed game I actually enjoyed since Brotherhood. If everything went right, it would have been a step in the right direction.However, as everyone knows, it didnt. The game has performance issues across almost everyones machines for no discernable reason, and its filled with bugs at every turn.I was lucky. Maybe my computer runs on black magic or something, but at 1080p, almost max settings, I was able to get about 4560 fps for the vast majority of the game. My computer however is likely just a fluke, as people with even stronger machines struggle to get that speed in the same conditions. I was also lucky enough to actually not encounter a single game breaking bug during my playthrough, the only bug I found was one time a NPC was running down the street, arms and legs stretched, flailing them like a necromorph.Based solely on my experience with this game and not the experience others have had, I have to recommend it, but it is the most cautious recommendation of all time. I know that for most of the people reading this, your experience will not reflect mine. Honestly? Wait a few years until a new generation or two of video hardware comes out before picking this up. By then, maybe youll be able to just throw enough hardware at the game where the performance issues wont matter as much.
