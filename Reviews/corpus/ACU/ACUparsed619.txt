This is a game I sped through to be honest, I beat the campaign as quickly as I could because as a historian who is into gaming this game just massages my brain in all the right place. However, Im bored of this franchise and this game didnt help. The narrative is literally meaningless in terms of stakes and actual impact on the world created by the franchise. Its still buggy as  and that is unacceptable given the fact that the game has been out for years. If you feel like you want to skip an Assassins Creed game than pick this one as the one to ignore and I say this despite the fact that Arno is my third favorited assassin after Altair and Edward.The full review is over here on the blog.
