Absolutely shameful port. Its almost like Ubisoft didnt even bother trying to optimize it. Running an i5 4670, HD7970, and 12Gb of RAM and on medium/low settings I get 30fps, and even lower than that inside buildings for some reason. And then theres the constant crashes, buggy pedestrians, and dumbasbricks AI. If youre really craving an AC game, go back to Black Flag. I couldnt honestly recommend Unity to anybody at this point.
