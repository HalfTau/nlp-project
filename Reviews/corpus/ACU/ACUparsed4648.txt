System requirements are way too high for a unoptimized, inefficient game that provides the same kind of gameplay and repeatable missions without the cost of the season pass involved on top.A GTX 660 is capable of playing this game with a 4th generation i5 cpu, and yet the massive stuttering that occurs every time the game wants to load everything from someplace causes it to freeze for a whole 10 seconds.While the emphasis is on large crowds, there really is no point of wasting away resources to render them graphically and have them animate when in urban areas and alleyways full of obstruction, AS you may not see them at all, so there lies the inefficiency.While others are talking about the massive amounts of bugs, there seems to be a lot of desyncronization bugs when the game stutters and freezes, its like you are playing a MMO and theres crap internet connection that causes you to warp all over the place once in a while, through walls and all.You still fall through the walls and such with parkour and such, but not through the floor anymore due to patch 2. Even partially touching and being stuck to the wall because your shoulders clipped into it can make the game unplayable until you restart the mission again.I personally have not experienced so many game breaking bugs, only massive frame rate losses in the odd moments of the game.
