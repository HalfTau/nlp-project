To start with, im a big fan of the AC serries. ive played all the games, and i loved them all.When i started this game the first time i was blown by the graphics, and the new moves when Arno was climbing buildings because it looked so very realistic.But after i actualy started playing the game and meet all of these bugs, and its many other missings, so to say, i found it very hard to like.Here are the things that is making me not liking this game.I hate the crontrols. Pretty much most of the time, it feels like Arno the main character is living his own life and making his own choices in what to climb, and when to block and that is VERY frustrating. Because, if u have to chase a guy in the game, and arno feels like jumping up on every single obstacle he sees, instead of just evading them, U WONT CATCH THAT DUDE. Or if u must hide from the guards and be stealthy, its just super annoying when Arno doesnt want to get behind cover.And believe me, i love the AC series, but this one?, is one is not nearly finnished. A lot of times when i click the buttons that in need  IN THAT EXCACT MOMENT, such as blocking in a fight, then most of the times these buttons wont work. Well, yes they will work but only when it dont matter no more.So that results in a lot of failures. But not because the diccifulty is too hard, but because the reaction time in the game is too fcking slow...I must say that even though i really wanted to like this game and kept on playing it, just because i wanted that well it aint that bad anyways feeling, i still havent gotten that feeling yet. And i dont think i will either.I have not completed the game, because i didnt at all find it worth my time because i just got kept on being mad.Well, in the end this is just my opinion. But i wouldnt recommend it after all.
