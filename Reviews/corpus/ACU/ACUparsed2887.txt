this game is super fun, when it works, i use a beast of a computer, but it still crashes every 2 hours or so. however since the patches i think most of the other bugs are gone. if it wasnt for the crashes i would find this game a huge step forward for the assassins creed series. however even with the crashes, i still recommend this game.
