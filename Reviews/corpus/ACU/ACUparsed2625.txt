If this is how it plays when its been patched 5 times, then I cant even imagine the playablity on release. Its terrible. I have a new  R9 390x. I get 15FPS in crowds and maybe mid 20s on roofs. I know its not a precious NVIDIA but come on. I should be able to run at mid graphics and clear at least 45. This is a spit to the face for PC gamers. Do not buy this game. Unplayable.
