Since its release, Assassins Creed Unity has received a large amount of hate. However, I dont think its a bad game.The weakest part of the game is the story, which focuses too much on the relationship between the main character, Arno, and his lover, lise. Other than that Its a great game that will give you at least 15 hours of fun, if not more, and thats just the main game. The DLC, Dead Kings, is free to download and continues Arnos story after the events of the main game.At launch, the game was riddled with bugs and performed poorly even on expensive hardware. Now, it is all patched up and should run smoothly as long as you have a fairly modern GPU. For the smoothest experience, NVIDIA GameWorks settings should be turned off.As far as the graphics go, this game looks beautiful. The city of Paris has been recreated with detail in mind and there are many little things going on on the screen that make the city feel very lively.If you are an Assassins Creed fan, this game is a musthave.
