NOT A GAMEPLAY REVIEW As I cant even make it that farOne of the most horribly optimizted game I have ever played this year Even worse then Dead Rising 3s release. I cannot even get past sequence 3 of the game as the combat is so unbearable in its state. Would not recommend it even if it was free at the current state it is in. Let alone 60. I have never felt this ripped off by a game in a long time. First WatchDogs now this garbage release. I have now compeletly lost faith in Ubisoft. Will not be getting anywhere close to Far Cry 4 if this is the quality of work I can expect from Ubisoft from now on! Get your st together Ubisoft. If they do update and I can play and finish the game I may change my review to positive.
