I dont know why everybody hates this game so much. It is a great game. My laptop newst macbook pro, bootcamp into windows runs this game at a decent framerate on lowish settingI did overcloack my GPU. To be fair there are some control issues for example entering and exiting windows but the depth of customazation, side missions, skills and the environment is great. Missions are much more open ended now allowing for great approaches with all different play styles.
