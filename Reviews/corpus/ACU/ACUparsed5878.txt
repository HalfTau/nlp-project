Horrible. Cant even get through a mission without a crippling bug of somesort popping up. I exceed the specs for this game and still it is not even playable on low settings. Hopefully they fix this very soon. I was really looking forward to this game too. I cant recommend this game till they fix the bugs, so if your looking at buying it, wait for a few weeks, hopefully they will have the kinks worked out by then.
