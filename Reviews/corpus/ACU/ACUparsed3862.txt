Recommended ONLY IF you can run it. This game is actually pretty good, but its bogged down with bugs and technical issues. Gameplay wise, its superb if it does works... Story wise, it loses to AC2 of course and AC4 Black Flag. The French Revolution is barely mentioned in the main storyline, and its really just follows thisKill X  apparently X is related to Y  Kill Y  turns out Y is holding some sort of secret that mentions Z  Kill ZUnity feels most like AC1, which is what theyre aiming for I guess. A pity I didnt really like AC1 the series boomed from AC2 IMO. Still, its a solid game and Paris is just downright gorgeous.
