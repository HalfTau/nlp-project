This game sucks!!! They took away some great things they had in previous versions like stone throwing, whistling from cover, heybail kills and more.  Enemies, when they discover you dont investigate. Keep getting stuck ie behind the door at Notre Dame.  The game is riddled with bugs and the story seems disjoint and confusing. Controls are horrific and dont get me started on the stupid interface! What a waste of money this thing is. I dont understand how a company can put out such a piece of crap and not be liable in any way. I want my money back.
