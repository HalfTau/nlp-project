So far so good. Everything works great on my PC. Its beautiful, parkhor has been improved, I love the new combat system and custimization options. I havent had one bug or hardware issue yet. Be nice if there was an eaiser way to filter who you got in CoOp like I only want people who speak English and have a microphone.Multiplayer though I miss that. So sad they didnt include it in the game.
