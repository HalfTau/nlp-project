I usually dont write a review but this one deserves it. I was happily playing the game on sunday, closed it, opened today just to find out my save game is gone. Tried every possible way to recover it and ubisoft basically gives the player the finger on this matter.I already despise being forced to open multiple clients to play a game  steam  uplay  then play the game but hey, what the hell .. You suck it up and do it. But when they cant do a proper job and keep your saved files like they should, in a cloud service which the whole point is to keep it safe?So yeah, this was my last attempt of giving ubisoft a chance after previous fiascos but now they are on the same bucket as EA for me. Not gonna bother to pay for overpriced games when their service/support dont justify it.
