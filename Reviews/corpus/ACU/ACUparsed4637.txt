Im going to be honest with you, when this game first came out, it was a nightmare to play. The game is very stuttery, has massive frame rate drops, random glitches, and other random crap. This game is so unoptimized, it blows WatchDogs out of the water. They have released driver updates and patches, which have helped to some extent. Still though, the graphics are some of the best I have ever seen.Dont listen to the system requirements though. Its t honestly. I play the game on an old i52300, 8GB of RAM, and a GTX 760 and I run the game at very high graphics settings the game has options of Low, Medium, High, Very High, Ultra! The fps is usually around 30 to 40, with some dips into the 20s. Honestly, I can still play that fine.If you push all the hardware related problems to the side, this game is absolutely AMAZING. The characters, the location, the missions, the story, its all great. Easily blows AC3 and AC4 right out of the water. Running along the rooftops just gives me a flashback of running along the Venice rooftops in Assassins Creed II, the best game in the series. I was hyped for this game and in terms of the amount of stuff you can do, coupled with the story and gameplay, its definitely one of the best in the series. Full stop. If Ubisoft took another 6 or maybe even 3 months to optimize this game, it would be one of the best games Ive played in recent years.TLDR If you can get past the performance problems, this game is absolutely incredible and super fun. Maybe wait a few months for the game to get some more polish and I couldnt recommend this enough already. 8/10 for me.10/10 will play again.
