Id recommend this game, but only when its on sale. Playing it was fun, but it wasnt worth the money that I paid for it. Paris is beyond stunning, and I really enjoyed walking around Paris. The missions where you had to assassinate someone and you could pick your own approach were quite enjoyable.However, the storyline was very bland and the characters werent very interesting to me. Ubisoft boasted about having Napoleon Bonaparte in this game, but you only speak with him a couple of times and the missions that accompany this just arent special in any way. I also expected a lot more of the relationship between Arno and Elise, and the overall ending really bothered me. I mean, I spend all of these hours, and what I got in reward was the one of the most obvious and simplistic endings the Assassins Creed franchise has ever seen.Besides not really feeling the characters, another thing that really bothered me and made the game less immersive was the AI. The guards in Paris are the dumbest AI of the entire franchise. Whenever they are after you, just climb on a rooftop, stay out of their sight and stand still. Just one second after youve done this theyll stand still and wonder where youve gone. Come on Ubisoft, even Assassins Creed yes, the first game could find you on a rooftop!
