Regardless of my opinion on the game itself Its my favorite AC, Assassins Creed Unity is a technical masterpiece. It uses some of the most advanced graphical features youll ever see in a modern videogame. They way this game does textures and surfaces is just mindblowing, metallic surfaces look real, and most, if not all, use real time reflections. It was just way ahead of its time, and it still is. It looks better than every single Ubisoft title since it came out, and its depiction of 18th Century France is the most detailed and graphically advanced open world Ive ever seen in a game. Its just a criminally underrated game that was just too ambitious for its own sake. I highly recommend it.PS Played it for 80 hours on my PS4, looks amazing on PC and it runs at a locked 60fps on a 6700k/GTX970.
