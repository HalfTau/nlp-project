I would recommend jumpiing off a cliff first, more of a rush, and no laggyness whatsoever.ACU has some serious optimization issues. I have the 8350 OCed to 6GHz, and it still used 100of the cpu on low graphics. My dual 7770s match the minimum requirement, and with the OC out perform a 290, but lacks VRAM. The game should run on low, but I cant play the first chase mission, because by the time it is loaded, the enemy is too far away and mission fails right after load in. One of two things needs to happen, either give us a refund, or optimize this game to reasonable standards.
