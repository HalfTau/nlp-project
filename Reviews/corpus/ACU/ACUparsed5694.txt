My rig is i7 3630, 16 GB ram, GTX660 with 2GB ram. I realize that my video card falls on the bottom end of the specs, but to not even be able to play the game at all on the lowest graphic setteings is extremely dissapointing.I realize its my bad for not reading the game specs before I plopped down the coin for the game, so this is just a warning to anyone thinking of buying ACU... Dont bother unless your rig is top of the line, especially in regards to your graphics card.
