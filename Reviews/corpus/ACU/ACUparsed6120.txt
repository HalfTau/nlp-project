I74790kNVidia GTX 9708 2 x 4 GB 1866 RAMIm getting 5060 FPS on 1080 / 3040 FPS on 1440 max settings w/ FXAA in borderless window mode. Cutscenes lag a bit but textures look great. No crashes after several hours of gaming. Vintage UbiSoft postlaunch optimization will improve gameplay a bit  whenever that happens.As for the game, its fun. A lot of the gameplay from the last game is carried over, which I consider a good thing. Maps are beautiful and welldetailed, and the storyline is deep and intriguing. UbiSoft seems to be going a bit overboard with their microtransactions, but, from what I can tell, none of them seem necessary or provide a glaring advantage, so I think its harmless.If youre a fan do the AC series, then you kinda have to play it. However, keep in mind that this is a highly graphicintensive game and, as of launch, a poorly optimized one, so if youve got a rig with less than the recommended specs, either be prepared to sacrifice detail for FPS or wait for a postlaunch patch and driver updates.
