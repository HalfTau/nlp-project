assassins creed unity is a is a perfect example when a mother er from management is in charge. I am quite certain that no technical person in his right mind will release this beta as a triple A release. The game might be good I am not certain with the bugs with are so many to start counting.... and not to manchon the game crashes. I got it for 40 euros. it is far too much to ask for a early access game with assassins creed unity is. This must be a wake up call for ubisoft. It is necessary for somebody to lose his or hers job for green lighting this game. the game was out for 2 months and still is in beta. One thing to say to the person who gave the permission to release this beta. I hope that you get fired from your job you suck ... go be a manager in mcdonalds but that wont work ider you know why ...... because you are too ignorant and stupid for that job also. You clearly dont deserve to do anything with gaming at all, you do not understand it... just go and be awful somewhere else... go wash dishes or something. you do not possess the skills to be in charge of a big project, you see the small benefits of a pre christmas release date. no skills whatsoever to see the long term benefits for the project and or the company.
