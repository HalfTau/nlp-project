I have a computer running an overclocked AMD FX 8350, 2 Radeon R9 290xs yes I have the beta driver for this game 16GB of RAM and a RAID 0 SSD array. This game, on medium settings, with no Antialaising enabled, runs at 50 FPS. Let me say that again, a 3,000 1 year old gaming PC cant push this game to 60  FPS on medium settings with no anti alaising. The game looks okay. Its pretty. It is not pretty enough to justify the performance issues, especially not on medium.Ubisoft, I own every AC game you have released. I own Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon. I own Splinter Cell Blacklist. I have given you a lot of my money and this is the first time I have ever wanted it back. You DELAYED this game even. How bad did it run when it was originally supposed to be released? Do you have any intention of fixing this? Youre lucky steam doesnt issue refunds because I have a feeling youd have to return a lot of money if they did.For those reading this review hoping to game insight on gameplay or story, I cant give them to you. I made it 15 minutes in before getting so frustrated I had to stop. This is the worst experience Ive ever had playing a video game, and I tried to play Crysis on an ultrabook once.
