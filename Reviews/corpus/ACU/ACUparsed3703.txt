I would love to write a review about an exiting game expirience but over the last 8 times i have attempted to download and play the game it has crashed both the game and my system. I have owned the game sinse the release and I have never gotten past the first loading screen. The game just doesnt work. I am using one of the latest ASUS computors and the game still doesnt run. Dont buy this game. It is a waste of 60, and a major dissapointment. AC 3 was better than this piece of garbage.
