Ok so being a Long time assassins creed fan I do feel somewhat dissapointed by the game. Im no saying its bad, Ived played a bit and i like it so far but you NEED to have the recomended video cards. You can try and play with lower card but you will end up sadly playing on low end graphics with some frame rate drops here and there. But i was well aware this would of happen so honestly i cant complain a lot about it. I guess i have to wait for some perfermance updates and im willing to wait. Story wise its desent, Im not to many hours in the game just 1 c but Im already atracted by it and still wanna play more! To be honest its just a matter of patience for this game, If you have the specs you will be amazed by it of not you will still be amazed by it. The game does have some of the best graphics ived seen so far so people have to cut some slack if you dont have proper video cards. Overall i love the game and i cant wait to get more into the story and start playing coop.
