I, like most others, have been getting incredibly awful FPS drops. On medium quality, i get 50 fps. Im running an i7 4770k, 16bg ram and an EVGA GTX 780. Horrible frame drops at cut scenes sometimes even down to 2 or 3 frames. Cant get anything above 30fps on any setting above medium. I also get random lines on the boarders of objects like paintings on the wall, etc... I dropped 80 on this to get the season pass and the game. This is EXTREMELY disappointing. Its sad the Ubisoft messed this launch up because Ive loved the entire franchise since the beginning. Im not really too upset becaus eIm pretty confident they will fix it, but I am still very disappointed.
