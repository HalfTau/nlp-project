In the final state of the game i can say its playable there are some bugs but they dont distract you usually for npcs.FPS is good other than that its fun new parkour system is good, fighting mechanic could be hard at the start of the gamebut it get easier while you upgrade Arnomain character.For me it is my favourite AC game.
