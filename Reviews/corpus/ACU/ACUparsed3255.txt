Have I really paid 110 for this crap? The game was not even worth 10 at release, and we did not even get content for the season pass, it would probably have been crap anyway, just some crappy DLCs not even worth 0.99I can guarantee that it was the last time I would make such a mistake, no more preordering, no more full price games nor season pass.Heres the positiveGreat soundtrack, but not my favorite one from the Assassins Creed series.Thats it.Now the negativeThe worse gameplay in the whole series.Glitchy character, theyre moving but without the walking/running/anything animations.You can use the eagle vision while running but it is limited, both changes are pretty dumb.No daggers, your stealth blade can barely be used, I mean, you cant fight with it nor you can fight using your fists.You cant dodge bullets outside of combat.Gameplay feels weird and clunky very consolized.Some scenes looks a lot like some in Far Cry, how original, but to be excepted from Ubisoft.Very badly unoptimized.Crappy microtransactions to feed Ubisoft incompetence and greediness.Lot of gameplay mechanics removed from the previous games such as being able to steal anyone, petting animals, not being able to use our stealth blade at any time, etc...30 fps locked menusAnd now facts aside, characters arent that great, but thats just my opinion, even though it is true that they are not as great as the characters from the previous games, they lack... something...Seriously, this game is more of a downgrade than anything else, stay away at all cost.2/10  Honestly, what the hell is this crap?
