Ok this game may have its unoptimizations but common guys, we should know this with day 1 games, remember black flag when it first came out? well anyway story wize its good but not Great... especially when you have the french revolution going on but it goes on to this love story/ murder mystery sort of plot I guess they got someone new writing the story personaly but it quickly makes up for it in its gameplay It very much reminded me of assassins creed 2 like gameplay and one thing I hate what ubisoft does in every assassins creed is CHANGE THE CONTROL SCHEME.... WHY!!!! but anyway id recommend this game after first patch and its optimizations in the geforce experiance are realeased.
