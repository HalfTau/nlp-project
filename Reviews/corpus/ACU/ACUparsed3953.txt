Gameplay is ok. But the story line is complete When A character dies Ubsoft expects you to be sad. Well heres the thing you hardly know these characters so they want you to feel sad when you couldnt give two  about em. DO NOT waste your money on this game like i did. Also if you are asking this for Christmas please do not waste your familys money. The game is not worth one pennie of your money. The gameplay is the same other than climbing buildings faster. Fighting is the same moves we have seen through out the series. Please do not waste your money or your familys money for christmas on thisgame.
