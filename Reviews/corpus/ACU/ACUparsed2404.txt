Assassins Creed has really let me down recently. AC3 was a big letdown in most of its promises. The best part was a few sneak scenes and the ship side quest. The ship helped ACBF make a brief comeback, butthen they released this initially bugged and always lackluster game. I thought the main story line was mostly boring or led you into big fights which is the exact opposite of what i want from an assassins creed game. Initially I was unable to connect with my cousin to play. We tried to join a guild or whatever it was called together, but it glitched out and showed that i was in the guild twice. I tried breaking apart and remaking it, but it didnt fix it. Never could play with my own cousin. finally gave up on it, I hardly ever dont beat games I start, but I probably finished about half the content of this game and dont care to finish
