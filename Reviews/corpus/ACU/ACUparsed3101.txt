Of all things Ubisoft can do, they attempted to improve their graphics. Not a bad thing, only that you have to have a really powerful computer to run it. Im currently on a Lenovo Y4080 laptop with huge specs and I can barely run this game on low graphics. I love Assassins Creed and all, but it would be nice to actually enjoy the game without pixels and bad quality.
