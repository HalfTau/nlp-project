Okay, there are way too many negative reviews, and I know for a fact, this game isnt bad.The game has only crashed on me once so far, and as far as performance issue, I occasionally dip under 60 FPS, but only occasionally, and there was one moment when it hung up, freeze for about 2040 seconds, but in unfroze itself. Im running the game on High settings, and my computer can handle Ultra, but the FPS tanks too low to tolerate for me, but I pretty much dont tolerate if it cant stay above 50 FPS.As far as microtransactions and bugs, there are occasional MINOR bugs, but they arent too distracting and are not game breaking. The ones Ive noticed so far are NPCs standing in weird places on a table, etc. which is quickly selfrectified, Arno having trouble with the navigation a bit which is also quickly rectified by simply altering movement direction slightly, and enemies who are dead start squirming on ground as if still alive its slight though so its not THAT big of a deal.As far as people complaining about navigation, it is NOT buggy or bad. Its actually quite fun. There is still some challenge for climbing some areas, and in my opinion a MAJOR improvement. It IS meant for gamepads though, and will take some time getting used to, and even then, sometimes itll not do what you want it to do, but thats been present in nearly every AC game so far to a certain degree.Keep in mind, that I played this game with a beefier setup than probably most using 8 GB of RAM, a NVidia GeForce GTX 660 Ti w/ 3 GB of vRAM, a dual quadcore i7 processor at 3.4 gHz, and used a gamepad and not a keyboard. You need more than just the right video card to run this game, you need RAM, and a processor that can handle it.
