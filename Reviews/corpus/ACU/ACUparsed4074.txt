Do not buy this game!!!!1!! !, it has been patched 4 times and is still unplayable. Cutscence and audio are not synked. It has major stability issues and crashes often as well as many bad graphical buggs and the options for the port dont give you the option to try to customize the graphic to something playable. Add to that the fact that the story is really really bad with a main character that makes Connor look cool, the controlls are really hard to handle and sluggish. I have bought and played all the old Assassins Creed game, but this was my last.1/10
