First of all, allow me to state my laptop yes I am playing this game on a laptop specs. It has a Intel i7 4900MQ processor, 32GB of DDR 3 RAM, 2 TB of Hard Disc and a NVIDIA 780M GTX graphics card. So looking at the specs, my laptop DOES NOT meet the minimum requirement. Reason being, a 780M GTX is nearly equivalent to a 660 Ti and the minimum graphics requirement is a 680GTX.However, to my pleasant surprise, the game ran smoothly with a few hiccups here and there. Nothing game breaking. The gameplay as well as the graphical aspect of this game is stunning, to say the least. Granted, this is my first venture into the Assassin Creed franchise but in the near future, I plan to play other games within this franchise as well.Lastly, I would like to add that I simply do not understand what the fuss is about UPlay. That to me, is just a very minor inconvenience, that is all.
