Intresting storyline. kept me busy for 20 hours, after that its a nice open world but not really intresting to explore. Grafic wise is very nice, there are some drops but not many. The glitches, i encouterd a couple but not gamebreaking, and compared to lauch its much better.The multiplayer works easy but not that many people use it, but you can play through when searching for a online game which is nice.
