The graphics is amazing, and storyline is pretty cool, with a lot of historical  appropriate events and references in the gameplay, and I would love to enjoy the beauty of this game, had it not been......so EXTREMELY laggy!Using my Samsung Gamer 7 laptop from 2012 with its nVidia GTX 675M GPU, it is in fact below the minimum requirement to run the game in that respect with game requirement of an nVidia 680M at minimum. I did expect to have to downscale the graphics a little to make gameplay a little smoother, as I did on Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. But this is just too silly, as my laptop fulfills all other requirements in terms of performace, with an Intel i7 3610QM CPU, 16 GB RAM, as well as 1TB SSD. Even downscaling everything to minimum/off it was still lagging, as if it only had 10 fps. The other game had far superior performance and smoother gameplay.
