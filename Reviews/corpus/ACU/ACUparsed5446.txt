This game goes back to similar AC2. I love playing this, yes the pirate thing is gone it seems I myself dont care. I never played AC to be a pirate i play it to be an Assassin.  We all complain about the graphical issues. I give this a thumbs up I love AC but i will agree play it at a friends house before buying it. The game doesnt feel fluent in combat or cinematics. The frames per second really is an issue in Unity. They seem to have been patching out issues though, but the game i believe will never feel fluent when in combat. Awesome improvements in free running really but it feels like they wanted to make a pretty game and not a game for gamers. Remains awesome, but it might just be the love of Assassins creed in me trying to ignore the graphical issues and the slow feeling whenever you get into combat. Maybe when you progress you become faster who know haha!!! this is just an early review. Have fun guys and girls so far its been a blast.
