The games combat and story are great. Im taking a liking to the new Helix story they are trying. Yeah theres optimization issues, running in game with a few hiccups on medium. The main menu lags along with any other ingame menu and the cinematics lag. But that will be fixed. overall, glad to be back in AC!
