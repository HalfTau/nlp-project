This game has caused me so much fustration, I cant believe it. Frame skips/drops. Mouth sync is off at times. Fell through the map several times in CoOp Missions. Targeting your enemy is like a myth now seeing as how he goes after anyone around him beside your main target. Missions are incredibly hard and dont really push in the stealth feature seeing as how every situation intends you kill everyone that apporaches your way. Its a poor excuse for a game that should be incredibly beautiful and fun as a Assassin roaming the beautiful French Revoultion Era. But no, Instead we earn a game that is completely absurd and a waste of my money. Sad thing is, Advanced Warfare turned out better than this.
