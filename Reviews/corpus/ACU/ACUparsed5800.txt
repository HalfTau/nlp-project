There seems to have been alot of hate, saying the game wont run on highend PCs or people with decent PCs are still having trouble. I have a GeForce 780M, Intel Core i74700MQ 2.4ghz, and 16 gigs of memory. Its about twothree years old, and I have had no bugs, no stuttering, ad no slowdown in graphics. Some of you might want to right click my computer, go to advanced systems settings, go to the advance tab and then modify the performance options to use any extra HD space as virtual RAM. That being said, looking at the game, it probably will not run on a lower end computer.  Save yourself the money on the upgrade, but if you can run any of the nextgen games like Ryse Son of Rome, The Evil Within, or Aliens Isolation you can probably safely run Unity.
