Performance ReviewDont be eager to jump right into this game. The moment you start playing the game you will notice all sorts of bugs. Examples of the ones Ive ran into have been sticking to rooftops, getting stuck in mid air, npcs not opening crucial doors like in escaping the bastille. Even turning down the graphics doesnt seem to help with some visual bugs. One of the visual bugs that I have seen is in cut scenes, where the npcs hair literally thrashes violently around the air as theyre trying to have a conversation. Ubisoft clearly needs to address these issues.
