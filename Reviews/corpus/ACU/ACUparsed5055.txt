I rate this as a yes for the sole reason that as a game, it is magnificent. I adore the assassins creed series and seem to be the minority is believing that while inivation is nice, allow me to purchase the old.The game as a game in my opion is great. The new stealth mecanic is fun to play with, the combat is much harder in my opinion but that might be due to the fact that because my computers frame rate with this game is so slow that you can miss being attacked from behind entirly.The Frames per second is awful but I have the deffinition of an outdated gameing computer. The fact that I can make it load makes me proud of the old girl with only a amd hd 6670 video card. In time I hope Ubisoft patchs some better opimization but It might not even help me. Now that being said, I can run anything preivous up to snuff without any frame rate disasters like Unity. The frame rate if your computers like mine can be large problem if in a kind of spoilers but not realy cutscene button mashing portion when fighting an indiviual is near imposible due to the frame rate and lag.Some advise for lower end computer owners. Do not purchase this game for another 6 months to a year. wait for the price to drop and the patchs to come in befor a purchase.ending vote.9/10 for game play and good story Arno isnt as bland as Connor or as greedy as the pirate. Kind of ezio like, in france... with an english accent... who was raised in france... whatever5/10 for playablity. I want to keep playing but I have to take breaks because of how frustrating the game speed can be.even though paris on minimum quality still looks incredable, I wish I could see it at 30 fps and not 10 to 20I appligise for the unperfesional and randomness of the reveiw if you can call it thatRate for 11/14/14  7/10 really fun if one has a super computer or is patient
