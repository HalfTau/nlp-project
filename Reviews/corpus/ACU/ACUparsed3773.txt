The biggest decision you have to make is  How much do I want to be entertained by the game ? For me  this is really the bottom line.I bought Far Cry 4 and Assissins Creed Unity at the same time  both run well on my system  and I started playing both when I bought them. I have completed FC4 twice  and I struggle with AC Unity  simply for entertainment value. I like to smile and laugh at the dialog  be dazzled by the graphics  and enjoy the challenges of gameplay.FC4 is FAR more suited for MY preferences. Its a lot more open  and filled with interactive surprises. The addition of the buzzer helicopter was priceless.I should mention that I was a history major in college  and appreciate the lessons of the French Revolution  but this is hardly entertaining from a gamers perspective. I dont remember ever laughing or smiling while playing AC Unity  and running for 10 minutes through a park trying to tackle some dude just doesnt do it.
