bought it for 165.5 hours in and im lovin itwith my gtx970 im getting 4050 fps on VERY HIGH graphic settingsin my opinion this game is the best in the franchise EVEN BETTER THAN SYNDICATETHE MULTIPLAYER IS COOLive only done 2 missions so far but i didnt even have to wait more than 3 seconds to find the players to start the missionsthe combat is now challenging and rewarding SO STEALTH MATTERS GREATLYyou can fully customize your character Arno, including different weapons, types of weapons, and equipmentPARIS LOOKS AMAZINGonly bad thing is ive seen a few minor graphic bugs such as unintended occasional light flashingconclusioni believe this game represents what the franchise has been aspiring to be likethis game just feels right, it clicked for meif your computer meets the recommended specs, and you are considering buying this game, you should, but only on sale why would anyone pay full priceits well worth itFINALLYMost the negative reviews are from when the game first came out, which Im sure was a disaster back then, but things have changed. THE GAME WORKS!! !There are also lots of people complaining about low fps issues, but I assure you it is because theyre computers are just not good enough to handle this game which is why you shouldnt buy it unless you have AT LEAST the minimum, but I recommend the recommended obviously.AC UNITY DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
