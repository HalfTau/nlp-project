 Be sure to check the system requirements of the game before buying it. This game requires a strong PC.Ok, so this is my first review ever...Well, I saved up money for a really long time, so I can buy a computer, just for this game.i5 4590, GTX 970 and 12 RAM, if you were wondering...So... lets get to it.First of all, Many people have problems with the game because they dont have the required specs, which means that they could have some FPS drops and crashes. If your PC really cant run this game, it could stop responding right after you open it. So. Dont buy this game if your PC cant run it. As simple as that.Another point  Some GPUs are Broken in this game, and this might cause some graphical glitches   Like when sometimes in cutscenes, some characters have no faces.Yeah... So... You should check if your GPU has this bug fixed.Now, on my PC, the game runs on about 60 FPS on HIGH settings., so you if you have a PC that is similiar to mine, you should run the great.Now for my opinionI think this game is amazing. There are some bugs here and there, but these are too minor to actually ruin your fun.The game has awesome graphics, great gameplay, and the story is very nice.So... If you want to have a great time, you really should get this game.Enjoy
