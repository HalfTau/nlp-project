I really want to love this game, Arno is amazing, but its really poor planning on Ubis part.Gameplay would get a 9, but I can only give a five for several reasons Coop. I hate coop modes, and if you want the skills, you need to do coop missions 3 different ingame currencies You cant whistle. You need to /buy/ cherry bombs to create distractions.Rouge was amazing, and its still fun to play, but this was a real step down. Ill keep with Syndicate and Rogue.
