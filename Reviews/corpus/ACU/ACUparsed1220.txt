It runs like crap on windows 10. I have an HP Envy which is more then qualified to run this game maybe too qualified I had to run it using Windows 8 compatibililty to get any sort of playabilty  out of it and it wasnt enough.UpdateI updated my graphic drivers and the program I used optimized this game settings and it seems to be working pretty good now.Its a harder challenge then any of the other AC games I have payed so far and Im liking it.
