This would be a very good game if uplay didnt coimpletly f multiplayer up.Dont buy this game cause a friend got it because u will not be able to play it with them.I barely got multiplayer to work a few times and i dont know why but the fps is pretty bad and since gta v is running 60fps idk what the problem is.
