Writing this review much later than the release date of the game, and im well aware that the reality of someone reading this is slim to none. But I couldnt pass up on the opportunity. Through all of the negative reviews and glitches of this game, I would still rather play this game than 90 of the others on steam.Im 30 hours in and barely into sequence 6. There is so much to do in paris that it is a never ending trail of fantastic entertainment. I couldnt imagine a better way to play through the french revolution. The charm of AC has always been its work into the detail in architecture and historical accuracy to an extent of course, I know Shay Cormac didnt actually murder George Washingtons older brother.So if I can help convince one person to play this game instead of listening to the glitch ers, I did a good thing. The story and detail of this game make up for any glitch that comes up through the entire game. Happy hunting initiates.
