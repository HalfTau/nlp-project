Perfectly fine in my system. A good example for SLI that give benefit scaling 160 more better than scaling on Syndicate. Run solid on 60 fps max setting, Only found few drop fps especially in some cutscene but it didnt disturb my gameplay. Maybe i got the latest version after 1 year been released so i dont get very bad performa issue.The environment..the city view....so beautifull in ultra high, soft shadow and FXAA. It would be more beautifull if i use MSAA but thats will sacrifice alot of  framerate 10/10The reflect from NPCs is realistic. They will scream and run when hear a gun battle while in the street or market...waow thats cool, man. 8/10I played a lot of AC series but when i run in rooftop, climbing and parkour, AC Unity give me better experience than another series.At this time , i play 2 AC Creed Unity and Syndicatenot in steam. After spend 3 hours with Unity, i can feel how boring AC syndicate with repetitive side mission by the same formula.Only mp mission that make me to wait so long to find another player join my game, maybe because this is not new release game.This is The Assassin what i am looking for. Too epic to be skipped.
