Listen, I really should say this in my review before I start offThis game NEEDS compatibility patches for the graphics.I have a one year old PC Alien ware with all the reccomend specs, some even above reccomended, and I still lag on low.However, the lag on low graphics is minimal for me so I can still play.Therefore, I will be basing this review off of gameplay, instead of the obvious graphic issues it has.The game itself is wonderful. With me playing 11 hours of it, and planning to continue it even more, if you can ignore the lag, the gameplay itself is really good.The parkour is sticky like it always is in Assassins Creed, but has some cool new animation.The combat is REALLY redone, in the sense that youre not an invincible god. I find myself running out of medicine quite easily, especially when you are fighting 56 people with the ones shooting you in the back. This encourages harder combat, but also for you to use stealth rather than running in and be a killing machine like you were in all the previous assassins creed games.Overall, this game is good, and would be a great assassins creed game if they could only fix the graphics issues.
