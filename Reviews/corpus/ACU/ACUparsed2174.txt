you might encounter some intial problems like the game crashing and occasional gliches .but mark my words  if you are a stealth junkie like i am , this game will make you gamegasm like youve never before .the stealth and player environment interface combined with the exceptional parkour and butifully thought out story make it a must buy .ofcourse, to truely enjoy the game youll have to spend more time doing side quests and collecting miscelinious objects like chests and cockades . each red chest is for all practical pourposes a puzzle . you can either tackle it as an assassin or a brute . ubisoft lets you decide .the new coop and heist missions along with the club competions are a welcome distraction from everyday assassinary . play with friends as and when you like . a slow internet connection however might hamper your online experience .all in all the game requires you to be sneaky and evasive rather than brusque and brutal . if any of you need any help figuring out stealth , you can get in touch with me on uplay . my id is SilentDeathBLDE
