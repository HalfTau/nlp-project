7/10 the game is still buggy but is overall playable for me at least. Im running a gtx760 with a fx 6300 4ghz  which is under specs and with patch 4 installed the game runs much better after I installed NVIDIA BETA DRIVERS which is what made a 10 FPS on the settings I managed to run which was high settings. I averaged 35fps large crowds 4050 on roofs 60 looking down over city. CONS with game still ocational freezes ending in stuck in geometry sometimes  thats it the game however is not optimized for sli yet so keep that in mind. The game used to be crap but now it can be enjoyed if you look past the the 1 con
