i had only 3 assassin missions soo farevery time i want to assassinate someone i feel sad and miss the old creed gamesthe double kill in the game is broken and the enemies need to be dead close to one another to count is a double assassinationthe open houses was a great add on but incomplete, you get stuck in windows and the movement is not easyammo on enemies is ones in every 100 loots and its only 1 bullet or knife forcing you to go to shops every few runsits one big map that everything feel the same unlike other creed games that you had different map and city typesthe combat here is boringhigh gear is one hit killlow gear an annoying fight of perry and rollthey removed the easy kill and that in one way is nice and another you stuck in that boring combat systemafter you kill the main target you dont get a speech between yourself and the target but somehow you suck in part of their memoriesalways clues,feels like xmen in the past
