Im so ing disappointed with this game. It has the WORST and I mean THE WORST ending and endboss fight EVER. The plot is boring and sometimes without much connection and you can see it coming from lightyears away. Just dont buy it. You will like it first, but then it will give you big fat slap in the face for being hyped. And the best part is 60 of the content are side missions. Ive needed less than 20 hours for the ALL the main missions.  THIS GAME AND UBISOFT
