Dispite the initial issues with the game preformance, this game is one of the best assassins creed games yet. I have bearly done the first 3 missions and I already have almost 5 hours into the game just buy doing side quests. The coop i also amazingly fun, with short wait times, an interesting story, and even assassin clans that you can customize. This game is amazing, but I would recommned getting it for the xbox one or ps4 unless you have an amazing gaming computer. Further optimization patches might change this though.Give it a go.
