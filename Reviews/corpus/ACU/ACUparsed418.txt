Game is good, especially if youve got friends to play with since you can have a lot of fun playing together. Usually random people in public missions go rambo what i personally dont like. I try my best to do as stealthy as i can, but they ruin it  Of course i always could solo every mission id like to, but doing solo missions isnt fun. Also if someone is willing to play in public missions, then expect someone to run around missions place like chicken when everyone has to gather in one place. Without bugs at release and griefers game is good to buy, but not for full price. Id suggest to wait for sale.
