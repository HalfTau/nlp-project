I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAMEProbably not even buy it on sale.ConsBoring characters and stoy.Most of the games chests are locked behind Uplay, Initiates and the not working Companion app.The game is full of bugs.The multiplayer is a joke.All of the best gear is locked behind Club competitions which doesnt even exist in the game. This means you cant access the best geareven thoug it is displayed in the menu since they decided to lock it behind something that you probably have to pay for anyway.All the side activities doesnt contribute to the game at all since they only give you money, which you after about halv the game have enough of since you cant spend it on anything.An insane price for the crappy content it offers.Microtransactions.Oh and since the latest patch the game freezes in the start menu everytime whic means that I cant play it. Would recommend 100000000000/10.ProsPretty graphics.
