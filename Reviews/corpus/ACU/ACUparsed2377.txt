So many reviews complaining about performance alone, I feel it needs a good review.Character wise, I did not like Arno, he just didnt have the effect of previous characters like Edward, Ezio or even Connor, and yes... I did like Connor, but thats because his actions felt genuine, here you essentially play an unlikable prettyboy with alot of money. Essentially Colonial Justin Bieber.Story wise, I loved the locations, the freedom, the flow of events and watching Paris change as the revolution unfolds, it truely let my love of historical events run wild, Napoleons appearance was the cherry ontop of the cake to all this for me.Now with graphics, I was fine, whilst it was clear the game was unoptomised, my system was able to run it on the AMD Raedon 290X 4GB card, 8 i7 CPUs and a 16 GB RAM, these spects were able to run it on high/ultra between 4550 FPSAnother this I loved, was combat, I hope the changes brought around in ACU will continue in later games of the series will follow its combat style. Combat in ACU was finally a challenge, no longer were you an invulnerable walker tank, in ACU a couple of guards with some smart shooting are able to take you down in moments, if not they will easily try to outnumber you. Guards are finally more agressive, and never hold back on a chance to attack and instead unleash their full rage upon you, many times have I fallen to the city guards finishing moves and accurate shots.The game does offer a system of buying ingame money with real money however this is not necessary if you remember to upgrade your cafe, much like the Auditore mansion of AC2.
