this game is a joke compared to the other parts ..... there are some good things like the graphic social club side quests the modifications that u can do on your char skills weapons outfits .... but the bugs and the fighting movement system is just...in my opinion ....not good at allur char doesnt just climb up and down by himself like in all the other parts of AC... u have to click and extra button now ... why? !the yellow bar thing when u are in combat... its not a bad thing but when enemys can hit/see u through walls cover ... jumping towards you from like 5 meters away  they are not on your screen when the yellow bar appears wich means u cant hit  in the right moment and plz dont tell me use the camera its just not working at all  ...  then its useless..maybe its just me not beeing good enough for this  but ....i loved AC until this part .... iam not sure if i wanna know how syndicate isPS sorry for my bad english i tried my best
