Unlike most people I actually enjoyed this game. The story was interesting to me and the gameplay is quite fun. I did encouter a few glitches here and then but honestly they werent as bad as the ones that Ive encountered in AC Syndicate Jack The Ripper DLC.I LOVE the multiplayer missions, I think they can be really fun, depending with whom you play. I also REALLY LOVED that DLC of Dead Kings. It was so good and I really wish the story was longer.Was it worth the 40? No,not really. You better off buying the game with a sale.
