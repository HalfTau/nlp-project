Amazing story  at the the time of French revolution..things I like1. Open world and and partially linear.2. Lovely romantic scenes from Paris at 19th century.3. The set is amazing at the time of French revoluion and how the life in Paris was portrayed at French Monarchy before, during and after the revoltion.Things I dislike1 The graphics in general not bad but lack of details with blurry backgrounds  and camera movements are limited in some angles the texture details not that details as well even if you use very high settings with 4k its still not the smooth. As the game was released in 2015 I found it poorly crafeted when you compare it with other games of that year especially witcher 3 or ROTTR. However, the background the sun shades looks very real..but the blurry vision makes it like a film from 1980s. So if you are screenshots amateur then dont expect too fantastic screenshots!2 It has some few glitches still you can evade it by reloading from last checkpoint.in General  I give it a rate of 8/10 and strongly recommend it .
