assasin creed unity is a general failure of ubisoft on a almost complete level almost everything going from all the previous entries that was bad was brought back to this one no crossbow fron ezio saga or any tricks bombs or any intelligent choices and to many numerous flaws that are throught this entry.everyday guards will wreck you at the start and somewhat give you a un for you money later the ending, probly the worst i have seen in assasins creed game.past that every assasin you meet is a complete moron and every templar only has 10 more brain cells than them so they are generaly just ahead of them.SPOILERSArno is a complete moron who loses himself in hunting down and killing everyone involved in his not girlfriends dads killer and she looses herself in that even though arno loves her completly she knows it and loves him back but doesnt have the intelligence to see that if she goes donw the revenge path she will die.the assasin brotherhood are complete morons for letting arno in and kicking him out arno didnt give afor the assasins at the begining and arno only at the very end decides revenge and only revenge was maybe a bad idea....?!?!?!?!?When arno gets kicked out of the assasins finger quotes they dont strip him of his gear and take everything they just kick him out ?!?!?!??! there is so much wrong with this game.I dont know how ubisoft did so wrong with this game Asassins creed 3 was painful due to the completly new combat system aka dumbing it down, black flag at least went somewhat back to the 2 sagas of combat systems where skill and timing were king.
