AC Unity  What a load of Story is cliched and contrived complete tripeWhat happened to the combat? The camera doesnt pan out when its supposed to so you end up getting attacked off screen. When you need to refill health, an insultingly large HUD appears impeding my vision right before I take a sword through the throat. NOT what I wanted.The free running is just painful as Arno seems to have some kind of neural aneurysm when I ask him to perform a basic task. When I want to perform a ledge assassination I want Arno to pull the target from ledge to his death. What I DONT want is Arno to dive through someones open f o k i n  window and then jump out onto the street below! Since when did assassins have the motor skills of a brain damaged childBuggyGame runs like pishTerrible popinArno is just some rich mook in a hood
