Reason why Im not recommending this game is not because of bugs, or frame rate, or poor optimization in general. Im giving it a bad review because of Uplay. I was at 40 completed overall game, beaten story line, had Legendary sets and all the skills I wanted too have. And then, my progress gets set back to 0 because of Uplays cloud save and screwing up my sync. I love the game, I love the idea and the concept even with all the bugs. But I just cannot recommend getting this game especially if you spend more money in game because there is a chance you will lose everything youve worked for on a crash. I cant even bring myself too play the game anymore because of this. I dont feel like starting over and Ubisoft is taking FOREVER getting back to me on what they are willing too do if anything at all.
