Great game! First sequence in Versailles and part of second in Paris was stuttery to say the least. Then came the Rebirth  youll see , it crashed half way through, rebooted the game, finished Rebirth and boom, no more stutter. Cranked it up from low to ultra gfx and still pretty damn smooth.  3570k, gtx 690  only 2 gb effective vram , 16 gb ram 1600mhz, win 8.1, ssd  highly recommended with all the loading and saving. For the gameplay and content, so far loving it. AC Revelation was the reason I bought Unity  from all the negative reviews yesterday  probably many because most ppl hadnt unlocked the Rebirth yet  ROFL  I probably wouldnt have. Its a great deal more complex, biulding characters, developing skills, nice and difficult AI... And a Homogous Paris world to explore to boot.This weekend is gonna be nice and nerdy xd ENJOY Ps.
