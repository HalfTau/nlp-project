Good game, with a solid story. This entry in the series is perfect for those who didnt like the boat warfare in AC3 and AC4. I would say that the lack of optimisation for the PC platform does let it down a bit, and so, I wouldnt have been too happy if I paid full price for it, but I got it on sale at 30, so its not too bad. The coop is really fun, and is just as awesome as we all imagined it would be. Furthermore, the clothing customization is brilliant, as you are able to completely customise the look of your assassin.Definitely a solid game.
