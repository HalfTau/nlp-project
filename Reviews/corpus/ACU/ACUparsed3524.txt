Ok, so after finally getting to play this game after the white menu problems, I found out this game is atrocius. Every inch of this game disgusts me. Lets start off with what Assassins Creed was famous for. The extremely long view distance and how the graphics looked perfect from all distances. In this game once you step away about 200 feet from a building and the graphics turns to counterstrike 1.6 graphics. WTF!?! 2nd the lighting is terrible, when you run through a crowd of people it looks like their clothes change, but they dont. 3rd The minigames and basically the whole game sucks, all rushed programming, and nothing in the game is flawless everything has many things wrong. 4th The engine in general that Unity uses is terrible, never reads anything correctly, constantly messing with your gameplay. Finally, I did not finish the game but so far I hate the story line, maybe theres some  twist at the end idk.BTW I run this game and every new game on max graphics, this game hasgraphics. On any lower settings Im sure this game would look just like CS 1.6. Disgusting. They pushed this engine so hard that they had to lower all the graphics, and the engine still has tons of problems. Then they brag about how much npcs they can have on the screen at a time...
