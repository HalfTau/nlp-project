I can review this game with pure numbers. Here is a list of my play times with the last three AC games.ACIII 90 hoursACIV Black Flag 110 hoursACUnity 50 hoursSo its been entertaining for half as long. So I judge it about half as good as the last two.Good stuff Oh sure, its pretty at street level and inside buildings. Sometimes very much so. And the combat which many hate for me is interestingly varied and the swordfighting feels appropriately hard, especially when youre surrounded.Mediocre stuff The plot isnt great. The voice acting is sub par for a series which has usually been great this is a big miss. And the collection stuff feels  for the first time, IMO  very much like a chore.Bad stuff The parkour  one of the keys of the franchise  doesnt feel anywhere near as breathtaking and dangerous as it once did. Maybe this is because were used to it. But maybe its also the awkward way that every roof in Paris seems to stop your movement those long flowing runs are mostly gone. Gaining viewpoints used to be an absolute highlight for me in previous versions. But every swoopy synchronization in this iteration is just a sea of bluegrey roofing tiles. Yawntastic.Conclusion Skip it. Youre not missing anything important in the overarching plot. Wait for the next one, and hope its good.
