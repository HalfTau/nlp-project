I dont even get 15FPS on it, after its been realeased for who knows how long.My pc isnt a peice ofand I paid full price for this garbage Ubishit considers a Game I ended up PIRATING ACRogue so I had SOMETHING to play considering I gave Ubisoft 70 for a game that I cant even play. That thankfully atleast ran on my computer at a blazing 120 fps. Ubisoft has lost a me as a loyal consumer.Unless this company does something decent for the PC fan base Like give me back my 70 I wasted on something I cant even play I will no longer be making purchases from this developer.Also ACRogue  Boring as  dont waste your time, the PC port is actually good, but playing the game feels like a side mission from black flag. the missions are boring and dont give nearly as much excitement as black flag did, it seems as if they took black flag, addedinto the recipe, then released it for 60.GG Ubisoft, way to be  ups.I feel sorry for your talented game developers who actually want to put in more time into these games but unfortunately to the CEOS, its just a money grab.
