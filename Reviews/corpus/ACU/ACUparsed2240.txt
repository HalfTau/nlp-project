The game in itself is quite fun, but the countless glitches justyou off to no end, you get shot, cant move and have to stand there and wait untill the enemies come over to kill you, you get stuck on climbing a wall then have to ctrlaltdelete to get out of the game, its just too much bugs and little things like that that ruins the entire experience.
