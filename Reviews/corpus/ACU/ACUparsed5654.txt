Broken game aside from the massive number of bugs from being dropped out of the world at random or  getting stuck in a closet because an NPC numped you inside. The game is riddle with microtransaction ranging up to 99.00 USD just to unlock SINGLEPLAYER items. This game also requires the stupid unity App on your phone if you want the full experiance. In all I am happier with Watch Dogs because it doesnt run at 15 FPS and Watch Dogs isnt riddled with microtransactions.
