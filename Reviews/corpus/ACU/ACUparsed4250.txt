Ive always loved the assassins creed franchise so heres a word from someone who has played all the other games. The graphics are fantastic and so far the story is great. the visuals are nice after i updated my graphics card driver especially on ultra. This game has huge lag spikes and i am on a highend computer and it should work fine as i can run arma 3 on ultra.. bioshock infinite etc etc.. The lag spikes and missing faces and hands totally ruined the experience for me. This would be a easy thumbs up if ubisoft would get their crap together and fix the bugs.
