I payed 60 for a game that works like a piece of crap. This game has some major buges that need fixing such as, not being able to move, incredible lag,falling throught the floors to get out of the map. This is probable the worst Assassins Creed game iv played by far. i love this series and i hope that opinion wont change but right now it seems as if it will.
