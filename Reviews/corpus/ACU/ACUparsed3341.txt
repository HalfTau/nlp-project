I would normally love difficulty, but when the game is difficult because the Assassin youre playing as is completelyat being an Assassin, its not very fun. No double hidden blades, parrys are no longer followed by a riposte, just a series of random slashes, thus defeating the purpose of parrying altogether. Human shields? Nope, gotta roll from side to side and hope that bullet doesnt getcha. Fantastic how we have to buy skills now too, gotta love that. Bought double assassination and doesnt appear as though you can perform that in the air. Chaining kills? Dont think about it they removed that too. Climbing is much faster though. so thats a good feature right? It would be if wall eject worked, says press a to wall eject but alas, nothing happens. This game had so much more potential if it wasnt rushed. There are tons of small glitches but nothing overly terrible. The only thing this game really has going for it is the co op. I suppose playing Assassins Creed with a friend is worth 69. Nothing else in the game is worth paying for.
