Although there were still some minor technical hickups, ACU has been patched to an acceptable working condition. Sadly, theres nothing a patch can do to fix a bland story. Half the time you wont know what you were doing, and when the story reaches its conclusion, theres really nothing more there than a pat in the back. There are some weird things too like the ability to read the targets memory after you assassinate them? When was that introduced? If you like the series, ACU does pretty much what you would expect. It wont blow your mind, though.
