Really loved this game.Graphics are very awesome and visually stunning.The animation of characters are just one of the best Ive ever seen.Didnt have any lag issues version 1.05Its the first AC game where the economy is quite decent. Throughout the whole playthrough I always had the need to have as much money as possible in order to buy armor or weapons.The main story is more about the main characters than about the AC universe and I did enjoy it.Finally all the locations are inside the city and you dont have to wander around in woods or other wild locations. Like in AC III or Black Flag.This game is the closest AC game feelingwise to AC II, so it was like a fresh air for me, because I really liked Ezio as the main guy.The only thing I disliked is that the game leaves you with that empty feeling all the time, because something is missing. And I cant understand whats missing. It just feels like it.Overall, I had a blast playing it from start to finish. And all the completionists will have another 2030 hours of gameplay, because there are lots of side activities in this game. LOTS.
