This game is totally fked.textures wont load 50 ft down the street.  the pop in is so noticable that for me it makes this game unplayable. if youre stading in the street and you pan the camera round you will see textures loading in on npcs that are 20ft away.as suppose to looking at amazing city scapes, which the previous a/c pulled off fine, distant buildings look like youre in a poor n64 game.im actually shocked. very dissapointing . going for a refund
