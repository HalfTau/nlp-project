Horrible experience. I am a french revolution history buff and was SO looking forward to this game. Very disappointing. It seems like these guys have one team of awesome game makers and then another team of people whose job it is to make the awesome games a pain to get running. Why do I get errors about point of entry? Why does my game shitdown and talk about UPlay was unable to connect please quit. Why does my effort to even open the game get stalled by so much uplay bullcrap?  I didnt buy uplay. You didnt advertise uplay to me. You got me excited about Unity, not uplay and yet you throw a thousand uplay related roadblocks and annoyances at me.  So you know wat? Screw you and your games. YOu need to fire the idiots who spend their time finding ways to create these problems. Just let me play the dang game that I spent so much money on you jerks.
