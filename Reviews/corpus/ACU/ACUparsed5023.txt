you know what i spent the whole god damb year waiting for this game i pre order because i trusted ubisoft but obiusly now i have come to see that that was a very bad idea. first of all the broke the game engin and it doesnt for most gamers about  1 out of 10 people who bought this game i bet actually got to play. ubisoft still releases the game on pc yet its not even a working game and then they charge alot for it to. this game was alot of money and ubisoft took that money and and basicaly didnt even give us anything back. i am dissapointed ubisoft i really am.
