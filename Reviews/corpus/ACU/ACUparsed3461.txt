This is a good game, shrouded in a million layers of blah.Performance issues, bugs, microtransactions, youve heard it all, But the thing that really gets to me is how INFURIATING the controls are for PC. Clearly designed with only consoles in mind, it unalterably binds half a dozen very different actions to a single key, and the contexts for what does what when are too vague to ever be certain what each keystroak will do. Simly moving around is awkward and imprecise. Throw in the frame rate drops, and Arno behaves like a marionette in a windstorm.Every time youre forced to think about the mechanics of a game is a failure, and the only times I stop thinking about the mechanics of this game are during cutscenes.It wouldnt be so bad if i didnt want to like this game so much.
