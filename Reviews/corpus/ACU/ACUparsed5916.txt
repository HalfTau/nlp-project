Has a lot of bugs as of release that will have to be fixed to actually play the game correctly. The slow fps and graphics lags are only a bit annoying but the crashes happen at the most random spots making the game basically unplayable. I get half way through a story mission and it crashes, I go randomly run through the steeet it crashes. Im sure there will be a serious patch coming very soon since it seems everyone, regardless of computer specs, is having problems.Other than that the gameplay overhaul of free running makes moving around on rooftops without crashes very fun and a bit of a newer feel since you have to hold down a or b to move up or down. A lot harder to get him to jump in a direction that is up or down in the complete wrong direction. Camera moves a bit too much in tight spaces, however and you end up jumping in the wrong direction but at least you dont have to climb back up because he randomly decided to jump down off of a building. Will still have to see how the fighting system improves with gameplay and stat changes, in the beginning its very slow because you can only attack 3 times.So overall I would like to play more but the developers should have waited a few more months, tested A LOT more, and hashed out the bugs with the graphics and memory. Maybe after the new year would be a good time to get the game since HOPEFULLY they will have hashed out at least the crash bug. I recommend the game as an assassins creed fan but not a computer gamer FIX BUGS.Running a MSi GT70 dominator  laptop so i7, 16gb ddr3, and 870GTX gpu.
