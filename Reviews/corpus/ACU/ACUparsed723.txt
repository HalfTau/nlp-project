I read the reviews and saw they were mixed. I also remember hearing the grumbles of people about the glitches and bugs. Honestly, I am 30 hours into the game and its a damn fun and good assassins creed game. The maps are huge. The controls are spot on like assassins creed game typically is and locations like paris are really neat. I dont get the some of the hate/dislike for this game. I keep mumbling to myself this is a damn fine game and totally worthwile in the series.
