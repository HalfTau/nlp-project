As the creators of Unity promised, a game where you feel like you are playing a movie. Althought its first release wasnt the greatest, its subsequent patches were worth the wait. Now the game is awesome, the characters fresh and upgradable, and the storyline feeling a nice new niche. Play as a new assassin, enjoy the old playability of the game with a fresh new twist that Im not going to tell you about, and run in a more open world than before. No loading screens for buildings, now  you can run through some of them in the open world. However there are loading screens with great cinegraphics, I wouldnt say cinemotography yet but close before the missions.
