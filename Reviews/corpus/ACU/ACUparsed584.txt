After just finishing Assassins Creed Unity, I can come up with this final statement This story was not grasping AT ALL!Considering how every single Assassins Creed has been able to keep my interest, this one just felt completely... Lifeless.The characters Arno and Whatever that redheads name is were not THE GREATEST, but it was still OKAY.The fighting mechanics are amazing, and every time you get the final blow on an enemy its SO satisfying.The parkour is just a tad bit clunky, but when you jump through a window it feels pretty darn cool.The story was just... SO dragged out, they couldve summed up the story in 5 sequences instead of 12!! !And my personal favoriteSometimes the Real World will pop in for a bit to tell you to get out of dodge on the game remember you are in a animus or dream state. The people helping you make you have to stop what your doing and go through portals to go to another world. Sure the cinematics are cool inbetween, but It is super obnoxious.Im still recommending it however because of the price drop from 40 to 30 dollars, and Its an Assassins Creed game for Christs sake. But just know, if your looking for a more enjoyable and laid back gameplay pick Assassins Creed Syndicate, or any other one before then. Just not this one.Hoped this helped. Thinfv
