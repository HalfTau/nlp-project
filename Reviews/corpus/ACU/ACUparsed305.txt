Ive played AC I,II, Brother hood, and black flag. But I still dont get why this game is still getting so much hate tbh, game runs quite well now , graphics are impressive still to this day, side quests are alot of funi enjoy murder mystery, stealth is well done, customization is good, and the world is quite large and so many buildings you can actually go into unlike gta 5 for example where nearly every building in that game has no interior. reccomdend to ac fans, especially on saleUpdate1. biggest annoyance for me is collecting all the artifacts in the helix just to get Altairs outfit, probably the most regretable time ive ever wasted playing a game in my entire life.
