Its a scam. It may work or it may not. Dont buy thisif you dont want to feel robbed on your money. Steam wont help you to get it working but they will make you work for hours to just end up with the same result, an unfinished product that does not work on all computers. I have a high end PC which is filling all the recommended requirements and even more. And yet I get the same message as most did when they launched the sale of this crappy game ACU.exe cant launchDo I recommend you to take a chanse? No! Do I recommend you to use Steam for your pruchases? No! Why? Because they do not help you.
