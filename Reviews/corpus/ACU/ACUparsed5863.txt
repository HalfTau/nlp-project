So, I was beyond excited for this game. I was dying for it. Then, i recieved this.Graphics are ok, i suppose. The textures are beyond glitchy, and forget the hair. All the ponytails were everywhere across the screen. I cant get beyond a certain cutscene, as it crashes the game and my laptop. My laptop is an alienware, and it can handle games worse than this. The cutscene is a simple guy throwing a table at who i assume to be Arno. The scene before that the people also teleport out, which i doubt should happen.In the beginning of the game there is a battle, i couldnt hear the dialogue due to sound issues with the game, nor could i follow what was going on. The mouse sensitivity was extremely bad, I only thought about touching my mouse and i was spinning around the character. I dont even know who i was playing, as i havent even gotten to the protagonist. I managed to somehow not die against an assassin, and i managed to kill him which i was happy with. The amount of cutscenes though destroyed my game, i had no idea what was happening.I had a terrible issue with running and parkour, as i got disoriented. I was stuck on a single perch for a good minute, as the game refused to let me dive off and try and see if i could survive the landing. I couldnt run in a straight line, even after i went into controls to turn mouse sensitivity to as low as possible. I also had an issue getting away from a guard, due to my running speed being halved as the lag made me need to pause to reorient myself.All in all, Im sure if they fix these issues then the game will be great. I really want to play more, sadly i cant. I havent reached story yet, but French Revolution sounds like the best thing ever.
