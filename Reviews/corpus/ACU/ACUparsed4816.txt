Wish they had spent less time making trailers and more time making the game. The bugs are game breaking.However despite all the plethera of issues I find that I am still having a lot of fun and it has been all I think about when at work/school.The story is lame but the coop has been fun btw.........Twenty hours later and I still love it. The crashes have been awful and I was going to give it a negative review however I read Ubisofts apology and how they will give out Dead Kings free to everyone. Apology accepted. Positive review stands. Cant wait for patch 3.........I have switched my reccomdation to a not recommended because the game, while fun, is just not what is was hyped to be. 60 hours of gameplay and I find myself disappointed. It doesnt really feel like you are a part of the revolution. The assassins feel like templars. Organized and high and mighty, helping out the rich and the royal. Patches didnt fix much for me.Verdict wait until the price drops.
