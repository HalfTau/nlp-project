I wrote a long review but i just erased it.Patch 1.5 made the game VERY playable and it is a great game to enjoy.Graphix are fantastic, Main character is likeable. Voice acting is good. Gameplay is mostly good. Game does not hold your hand as much anymore, so no reminders when you are about to die or if you need to buy more bullets.I found small hiccups but they are very forgivable, like during free running it wouldnt let me jump down to kill myself until i tried to do it a few more times... Then surprisingly MC landed on a chair 50 feet down... still alive.People, please do not preorder games or buy them on day one. I know this is very tempting to do but i have yet to see a gamer not get a game because he bought it a day after it was released.P.S. Just ignore ingame purchases, they are feeding of impatient players and if you buy it, you can blame only yourself.
