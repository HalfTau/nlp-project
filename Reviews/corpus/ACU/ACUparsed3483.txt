I like to think I have a pretty high end PC, I can play just about anything on extremely high graphics and still recieve good performance. As many of you have probably heard, Ubisoft basically went straight to the console players on this one, screwing any chance of optimization or getting more than 20 or 30 fps. Please dont make the mistake I did by buying this on sale, its not worth 10 dollars in its current condition, and I was on board the hype train from the start. Ubisoft, if your reading this, how about focusing on one game at a time, and building it for PC then porting over to console so you have a half decent game that isnt full of crap.TLDRUbisoft did a number on my fan loyalty by making this thing so crappy. I wont be supporting them very much from now on, or at least till the game is playable.
