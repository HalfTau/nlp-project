Played the first 2 sequences, went to load the save and whatever section its loading from crashes the game every time. I played this game to completion on ps4 and honestly, all I want to know is which of the  keyboard jockeys at Ubisoft decided that this game, with this garbage engine, needed that many thousands of NPCs which add nothing to the experience.
