This isnt going to be a long review sorry. I know we all want a good Assassins Creed game.Unity is not it. I want it to be good, but i dont think it is. Its fair or mediocre at best. Even if dont look at the constant texture popins and weird character animations  nonstory NPCs mostly you cant get over the fact that the gameplay systems are pretty dated. Especially noticable during mission. This aint no good stealth game. MGS5 is, for instanceBut for the most part there is a lack of overall inspiration that i think was there in AC2 and to some fair amount in Black Flag too. The parcour system has some potential but doesnt feel truly innovative or even standard to modern games.Characters story related that is are good designed though, like..really good. They also look good during animated cutscenes which makes for believable conversations.There are also a ton of locked items that have to be unlocked by apps/webpages Initiate Program which is basically a slap in the face of a customer who just forked out 60 bucks.My recommendation Dont buy, or if you are really curious wait for a sale and i would say no more then 10 bucks.Please dont get me wrong i want a good AC as much as everyone, but this game is really just not fun...
