I bought this game expecting some sort of horrible buggy, glitchy mess due to all the reviews I have been reading, at first i didnt want it, but since I am a very hardcore AC fan I thought i could run through it.This game is actually not bad at all, and its getting alot of discredit even though uncle UBI is giving it updates to fix it, I have experience absolutely no bug so far, the only thing that is of note, is that during cinematics the game is laggy, and your hair flies everywhere for some reason at times, but aside from the laggy cinematics, this game is beyond all the other AC games by far, it is so beautiful and so engaging that I just HAD to quit to desktop, and write a review to give this game some damn credit for once.9/10
