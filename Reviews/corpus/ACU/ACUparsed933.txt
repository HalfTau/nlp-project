This game launched with terrible buggery up thethat literally made it unplayable.The game has currently been patched to a level where only a few and sometimes annoying bugs remain, and in its current, playable state, I have to admit, its literally a 50/50.If you play AC games for the parkour, the combat, the pretty world, the level design, then this game is for you.The combat is definitely a tiddly bit better than the rest of the games with enemies attacking more aggressively, and they even have flashy twoperson finisher moves for when you get teamed up on.The freerunning system with up/down buttons might turn you off at first, but you get used to it. Its smooth, its fast, and its flashy. Not once did Arno get stuck, run up a wall, or make a jump I didnt want him to.Paris is a ing big and dense city, with nice rooftop construction that makes scurrying around a blast.The outfit customization gives me a woody. I dont like statbased costumes, but the ability to customize yourself to THAT level makes it feel like youre really investing in Arno.If you play AC games for the story, however...The story is a laughable revenge plot that gets convoluted and straightup lazy at worst, mediocre at best. Love interest feels forced, and Arno isnt even twodimensional, hes one. Always felt like a slog of going from one mission to the next.Dont get me wrong, there were a FEW missions that were ing fun as bro.The voice acting is SO BAD. AC games have always had correctlyaccented characters. I dont know why the entirety of Paris, France, is voiced by Englishmen/women.Pisspot.TLDRIf you like being an assassin, its fun. If you like being an assassino, its bad.
