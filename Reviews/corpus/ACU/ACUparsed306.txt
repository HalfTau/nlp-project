Not recommend!I played the Revelations then I skipped to Syndicate. When I finished Syndicate I thought well lets try Unity.Just dont.Aside that its not a smooth game, as in you dont run/climb/enter windows as smoothly as in other AC games, there are a lot of other annoyences too. You can hide for example, but there is no way to whistle to the guards. You have these cherry bombs, but they dont work.The controls are clunky, and there are still people floating about and others things that suddenly disappear etc.Other than that, the game itself is too short.
