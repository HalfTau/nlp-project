Literal I wouldnt go as far as to say its worse than any other assasins creed game though. They are all pretty damned horrible. And they all have the same game breaking crap. I absolutely love getting stuck on a stool or someor not being able to unstick myself from cover without literally charging headfirst at the opposite wall crashing into it, passing out, and allerting every guard nearby in a mission that REQUIRES absolute stealth...nevermind when you WANT to play a stealthy assasin. Of course you can just run around gunz or swords blazing and no one will ing see you anyway. All you have to do is turn a corner or ring around any object taller than your crotch and stab a guard in the back. Rinse and repeat untill all guards dead. Only AC fanboys yuck...I dont even consider them human are going to like this game because it is The. Exact. Same. Nothing has changed. Including a god awful story with really weird graphical glitches in the cutscenes. I dont know how it is for other settings but on Ultra the hair is literally alive and independent of the character and will have seisures...quite randomly...freaks me the  out. Oh and people pop in and out of existance or walk in place creepily They did manage to add more pains in thehowever. It seems the free running is even worse. You cant carry a rifle and a melee weapon at the same time...so instead I used my shiny new rifle as a club...thus clearly preserving the integrity of my equipment oh mighty assasin master. Honestly...the first one was good because prior to it, no one roleplayed in a game as a badass assasin in a free world...and the whole this is a memory not real life! was kinda unique and fun. Everything afterwards was The Matrix Reloaded. A  sequel that some wanted, that most smart people thought was going to suck, that didnt do anything BUTthe bed entirely...
