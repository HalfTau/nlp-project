I wish that I could give a mixed review button on this but since I cant, Ill have to say No to Assassins Creed Unity, the negative really outweigh the positives in this game. First major problem was the crashes every few hours whether they happened during startup or during the game.Other issues would be down to Arno deciding to grab onto a wall or decides to get stuck on a chair and refuses to get down at all this was especially annoying when trying to actually escape from a horde of police or guards from chasing me.The next issue I have was the many many collectables in this games 294 chests and 128 cockades far too many collectables that when your forced to play a lockpicking minigame made the chest hunt so much more of a slow grind that made the game unnecessary long. The collectables take me back to the first Assassins Creed which was more of a collectable grind as well. I can forgive the annoying random crowd events, but the collectable stuff was just a absolute punishment.One of the good points was the pretty motion capture and the story wasnt that bad, though I would of liked more of the present day story to actually be in the game, yes I am one of the few who actually enjoyed the present story and the Desmond storyline.So my final point is you could probably miss this game or if you want to really need to play it dont pay the 40.00 euro and just wait for it to go on sale instead, this game isnt really worth the asking price especially with the bad bugs and constant crashes, Since the majoraty of the game time was collecting these items when the main story was at least twelve hours.
