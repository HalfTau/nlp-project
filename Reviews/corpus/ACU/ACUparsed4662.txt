Ok look, Ive never had any troble running steam games on my windows 8 but then i got this game......I just....Basically i cant even run the game, it runs so unbelevably slow that its unplayable, and yes ive tried many times to speed the fps by turing down the graphics and what not but it hardly helped, so i never really got to play the game. Im really disapointed this happed not just cuz i lost 60 bucks because i was looking farward to playing this game,but from what i heard the game inst so good anyway. Before u buy this game make sure you know this stuff so u dont lose ur money.
