While at first, the game had its technical problems at launch. Patches and improvement in PC hardware have made this game playable once again.To me, this Assassins Creed is very underrated.Coop is a blast, and theres a lot of neat things you can do can do in the singleplayer aside from the story.It may not be the best one ever made, but I certainly enjoy it, and recommend it. Worth the 30 bucks.
