Its a system hog, had a bunch of technical failures at launch and requires uplay... But its a great representation of the French revolution, I think the setting was well explored and even though involved in wild conspiracy theories the historical figures are quite recognizable from our historical recreations of the time.The fight between authoritarism and libertarianism continues with the Templars vs Assassins and the out of game plot is selfcontained and it doesnt really interefere much with Arnos story. I felt the game was more punishing in combat this time around but ultimately still an easy system, coop is great though.Overall I recommend this game even though it was reportedly marred by technical hiccups all around I had no major problems with it at release, admitedly with a relatively high end machine.
