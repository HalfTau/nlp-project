This game is OK i play with 2 other friends and we have alot of fun but there is at 1 point in the game like 1 hour in the game gets really bugged out. i know its only a teaser game for syndicate but i still think ubisoft should come back to the game and fix on it since the game is really good indeed but the bugs get to much so i will say a 5/10 IGN its ok
