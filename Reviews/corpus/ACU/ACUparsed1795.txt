Most of the reviews, even in the positive ones, call this game a bugged mess. And I can almost second that. The game isnt as badly optimized as most say it is. I have an i3 4160 and a GTX 750ti. That are the lowerest mid level tier hardware you can get, or highest low level depending on how you look at it. I run this at High settings, and have never dropped below 30 FPS. Badly optimized? No. Mostly Optimized? For the most part. This game is a blast with friends, and exploring Paris is stunning. Just mind the occasional glitch or so.
