FXXK IT CRASHES ACCIDENTLY AND THEN I LOST ALL MY SAVES!!!!!!!!!!! !0/10 FXXK UBI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !EditAnd now i finished it and im very disappointed,the worst one in the seriesi never played AC1 so that one excludedBeautiful landscapeAwesome musicCoop questsDetection questsI really didnt hear even once the assassins creednothing is true,everything isthat should be the theme of the entire series?Instead heard more than 10times of templars.Too short single campaign,i think you could even make it in 4hours if regardless of minor quests.This is unacceptable,the story is the soul of AC series however this game makes it nothing,and when i finished i knowoh this is only a revenge,and not that intense.Worst control experience of all series.At first i like it because seems i can easily climb higher than before,but soon i get crazy because it gets very hard to do what i want,cant even jump back from the wall to the opposite,so i have to climb to the rooftops or drop on thethis game house are almost have 3 floors,im too tired,really.Worst stealth experience of all series.I didnt make a single mission undetected,oh except the one in chapter 11 or 10that mission has a minor quest to do,there are always a bunch of fxxking snipers who are sensitive as you,and always 50 guards,watching everywhere inside and even outside of the area,yeah and ofc they are strong,so many guys die again and again when they start to play coop questsi got a 2star guy play a 3star mission,he was running,full health,and a sniper saysyou are mine,and bong!he died directly.At first i tried to use guise however this skills cd is too long and if you kill someone it becomes invaild,so i just buy a good weapon and jump into the trouble and kill everyone,that is more efficient and take less time.Due to the lack of the story,napoleon,other 2 master assassins in the brotherhood and many others have nothing to do with the game,all they do are only several speaks,the entire game is like thisi kill one guy and oh i know some of histhe memory another guy appears and then i kill him and then the next.Ridiculous puzzles,i cant even make a single one except coincidence,wanna me use eagle eye in entire paris?After the game i dont get any impressive feelings,maybe 30, far away from 60My opinion 2/10 or 3/10 or 4/10,idk,they are the same.This game even shouldnt be calledAssassins Creed
