This game is just barely worth playing if at all. Its still glitchy, and both the economy and skillpoint system are horribly offbalance. Im about to finish the last mission and I still have several skills left to unlock and many of the best accessories remain prohibitively expensive. Unlike other installations in the series you cannot whistle to attract enemies to your cover position. The throwing and berserk knives have been replaced by wrist shooters and you can never really carry enough blades, even with the wrist upgrades. Perhaps most annoyingly the map is cluttered with way too many minimissions and collectibles to the point where they had to add filters. This game is not nearly as fun as the ones that came immediately before and after it. It may even be the worst of the entire series.
