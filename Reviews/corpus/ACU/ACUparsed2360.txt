This game is seriously demanding. I have an overclocked GTX 970  1486 Mhz, VRAM almost 8Ghz and an overclocked FX 8350  4.6GHz and I get about 5060 fps on ultra with 2x MSAA. That being said, This is one of the best Assassins Creed games to date in my opinion. I really like the openworldness and had lots of fun playing the multiplayer missions with a friend. I also like that you can just run around paris with up to 4 of your mates. Yes it had some issues in the beginning but they are all resolved now.
