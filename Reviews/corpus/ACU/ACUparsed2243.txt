Outstanding graphics. One of the games that at least looks like nextgen gameOverhauled animations and parkourBig and beautifully designed Paris of XVIII centuryNew combat system,that makes the game a bit more challenging in a good wayAI is a bit smarter now, comparing to ACIV and RogueInteresting investigation missionsA lot of customization features. You can create your own unique assassinCoop modeStory is dull. Dont get me wrong. Cutscenes are well directed. Voice acting is good. But Arnos story is kinda boring. Arno himself is not so interesting as protagonist. And Ubisoft failed to use all potential of Revolutionary France settingXP system is uselessCreed points actually has no point. Devs rewarding players more for kills, not for stealth. They just force you to go loudNew stealth system is good but Ubisoft not even tried to make missions fit this new stealth system. There are just room full of guards and you cant do anything in a stealth wayControls are not comfortable. Arno is not responding to my commands correctly. He sticks to  the walls not climbing into windows etcSkills system is so bad. You need to unlock skills just to throw money on the ground or sit on the bench. Really?Economy system just forcing you to use microtransactions. In the 60 gameLanguage restrictions in CIS version. Just forced to play in russian. Good thing there is still french voice over
