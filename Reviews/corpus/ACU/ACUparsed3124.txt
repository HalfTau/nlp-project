A friend bought this for me before it was released and I have never been able to play it. At this point, Ive just lost interest in doing so, and consequently in ever buying a Ubisoft game again, especially before people have had a chance to play it. REAL people. Not reviewers in Ubis pocket. Despite the horrible Steam reviews, professional game critics still rate the game shockingly highly. Then again, maybe they have computers beastly enough to actually run this horrifically unoptimized piece of turd.
