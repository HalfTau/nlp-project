Horrible mechanicsThey took all the good stuff from previous gameslike the ability to hide bodies,Be able to whistle in a cover to attract enemiesTook many things away from the parkour to make it horribly badto the point where you would like to go through a window and you end up jumping above itIf you are running away from guards and someone hits you enter into this combat mode where is tedious andwont let you run away properlyYou cant multi select weapons per say you either carry ONE sword and ONE gun but no hidden blade as primaryWeapon or be able to select/change weapons during combat, in other assassins you could carry a heavya normal sword, the hidden blades etc... Even carry the enemy weapons, now you cant in this gameBuy thugs or s to distract the guardsYou dont have two hidden blades anymoreeagle vision has a stupid timer so you better be quickPrevious assassins you could buy buildings to get money more easily, the cafe thing is almost the same but itdoesnt give the feel of me winning money as the other asssassins. When you buy things in the other assassinsyou could get discounts from weapons, clothes, armor etc. this one is all about money and not that muchOther things that made the game horriblestupid huge updates that wont fix a thingHUGE Unnecessary amount of npcs that make the frames go lower than your ageyou can know is because of the npcs because there are part of the games where the city will be empty with nonpcs and runs silky smoothThe story is boring as hell, very generic and mehTHINGS POPPING OUT OF NOWHERE, like people, furnitures, poles you name itTHIS GAMES was RUSHEDTLDR THE GAME FEELS LIKE A BETA OF ACII OR SOMETHING, DONT BUY ITdont bother if you wanna play assassins go play blackflag of brotherhood
