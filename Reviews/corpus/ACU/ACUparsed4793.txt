So, I took a chance. I know the reviews were pretty terrible, but I thought, Im sure they didnt mess it up this bad. I was wrong. I cant believe they released this game. Its like the developers didnt even play it before putting it on the market. And if they did, then they have very low standards. The game is almost unplayable. It constantly crashes, deletes saved content, and the amount of bugs and gllitches are too many to count. You are the WORST ubisoft.EDIT Downloaded the 1.4 patch hoping it would be the saving grace for this game. Unfortunately, the patch breaks sli. There is major texture flicker. This means I can only play the game with one of my video cards. This is a shame. I was looking forward to playing this again.
