The game also after the new patches and new beta graphiccarddrivers on my highend machine isunstable, laggy and buggy!I feel like Im trying to run a Playstation2 Emulator on a 10 year old WinME computer with this game!So its unplayable and I dont want to continue BETATesting a game after his release again!
