In a short, clear, and straight to the point reviewIn order to get a full and enjoyable experience you needA good configuration? Of course! If you dont have a beast, tweak down shadows and other stuff to get some fluid results. With My GTX 760 I got a satisfying and mostly stable 3040 fps. Now with a nice gtx 970 the game is smooth as !Raging for optimization and no respect for pc gamers? Read point stated above, upgrade.Thought you could run it like the first AC? Again, upgrade, quickly.Actual configMSI GTX 970CPU i7 4770K8GB RAMWorks like a charm ing aside, youll NEED a full and stable download. If it craches, like constantly at the same point, you got that wrong. If it continues crashing, try to cool down your cpu, it might be too big for it to handle.Anyway, this game is NOT terrible, I enjoyed it and will enjoy it for a long time. 9/10 just for the launching fail, now that was a bummer
