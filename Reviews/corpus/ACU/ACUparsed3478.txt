It looked like garbage, and handled even worse, but I was still able to convince myself it was worth a look. By the beginning of the second sequence I hit a game breaking bug, searched for an answer, made numerous attempts, all of them failed.At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I belive it is self evident that this franchise is dieing. I can only hope that a lesson has been learnt, and that sales of future titles will suffer because of this, regardless of there quality. If this game wasnt on sale, I never would have bought it, now that I have personaly experienced it, you couldnt pay me to play this abomination.Wait for how ever many months it will be to fix thisfest, pick it up for 10, and repeat the proccess with all future titles. Ubisoft obviously doesnt deserve the support of the gaming community, and would quickly faulter without it. Stop preordering, stop blindly paying price, these studios will close, and will no longer have the resources to release trash.
