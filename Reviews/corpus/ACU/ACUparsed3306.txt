Just a quick review. I have 32GB of RAM, Quad Core i7 CPU and a 2GB Nvidia Video card. Graphics are choppy at best. I am constantly getting stuck in objects/walls/floors requiring me to fail missions. Multiplayer missions are near impossible to play since combat doesnt work half the time since the game is trying to sync with other players. All in all, a large world games with lots of missions to churn, but half way through the game I already had over 1,000,000 lin credits and almost all the best weapons.
