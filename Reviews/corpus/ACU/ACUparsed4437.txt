Very laggy. Many Glitches.The lag is the mouse. I will move the mouse and it will take a second to render it making it hard to choose options and even turn my character.The glitch is the game. In building and most missions the screen will turn a bright white and even if I turn the brightness down all the way it will still be impossible to see.Not worth the money. Youre better off buying Black Flag which I have, its very fun. If you want a fun game with the same parquor sorry for spelling buy another assassins creed game or Shadow of Mordor.
