Its actually a very fun game. The story is a little long and very cliche, but its a really great game. The people who say its bad probably just got it at launch and had to deal with all the bugs. It runs perfectly on my computer, which isnt the greatest computer. If its not working with a very high framerate for you, try playing it with your internet turned off. it doubles the framerate for me.
