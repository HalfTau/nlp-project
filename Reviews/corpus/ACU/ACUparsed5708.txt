Im not having FPS problems like the rest of the reviews.What can I say about the new assassins creed...Well to start, its an assassins creed game, climband stab people. ITS FUN...IF YOU CAN PLAY LONGER THAN THREE MINUTES WITHOUT THE GAME CRASHING!Most, if not all crashes are directly linked to Uplay. A service that no one wants, but is cramemd down our throats anyway.Disabling Uplays online running it in offline Fixes a large amount of crashing to the point to where i was able to play the game for 30 minutes or so before a crash.but you are limited to solo play i think and some features arent available.The game is Fun, but a crash fest.And as for those having framerate issues. maybe you should lower your graphix settings m8sor check for driver updates.My PC is a beast, but only to me.its specs are decentAnd im running the game with somewhere between 6085 fps even while recording.and everything is on all tarted up mode, meaning the game is running everything on its highyest graphical settingsYes teh cutscenes do lag a bitonly to look like slowmo lol , but its not Terrible and only happened on a few.Truth is, I do reccomend this game, but wait until after they fix the crashing.Its funFun is good
