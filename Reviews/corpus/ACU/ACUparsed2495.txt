Never in a AC game have I been so mad at my character, cursing and swearing at him as he plunges nothing though there was a place to walk on just there ... even running in the streets is a pain in theas he will climb up small objects like a lantern on the floor, and then branch off to a nearby wall ... and just when you were thinking never mind, keep cool, get back in the street and keep running the stupid controls make him go up and down and up again as I frantically spam E to go back to the floor.And thats not even mentioning windows which you can enter, I wont even get into that t lol.What I really dont get is how they can get something right for pretty much all their games, and then mess it up so badly in the latest one? Did they fire the team that was in charge of this and replace them with a bunch of noobs?PS oh and I hate how you shoot in Unity, Black Flag and Rogue had it right.Unity took quite a few step backwards in so many ways even though there are some nice step forwards, at the end of the day, if you close the game just because youre so damnoff, thats what counts isnt it?
