I am a hardcore Assassins Creed fan, and I will try to give anreview about the game.As I am writing this one down, I have already played for 23 hours, and finished the main missions. I must say that there is not much of a shock to what would I see. The game still has the typical Assassins Creed feel. If theres anything new that I liked, it would be theability. Now you dont have to find a haystack to get down safely.I also liked the the new skill categories. These gives an opportunity for one to specialize on a certain skill trait and use its advantages. Although I believe you would acquire all of it in the end if you finish the game 100.Now if you dont have a PC with the latest GPUs in the market and you preferover, I suggest that youbuy this game for PC. You better buy the one for consoles. Now the question is, why?Why? I believe that this game is not entirely poorly optimized. Its just that it requires highend specs to run it smoothly on the highest settings thus, the reason for the heavy system requirements. I have a decent gaming laptop msi ge60 2pe apache pro, but I play on 1280x720 resolution, on medium settings just to get a more stable gameplay. Also, a lot of people are complaining about the same problem.Now, why did I buy even preordered the game? Even though I am uncertain of how good/bad the game will be performance wise, I think the reason why I bought this game is because I am a longtime AC fan, and I would not like to miss this game. I do not care if my graphics are not superduper realistic, as long as I can play this game again after months of waiting.Well I guess thats about it.If you are a huge AC fan, and you dont care about graphics that much, buy it. Else, dont.
