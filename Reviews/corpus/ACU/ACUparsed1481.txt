Not the best installment in the franchise. I finally bought this game in the hopes all of the bugs and eprformance issues would have been fixed. They are for the most part. Its still a stupidly demanding game...WAY too many NPCs. The story is interesting at first but it soons gets pretty boring. I was kind of itnerested in the relationship between Arno and Elise, but even that was pretty dull. They also changed teh combat quite a bit from previosu games, and personally, I really didnt like it. Made everything harder.
