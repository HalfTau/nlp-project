Are your coders and programmers a group of mentally disabled chimps with no attention span and a limited supply of cocaine? Cause that 1.5Gb patch you lot just rolled out turned occasional framedrops into frequent freezes and crashes!Its okay though everybody I can now start a mission from the world map without it causing the game to crash! Thats whats important! Seriously every patch that is released the more problems I get. What the  Ubisoft! I didnt pay 75 to have 50GB of my SSD made completely useless. The game is ing unplayable now! Do the right thing and enable refunds and recall this broken piece ofuntil its fixed! Corporate money grubbing pigs.GTX 780Intel i54670k16GB RAMDO NOT BUY. GAME IS BROKEN AND KEEPS GETTING WORSE.
