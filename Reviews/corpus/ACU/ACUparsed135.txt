Well... the game has a lot of bugs, a very poor optimization and FPS falls every time. I like this game in PS4, and my PC has a Titan X and has 16 GB of RAM, and I dont know why I have that lag if I have a very good PC. The story is good, the gameplay is good, the customization is good, but the FPS falls and the poor optimization makes imposible enjoy. I want a refund, because I played this game on PS4,  and I player in PS4 like 30 hours, so I know all the bugs and mistakes that this game have. So Ubisoft, I want a refund, please
