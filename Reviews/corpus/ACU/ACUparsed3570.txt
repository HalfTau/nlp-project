Spent 20 minutes setting up Uplay before finally starting the game. Framerate was chugging, so I adjusted some graphical options and my characters hair started whipping back and forth as if possessed. Game then defied expectations by somehow becoming even slower. I waited four patches before playing and the first level doesnt even work right. Unplayable.
