I Urge you to avoid this game at ALL COSTS!! poor build quality, and having the majority of PC users running around looking for bug fixes and solutions JUST TO START THE GAME!! NO NO NO. This game and other Ubisoft Games which elect to force you to use uPlay which also is rubbish, are a symptom of big developers thinking they can charge full price for a game that clearly is not finished, and have it their way, ignoring the fact that Steam is a perfect software client. Id particularly discourage AMD users to STEER WELLL CLEAR! i have also seen Intel NVIDIA users have problems despite that being the apparent optimization. Im running a rig that easily runs into the 80th percentile high Performance on systemrequirements, and when tested exceeds the reccomended requirements for ACU. Paying for a game at any price should not involve your legwork and downloading fixes and patches, fiddling with settings etc. Again NO NO NO, AVOID THIS GAME!!! V. Dissapointed!
