One the best looking parkour animation in an AC game that is unfortunately suffer from performance issue that is yet seeing proper optimization.Im playing the game in the range of 30fps1080p on everything maxed out. My PC specs can be consider one of the highest end built and for the game to run at this framerates is just unacceptable. I am too used in playing action games in high framerates and this makes the game feels very unresponsive when it comes to control.It is really unfortunate for this game to have this terrible framerates because behind the terrible optimization lies a decent game. It may not be the best gameplay from all the AC but its fun to play.However, I had to uninstall the game because the low framerates makes the control feels laggy and unresponsive, this makes the game simply not fun overall.
