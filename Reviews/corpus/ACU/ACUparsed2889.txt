Im an Assassins Creed fan boy ever since the first game. Assassins Creed Unity is easily the worst entry in the series. The difficulty leveling is designed to keep the player from being able to play the game without either wasting time with the side quests or spending real world money on digital goods. They might as well have made this free to play and pinged the hell out of players with micro transactions. The bringing back of health potions and enemies of various difficulty ratings from Assassins Creed 2 is horrid. I thought we had moved passed all of that. Then there are the bugs and game breaking glitches that are still not patched out. What happened to this franchise? The next game had better not include this crap or I will find a new franchise to give my money.
