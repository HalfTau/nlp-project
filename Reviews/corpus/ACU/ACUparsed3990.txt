I think this is the first time I have ever bothered to write a review for a game on Steam. Why this game? Because it just isnt playable.Frame rate is terrible, even if you put everything to minimum settings and no, its not just my PC, I have a gaming rig that meets the specGot suckered in by the offer and completely regret it. This game isnt ready for playing. I feel really sorry for the testers who are going to get the blame for this.DO NOT BUY
