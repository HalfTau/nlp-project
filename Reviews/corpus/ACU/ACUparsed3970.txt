EDIT After literally A YEAR, I still cant get 60FPS or even hit it on LOW. What the  Ubisoft. Now I know that youre a bunch of greedy corporate dogs that just want our money. If Syndicate isnt good, Im probably not going to be interested in your series ever again. It used to be my favorite franchise of all time, now its just a shadow of that. Go back to the roots. Go back to black flag. Make AC great again.Lets just say this game would be my GOTY if it wasnt so unoptimized...dont buy it until its patched...or if you do buy it, I suggest not playing it until it actually works. I have tried all settings and even low doesnt run too well. My rigi5 2320GTX 770 SCKingston HyperX SSDUpdate After completing the entire game, its hard to recommend. It has AMAZING gameplay and a pretty good story. I love the combat and the graphics are very good. The only problem with it is the framerate at this point on PC. I dont get any stuttering, not many bugs are really seen. Its just the framerate. I used to recommend this game but I dont anymore. DONT BUY IT UNTIL THE FRAMERATE IS OPTIMIZED!!!!!! !
