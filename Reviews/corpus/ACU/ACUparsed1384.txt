The game initially had its problems, but I believe at this point 2016 most of it has been patched. I enjoyed the game immensely. It is packed with stuff to do and plenty of missions.Areas where it could improve is in the minigames. I thoroughly enjoyed the Black Flag and Rogue minigames and was disappointed to find out that similar minigames werent in Unity.The story is okay, not the best in the series, but definitely a great story if one were to look at it on its own. Overall Id recommend the game to any AC fan.
