My specsIntel core i54670CPU  3.40 GHz8.0GB RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 760Performance reviewI preordered this game like everyone else, but put it on hold for a couple days after reading steam reviews about the bugs and glitches that most everyone was experiencing. After Ubisoft has stated that they released a 2nd patch for PC, I decided to give it a go. ACU has the most beautiful graphics that I have ever seen on a video game. This being said with my graphics only set to high. The detail is truly incredible, and there is no doubt that this is why there were so many initial bugs and glitches.So far, I have experienced no significant performance issues. With my specs, I am able to run the game on high graphics settings with the only minor framerate drops occuring when encountering large crowds of people, at synchronizing points, or when it rains. This isnt too big of a deal to me, as this also seemed to happen in Black Flag and other AC titles and doesnt really affect gameplay at all. No characters falling through floors, floating in midair, or anything extreme like that.Gameplay reviewI wont say too much about the main story, but lets just say Ubisoft has impressed me so far yet again with their new approach to the templar vs assassin theme in the French Revolution. I love the new parkour animations including the controlled descent ability. It really makes the characters movements feel more lifelike. Dont even get me started on the customization options for Arno as far as clothes and weapons go. I have yet to try the coop missions yet, so I am unable to comment on those. The new combat style is slightly different and more challenging than previous AC titles, but nothing that you wont be able to pick up after a few street fights. So far, I am very satisfied with ACU.From my personal experience, I have to recommend this game at this point. I will update as needed.
