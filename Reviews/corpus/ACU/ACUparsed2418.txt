Yet another medicore Assassins Creed entry.Guess Ill list the few pros.Parkour is pretty good.ConsRuns like absolute dogCombat is boringStory is boring, though it had a real chance to be interestingPlayable character also had a chance to be the new Ezio but he turned out just to be a cliche hardassthe world is kind of lifeless and dull.At this point Im no longer interested in Assassins creed as a series, which is sad. It was once one of my favorite series, but Ubisoft have ground it down intojust to make that dolla, dolla bill yall. What a shame.
