Let me start with what is wrong Cons When I am in the Cafe Theater, I get like 20 fps and lower This is on low, and I have a radeon 7970 Some locations in the game cause 20 fps or lower Pretty much everything is buggy, in the begining of the game the SPOILER ALERTTemplar guy in one of the cutscenes has a hovering book and sheathed weapon Really demanding on specsGameplay Whistle was removed Cant move bodies Free Running is very clunky and very buggy Buggy Was expecting some more exciting stealth, but I got AI that have some sort of a super vision that can see through tiny corners. AI sees you even when their heads are not looking at you Lack of an expanded skill setPros Looks great Animations are cool looking Hours upon hours of content Customization Actual Assassins instead of you being on your own throughout AC3. SpoilersYou become an assassin early in the game Enjoyable in a sence However, AI is Over PoweredConclusion By the time you read this reveiw, it was posted right when the game was realesed. What I mean is that, just because the game is buggy and has a low FPS problem does not mean I wont recomend it forever. I would assume that Ubisoft is already fixing these problems. Many games in the past have had the First Day Bugs/Problems that get resolved in a certain period of time. The game is enjoyable, but not as much as Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. Black Flag had a stealth system that felt too easy, but it worked. In Unity, it was taken over board and we got almost impossible AI, I dont know if this is just me needing to get used to the new AI or there are problems with the AI. So, some of the things in the game are kind of laughable. Again, this does not mean that this game instanly gets a low 0/10. The game just came out and until we get fixes, we can rate it properly. But for now do not get this game for now....we will see. It is beyond buggy.
