Game is stuck on a certain part, anytime I try to go onto the next sequence it crashes and says Assassins Creed Unity has stopped working. It runs ok, a few fps drops here and there. But as soon as I try to continue the story it crashes. I really dont want to redownload a 37 gB game for such an error.
