NOBODY BUY THIS GAME. OR ASK FOR YOUR MONEY BACK.Full of graphical errors and glitches, and ubisoft has made little to no attempts to reassure all the buyers that they will soon be sending out a day 1 patch.If your lucky enough to get through the download process youll be met with a white menu screen where you cant even see the options. Then after launching, your mini map is white, your buttons are white, faces melt, people start flying, FPS drops as you see the gravity mechanics go wild and drapes/ capes start having a will of their own.tbh tho, its quite funny to watch, so there is that....seriously people, look elsewhere, Ubisoft is acompany until they fix their crap games.overhype/10. Will not recommend to my dog.
