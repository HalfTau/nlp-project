Well, where do I start....For PC, If you dont have a graphics card of a GTX 780 or higher, then you wont enjoy the game unless you dont mind playing on the lowest settings. I have a GTX 670, 8 gigs of ram and an intel i7 processor and it runs okay on medium settings.The missions are pretty much the same. Killing someone in a palace of some sort in the city, over and over again.
