payed 60 dollars to ubisoft. make uplay account. turns out you need a nividia card. ubisoft, please make this playable for people with nividia, yes i get you want next gen graphics, but half of the people who bought your game on pc cant play the game in the first place.an update it has been 20 or so days since i have posted a message to steam report. and there has been no response. i do not know if pc gaming ESPECILLY on steam if i have to deal with this crap then get 60 dollars taken away from me is the right thing for me. in conclusion if you have a consle buy this game youll be able to play bug fixes will come out soon. but if your stuck in the ing mess i am then dont even bother
