I am dissapointed that this is what the assassins creed series has come too. and for anyone looking for a lore friendly story from the modern work complimented by the revoultion era assassining prepare to be dissapointed. Ubisoft need to repair soo many things about Unity. They have sent an unfinished game onto the market. If you are on the fence about buying this wait a few months for them to sort theirout.
