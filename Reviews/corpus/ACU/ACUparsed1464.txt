Absolutely no different than all the previous Assassins Creed games, nothing new other that the very good character customization. Extremely poor optimization. Bought it to play with my friend and that lasted for 30 mins before we gave up trying to make it work for him. Not buying anymore Assassins Creed games after being dissapointer almost every year.
