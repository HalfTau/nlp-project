This is terrible. I like unity ... but it was so LAGGY I couldnt play it. Dont get me wrong, I have a VERY good computer, and ICANT even play it! This was a huge upset considering it took a day to download.Im filing for a refund. Since I paid with pay palI would not recommend this to ANYONE! Except if your playing on a console. If you play on a console, its fun.But on PC... it takes you 30 seconds just to open the menu.DO NOT BUY THIS!
