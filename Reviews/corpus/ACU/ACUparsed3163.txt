I dont care what other people say, I really enjoy this game, there are some downs like the optimization needs some work but it has gotten better and if it freezes sometimes I think playing in offline with the internet disconnected helps, not perfect but not the worst, I just miss some of the features that the other games had, I miss the loading screens that let to just walk around in it, and they got rid of you holding the person you just assassinated talking about plans and such, with some weird flash back memory like thing of what happend, and the other thing is I miss being able to sellect the hidden blade by itself and just use it as a weapon, sad you cant fight with the hidden blade anymore. but these arent game breaking for me, I really enjoy the parkour and movment of it, parkour seems to be smoother and I enjoy just running around the roof tops of france. and I really love the customization in this one, I havnt finished the story yet, but I think so far I would give the game all in all a 9/10.
