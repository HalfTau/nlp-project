As of right now this game is practically unplayable without a computer well above the recommended stats. My computer has a top of the line graphics card, an above recommended CPU, more than enough RAM, and a fast enough HDD. Ive had to lower the graphics to low for environment, textures, and shadows at multiple parts throughout the game. Aside from that the game hardly ever runs at 30 FPS, it usually sits around 2025 for me. The screen likes to go bananas sometimes and shoot off to some random angle without my input to do so. During combat this is extra annoying.Overall the game right now is buggy, unoptimized, and nowhere near a steady 30 FPS that is almost required to play any game nowadays. Unless you have a beast of a computer Id wait on getting it until they hopefully fix some of these problems.Some pros are  The parkour feels good, the combat is more difficult and fun, you also die a lot faster 24 hits. Havent tried coop since most of my friends waited for the review first, and after the flop it turned out to be, decided not to buy it. Mine was a gift from someone though, or else I also would have waited for the review.Last note, the tutorial is by far the worst part in terms of lag, glitches, and bugs. If you do have the game, it gets a little better once you finish the tutorial, so hang in there and see if its playable after that.
