This game embodies the essense of Assassins Creed. Lean gameplay with very little fat. The detective missions are a fun deviation, a pause in the action. A time to think.This historical setting is the best of the series. Rendered in stunning detail. Coop is fun. The missions are replayable.Dont listen to the haters  Ive hardly had any bugs when playing. Yes, the game is demanding of your system, but most of you will have specced past the requirements.
