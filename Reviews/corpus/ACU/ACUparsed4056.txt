Ok first impressions are its going to be good seeing as there seems to be a blackflag type levelalthough many of the play styles have changed, AC Black Flag had awsome improvments via controlls  attacks  items etc  however i found it difficult to jump over a simple log whilst chasing an assasin at the very start.bassically I have been put off playing this after only playing less than 5 minutes.I would advise waiting for a sale or accepting a different game compared to previous versions.This is not your standered AC
