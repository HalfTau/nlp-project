In a nutshellIm regretting not buying Rogue. Assassins Creed Unity is a complete disappointment other than graphics. They stripped naval missions, terrible story, predicatable ending, and repetative misson design of sneaking in to a guarded building and kill the target.The last thing is that they included Napoleon Bonaparte for only 10 minutes! Are you crazy! Hes is one of the most influential figures in history, but he just gets a small part of a sequence to show that hes around. And even in that short time hes shown to be a smart, calculating genius who is somehow one step ahead of both the Templars and Assassins.This game was just not up to par with Black Flag, and I feel that Ive wasted 60.
