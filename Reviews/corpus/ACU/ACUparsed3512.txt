This is a sad sorry excuse for a game.  The gameplay is great if you like assassins creed great customization and whatnot.  But be warned as their are so many uncompatible graphics cards that ubisoft claims.  But if you do have a graphics card that is compatible you get serious FPS lag i mean you will have 60 frames then in a matter of .5 seconds youll get 5 frames then back up to 60.  This is very game breaking in my opinion and ubisoft cant seem to fix it so save yourself the 50 dollars and buy black flag or a different game because this is deffinently not worth 50 bucks maybe 5 dollars in my opinion.
