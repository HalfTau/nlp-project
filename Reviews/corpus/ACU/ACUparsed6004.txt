I would very much love to recommend this game to so many, but the fact that there are still multiple issues, I recommend you do not get the game until it has all been solved.I for one, had to go through multiple tiny text you can barely see so I could change the display to fit my screen. It took me multiple hours to figure out another way to fix it. When I am in game, I can not escape to the options menu? Is that a bug?As well as the fact that many have indeed have very low and poor fps even as for me having the graphics car dand what not. It deems to be unplayable.I will most definitely continue to play, once everything is fixed. For now Im going to stick with the a few older AC games. I do hope to return to this game as a playable game for all and I do hope, for all that have preordered this, that it will be worth it. Soon.
