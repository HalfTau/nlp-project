I was not able to play this game very far because of glitches. I even have the free dlc from ubisoft for a game I cannot play. Ive thought about getting it for ps4, but I really dont want to give the company anymore of my money. Especially not for a game I already own.Ive seen gameplay from the game and its a really pretty game. I liked the idea of it, but I wouldnt recommend it mostly because I feel betrayed by Ubisoft.
