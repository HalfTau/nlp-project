Its a decent game, but this taught me that under 18th century Paris theres a white abyss that goes on forever. Seems Legit. And the stealth is so bad I was planning to use it all game,but you cant even switch cover at all. How crpy is that! Honestly, Id give it a three out of ten. If you are planning to buy this, just throw those 60 dollars in a fire and youll get something better than this game.
