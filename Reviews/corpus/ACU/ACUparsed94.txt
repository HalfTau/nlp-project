If you can get over the crashes, poor optimisation, bugs, microtransactions, then this game is pretty good. Unlike ALL of its predeseccors, the combat is hard and a matter of counterkill. The story is fairly good like all AC games and parkour is slightly better. If it werent for bugs, glitches, crashes, and microtransactions, this game would be great. Because of those however, the next games had a bad reputation.One thing i HATE is Uplay. Otherwise this a pretty good game, and I recommend you get it during a sale, because it has better worth.
