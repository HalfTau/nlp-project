I played every assassins creed game that has been made so far, exept for syndicat and although i really enjoyed assassins creed unity and its multiplayer aspects of the game i have to say it was not exactly what i expected but it defenitly isnt a bad game. If your like me and you play games for 2 houres a day then ac unity may not be the greatest if you want to spend multiple days playing it. It took me 23 houres to complete the story. In my oppinion that isnt very long but if your into doing Quests and missions there is plenty of it.With all i have learned in my 23 hourest of play time i would rate the game a 7/10Should buy
