This game contain A LOT of bugs in both single player and multiplayer, even after numerous update and socalled bug fixings. Often you would see NPC that you suppose to follow is just stand there frozen. This game is a disaster for 70 dollar game level, if you are looking for single player experince which you should, cause the mulltiplayer is just a cluster f of failure or just a big fan of the ac franchais, you should definately go for ac rogue which is coming out in couple of weeks on pc.Most disapointing ac game so far from UBIsoft
