When I bought this game it was set to Japanese. I requested a refund. I re purchased the game and it was in English. I finally play and am impressed to not have any framerate issues noted by the earlier reviews.I can reccomend this game if you meet the requirements listed above...Im using a desktop PC with ani7 4770k 3.5  even usage across the coresGTX 970     maintains a mid to high 70s fps sometimes more... no less than 59 in huge crowds8GB RAM8.1 ProPROSI am blown away by the facial animation.I prefer this games more fluid parkour system.The combat system is more challenging than previous gamesIm wielding a Bident, but they have a ton of different weapons too many to listCONSThey keep stammering about the Animus in this oneThere are texture pop ins and sometimes whole people pop in
