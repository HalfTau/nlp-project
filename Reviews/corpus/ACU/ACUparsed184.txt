I waited until thestorm is off to buy this game at half the price and now ready to give my verdict.Pros I like the new parkour mechanic when you can ascend and descend the building at almost any surfaces. Especially the descend one, where the probability of falling down the building and taking damage is pretty much disappear. I like how this game uses several progression system money to buy better equipments, assassin points to upgrade acquired equipments and skill points to learn more useful skills. I prefer it this way than Black Flags where you need certain materials from certain animals in certain areas which is bothersome for me. The coop is the main selling point for this game. A new experience in the Assassins Creed franchise. It feels so great when you try cooperating with strangers on taking down the target and finishing the mission together. Lots of collectibles and side missions for completionists.Cons Even though they already patched major bugs in this game, I still got it sometimes. While I said the parkour mechanic is good, sometimes the character doesnt go the way I need him to be. Especially when Im running from enemies through narrow places with many tables and chairs around. Then Arno would foolishly jump onto the table and slowing down for s sake. The story is not its strong point. Its pretty much generic. AC games before this might have better plot than this one.Id recommend this for someone looking for new approach to the Assassins Creed games.
