Im really enjoying the hell out of this.I dont get how they are purposefully ignoring the plot of the revolution, though. Its one of the greatest, most violently disgusting chapters in world history with every imaginable twist handed to them on a silver platter ...and they are doing next to nothing with it.But the game mechanics are delicious and the fights are awesome! So a highly unusual thumbs down to ...Abstergo Entertainment, for dodging the history, but total glee at the general carnage and destruction.Hurrah!
