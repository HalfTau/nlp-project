Fantastic! Literally the perfect Assassins Creed game,Fully customisable character outfits all with stat changes,The city is full of life!The combat and parkour was revampped to perfection,Graphics are stunning!Unfortunatly the game runs quite bad on medium  high settings as it is so unoptimised which is shame as if it ran well it would literally be the most perfect AC game to date!
