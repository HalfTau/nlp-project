Despite all of the complaints about Unity and its performance issues, I found it to be a great game, with a historically accurate more or less environment, likable secondary characters, and a breathtaking, utterly gorgeous environment. THe character customization and RPGlike ish progression also were some of the brighter points of Unity, and the Coop portion of the game was a successful influence on my immersion ingame. I will also say that the TemplarAssassin fiasco never ceases to enthrall me in the ageless, longfought war between order and freedom.My main gripe with Unity is that the main character, Arno Dorian, had so much untapped potential, and the writers of this game failed to take advantage of what could have been the next Ezio Auditore. I would liken Arnos story to ACII, where Ezio is just starting to become an Assassin. Their stories are similar, and yet Arnos story was shortened into one game, and his character was rather bland, providing no motivation towards relating to the character in any possible way.I built my first PC to play this game. It was worth it.
