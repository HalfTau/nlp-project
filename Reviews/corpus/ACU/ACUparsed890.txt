I got the game back on when it was new. Computer ran it terribly because of its launch issues and the gaming industry and followers learned a new lesson then or so we hope.And so did I. Not to preorder again.I decided to give it another shot. See if it was worth playing.The story had me gripped on a few points but the ending was just so anticlimatic that its unreal. You can see the game was meant to be more of an active online thing rather than anything else. Because it shows.And that bit was fun.... back then. Right now, I can barely find people online.I couldnt even bother to finish the free DLC they had to toss in because of the launch problems.The game is beautiful, yes, but I only advise you to play it in case youre a really diehard fan of the series.So, do yourself a favour and stay away from it.
