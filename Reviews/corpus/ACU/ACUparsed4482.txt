If u just want my star rating 5.5/10Best AC game since AC 2 not counting in expansions such as liberty freedom cry brotherhood ect ect not that that is saying much. last few were complete trash for the actual story of AC. only recommend this on sale but its fun gameplay, if u play AC for the story though, then u shouldve stopped trying with these games ages ago.I dont not recommed the game so i put i recommend but dont pay full price for this broken game invisible blocades in roads, glitching floors and what not patches slowly fixing theseFINAL POINT read the specs required most negative reviews seem to b bittching about crashes and bugs that r the consumers fault for buying a game their comp cant handle rather than being ubisofts fault for releasing an unfinnished product which they did but not as bad as ppl make it out to b, but still bad5.5/10EDITLol they made it near unplayable with the last 2 uodates, not worth 5cents let alone 70dollarsEDIT 2K, so they are still fixing in game purchases before playability and rather than fixing countless bugs that make the game look like its in Alpha still, they decided to release a semi broken DLC... anyone remember Ataris infamous ET? I feel like this is the beginning of the end for UBI...
