Great game, when it runs. Hopely patches will fix the bugs and crashing, But as a assassin creed game the combat is alot harder then the ones in the past, the stealth syetem could of been improved more but thats not a bother. One of the best things is the new parkor and coop.Overall 7/10 with bugs and crashes 9/10 without them
