Dont listen too the other but hurt people in the reviews, they are just mad because they cant run with there Intel HD4000 Intergrated Graphics. As long as you have a minium or recommened GPU standard you will have a blast at this game.I have a MSI R9 280x and on High graphics i run 3750 FPS constantly.This game has a great story line with 10/10 graphics.As long a you dont have atoshiba laptop you will be fine.Plz stop the buthurt about FPS its fine.
