Dont get me wrong, This is an amazing game. The graphics look great, I get nice FPS, the main plot is complex and interesting, the gameplay and parkour is better then ever. Yet, there is always some issue with this game. I played to about sequence 5 when my save data got corrupted. Great. I play back to where I was, bu guess what, now there are random crahses. Really? Now, I cant even launch the game. It just crashes. Its a great game, but right now its unplayable. Just wait for it to go on sale later when they have patched the crashing issues.
