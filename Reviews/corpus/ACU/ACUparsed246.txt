This game isbeyond words. And I cant even get a refund for it as I have a few more hours over the max, so Im stuck with this peice of dog VALVE FIX THIS NONSENSE. For a game that takes more than 2 hours to get through the prologe, 2 hours isnt enough to judge the game off of. The refund period should be case by case and game by game based. Not some abstract value.
