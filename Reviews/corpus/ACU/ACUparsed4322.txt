Ive done everything possible to mediate the game not launching to no avail! Press Play and Uplay logs me in successfully, ACUs splash screen pops up, ten seconds later I get greeted with Assassins Creed Unity has stopped working.Validated cache, disabled Steam/Uplay overlay, disabled cloud, exited EVGA Precision running in background, disabled HID in Device Manager, and reinstalled ACU after uninstalling and cleaning registry with CCleaner.I enjoy the Assassins Creed series having played all of them and was excited so much I preordered the latest. Far Cry 4 was in my wishlist until I saw the plethora quantity of not launching threads in the forum! First Ubisoft game Ive encountered a problem having zero issues with the other AC games, Far Cry 3, and Spinter Cell Conviction/Blacklist.SpecsWindows 7, i7 920, 6GB RAM, GTX 750 Ti SC.
