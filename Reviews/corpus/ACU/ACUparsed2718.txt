Uh personally I didnt have much fun with this game as I thought I would have. This is the first Assassins Creed game where I have not actually bothered to finish the story or even care much for it. I havent played it since around the first month of release so I apologize if this review is outdated. During the first month the game wasnt that buggy as people made it out to be. I barely had any glitches or bugs. I did have some trouble playing multiplayer as the server would lag at times and people would become invisible or just randomly teleport to their death. The game was very poorly optimized in the beginning which Im sure has been fixed now, but in the beginning I couldnt play the game at all without skipping all over the place.The story, or what I payed attention to was alright. Nothing special, they definitely tried to recreate the Ezio feeling but didnt really get it. The combat is more or less the same but this time you can have your own personal custom weapons. If you prefer spears, swords, two handed axes, polearms, they got them including rifles/muskets. You also get rewarded gear for completing coop missions online allowing you to further customize your assassin. The graphics were nice but didnt pay much attention to them since I focused more on finding what to climb and where to go. Just eh, this didnt really do it for me.Edit 10/22/2015Now that Ive gotten a chance to replay the game and actually finish it, I still stand by with my old statement. The game is still surprisingly not optimized at all. The coop is literally dead and would take minutes to an hour if youre still trying to find a party. This game was a pretty short lived game and the ending was a complete disaster and a huge downer. I played through all of that to not even get a remotely interesting or satisfying ending. Hopefully Syndicate doesnt have any of these issues.
