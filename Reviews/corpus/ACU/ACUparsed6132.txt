The game is quite flawed at launch. Its how I want to open this review. Ive had the opening mission bug out on me near the end prompting a full restart, combat has frozen in certaint areas multiple times, leaving long delays before action resumes, and not only that, but the game seems very poorly optimized at this time. My GTX 780 is showing frequent if small frame spikes, and graphics are consistently not rendering properly. Please be advized that these issues exist at launch day.That being said, what I have played of the game so far is... interesting. The story doesnt really seem to do anything new, in fact it is strikingly similar to Ezios story. Stealth missions, while still plenty of fun, also dont seem to deviate from the tried and true format. Unfortunately, what could have been a huge reveal during the plot at the end of the prologue was quite underwhelming. I am also still very much in the dark as to who my presentday character is and how they fit into the story. This is something I would have liked to have been cleared up near the beginning before I was thrust into the past.However, I have been enjoying playing the game and I do look forward to seeing how the game plays out. I am very fond of the downward parkour controls, and the obstacle maneuvering controls have been wellrefined. I personally am happy to see the series return to Europe and to a busier city setting.My verdict If youre a big fan of the series and have played it all, my initial response is that theres enough here to keep you happy and comfortable, even if it doesnt sweep you off your feet. If you havent played much, dont bother. As far as I can tell, the game downt hold up much on its own.
