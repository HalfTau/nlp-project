Before you read this, I should warn you that I didnt play Dead Kings nor do I plan to.In my humble opinion, Unity is merely a bad joke of what it could have been.ACU had the potential to be the best game in the series so far. Next gen, superb graphics, customizable assassin, awesome historical setting, COOP missions etc. In a way it was perfect Paris is huge almost 11 scale, wtf and beautiful, and theres a lot to do. But as we all know, graphics quality never makes a games story any better, and this game is a prime example of that.The main story is weak. Theres a world changing revolution going on, but the character only cares about his personal quest this might sound familiar, which is one of the reasons this game wasnt good.The Companion App is boring, the love story managed to be almost as bad as Twilight and whoever thought removing the human shield feat would be a good idea should be fired and never work in game industries ever again. Not to mention the glitches, which can still be found though the game is as patched as a metalheads jacket by the time Im writing this. Seriously Ubisoft, get yourtogether.So Unity is yet another dissapointment in the AC series, though Im not very surprised this franchise is going down the toilet. After almost completely setting history aside just for a trope that has been told a million times by now, AC is just a thin glimpse of what it was once. The soundtrack doesnt suck yet so theres that as consolation.RIP modern storyline by the way.The COOP is fun as hell though so theres that assuming you dont get paired up with noobs, of course.Im gonna say what youve probably heard from a ton of people already Rogue is better. If you see both Unity and Rogue on sale, get the latter. Trust me.4/10 would steal the king with Napoleon Bonaparte again
