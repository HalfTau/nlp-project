This game is not very well crafted considering that there are numerous bugs which make the game unbareable. Among constant character clipping, even occuring during cutscenes seriously detracts from the games integrity. Often Arno will become stuck after the free run glitches, needing a full restart of the game. Among combat occasionally freezing my character in place unable to move, sometimes blocking and countering attacks will simply not register.The game however is quite nice visually as the architecture of the buildings, character costumes and weapons are well designed. Overall a mediocore Assassins Creed Game. These technical aspects make the experience more frustrating thansummary I would recommend Black Flag over this game.
