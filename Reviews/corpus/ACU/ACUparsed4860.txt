This game is a disaster. First I was playing with manageable crashes that were frustrating, but hey it happens. Then, after a certain cutscene, the game kept crashing and wouldnt load. Ok, really starting tome off. Now, I cant even start the damn game without crashing right from start. Great job porting this game Ubisoft. You are now the new EA.
