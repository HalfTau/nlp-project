when i first got this game wich was at launch i could hardly run it. i even have a decent pc. but it was an assassins creed game so i didnt really mind about the low fps, untill i realised not only did it run bad the game also sucked. the story is bad gamplay is ok but with bad fps it sucks and if you have good fps it is the same as the other games in the series. today i tried to play it because ubisoft did a lot of patching and i wanted to see if it got any better. and it didnt the game now crashes if i open it. conclussion dont buy this piece of overpriced
