Firstly i have seen a few minor bugs but mostly Ubisoft has completely fixed the game now which is why i bought it in 2016. Secondly the games graphics are georgous and i find the storyline decent. Lastly the customization in weapons and outfits is very deep and i love the large amount of options that enable you to be the type of assassin you want to be
