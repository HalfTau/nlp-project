I gotta say I really love this game. This is on my top 3 AC games. I love the gameplay. The coop, I pretty much everything comes out perfect. There is just one part that I strongly dislike. The story. Ofcourse its assassins creed and you have to assasinate people and thats cool and so on but the need of Elise Arno has just makes him a weak character, ofcourse not every Assassin can be perfect but I still dislike the factthat the creeds biggest target isnt worthbecause he thinks that fighting beside some girl he is inlove with is more important than assasinate the creed of Paris biggest target.But this also creates an different atmosphere for ACUs maincharacter Arno, but personally I think that everthing in the story is for a girl he loves is just stupid.The rest I strongly like, having great fun with my buds in this game.8/10.CHP
