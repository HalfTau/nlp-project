The secondbest Assassins Creed game in my opinion, graphics are beautiful, story is not as good as the Ezios but its decent enough for Assassins Creed game. Combat and stealth are challenging, which appears to be the first time in Assassins Creed games, and its a good thing! This game had a lot of hates back when it just launched, mostly because of the bugs and optimization issues, but those are no problems anymore after patches. Sometimes enemy get stuck or combat feels kinda clunky, but I didnt experience any gamebreaking bug or crashes through out my personal gameplay. In conclusion it is a very good start for new generation Assassins Creed games.
