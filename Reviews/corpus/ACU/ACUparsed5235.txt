Seems like most people are saying this game sucks andlike that. Welp to me the story is fairly good, it keeps me intrested and wanting to play.I feel as though on medium settings I get a solid 40 fps, and I dont even meet the min system requirments. There is some stuttering in densly populated areas but it isnt bad for me atleast enough to the point where I can not play. Ive heard of plenty of bugs but havent seen many myself.The Movement system is not the greatest. It can be very random at times and Arno might just jump off a building and kill himself here and there but Ive delt with that... Combat is more of a challenge the AC3 was havent played BlackFlag. The Camera is fluid and makes the game look great.The Micro transactions and having to use an app to unlock chests ruin the game quite a bit for me... Not being able to open a chest that shows up on the map makes the minimap clutter and sometimes useless.Still havent tried Coop only because none of my friends have the game ATM.Overall I Would not reccommend it to anyone unless you were able to play WatchDogs at release and get around all those problems. Great Game, Was rushed and is incomplete.Oh yea One last problem! Cant wield the hidden blades as a primary weapon...
