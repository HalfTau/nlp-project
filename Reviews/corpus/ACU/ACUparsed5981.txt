Before I start, let me just state that apparently everyone else and their mother is having performance issues. Ive not had any issues though, so im going to assume its computer specs.That being said, after playing for an hour I find the story keeping my interest which hasent happened since AC2, the gameplay is a lot more fluid and responsive, the parkour elements are a lot quicker and easier to control. Combat makes a lot more sense now, you cant take on hoards of enemies by spamming B, parrying is a lot more precise. All in all, the combat is more realistic than previous entries into the franchise.Im loving this game, and seeing as everyone elses problem so far has been about performance, I dont think all the bad reviews are really warranted. Its just going to push people who are actually interested in the game away without a second glance.
