After all the patches and repairs done to the game. I can say one thing for sure it is a must buy and must play. Really love the setting of the 17s France. The streets of Paris seems very real, graphics is beautiful and the npcs or how busy Paris can be feels very real. Dont let the reviews fool you, it was bad in the beginning but now it is definitely the best AC. Not sure about Origins tho..
