Nope. Worst port by Ubisoft yet. Unless they patch this disgusting sack of unfinishedthey called a game, I will not continue to play it. I get 2040 fps on medium settings, and I have a GTX 970 with a i54690k clocked at 4.3 ghz. I play games that are way more demanding than this at ultra, and with this game, I cant even hit 60. Do not reccomend.I am updating my post from when I first bought it to now, trying to give it a fair review, but I cant due to it not starting at all, and I have reinstalled it, done fixes, everything to this upsetting game, and nothing, it does not start, save your money, never buy anything from Ubisoft again, because the more money you give them will only make them worse.
