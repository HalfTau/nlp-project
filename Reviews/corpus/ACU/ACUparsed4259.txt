do NOT buy this game, just dont. If you like AC games, play any of the far better original ones, like AC brotherhood, if you are new to AC games, dont let this poor mockery ruin your view of the series. EVERYTHING has been sacrificed to make it co op. Combat has finally been made slightly harder, but is now ruined due to parries and dodges working maybe 50 of the time, and having common street brawlers fight better than an assassin is pretty pathetic. the renowned fps issues and other strange glitches are really just another layer of incompitence on top of the already poor excuse for an AC game. Ubisoft, go back to Brotherhood, everything in that game is better than unity is today, and that game is many years old already
