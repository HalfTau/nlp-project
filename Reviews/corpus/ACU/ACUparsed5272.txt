Waste of 60 USD until this gets patched, this is beyond ridiculous, I couldnt play through the entire first mission without a crash on the cutscene.  Now, every cutscene crashes at least ten times before it works, and the frame rate is atrocious even on the complete lowest settings.  Running a FX6350 and a EVGA GeForce 660 TI yes its under the minimal requirements, but it has been a graphics slayer on every game allowing max settings and 60 fps on almost every game to date.  Extremely dissapointed so far, hopefully there will be a patch in the near future so I can give a positive review.  From what Ive seen on console footage it looks like an outstanding game with great new gameplay features, but for now Ill just have to wonder as it seems it is nearly unplayable for most PC users.
