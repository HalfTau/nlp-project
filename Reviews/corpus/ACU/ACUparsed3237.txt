Fix the game or I will do a Charge Back.Edi 3/1/2015Well I had to get a new Grahics card to play it. I ended up getting a Titan and it runs very well at 2560x1600. However after playing it for the last two weekson and off, I find that it is very boring. The story might as well have been writtten by a 15 year old that has an extra chromosome. The game itself gets really tedious too many bugs. E.G. I want to run up a wall, well after 5 seconds of slamming SpaceShiftW he goes up. However sometimes He will not climb the wall. Or while Im in a fight and Im trying to run away and I get hit once Arno stumbles and after a series of very quick combos by the AI Im dead. The game is broken, dont buy it.Im very disappointed in ubisoft for setting their standards so low. I will not support bad business practices from such a well known company, I will not be buying any future Ubisoft games.
