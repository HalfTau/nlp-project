Its a good single player game but a bad multiplayer game as well.It has a few glitches but not game breaking  compare to launch its way better  .Character customization is good.Story is decent  not the best but not the worst Its requires a decent pc.I give the game a 3 out of 5I recommend this game but i also recommend looking up other reviews.
