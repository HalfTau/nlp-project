Currently, this game is bad. I was very excited for this release but was disappointed. I get bad fps and the real problem is that it is real buggy. I couldnt even get through the first memory because i was stuck in mid air, I couldnt move.I hope they patch this, because right now, it is kind of unplayable.EDITNow that the game is actually fully fixed and is now playable, i find it quite fun. Still, is really hard to run but a good game, not even close to the best of the AC but new mechanics add more depth to it.
