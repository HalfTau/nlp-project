After a year, this game still crash. Crash, crash, crash, crash, ACU.exe has stopped working! WTF!!It is quite optimized, well, at least. Texture popins almost everywhere, like at one moment there is no one in front of you then suddenly 2 people appear from nowhere. Also ive tried some fixes to solve this crashing issue but none of them work, what a shame. If you want the latest Assassins Creed experience go get AC Syndicate, that game is waaay better than this but still there are some minor issues but none of them are gamebreaking issues.Sorry for bad englishASUS Maximus VIII HeroIntel Core i76700KASUS Strix GTX 98016 GB DDR4Windows 10 Pro 64bit
