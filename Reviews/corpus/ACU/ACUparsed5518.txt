I havent had much playtime with this game about 6 hours in. But its enough to give my impressions. First off I love the AC series, been a fan since day one. But I can see the greatness of this game. Problem is, are the poor perfomance issues. Crashes, glitches, framerate stutters and major framerate dips and losses even on loweest settings and resoulution. The game is buggy and just plain broken. The issues plague all platform, Xbox One PS4 and PC. This is one of the worst laucnhes from Ubisoft in recent memory, even worse than Watchdogs at launch. Is this is a good game? Sure, once Ubisoft fixes the damned thing. But as of right now, I honestly cannot reccomend anyone should buy this in the current state that it is in. Wait for the patches, however long that it is and spend your money elsewhere. There are thousands of reports from all over the internet about this games terrible performannce issues on even High end PCs. Stay away from this game... just stay the hell away until its fixed...
