suprisenly its a pretty fun game and lately or now its been a year its a stable game, although there is a nasty, rare glitch but that shouldnt be a problem THE ONLY MASSIVE complaint tho is, THERES NO OPTION TO RESTART. Yes i am correct if you complete the game and want to replay it tough luck you cant, also if you turn of anti alisinssgding or however you spell it the game almost always runs on 60fps7/10 recommend when on a deal
