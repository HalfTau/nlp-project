This game really isYou cannot grab enemies, you cannot pickpocket, you cannot fight without the camera acting .You cannot open numerous chests without not playing the game. Ubisoft has even added a cash shop to the game.What is this? Fing Neverwinter?Do not buy this game unless you are a masochist. Aside from the abysmal optmization of this game, the general gameplay is greatly bereft of the various improvements from earlier entries to the series. In turn, this game is instead loaded with many of the failings of the prior entries.This game is a waste of 60.00. If I could go back in time knowing and having experienced this game as I have now, I would be reluctant to pay 20.00 for the game granted its current state.Optimization will come with time. That is the least of my gripes. The blatant absence of features like grabbing enemies, human shields, and pickpocketing irritates the s out of me! !It had such potential, but Ubisoft done fed that up. I really hate that I dont like this game. There is clearly a great amount of effort and work that went into it, but there is just such a blatant lack of progress in this entry that Im not sure Ill ever buy another Ubisoft game again. The heists that I played are great, and repeatable! Alas, too many failings and omissions have ruined this game at present. Who the hell made these decisions? Amancio?
