As an avid Assassins Creed player, since AC1. I was extremely excited for Unity. The trailers I saw just had me on the edge of my seat waiting for the release. Well, I can honestly say I am dissapointed, The game is so broken it is almost sickening. Where to start? First off FreeRunning, I am not sure if the console has this issue but the pc version does. I have to turn the camera 90 degrees to the side of Arno to properly perform the leap of faith, If I do not do that he will not jump. At ALL! And that is a 50/50 shot that he will jump in the correct direction. Second, the combat mechanic, BROKEN! The blocking mechanism is selective at best. You can try to block when the bar above the enemy flahes yellow right before they attack and its a 50/50 chance Arno will actually block the enemy. Third, Ranged enemys, If you are fighting an enemy who has a gun, forget about it. You will die, unless you have a load of smoke bombs and medicine. The dodging mechanism for gunshots is broken so bad it makes me want to stop playing the game entirely.There are many many more things to list in this review but to keep it short I will leave it here. All I can say is Ubisoft better fix the problems they are having or I will not play their next release.
