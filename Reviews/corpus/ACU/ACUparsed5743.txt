An excellent progression of the franchise. The cover system for stealth makes it much more interesting for sneaking past guards or simple assasinations. There is some issues with the game slowing down in odd places such as when you are running and adjusting the camera view on tight corners to see where you are going is somewhat difficult to anticipate. But overall the gameplay for free running is much smoother. Fighting is also very unique for builds and weapons positioning is very crucial.
