This game is underrated in my opinion, really is not that bad as people make it sound. I know it had a lot of bugs at start, but now it is running really well. I dont think i ran into any bugs actually during my gameplay of around 100 hours.The strongest part about the game is definetly the graphics and enviroment in whole, it is easy to see they have put a lot of effort in that.The weakest part is probably the enemy AI and story  story was a bit dull in my opinion and enemies were extremely dumb  though i guess if they were smart, game would become much harder.
