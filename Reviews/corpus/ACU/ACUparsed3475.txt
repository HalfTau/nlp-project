I honestly dont know what people are complaining about, I have played this game for 9 hours now and so far having a blast. The optimization is bad, but its completely playable. I have a r9 280x AMD 8350 4.4 ghz and i run this game at very high without AA at around 4050 fps which is completely playable in my opinion. The bugs are quite bad but not bad enough to ruin the game experience, stop focusing on the negatives constantly. The gameplay is really fun, the customization is great, and the COOP is also extremely fun.
