The freerunning/ aspect is so poor its pretty much impossible to get Arno to actually go where you want him to. Completely takes any fun out of the game.However, the story was good and some of the upgrades enjoyable. Coop was reasonably good.Not worth the full price but on deal and as part of the collections its worth a play.
