Ive heard many negative reviews in the past about this game, but I think it wasnt too bad, I like playing coop with my friends a lot, there may be a lot of bugs, but its not too bad. I just wish that Ubisoft spent more time on this game, it wouldve probably been better if they worked on it once again.I suggest you get this on sale, its better getting it for 20 instead of 40.The story was actually good in my opinion, it wasnt too bad but it was actually a nice story.Before you get this game, you should get a good computer.
