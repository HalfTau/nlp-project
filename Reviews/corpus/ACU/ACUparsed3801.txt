TAKE IT OFF YOUR WISHLIST  I completely regret buying this game.I dislike how they removed whistling, removed human shields and wasted our time with these smoke bombs vs stun bombs which almost work the same and neither work that well.  For example you cant assassinate people with the hidden blade after throwing a smoke bomb... you are forced into slow melee and they removed the ability to switch to your hidden blade as a weapon while in melee... and I think you only get one hidden blade.  If you recieve two i cant tell.CoOp never works.Its saving system is terrible.  For i have purchased, ingame, 300,000 F  of items... twice and they still show up as needing to be purchased once i quit the game and return.  I dont just purchase them, either.  After spending my florens I play missions and fast travel so as to give the game a reason to save/load.  But it still says i need to purchase items that I have already purchased several times.The story is boring.The parkour is frustrating to say the least, though they did add some pretty new moves... i hate getting stuck on furniture and circling windows cuz Arno doesnt want to enter them for some reason.Upgrading skills is masked as new and different, but really you still are restricted to certain skills based on how far in the story you are and you also have to acquire the needed amount of skill points... which you can only get by playing coop missions or main story missionsOnly buy it if its 5 or if youre so rich 60 is 5 to you and you dont care about throwing money away.I completely regret buying this game.  The FREE DLC is crap too.  Boring story and lame weapon.
