Recommend? Yes, but only because Steam doesnt have an Meh option.Honestly I think its a fun game, not as good as Black Flag but better than the Ezio trilogy.So onto the pros and cons...because whats a review without it rightProsMovement system is much smoother than in previous installments, difficult at first to get used to it, but works very wellGraphics are very impressiveThe main story is fairly immersingPlayer equipment system is very well done, lots of weapons and armor to choose fromPlenty of side activities to get distracted withConsNo hunting or craftingIs a much smaller open worldMultiplayer system is apsolutely atrociousDuring chases, Arno develops a certain highly annoying stickiness to the environment which causes him to climb on top of an obstacle such as a crate in the middle of a market place instead of just running past it, this ultimately just makes you slow down and makes the chases last longer.So there it is... This game is perfectly balanced between a good and bad gameplay experience in my opinion.
