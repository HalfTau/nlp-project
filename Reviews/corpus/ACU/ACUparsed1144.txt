Okay okay, I have to admit that... This game is actually great!PC specs can be seen in my profile, I can play this game on high smoothly I can go beyond high but I want smooth gameplay.There are some glitches in the game, all games do. However I believe that the developer has managed to fix the major ones, I havent seen the, crashes, etc. I do still face some annoying glitches like getting stuck in an object and on a mission.This game is not the most optimized, but I have not experienced significant fps drop which mean it is not really that bad.The graphics is stunning, I mean it, even on high which is not the highest setting, I have not finished the game yet but the story is somewhat intriguing personal opinion, mediocre. Ilike the gameplay! The animation is stunning, the combat is new you cannot chain kills everybody anymore and the multiplayer is so fun coop, unlike the other series which is versus. I DO NEED to remind you that the multiplayer missions are a bit buggy, if you are unlucky you might get stuck in the level which is annoying and doing it all over again can be outrageous.If you really want to buy this game, YOU NEED TO SEE THE MINIMUM SPECS FIRST! This game is so demanding if one of your parts does not meet the requirement the game would stutter a lot. You also need to consider about the bugs, this is not just a small bugs, its pretty big and I have just written it above, getting stuck in an object is not a minor glitch, you really need to load checkpoint or even restart level. Getting stuck on a mission is a pretty big glitch, it will drive you crazy!I will give updates to the review if I need to new patch, find another glitch that is worth sharing, etc..I think this game deserves a second chance.
