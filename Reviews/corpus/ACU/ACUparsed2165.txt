Honestly, I had really high hopes for this game.Over a year after its release, I decided to finally drop the cash and buy Assassins Creed Unity. Most online forums claim that during this game the game has had a large majority of its bugs fixed.I dont even want to know what this game look liked at release.Id heard of the gamebreaking bugs that players experienced and had expected these to be fixed in this release, which, allegedly, many have been. But you wouldnt notice this was a finished product from playing it. Jerky parkour and freeclimbing? Yep. Buggy AI? Yep. Citizens who walk into tables only to be teleported on top of them and walk casually across as someone sits by their feet? Yeah! It has that too! Uplay disconnecting every few minutes despite my internet being fine? Awesome! Uplay in general? Lets not get into that... Quest markers getting stuck and not following the characters theyre bound too? Absolutely!This game is a broken piece of garbage. Ubisoft has gone down the drain. Assassins Creed 4 was at least somewhat fun and original, this game is just disappointing.
