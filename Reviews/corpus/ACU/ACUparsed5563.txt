I CANT ABORT A COOP MISSION! Unless I let myself get killed while waiting or quit the game, I am stuck watching a timer and not playing missions.I cannot recommend this game until the coop, fps, and most of the free running bugs are fixed.Btw, played a mission where I listened to the devil and my eagle sense was forever compromised.
