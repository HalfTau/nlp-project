Honestly, there is no excuse for this half finished product from Ubisoft. Adding 10,000 generic NPCs that all look identical doesnt add ANYTHING TO GAMEPLAY. I dont care that there are a thousand generic dudes on screen, I care about the gameplay, which is the same as its always been but somehow even worse. First of all the parkour system is garbage, half the time he gets stuck doing the most basic things such as climbing down. The graphics fully maxed are pretty gorgeous and the music is good. The gameplay is just plain boring. After 5 hours I have no more desire to play this game honestly. If I could get a refund I would request one. Im done buying anything from Ubisoft at this point.
