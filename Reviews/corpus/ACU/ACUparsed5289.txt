I really dont understand why all people are crying because of this game and are critising it, its one of the best games Ive every played and ffs only because you people cant play this game on max then a Buy a better PC or b go and  yourself because nobody is expecting you to play this game on high, I play this game with medium options and this game looks just amazing and I just cant explain to myself why there are so many negative Reviews so I started to read them Yes this game have bugs I cant play it on max I am stupid and if the game isnt working with constant 60fps on high its bad How about you guys just try out the gameplay? I played this game only for 3hours and the story is already amazing and played 2 rounds in Coop and its working without any problems!! Yes this games has some small bugs but they are working on a patch so please dont cry around guys, the only problem I had in this game is that it crashed in the middle of a coop session but I can understand it the game just came out.So Im definently recommending this game because its one of the best Ive ever played in my life and its the best Assassins Creed in my opinion, maybe it has some small bugs but Ubisoft is already working on it.Thank you for reading my review, sorry I dont have a potatoe for you
