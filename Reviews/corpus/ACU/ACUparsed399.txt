If you like the Assassins Creed games, youll enjoy this one well enough. One of the dissapointing features is that they are just giving up on the present day storyline and are only using it now as a reminder that you are actually in a memory, and they really dont go beyond that.The overall story is enjoyable enough, though I cant say too much about the side content as I rushed through it to play Syndicate which Im enjoying a hell of a lot more before Origins comes out.
