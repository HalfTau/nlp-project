Thought Unity had a shaky release as we all know, with incredible lag spikes and numerous other problems. The game now, is pristine. In Unity you play as Arno Dorian through Paris in the 1780s during the french revolution. A wonderful view of the city is seen around every corner. Whether youre looking at the old church of Notre Dame, or just witnissing the crowds gather and sing and yell for a change. I do believe I sat in Versailles watching people get executed for 10 entire minutes.The story mode can be challenging in some portions, big fights make life difficult so the classic Assassins Creed stealth requirement is returned because you want to do your best to avoid these massive 6to10 on 1 fights. Gameplay is quick and exciting as Arno proves he can do many more things than Ezio, Connor, and Edward. Climbing is faster, combat is faster and cooler I might add.Side missions and Side puzzles are in numerous variations and levels of difficulty all around Paris. I am not that good at Puzzles but if you are any more intelligent than me which isnt hard to do mind you then take a crack at it. Where I love the gameplay most is Coop missions.Im hooked up with anywhere between 1 and 3 other assassins where we tackle missions together in the coolest ways possible. I never thought I would ever see such badassery when we plan a mission perfectly and pull of the sweetest combos. Every mission is just like the trailer I promise you. Nothing feels better than running into a room with 3 other badasses and taking out a room of 16 guards so swiftly and easily. You wont be able to press F12 fast enough to catch it all!I wont even get into all the customisation features to make your very own Arno look far better than any other Arno, representing your class and playing type the way you want to.I would highly recommend Assassins Creed Unity to anyone who is new to Asssassins creed, and to anyone that has followed the series from the beginning.
