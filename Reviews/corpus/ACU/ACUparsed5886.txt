Despite the multitudes of crashes and errors Ive had to deal with since first playing, the general performance seems to be gradually improving. The game lags less and less and I havent crashed in a while. Ubisoft seems to be genuinely concerned with working out the bugs in this game, although why they released a game as broken as it was Ill never know.Unity is a gorgeous game with an interesting and engaging storyline, and an abolute delight to play. Yes, many things have changed from Black Flag, and there are always those who will complain. I personally enjoy when major developers shift their style from game to game. It just makes players tweak their strategy, which is arguably the whole purpose of Assassins Creed games, to actually think about combat in different ways. Because the hidden blade cannot be a main weapon, you cant tank your way through guards like in Black Flag. And I dont think thats necessarily a bad thing. Without minor changes there can be no progress, and minor changes in controls and weaponry dont even come close to ruining my game experience.Yes, there are still errors present, but with the way things have been improving I believe its only temporary. Bottom line is that Unity is a great game, and in my opinion, well worth the winceinducing pricetag.
