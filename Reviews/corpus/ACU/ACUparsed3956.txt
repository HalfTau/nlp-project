As of December 22, Patch 4 didnt fix anything for me. I get about 4050 fps max and when free running or in combat it drops to 1015 fps. I really really wanted this patch to fix the game since Im a huge fan of this series, but Ubi just keeps letting me down and all I can expect now is for another 34 months for this game to ACTUALLY work corrrectly. Combat is still glitchy as hell, my attack animations dont even display properly sometimes and Arno is either crouched and stuck like that or with one arm stuck in the middle of a swing but I still end up killing the person, or vice versa. Because of this, this game is unplayable I keep coming back to it hoping that, maybe just maybe the game will run smoothly but I still end up dissapointed.Specs Intel Core i34130  3.40 GHz8 GB of RAMNVIDIA GTX 650Ti BOOSTUPDATEJanuary 2015The game runs really well now, whatever Ubisoft did it seemed to have worked. Also just upgraded my 650 TI to a 750 Ti and the games performance didnt drop at all. The fighting and long weapons a bit of my personal opinion are freaking awesome. The Parkour is ok, it does have its few frustrating bits, but it was because of me, but with time its easy to master, watch the video where the dev talks about the parkour system and how it works after I watched that I got better at it. The Storyline is meh, it couldve been better imo. Overall now that the game runs butter smooth, Id recommend it.
