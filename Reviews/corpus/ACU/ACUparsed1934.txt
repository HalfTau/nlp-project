Yeah, exactly what is the fuss about AC Unity? I get constant 80fps on a GTX 980.Env. Quality UltraTextures UltraShadows High not PCSSAmbient Occlusion SSAOAA FXAAShadow render distance? Meh.Other than that. This game runs fine. Completely underrated. People are saying Syndicate is better, but somehow for me, Unity get higher FPS than Syndicate, and has better graphics. The streets are actually full on Unity, and not empty like Syndicate.9/10 I had to tweak some settings in Nvidia settings though.
