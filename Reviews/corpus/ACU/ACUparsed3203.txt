i love assassins creed and all. and this game was a pretty good game. but as for as bugs go, its nearly unplayable. I have a good computer and on medium/low graphics, the game will lag every five seconds literally. I know ubisoft is trying to fix it but ive downloaded 20 gb of updates and it hasnt fixed it. Also, the latest update broke the game, i cant even play the game now after i update it. If the game is fixed then i would rate it 5 star but until then its at a 1
