There is a known issue with this game, that the publisher knows about but has not bothered to fix. If you have an ASUS model motherboard and/or a Realtek soundcard, the game crashes every 1015 minutes.Ubisoft recommendation is Disable your sound card in your BIOS or delete sound card .dlls in Windows/System32.This fact alone makes me state that this game is a broken product, left on the Steam Store in hopes that others will purchase a broken game for a slight bit of profit for Ubisoft.
