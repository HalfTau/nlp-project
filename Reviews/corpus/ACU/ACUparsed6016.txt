Let me start by saying my specs blow the crap out of the recommended specs. I love Assassins Creed, I will finish this game because I love the series, but I wouldnt buy this game again. If you want to play this game, buy an Xbox One or PS4 and play it there.Its important to note that the only issues are NOT graphical. I experienced my first gamebreaking glitch before even playing as Arno.
