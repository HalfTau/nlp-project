The game itself is fine story, free running, fighting, etc..Though unless you have a BEAST of a computer, I would not recommend getting the game. I have to play on low graphic settings, just to get a playable fps. Other then my FPS problem it has been not too bad, other than the two crashes I have experience in my 8 hours of gameplay.Hopefully Ubisoft will fix this soon.Overall Unless you know for a fact your computer can handle this game, then dont get it.
