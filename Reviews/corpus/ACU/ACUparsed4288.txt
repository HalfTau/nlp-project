First of all, this is not a perfect game. But its getting better. Theres a lot to like about the game, if you look past the ugly stuff that happened on launch. The bugs that people have  been reporting havent happaned to me, but I wont deny that they have happend. I have a GTX 745 the 4gb version, 12gb RAM, and a 3.60 GHz I74790 processor.Pros  Good Storyline Challenging Gameplay Updated Freeruning and ClimbingMultiplayer missions are pretty coolCons  I still cant get a decent frame rate should not happen Some bugs and Lag
