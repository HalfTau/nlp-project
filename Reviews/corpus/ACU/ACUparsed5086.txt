I really dont need to say anything about the ridiculous amount of bugs because all you have to do is Google Assassins Creed Unity and youll see everything you need to know. I will say this though, Im so frustrated with this game that I want a refund. Ubisoft took something with so much potential and ruined it by releasing it with such an outrageous amount of bugs that the game isnt even playable. Im a die hard AC fan and have played and beaten each and everyone of them.Even though ACIII had its fair share of glitches, this.... by far is the biggest goof that Ive ever seen. Dont waste your money. Ill return to AC Black Flag while I patiently wait for Inquisition.
