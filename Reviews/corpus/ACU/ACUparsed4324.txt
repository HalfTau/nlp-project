I am a huge fan of the AC franchise, but this game is disappointing in nearly every aspect. I admire and respect the effort invested in creating a game of this detail and atmosphere, but the decisions for changes in regard to the predecessor games are not comprehensible for me. The controling tries to make everything more smooth but restricts the players possibilities. Forcing the players to play coop missions to develop their character is simply an insolence for a single player game. A lot of collectibles are only accessible in the later game but spaming the map from the very beginning. A lot of time already wasted for trying to get a chest simply unreachable. Some of the collectibles can only be accessed when also playing the companion app. I like to finish collectibles and side quests early in the game before getting the main story on too much, but this seems not possible for this game. So all in all I am quite frustrated by this reinvented AC as Ubisoft itself puts it and I am not even considering the bad performance of the game. Nevertheless, I feel very positive about the innovative way Ubisoft is going, Id only wish they would not force the players to use the innovations they simply do not want. A little bit more of having a choice would be nice. What a shame. I hope Ubisoft rolls back some of its decisions for the future. I will definitely not prebuy the next AC.
