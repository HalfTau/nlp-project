I really like the game!Only had one bug in almost 40 hours of playing you can see the screenshot if thou wish. I didnt have a laptop that met min.req, but I can play everything on high with fxaa and ssaowhatever. My laptop is a Lenovo Y510p, Cputurbo at 3.4 x4 and, G.force 755M x2. I hook the laptop into my tv and play with a pc/xboxcontroll and it works amazing!I feel so bad for the people that get these massive bugs and Im so thankful that the gaminggods have spared me.
