I dont get what people hate about this game so much. The customization isnt at all bad and the amount of different weapons you can have is amazing. You can even main a rifle! The parkour is insanely fun, probably the best of the whole series. The story isnt that bad as well. I wouldnt say its as good as the Assassins Creed II story but it had some of its good parts. And if you cant run it, you must have a crap PC because my PC is about 4 years old and the game runs perfectly fine on high settings. So with all this said. It was probably my second or third favorite Assassins Creed game, my first being Black Flag of course.7.5/10. Whats all the hate for?
