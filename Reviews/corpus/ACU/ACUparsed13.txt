Other then the original game AC Black Flag is the best AC IMO. Unity to me is the 2nd best. I loved the time period. The reason I like it over Syndicate and Origins is mainly because the parkour system is the best one they have created. It seems it has regressed in Syndicate and Origins. In Unity you just feel immersed because the streets are so packed with people. You feel like you are in a living breathing city. In Syndicate it is an amazing environment but it is so barren of people compared to unity. A lot of critiques from people seem to be about the coop, which is fair. They dont have enough content to call this a coop game, maybe 2 hours worth. They hyped the game up to be a coop experience, but in reality coop is just a gimmick. They couldve went bold and made the entire game a coop experience and this would have been the best AC ever. At the heart of it though it is a traditional single player game.That being said the misssions do get repetitive. For me though all the AC games get repetitive. These arent games to play 12 hours straight. Its a game you can get lost in playing for a good 23 hours. Then come back to the next day or day after. If you are getting the game with the goal of beating it as quickly as possible then you will be burned out. If you are getting the game for a truly immersive experience then you wont be disappointed. You truly feel like an assassin.The one major drawback of the game is it has far too many scenes dealing with Abstirgo. It just takes you out of the immersive experience thankfully they rectified this with Syndicate and Origins. Also the whole jumping through portals because of a Abstirgo server sweep is completely annoying. People dont play these games for the Abstirgo spelling? storyline.Either way you cant go wrong with Unity at this discounted price.
