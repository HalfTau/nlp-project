Despite what bugs remain, this game is enjoyable. You get to run around Revolutionary France as an assassin with fellow people. And by fellow people, I do mean a dedicated coop system, not like a small coop experience in multiplayer such as Wolfpack from AC3 and AC4 Black Flag. The story, I must admit, is rather lackluster compared to previous games series of events. Although it is another revolution, Arno, the main character, plays a bit of a much more laidback role in the French Revolution compared to how Connor essentially did everything for the American Revolution. The love story between Arno and Elise is a nice touch, and rather hearfelt at times. The combat is somewhat more difficult to get to used to than the more recent past installments, but still enjoyable. Overall, this game is pretty damn good after the patches. My only true beef with this game is the minimum requirements list as I had a GTX 660 when I bought the game, thinking that I could run it smoothly on the lowest settings. I was able to upgrade soon after I bought it, so I wouldnt recommend this game if you fall short by even one of the minimum requirements.
