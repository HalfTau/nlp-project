Outside of the main missions, well, its fetch quest central for the most part, along with a few assassinations. The excellent stealth mechanics make these missions more exciting than they have any right to be, though, particularly thanks to a few new tweaks that solve some ageold problems. Breaking line of sight with an enemy now creates a visible silhouette of your last known position, which makes it easier to know exactly where youve been spotted, and which areas to avoid. It also works rather well as a lure. Enemies often investigate your last known position, and if that happens to be right by a ledge or a behind a doorway, it makes for an easy assassination. The parkour system has been tweaked, allowing for greater freedom of movement. It means you arent locked into a set course during a climb, so you can easily move diagonally across a surface, or descend with fewer awkward animations. Arnos new phantom blade ensures you always have access to a silent, longrange weapon, opening up new avenues of assassination that would otherwise have been closed to those who didnt opt to hone Arnos skills in projectile weaponry.Speaking of weaponry, gone are the complex crafting systems of old, replaced with a far friendlier cash system complete missions, get cash, buy and upgrade weapons and armour. This simplicity is good, because theres a dizzying amount of stuff you can buy, all of which has some sort of effect on Arnos skills. For example, certain hoods extend the range of your eagle vision, while certain pants increase your stealth abilities. The chest, forearms, waist, head, and legs can all be customised to your liking, giving you noticeable boosts across melee, stealth, health, and ranged attacks, as well as a unique look if you opt to tweak the colours.
