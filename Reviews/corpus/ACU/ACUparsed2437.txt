This game is a huge let down looking to all the previous AC Games...I do not recomand it...Ive always been a huge fan of AC but this is the biggest letdown ever...especaily from AC. Long live 1,2 Brotherhood , Revelations , 3 and 4 which were awesome rouge was .... meh.... but unity is just...extremly bad....hope syndicate will be better...
