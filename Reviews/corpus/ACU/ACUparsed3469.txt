Very fun, beautiful game. Im using the ASUS ROG G751JY laptop to play this game gtx980m and the game runs very smoothly at ultra graphics.  The storyline is great and the graphics are beautiful. The combat has improved and there is a LOT of customization.  As long as you have a highend graphics card, youll really enjoy this game.
