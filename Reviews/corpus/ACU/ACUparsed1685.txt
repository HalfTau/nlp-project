After replaying this game many years later and being one of the unfortunate victims to preorder this game I can confidentally say that this game has been abandoned. Its playable and I recommend buying it on a sale but if youre looking for the powerhouse game they originally advertised it as then youre in the wrong place and I recommend you move to the witcher series for a much more powerful and interesting story and much more reasonable prices.
