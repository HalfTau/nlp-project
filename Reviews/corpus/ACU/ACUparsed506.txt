I am sitting here writing this review while my character is dying by a gun shot as there is nothing i can do about it. Walk down the street, nope cant do that the sniper will see you from accross ing town. Sneak your way through nope everyone is up to date on their eye exams youll be seen no matter what. Oh and level progression, i dont think ubiknows what that is they have horride stealth and even worse ways to defend yourself in combat.So i present to you the new assassins creed Dying simulatorBy the way im just aof littleso dont pay any attention to my rammblings.
