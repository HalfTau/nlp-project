I seriously dont know what everyone is on about. At the moment Im 7 hours into the game and havent experienced any major bugs or perfomance issues. Ive experienced a single noticable frame drop, while using eagle vision. The only bugs Ive found were minour once while parkouring, but that seems to be a recurring theme throughout the series. So far the story is alright and I really like what theyve done to the combat and customization. I like it!
