Worst Assassins Creed game i ever played. The story is not enjoyable, no twist, and no attachment with the main character. The voice actor using english accent instead of france not like AC Ezio series  Italian accent. The glitch is unbearable. It poorly optimize,  Patch update is sort of not doing any help. first AC game with good stealth mode. there is crouch button. and combat with enemy now is harder than ever.the AI attack is fast and harder to counter. and at large number it will make you cry. Lightning and Texture is beautiful. you now can start blend with people more further. so you can assassinate your target easier. better free runing control. although it still could be better, sometime it wont jump or climb down to where you want and it hard to get in through window fast..
