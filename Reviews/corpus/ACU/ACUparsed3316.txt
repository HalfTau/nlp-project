I love all the assassins creed games, some more then others but there all pretty good. I had a xbox but swiched to pc a while ago. There are a lot of games for pc and very good gave devs, but ubisoft is not doing a good job... There games are not optomized and run like a piece of.. I always give them the benifit of the dought but now i am not getting ANY of their games unless i know i can run it and its not a  port... cough cough watch dogs cough cough assassins creed
