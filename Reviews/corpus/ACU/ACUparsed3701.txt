So Ive read a great deal of the negative reviews in regards to this game and well I bought and downloaded the game Anyways. There are indeed bugs that need to be worked out included crashing every so often but I still enjoyed this game. Im not saying that the existing problems can be ignored, instead Im just saying that this game is fun. Sounds simple, sorry if Im not tech talking it out with all the tech slang but yeah the graphics look awesome and the gameplay is awesome as well. Yes it crashes on me every so often but then I just restart the game and there ya go. The game auto saves so you dont lose much other then a few mins here and there. Go have a smoke or use the bathroom. The game is far from problem free but its enjoyable at least to me. So yeah I recommend it. I hope ubi fixes the problems soon so that they can stop getting these negative reviews.
