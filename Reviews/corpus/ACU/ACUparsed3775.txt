I have had so many save problems, so many random glitches, and so many errors while playing through this game.That being said, I will happily replay the story line just because the improvements they have made on previous AC games is huge. The freerunning is stellar compared to the last releases i had too many issues with black flag, the graphics are amazing, as always, and the storylines are actually well done  yes both main and side quests.Good Job!
