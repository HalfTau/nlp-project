One of the things I liked best about the Assassins Creed games is the combat. I really liked being on a killing spree of awesomeness. Its one of the reasons I have most of the games, but now that its ruined... I hate this game, really.The combat might be harder, yes. I am not against that, but the problem is that I cant survive fights properly anymore. If I end up in a fight with more than 1 guy, I either die, end up almost dead, or I have to flee. This game is not fun. The only thing fun I think is the stealth and parkour... Which is in every other AC game.
