Been a big fan of the AC series but this game is simply unplayable for PC. Terrible port..  Frame rate is bad even on medium/low settings on a good machine. Even on low the game hiccups occasionally... Nothing like running away from someone only to have the game skip and suddenly you are facing the wrong direction.VERY disappointing experience overall. It is unlikely I will be buying another AC game.
