Game opened on my PC, kinda. Played at a playable but low framerate despite bringing all settings down. And then I tried to stream it... what a disaster. Ive played FMV games from the early 90s that played nicer with OBS than this game. Big fail for Ubisoft. I hope I can track a decent copy of this on console to at least complete my playthrough. If you arent a completionist like me, skip this. Either way, skip the PC port.Edit Playing on PS4. Runs better but still filled with tons of bugs. Not just fun bugs either, bugs that cause missions restarts. However, if you can get beyond that. The story and world is probably the most immersive of the series Ive played so far. The customization options for the character are very cool too.However, they decided to remove the ability to pet dogs in this version. Not sure why. Negative review stands. PC port still stinks too.
