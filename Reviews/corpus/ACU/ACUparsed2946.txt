I love AC, and I love the series... but this game was extremely buggy and was not patched as quickly as I thought. I still have frame rate issues, and the dead kings dlc refuses to load for me, forcing me to watch people on YouTube play it so I can understand the storyline.Please fix this game, Ubisoft. I love the older ACs, but this game does not live up to their standards...
