Dissapointed is what comes to mind when I play this game.Besides the various technical problems that everyone has been talking about for days, the gameplay hasnt really changed for the better, it just doesnt have that quick kill streaks we are so accustomed to in the series. The missions are okay with a few of them being more chores then missons. Micro Transactions are a terrible idea for this game. This is a single player game and the microtransactions essentially buy you power This demerits many of the activities in the game. All those missions you would play just to get more ingame coin is now rendered useless if you could just buy it.I have always played assassins creed games but this is the first one where I didnt wish to continue playing after the first week.
