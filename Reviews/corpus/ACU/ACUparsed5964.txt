I love the Assassins Creed series, but this game was pretty much the worst. First off i couldnt get a start screen to fix lag issues which is weird cause my computer is great it threw mw into the game without being able to fix anything. Then when i got a options screen it had a bright white light the made it impossible to see the settings. I assume these will be fixed in the near future, because i wanna enjoy this game.
