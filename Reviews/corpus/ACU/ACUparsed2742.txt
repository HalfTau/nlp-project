From many people Ive gotten mix reviews, from my play through I thought the story was good and the coop was well made. I got it for the coop but ended up playing the story as well. Im a big fan of the Assassins Creed games and I would recommend this for others that do as well. I will say the story was a bit easy and for me short though but over all still a good game and fun to mess around with friends.
