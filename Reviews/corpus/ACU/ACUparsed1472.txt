PROSSuch a beautiful game!Runs very nicely on my 980 Ti at Ultra settings.Same combat style that I enjoy, a few things are tweaked. some may notCONSStory is so generic, get bored after an hour of playing.You dont connect with the main character! Such a negative imo.Missions are all very similar. If you enjoy ACs parkour the most, then expect to be doing it at least 90 percent of the time.Still kind of buggy.Is this game currently worth purchasing at full price?No.Is this game a game I can invest upwards of 100 hours into?No. Even if you attempt to get all the collectables in the game, youll probably get a max of 50 hours into it, and be done with it forever.Is this game easily replayable?No. Story is very mediocre as is, and as I said earlier, you cant connect with the main character even at his highest/lowest points in the story because they made him so unlikable...Is this game reccommended?Yes, and no. If you are considering paying full price for this game, then you may be dissappointed.Wait until its on sale, then you can really appreciate the game, and not feel like youve been stolen from.
