So I just purchased a new Alienware Aurora... Just wanted to point out that this has the best specs Alienwares offer. I spent over 4000.00 on it.. I downloaded AC Unity within two hours, go to play the game. It glitches... Horribly.. I turn it to the lowest possible graphic settings... It still glitches. Horribly.. If my new alienware cant run this game properly how the heck do you expect other normal pcs too? I do appreciate the attention to detail given in this game. The palaces and estates are beautiful, and make everything realistic. However, for its beauty you must deal with lagging, horrible lagging. I honestly have to say this was a waste of my 60.00.............. I havent been able to play this fking game since Patch 1. Patch 5 is out and still cant play it.. Crashes on start up... Fk you Ubisoft..
