Comparing with Nier, Ubi didnt get what it deserved.If to be judged by me, this is among the Top 3 Open world games.A big recommand for the nicely designed open world and Ubisofts great effort after the game released.While speaking of weakness in this game, is there somebody like me hating to be a nerdy neet the initiate instead of a hero like regular stories? Being nobody doesnt make it more realistic than being a hero in these Storytelling Singleplayer Games.Anyways, a thumb up, Ubisoft, please keep up!
