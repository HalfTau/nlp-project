I got this game once Ubisoft fixed all of the major game bugs. It now works just as good as any other Assassins Creed game. They all have their fair share of bugs, and this one still has some minor glitches, but nothing serious. I have a gtx 770 and have to run the game on mediumhigh to get 60fps. Even when I bump it all up to max, I can hardly tell the difference, and is not worth the huge frame drop. The story is a little bit shallow, in that I really dont fully understand what is going on. I am currently on secquene 8 and the story is finally getting decent. There are a ton of collectibles dont waste your time with them because they dont enhance the game at all. If you can get the game on a sale, totally go for it if you like AC games. Full price? not so much.
