Unity was my first AC game and I purchased and played it right at its release, so Im partial to it.  I played AC Rogue next, also at its release, then just recently started and finished Black Flag.  I love the stories of each and they all rate and easy 9 out of 10 but its my personal oppinion that Unity will always be at least 1 decimal higher.  I like the armor craft better in Unity also.  Ive just recently started a new play of Rogue because I want to keep AC fresh since Syndicate is released  on PC next week and Ive played through Unity  at least 3 times and BF and Rogue only once.  So basically what my point of this review is...is...dont NOT play Unity because of reading mixed reviews because in the end its still an AC game with a good story and pretty much the same type of play style....just no boat to sail, but a huge.....huge...city.
