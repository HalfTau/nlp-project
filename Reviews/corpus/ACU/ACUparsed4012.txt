All Im going to say is...  Since release there have been 4 patches, that have fixed roughly nothing for the stability or quality of game play. IF Ubisoft can get their act together, and get the game patched, Unity will be a great game... But as it stands, I dont think anyone at Ubisoft has even tried to play this game on PC, even their testers..If youd like to buy a game that has been released, but is the quality of an Early Access Alpha or Beta...Then this is the game for you..As it stands, I can not recommend this game, however  based on its Potential I would recommend it in maybe 6 months. As we all know though, 6 months is a long time for a game to survive..
