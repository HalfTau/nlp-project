ok, calm down everybody and read this one please.If youre an Assassins Creed fan I think you should still buy the game, but you have to set your mind differently. I could go through the whole BUGS and LAGGY VIDEO experience, I played with some garbage equipment games that were ABSOLUTE MADNESS to be played on my previous pcs so I have been kind of satisfied with some of the visuals Paris is awesome guess they did a really awesome job since I am from ROME and AC Brotherhood was BS in a matter of distance between places and all of that, I mean, they made FING ROME look like the one in NY state the parkour is pretty cool, new and more fluid AND BELIEVABLE moves have been added to the gameplay. NOW THO. The storyline. Im not gonna spoil anything about the finale, but the story was VERY disappointing. It goes NOWHERE and people who are getting mad at ubisoft to CHANGE the finale, they are doing it for the WRONG REASONS and they are casual gamers, basically the people who make thishappen, always concerned about GRAPHICS and STUPID DETAILS and MY SUITS ARENT COOL ENOUGH. I hate you, you are ruining this for me, for EVERYONE. They are all concerned about NOTHING. This game is garbage because of what Ive got used to. Ubisoft, you lied to all of us, who have been following this from the start. I hope who reads this review has played the game already which I know is not really what this is meant to be for, but still... and agrees with me, watching forums and topics on the internet about this game is an entrance to the VOID of absolute NOTHINGNESS in gaming. Hope they change their course soon.
