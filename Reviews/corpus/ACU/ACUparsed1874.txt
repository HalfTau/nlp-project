Due to issues with the controls and gameplay in general this game is unplayable. It looks pretty, but when you have to reload a mission 6 times because you cant get through a door than an NPC is supposed to open for you, it really takes a lot out of the game. Issues with clipping and getting stuck in walls/furninture. Wonky controls that only pretend to understand controller input. I dont recommend this game. If you paid for it, hope you get your money back. If you didnt pay for it, I hope you feel silly for stealing a piece of crap.
