Buyers beware.I played all previous Assassins Creed titles of the main series, and liked them a lot. Thus I trusted Ubisoft to do a decent job.This game however I cannot recommend. It runs extremely poorly. Even on lowest graphics settings, I more often than not get 5 to 10 fps.Also while climbing roofs the character gets stuck frequently  which is kinda a big deal in Assassins Creed. Hence frequent reloading of the last checkpoint and losing your progress is inevitable.I would have refunded this game, but Steam is not granting a refund as I bought this game 19 days ago. If you decide to buy this game, dont let it sit on your shelf. Instead check immediately if this game runs well on your machine. Chances are it wont.
