I came this after all the terrible bugs got worked out.This was the game I got Steam for watching videos of gameplay, I envisioned myself as the Scarlet Pimpernel/a French Revolution Batman.And I loved it Paris is beautiful. Id stop mid parkour to gaze in awe at the city around me.I wish I knew French, so I could understand what all the towns people are saying.The only feature I dislike is the snipers every NPC with a gun has perfect aim.The story was neat, but the Dead Kings story doesnt really add anything to it. I wanted a bit better of a conclusion to Arnos story, but it was more like a short story that doesnt resolve anything.
