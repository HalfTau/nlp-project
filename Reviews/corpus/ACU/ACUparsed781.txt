Its actualy a good game. I was abit afraid that I might have the glitches others were talking about. But luckily I have not came by to any of that. Well its a great game for stealth lovers like me. And its also multiplayer so thats the plus point of this game. You can play coop with people around the world playing it.One more thing as far as graphics goes it looks phenomenal at high setting. Greatly appreciate this game.
