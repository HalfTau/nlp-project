Alright, here is what I have to say about this game This game is a very good one with amazing graphics. The parkour and the fighting is much smoother than in the previous AC and it is just overall better in that area. On the negative side of things, the game has  a lot of glitches and bugs that occur randomly throughout the game, mostly in multiplayer for me. It is also usually the same bugs that happen to me during parkour and fighting. Now... about the currency in this game, it is really easy to get, and I mean so easy it is TOO easy to get. I currently have 11 hours on the game and I already have full legendary gear with half of it upgraded, 0 spent. I did this by doing multiplayer missions with others. Get your self a good team and your good to go. Keep in mind I did the beginning of the campaign and stopped the second I got the base assassin outfit which is a solid 1 hour of gameplay. Overall this game is really fun, has great graphics but has bugs and is easy to gear all out in the beginning.
