I have played all of the Assassins Creed games Black Flag my favourite. I left off buying Unity when I heard about the terrible issues on release, but then it came up on a Steam sale, so ...The graphics are very good,I havent witnessed very many of the hideous comical bugs that caused so much hilarity bit disappointed about that, actually.The street life of Paris is fantastic  maybe its a bit tame for what I was expecting. Or maybe Im a bit bloodyminded.The story is more engaging than I thought it would be but not all that great.Some of the side missions are very amusing.The worst problem is the controlsArno sticks to the most inappropriate bits of game furniture a longstanding problem inCreed, and seemingly worse than ever in Unity,He very often chooses bizarre climbing routes  it feels like hes actively trying to resist the players control. Which is creepy, if you think about it too much.I also spend a lot of time desperately trying to cancel some useless action Ive somehow triggered, like reloading midmelee.Very often, he dodges around the route I actually want him to take  its can be like threading a needle while drunk.And the cover mechanic is awful  its not at all smooth or reliable.Combat is... different. Arno certainly isnt as deadly as his predecessors, or at least not under my control. Its a lot harder to fend off a large crowd of enemies in this game.Overall though... worth buying on sale. But be prepared to swear at Arno and his antics.
