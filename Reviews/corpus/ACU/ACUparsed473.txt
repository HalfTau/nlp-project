I wanted to like this game so that I could play it with a friend of mine, but alas, the few hours I played it proved that that was not going to happen.After spending a great deal of time trying to get past the splash screen, I found out that the game isnt very fond of running from any other location than the C Drive. Apparently this is a common problem with Ubisoft games, which can be problematic when a single game occupies one third of my SSD. Nevertheless, I managed to make room for it, and set out to try it.In the few hours I played this thing, I encountered way too many bugs for my liking, such as invisible enemies, not being able to attack or press the E button, my friend becoming stuck in nothing, NPCs glitching through the floor and taking damage from nothing. Though I wouldnt insist that the latter wasnt due to me not paying attention.With this many bugs only a few hours into the game, I simply cannot recommend it, regardless of how pretty it might look, how good the story might be, or how swell the gameplay might be. I might add that the story felt a bit rushed, and that the gameplay seemed very much like the other AC games, but I do not feel I got a very good insight in those parts.As a last note, Ill say that I was rather disappointed with the coop. There isnt really much to do in coop, apart from running around doing mindless combat. Both/all players will have to open the same chest and take the same collectible to get it, so you might as well do that in singleplayer. There will be a lot of waiting around otherwise. Most missions are singleplayer, meaning youll have to play the game alone to progress. The missions that arent singleplayer are repeatable quests you do to grind money. And whenever your buddies leave your game, the game will desynchronize. So if you are looking for a coop game to play with a friend, I suggest you look elsewhere.
