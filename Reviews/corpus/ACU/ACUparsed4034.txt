My first ontroduction to the AC series was the game prior to Unity, ACIV Black Flag. I loved it, and was really looking forward to Unity. Everyone is well aware now how the launch of Unity turned out, so I am not going to rehash all that in short, game ran well for a small minority, there were massive problems for everyone else. Im was in the latter group, and putting aside the myriad of bugs such as Arno getting stuck on level geometry with no way for you to move, my biggest issue was very poor performance, even with every graphical setting dialled down to the absolute lowest.Now that Patch 4 has been released the patch that was meant to focus on performance, I am still in exactly the same position. There appears to have been no performance improvements on my system whatsoever with the new patch. So, maybe one day when I buy a supercomputer, I may actually be able to properly try out the game though it will still likely be an unoptimised POS, so unlikely. I suggest avoiding it in the meantime.
