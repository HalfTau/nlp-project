Even after the releace of Patch 3, my ACU on my PC is still running like absolute CRAP! Probably about 12 FPS and about 5 on a good day. Ubisoft royaly failed on this game releace. I made a HUGE mistake buying this game for the price it is. I have always supported the AC series and loved the games, but Unity makes me doubt... I cant beleive Ubisoft was capable of such a fail. Even though they are giving everyone the DLC for free, I dont really care... I just want my 60 back. I really had my hopes up for Patch 3, but once again, Ubisoft failed deliver for the second time.Advice to Buyers and AC enthusiasts DO NOT BUY! It will most likely not work. No matter how badly you want to play this game, IT DOES NOT WORK!Patch 4 ReviewUbisoft once again promising FPS updates... no change in gameplay for me AT ALL! I played through Sequence 1 Memory 1 with great difficulty because of the lagging display and controls, but was able to figure out a few more things1. Arno gets stuck in the air when he parkours from one side of a roof to the other when he does the little jump move over the peak.2. I have to restart from my last save to get unstuck.Ubisoft, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR ASSASSINS CREED GAMES, FIX THIS NOW!I cant stand waiting for patch after patch, rebuilding a sense of false hope the MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, my ACU MIGHT ACTUALY WORK!
