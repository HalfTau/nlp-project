2nd day of launchIm running a mac on bootcamp here and suprisingly no crashes thus far, however the graphical issues are disgusting, tooltips and UI elements turn into a Garrys Mod esque graphical mess or they become brighter then the bloody landing lights on a Boeing making the game unplayable for more than 10 minutes at a time without your eyes catching fire, this same issue of the godly light carries over to the main menu which glitches out so you have to strain to see where the hell all the options are which was 5 minutes of random clicking to find the brightness settings which were already at their lowestin summary 5/10 not meant for species with eyes
