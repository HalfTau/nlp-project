Completely unplayable. I have a completely beast gaming computer with 3 GTX 780s in SLI, and overclocked 3930k at 4.5ghz water cooled, and I cannot run this game. Its completely bad. As of right now, its definitely not worth your time or money. Please wait for Ubisoft to fix their game before you purchase. DO NOT PRE ORDER GAMES! I made a huge mistake, as I am a major fan of the series, so I considered the pre order worth it since I was bound to get the game. I regret it.Ubisoft, you have let us gamers down.
