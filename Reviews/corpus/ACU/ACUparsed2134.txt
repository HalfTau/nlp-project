I will recommend Unity only because is gorgeous and it has coop, which by the way is awesome. But oh GOD... this game, even after 1 year after its release it has so many issues badly optimized, bugs and cluncky controls. If you want to see, explore Revolutionary France you will have a blast.. one frame at a time due to a bad optimization.Assassins Creed Unity deserves a 10/10 for graphics, music and atmosphere and a 2/10 for the programing.Buy it, if it runs well keep it, if not just refund and buy it again in 2020 It will run smoothly then for sure.
