Great game with a very good story. Technically and graphically impressive. They really did a great job bringing Paris to life.That said there are some bugs and glitches. I did get stuck in a haystack, and once jumped and feel through the ground. But this was adequately few and far between to the point that it did not affect my overall experience.In general I will definately recommend this game to anyone who likes the Assassins Creed series.
