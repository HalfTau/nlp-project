I have a GTX 950 and it runs at 30 fps with vsync at 1080p and fxaa with everything else set to low.Yes the game wont run if you have a 750ti or something, so dont bother, but what I do see is this game has an atmosphere of a city that no other game has been able to match yet.Throngs of people populating the streets, its magical, you can smell the revolution in the air! For daring to go somewhere that no other dev has, I respect them. You have lifeless worlds such as the one in MSGV where they put in an open world just for the hell of it, and the really crass open world of GTA V which consists of NPCs merely walking around swearing at you.If you have the hardware for it, go for it.
