Assassins Creed used to be a great game. Now Ubisoft has turnned it into complete garbage. Broken features and a multiplayer system that doesnt work properly with no way to refund your money, Ubisoft basically jsut makes it more and more obvious every single time they release another Assassins Creed game that they just want your money. Dont be a fool. If you play the single player, play the older Assassins Creed, for the stories are no longer interesting and boring missions means you may as well just be playing the same game with slightly different mechanics the next game that make no real difference. And since multiplayer does not work for everyone on PC, it is a gamble to purchase this game. So do yourself a favor a dont purchase this game. There are tons of better games on Steam. Ubisoft just wants your money.
