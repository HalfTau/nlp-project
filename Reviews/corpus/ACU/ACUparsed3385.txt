Dont let the reviews fool you, most people get the game for a computer that cant handle it then complain about not running good, noit wont run, your pc probably isnt even close to the minimum requirements.  I have an AMD Radeon R9 270x, i can run the game at medium graphics fine, and it is playable at high setting, you just get some lag.After patch 4 the game runs way nicer than the time most of these reviews were written.So, if you a fan of the series and want another game that has a great story and nice gameplay, then I would buy this.And, just to say, the combat and free running is WAY nicer in this game than it was in the past, much more difficult combat, makes you play like an assassin, not a 1 man army like in AC4 and AC3.I give it a 7/10, for the crappy release it had at launch, but they at least the fixed it up.
