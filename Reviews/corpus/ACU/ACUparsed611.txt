this review has nothing to do with the game. I just wanted to say that i hate feminists and blm. I utterly despise when people call metalcoreand deathcore metal. Also how is system of a down not metal. Kreator is a great band. Metallica is good but overrated. Pop music is gay Thrash is the only good type of music.
