This could be the best Assassins Creed, but despite 5 patches its still filled with gameplay and movement bugs that make it uncomfortable to play.SLI is bearable and I can even push 4k with two GTX 980s if i turn off SSAO and some detail settings down, but frames can still drop at the oddest of times.Though the gameplay is fun and the story isnt too dull like the last two, its still a horrible port that crashes at totally incompetent times and has even given me a BSOD at one point. Stress tested the PC afterwords to make sure nothing was wrong, which there isnt.Havent tried/researched Syndicate yet, so i hope this was a learning experience for Ubisoft.
