So, Ive only been playing for about an hour and a half but I can already say the movement annoys me. I absoutely love the ability to run up buildings but somehow it feels so slow. Getting more into combat I was recently in a situation where I dodge roled while on a table and instead of rolling ya know... off the table, I roled to the edge and kept rolling in place allowing the enemies to easily kill me. Then to make things better the entire game crashed for the 5th time since Ive started playing it...
