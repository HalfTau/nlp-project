All the issues that were at launch are gone, The game runs smoothely for me and the controller support is really good,PositiveThe Combat system is hard to learn but it feels awesome when you learn how to do it right. And its the first time that i dont feel like  a counterattack master and i cant slay 10Million enemies only using counterattack anymore. it makes me feel more like a Assassin.Stealth is good but it sometimes gets abit cluncky but it is something that i can overlookNegative it got so much bad rap during the first months that i didnt even wanna buy it so i waited for too long and now the Online servers are almost dead, i think i got like 3 possible connections during 1516 GMT1.Over all cridict.Get it if you like AC and if you wanna heist wich isnt anything special its just a coop experience in a AC game get some friends and make them buy it either by money or force. you will definetly have some fun,
