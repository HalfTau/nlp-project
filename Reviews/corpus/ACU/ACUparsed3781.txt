Laggy to the point of unplayability.I am running with 8GB of ram and 2 crossfired R9 280xs along with a Phenom X6 1090T. Waste of 40 bucks, and 55GB of hard drive space. When, if ever, will companies such as Ubisoft and EA learn that a shoddy console port is NOT acceptable for a PC game? Not only is Ubisoft foolishly missing out on a significant amount of revenue by screwing this up  oh wait, they dont care that Imoff, and they dont even seem to notice that they are missing out. Its okay, Ill just find ways to play YOUR games without having to buy them...
