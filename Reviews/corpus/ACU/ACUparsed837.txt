This is simply one of my favourite Assassins Creed after Assassins Creed 2, though it was a disaster at the time of its release mainly on PC and that was because of its poor optimization, glitches and game breaking bugs but now its completed fixed, though I only experienced minor bugs but it was two or three times only in my entire playthrough until now.Assassins Creed Unity uses new gameplay mechanics and engine as the last time it happend was with AC 3 and infact I loved AC Unitys combat system as its kinda hard now and quite challenging and its new character revamped customization stuff is just amazing and this is what I wanted with a AC game DAnd finally Ill give some Pros  Cons of this game Its new and improved combat system is just amazing and challenging as well.Improved Character Customization, this is how it should have been in previous AC games.Paris is just Amazing! and Its just so much FUN freerunning and parkouring around Paris, I just LOVE it 3New and Improved gameplay mechanics are good and refreshing.Story is kinda okay but could have been much better, as I really liked the characters in this game.Lacks the amount of Soundtracks especially while free roam, I mean it has really nice music when it plays but it just lacks the amount, because music just changes everything and especially in AC games I LOVE soundtracks from AC2 and Brotherhood which used to play while free roaming.
