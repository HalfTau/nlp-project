This game is riddled with graphic issues, stuttering and lag.  I will post my computer specs below, but this game was released a year ago and it still has issues.  This is unacceptable for any video game, especially one that has such a rich history.  I have played every major installment of AC, my favorites being AC2, Brotherhood and revelations.  I have really enjoyed the story line, the changes they have made over the years and the innovations AC has added to the gaming landscape but this game is terrible.The story line is bland and seems more like a marketing team attempting to maximize the money they make rather than striving to make an enjoyable experience.The technical issues are horrid, do yourself a favor and Google Assassins Creed Unity issues and just watch the videos.  My machine is very powerful and I tried every fix online to fix the dropped frames and laggy interface to no avail.  To make this game even playable you have to disable your network cards so the social Ubisoft aspects do not trigger, manually modify your GFX settings outside the game I have Nvidia, not sure about others but after reading reviews online this seems like an issue for all PC gamers, and use specific drivers.If you have enjoyed the AC series up to this point do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE GAME!!!I personally have decided to never buy another AC game again.As promised here are my PC specs.i72600K CPU  3.4 GHz2 Nvidia GeForce GTX 560TI cards running in SLI16 GB DDR3OCZVertex4 SSD Primary  Running Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 not that it matters but my rating is 7.6 / 7.9OCZVertex2 SSD PC Game storagePlease do NOT waste your money  if you are new to AC play AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations, AC3 or Blacksails!!If this PC cannot run this game it is not the hardwares fault  its the software
