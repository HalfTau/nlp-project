Pluses1 Next get graphics and animation2 New awesome parkour3 Challenging gameplay4 Fun coop5 Interesting side missionsOne BIG BAD minus1 The game came out in early beta stageMy hardware i5 4670k, 16 Gb RAM, GTX 780. Started playing with game version 1.1.First of all, the only reason I overlook the state of the game is that it actually feels like the first next gen game. But it is too ambitious, its trying to do so much that it fails. The development of the game had obviously started before Sony and MS shared the specs of the new consoles.So my opinion that the game really could use another 2 months of beta testing, but Ubisoft hurried and released it too soon, thats why we getting so many complaints. But, you have to admit, the post launch support has been amazing already 2 patches came out, 3rd is being worked on and they constantly provide updates about the state of these patches.A few suggestions on how I made the game run better1 Make sure you have the latest patch and drivers2 Turn off AA in game, force it through Nvidia control panel or CatalystI have around 5060 fps, game occasionally freezes for a few seconds, parkour sometimes can be funny 1 time he jumps 10 meters, next time he cant jump 2 meters, hiding in cover doesnt always work, but I think I got used to these already.
