Anyone who gave this game a thumbs down is a complete imbecile, yes it has a LOT of technical problems, but the game itself is wonderful. Ubi needs to stop rushing its developers to squeeze out a whole game in a years time, we dont need an AC every year Ubi, JUST MAKE THE DAMN GAME RIGHT, and release it when its finished!
