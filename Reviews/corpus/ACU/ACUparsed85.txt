The mixed reaction in the reviews for this game make perfect sense, as I can hardly think of a more mixed game. There are some really nice things, some not so nice things, and a lot of in between, making Unity a decent enough entry in the Assassins Creed series, but far from a must play for any particular gamer.I feel like every review I read here is either tepidly positive or tepidly negative, which makes sense. I trend more toward the positive side, as the game runs fine for me, I love the setting and scenery the one area where Ubisoft never goes wrong and the story is basically fine.Is it worth AAA prices? Probably not, no. Is it even worth the reduced price it sits at now at several years past its debut? Probably not, again. But if youve a hankering and see it on sale, give it a shot you might find yourself feeling more positive than negative about it, too.
