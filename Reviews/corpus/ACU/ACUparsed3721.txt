I have to say, I was a little weary to buy this game after some of the negative reviews.  When I first bought it, I had GTX680s.  I recently upgraded to GTX980s.  I have a friend who plays it on AMD 5870.  After a few patches the game became playable.  I have to say... playing open world coop in Assassins Creed is pretty awesome. The animations and combat is more comprehensive, but harder.  Id say if this game had no technical issue at the start it would have been deemed the best Assassins Creed.  Now that it works for me, I love it.
