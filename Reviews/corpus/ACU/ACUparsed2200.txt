Over all the game is good. But going to be brutally honest unless you have a major machine dont try playing this on PC. get it on Xbox1/PS4 Im a Xbox1 Girl  it stutters and choaks even with my graphics card and  I have the Nvidia I am and have been since the begining a lover of Assassins creed, dont get me wrong the game as a whole is great, but i think with the climate and with money being tight for most that Ubisoft was reaching too high when they set the graphics for this on PC.
