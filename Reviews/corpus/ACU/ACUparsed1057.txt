I dont get those who didnt like the combat, character,  customization and parkour.Parkour here is the smoothest and fun.Best in the series since it really allows you to take advantage of terrains.Combat is not the same since theres no killstreak stuff.So many different combos, weapons and outfits.Finally we can equip musket type rifles.You are free to aim with phantom blade,pistol or musket so it wont feel like a mmo game.Theres so many active coop players.In coop, the only thing that matters is skill.Veteran players can be easily killed, especially by musketeersYou can play in any roleStealth is always an option since we all have hidden blades.Become a sharpshooter on roof with rifles and assist your friends in crowd.Use one handed and take down guards.Use heavy weapons and handle crowds.Use pole type weapons and keep your distance safe.Gulliotine guns.InhumanAlso, protagonist is a funny and lively person.Got a serious side too but not odd.The only thing that you may not like about the game is the story really escalates quickly.But its not distracting and story flows well.If you got used to old fighting and parkour system, then please dont buy this game.Because you will probably die, wont even run straight and will leave a bad review.
