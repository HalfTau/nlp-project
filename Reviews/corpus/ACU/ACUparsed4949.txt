The reason I do not recomend this game is all of the issues that it has. Other than that, and its very short story this game has great potential. I would have rather liked to have seen it be released later, than it have all the issues. Also they really try to push the game to the max and its not worth it, it ends up just really clustered and  makes my 1200 rig push its limits  it also comes with a bunch of issues, AND it doesnt look that great and it freezes every 20 minutes.
