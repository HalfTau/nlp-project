While the Story of the game was a dissapointment, it is not without enjoyment. It was confusing, and didnt utilize the great environment it had. It barely made use of the revolution, and it made the same mistake Watch Dogs made. As confusing as it was though, there were many notable times in the story that was very exciting, and that i plan on replaying for the pure adrenaline and emotion it enduced. The overarching story behind the actions you do in the game is confusing and not very flushed out, but the individual moments you experience in the story mode are exhilerating and very enjoyable.Aside from the story the rest of the game is fantastic. The Devs put so much work into this game, you truly feel like a part of Paris when you roam the streets. The game has been fine tuned and feels very good, besides some minor glitches. There is also a ton to do outside of the story missions, so dont let that deter you from the game. Its still loads of fun.Botom Line Assassins Creed Unity is a massive game, and and enthralling experience. No other game can offer an experience like this, and it is very fun. Except that the story of the game felt like just an afterthought, which was dissapointing, but doesnt ruin the game. It is still worth playing!
