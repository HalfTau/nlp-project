This game. I enjoyed it. A lot. The story is nice. Gameplay is nice. Stealth is nice. Combat, after a few upgrades, is nice. But clubs, they are not nice. Clubss are the stupidest things in the world. I owned a club, we had won one club competition and gotten the gear assosciated with it. Suddenly, Im kicked from my own club, and the new owner is so inactive, and that he still hasnt let me back in. This happened a week ago. Speaking of which, my old club that I SHOULD BE OWNING, won the second club competition too. At this point, its guaranteed I wont get the legendary medieval set, because Ubisoft doesnt know how to make a good club or club competition mechanic. Suggestion to Ubisoft  Get rid of the clubss and competitions, and just make the game a GOOD game, without the need of 10,000 civillians standing in the middle of a street with no historical significane.
