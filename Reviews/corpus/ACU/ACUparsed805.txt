Assassins Creed Unity is like the other games but with a twist.You are able to customize your character way more than the other games could offer. This includes colors, hoods, belts, etc. While this may not be important to some, it sure can be immersive if one chooses to play that way.One other cool feature is the outfits system. This allows you to unlock classic outfits from the previous games, as well as never before seen outfits. All in all, the customization is great.One new feature is coop. In this mode you play through a certain mission with another player, and you two must work together to complete it. This can give you the chance to show off your master assassin skills to other players. Not only that, but show off your cool assassin outfit that you customized. The coop is very fun and very immersive.Now to everything else... well unless you havent played any other games in the series, its the same deal. Aside from the story, everything feels the same in some sort of way. It feels kinda monotnous to the rest of the games. I cant really explain it, just trust me when I say its pulling a call of duty move. COD move is where each game is basically the same with few minor adjustmentsI do reccomend Assassins Creed Unity, it is very fun and the new features really bring out the creativity the player can utilize.
