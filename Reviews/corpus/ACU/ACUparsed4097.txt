I am a AC fan since the 1st AC on PS3 and I bought every AC game on PS3 and PC. I preordered the gold version long ago. Till now, I have only played this game for less than 10 hours this game wastes your time, your money, your passion, your expectation. The graphic became worse after patches, the bug are still there.I am also a core fan for many other Ubi game franchise like Silent hunter, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Far Cry. However, I nearly lost my faith on Ubi despite the excellence of Far Cry 4. I think I will not preorder any Ubi games anymore. I expect Ubi can learn from this mistake and really care about the core consumers.
