TLDR If you dont mind a bit of lag, pick it up in a Steam sale, butdont buy if it isnt on sale.OverviewRating 7/10From the 2 hours I have played, I have experienced no lag,and even though the story isnt the best, still overall a fun game.StoryRating 6/10Not the best plot in the world, obviously Black Flag was the best,but still fun for just murdering people, plus multiplayer, right?MechanicsNo rating here, because my opinion is probably wrong becausemy favorite game of all time is Galaga.Opinions on the lagI didnt see any lag, but that is probably because I have a beefy computer.Summary of the reviewGood game to pick up during a sale, but would not reccomend playing full price.Also keep in mind you may experience lag,but it is a pretty fun game.If your computer cant run the game,than I reccomend getting Black Flag.Or Galaga. Galaga is always fun.
