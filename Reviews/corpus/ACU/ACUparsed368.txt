Ive been an assassins creed fan ever since Ezios story and let me tell you now that the story here is not as great as that. However, what I can tell you about AC Unity is that the mechanics have greatly improved. I can definitely see the story lacking, but the stealth, customization, and missions is what made the game fun for me. Finally, I can crouch!!! So far, no bugs or glitches found. Got the game on sale so id probably wait for that.TLDR  Story is lacking, but game mechanics have been greatly improved Stealth!. Also, Elise is hot Youll know what I mean.
