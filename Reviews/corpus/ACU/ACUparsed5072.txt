Honestly, this is just sad... This was one of my most anticipated games of 2014, and this... Just... UHG! Ubisoft doesnt care about PC, they are just making this for a money run of console users! DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT, buy this game until Ubisoft at least sends out a few patches and optimizes it!
