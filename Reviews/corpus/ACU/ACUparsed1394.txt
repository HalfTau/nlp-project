Underrated. Sure it was a mess at release, but it runs way better than syndicate, while having WAY better visuals. The combat actually takes some skill, not the most in gaming, but definately the most in any new AC game. Story is solid, the coop is actually funif anyone played it. If Ubisoft had not rushed this game out the door, it would have been remembered fondly. Too bad they did, which just piles on the problem that they assumed the new consoles would be more powerful and jumped the gun, but thats not really their fault. Buy it on sale, its worth it. Less busywork than syndicate and more stealth 12/10Also you can bypass the microtransactions with cheatengine btw since the main thing is grinding for money or using the mobile style currency. Just replace those values and bam, buy the upgrades with that.
