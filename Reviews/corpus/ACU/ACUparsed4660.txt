I had really good memories from this game. My best friend and I even made a meme out of it we still joke about to this day. Many people hated it, the optimization sucked, the story was sort of cliche, the online portion was kind of grindy and got old fast. Its sort of like The Division but instead its Assassins Creed. By the way, what the  is up with the accents? Its France, not Britain, jesus christ, you cant even get that right Ubishit. Cant suggest it, if you want a good laugh from an extremely flawed game, then get it when its on sale, but other then that. Dont touch it.
