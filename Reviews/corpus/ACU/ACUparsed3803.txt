What could be a great game is seriously marred by poor preformance, bugs and broken content. A signifigant portion of the game is inaccesable either from being completely deactivated, and not even attemptable, or game breaking gliches that make it incompletable. Two months after the game has been released the intitates program is disabled, the nomad portion of the game messes up saved games and cant be accessed without a smart phone app and coop missions seldom go through without someone disconnecting and resetting the mission and most undoable solo. Even if you can get the game to preform decently, the issues it has ruin the experience.
