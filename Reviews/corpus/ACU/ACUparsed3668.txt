awesome concept of a game but its not a gameafter a few months of off and on playing, waiting for them to fix it enough so that my cousin and I could play co op together, today my game was erased because of some sync issue with my cloud save.. I didnt even want to have a cloud save for my game, why the  do i need to upload my save to a cloud... what the ? !Oh people are doing things with clouds now, what can we do with a cloud, howbout we have everyones saves upload to a cloud?! thats a brilliant ing idea..Some things you dont need to upload to a god damned cloud, pictures or video.. some ing files you want your friends to download is cool but to me I can just imagine some suit walking in saying,. hey guys clouds are really cool right now is there a way we can impliment something to do with a cloud into our game? yeah we can implement it into player save data so somehow therecan get erased!my cousin still crashes when he goes into equipment menus..Im mad at myself for wasting money on this game and talking my cousin into getting it for an assassins creed co op experience weve been waiting for...I only wish there was a way to get our money back.. this is the worst experience ive had with a game in a long timefinish yourubisoft
