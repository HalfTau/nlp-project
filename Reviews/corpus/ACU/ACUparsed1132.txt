its a shame this absolutely had the potential to blow every other entry in the series out of the water. too bad its broken, unoptimized, and buggy. so much so that it completely destroys the experience. its ironic that dying is called desynchronizing because desync is a huge issue in coop, not only the person who joins but everyone will be affected. speaking of which, coop! finally right? well... when it works its a great time but it rarely ever does. more often than not youll be fighting the controls just to get arno to do what you want him to. also combat, again fun when it works but often s over the players. instadeath, ignoring parries, teleporting enemies, unity has it all. whats most disappointing is the amount of detail put into the world, revolutionary france is beautifully realized and covered in detail, but unfortunately you wont see much of this detail because youll have to throw the texture level down to nothing to get a playable framerate.if you really want it get it on sale dont spend more than 18ish
