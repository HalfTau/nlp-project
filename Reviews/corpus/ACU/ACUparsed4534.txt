Was very buggy at first but updated my AMD drivers and now it works fine at almost max settings at a playable frame rate 45. I have had a few glitches but luckily the game saves regularily enough that nothing has ever been lost. To get better frame rates, try playing in windowless border mode. I know this will disable crossfire, but SLI will still work. As far as the actualy game goes, it is another assassins creed. If you liked the game play of black flag, and the atmosphere of 2, you will like unity. So many side mission, customization is cool,  free running is the best its ever been. I do hate the need for the companion app and use of initiates. BUT srsly, its awesome.SpecsCPU intel i5 2500kMobo Asus Z77 VGPU radeon 7970 i have 2, but cross fire disabled in window mode16 gbs of corsair 1600 Mhz RamHDD Seagate barricuda 2 TB
