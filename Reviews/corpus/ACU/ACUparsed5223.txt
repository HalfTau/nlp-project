EVERYONE QUIT YOUR ING! This Game is REVOLUTIONARY haha get it...? Ok back to what i was saying, Yes this game has its ups and downs but this game is amazing. The gameplay is truely fun if you can run it. BE AWARE this game is a hard run so those of you without a half decent CPU you may stutter like the fat kid in Billy Madison. TA TA TODAY JUNIOR is the day you should buy this game is you can because if you can run it you are in for a blast.Pros1 Stunning Graphics Even at medium you will cry at how good it looks2 Great Characters Arno is very smart, Funny  and overall a very well portrayed character3 Amazing Gameplay and map  The map is very large and crowded but it makes the game realistic with all the AI4 Good Strong Assassins creed storyline  This game series has been known for always telling you well written bedtime storiesCons1 There are a few bugs but they will be fixed as soon as ubisoft can they are constantly working on this great game2 At first this game wants to make you want to go into that corner you love so much and cry because of the new combat system and how hard it is to kill things, but when you master the arts of being an assassin you will find yourself just roaming around being batman and trying to find some french criminals to kill.Overall i give this game a 8.5/10 thats just beacuse of the bugs but they will be fixed soon!
