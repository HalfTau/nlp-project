8/9 got Napoleons fiance to cheat on him with his second in command.In all seriousness though, Assassins Creed Unity is a pretty solid game. The scenery of 18th century France is absolutely stunning, the openworld map is massive, and the amount of optional quests and collectibles will keep you busy for many hours once you finish the rather short main story. In addition, the amount of customization options for Arnos gear and weaponry is virtually endless compared to some of the other flagship AC games only played the first two prior to Unity, dont hate me plz. Since the game has been out for a while and gotten its due care through patches and whatnot, most of the glitches and stability issues in the game are nowhere to be seen, aside from the odd person dropping in from the sky, which honestly is more funny than concerning. As long as you meet the minimum requirements, youll be abe to run the game just fine just dont try to be overzealous and run things at max if you dont have the hardware to support it.My only gripe with the game is the story itself. Having only played the first two AC games prior to this one as mentioned above, I felt like a good deal of the story borrowed heavily from the plot of AC 2, in that both Ezio and Arno lost their fathers and found out that theyre part of the Brotherhood, then set out on an epic quest to seek out and end the life of those who were responsible. In addition, it was rather disheartening to see Arnos feelings for Elise take precedence over the creeds values, to the point that I felt like I was watching an 18th century rendition of the Star Wars prequels, the only difference being that Arno doesnt lose his limbs and get locked into a life supporting suit.All in all, the game is great and worth the buy solely for the sheer amount of content in the game. If youre only interested in the story however, Id recommend waiting to buy the game until its on sale, as its rather short and youd likely find it hard to justify a 40 price tag for a story that takes less than 20 hours to complete.
