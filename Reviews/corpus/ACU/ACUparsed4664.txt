The Game is horribly buggy and glitched mainly online multiplayer but honestly the story is pretty good the game does a good job at not being too repetative like its previous games even tho i love all of them. Anyone ing about historical accuracy is stupid, who gives a diddle about accuracy in a video game, if you want accuracy go watch the freaking discovery channel or something, keep realisim out of my games....Multiplayer is nearly unplayable at thsi moment with soooo many bugs and AI poorly scripted, whenever it is finally patched this game will be 100 worth the buy, it will most likly get fixed but as is its not worth the buy unless u want to play for story.
