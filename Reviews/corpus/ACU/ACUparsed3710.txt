Let me first off state that I am a MASSIVE fan of this series and have played nearly every game they made. Initially I thought that people were just hating on the game because people are s. But nope. This game is so poorly optimized that its really quite embarrassing. Its choppy, randomly crashes and the resolution is basically unchageable the game set it at 1200x1000 or something like that while my monitor is more around 3000x1800. I regret to say that I am very dissappointed in this game. If/when it actually gets optimized for pc, I will play it any no doubt love it, but until then, its going to be sitting there gathering dust.
