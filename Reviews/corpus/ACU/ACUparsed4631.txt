This game has been a giant disappointment. So much so that I will not be purchasing another Ubisoft title.Here are the reasons for my discontent.The game is only available to have 1 saved game. To start the game again you would have to delete the save files and start over.The number of errors I have experienced do not allow for me to play past 2 of game completion. The game then black screens corrupts save data and I have to find the save file to delete it in order to replay 2 of the game only to black screen again.The gameplay is much clunkier than Black Flag was for the amount I have had the ability to playI would recommend anyone take their 60 and hand it to a random stranger. You will receive no benefit from this action just like this game.
