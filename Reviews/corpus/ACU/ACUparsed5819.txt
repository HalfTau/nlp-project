By the first 3 hours you will have the PC controls figured out and finally be able to start customizing your character and skills! Overall a great game, with hours of gameplay. Really excited to explore the coop mode later on.Cons Very heavy on the cpu and gpu! If you dont have a good rig, you will struggle to run this game.
