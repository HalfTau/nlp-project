So I finally tried this game with an open mind, and man, I had to stop after a couple hours. My complaints arent in the glitches or technical hiccups which are still present, but rather the substance of the game itself. Im a huge AC fan, and have playted nearly every installment of the franchise, but Unity feels so tired in its execution. Plot, characters, gameplay, all feel lackluster and played out. I can see many features I enjoyed that carried over to Syndicate, but Syndicate had a much more compelling narrative, setting, and characters. I strongly believe Ubisoft needs to make ACs next installment completely different to reinvigorate what has become a worn out franchise.
