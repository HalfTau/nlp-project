The last AssCreed I enjoyed was the third. It had its problems but the story and the characters and the brutality of the combat was enough for me to keep going till the end. I even end up wanting more.Problems for me started with Black Flag. The story was too sparse and irrelevant, the levels and challenges, though the battles in the sea were cool, were too restrictive and repetitive ie kill 14 guys to continue, and I couldnt force myself to continue.Unity is kind of the same. The story is incredibly empty and uninteresting, the main protagonist is forgettable, and there is nothing to get interest on. The game looks and sound amazing no glitches for me, though the frames drop sometimes for no reason like there is some kind of memory leak but everything seems like a wasted opportunity the historical scenario is mostly used as background noise, when it should have been the main pilar of it all.I am less than 5 hours in and I have had enough. Too many games out there to waste time in something you dont enjoy. And I think I am done with the franchise for good unless Origins proves to be worthy.
