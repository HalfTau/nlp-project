I shouldnt bought this game as early as I did, seeing all of the issues it had at launch. Ive played the beginning of this game maybe eight times. Uplay is incredibly frustrating, and everytime I launch the game, it askes me if I want to use local save data, or cloud save data, but refuses to let me use either. THe fact that there is no load option doesnt help either, this might be because it just automatically starts a new game for me when it doesnt detect a save game, but this shouldnt be a problem in the first place. It hurts me to talk so much dirt on this game, because what I played I really did enjoy THE FIRST TIME. Being forced to play the same tutorial missions over and over again sucks as you can imagine. I hope Ubisoft gets it together soon because they have made some really good games in the past. I hope Ubisoft as well as other AAA companies stop releasing their games unfinnished and put more time in them.
