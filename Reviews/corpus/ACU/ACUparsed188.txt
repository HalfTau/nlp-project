Only if youre a hard core fan of the series.  Im glad I didnt pay full price for this.Its a beautifully scenic game, HOWEVER...the controls in gameplay...are basically garbage.  Playing is awkward to say the least.  I figured that given a few years since it was released, patches were bound to have fixed issues for the game...but Ubisofts last patch was in 2015 and there are still issues with it.I played Rogue right before this and this was my first Assassins Creed game off of consoles.  While using a keyboard and mouse were different, Rogue had a better feel to the controls and character response, though I could tell that wasnt responding like the previous AC games.  Not sure if some of the same development people worked on both games, but I kind of get the impression they did.Hopefully Syndicate will be better.
