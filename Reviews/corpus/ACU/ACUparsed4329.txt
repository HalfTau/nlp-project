I write very few reviews, but this is one I feel needs to be done.I consider my purchase of ACUnity a horrible mistake on my part.the game is horribly optomised even after patches, and playing on PC will often have you suffering mouse stutters and sharp jumps in orientation, spinning you too far around, these translate to crippling gameplay issues, chases are incredibly difficult when you cant even keep your target in sight, much less run in the direction you want to run due to constantly having the mouse stutter and make you look the wrong way. and this is not a hardware issue, I can run games more intense than this on higher settings and suffer fewer problems. this alone is a crippling enough issue.Graphics, for whats supposed to be next gen, are far, FAR from impressive, and the game suffers from overcrowding of lower quality models to simulate Paris everyday streetwalker, and at the end of the day it just doesnt blow me away at all. Hitman Absolution handled crowds better.gameplay innovations are incredibly limited and with the game shifting gear, Naval combat is no longer the in, and thus we lose quite a bit of fun innovation there, but lack anything up to a standard that properly replaces it.the story itself has yet to make me care about anything and next to previous games, is terribly executed  all it succeeds in doing is jarring you around and making you either even more confused with ACs continuingly more convoluted plot, or is simply charicatured with average performances and portrayal.Vote with your wallet, this game is a terrible step for the AC franchise, and this is coming from someone who even enjoyed AC3 and damn near loved every previous title, and adored black flag. yet to play rogue but I will as soon as its released for PCTake it from me, please, theres a lot other games, even Ubisoft made FC4 for instance that I would recommend money be thrown at... but this one is not one of them.
