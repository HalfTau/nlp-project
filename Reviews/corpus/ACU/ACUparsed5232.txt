First of all, let me tell you that ive played this game on both PS4 friends house and PC My gameThe difference between consoles and PC version are obvious Lagg.Some may say there are more glitches in the PC version then the console version, but that may not be true.The reason why less glitches and bugs may be encountered in consoles in comparison to PC is that most are caused by the lagg, exampleThe scale down a building pretty fast once you got the hang of the new parkour controls, when suddenly your game laggs for maybe 3 seconds. When the mists of lagg clear and youre eager to continue, you notice Arno floats midair in his gliding position, not able to move or anything. Starting Cop or fast traveling may fix this, yet if youre in the begin missions, this may turn you into a rage devil. consult a doctor before raging, tables will be flipped.A pro about the PC version is that the online experience is free of cost, in comparison to PS4 and XboxOne.Lagg doesnt occur for me most of the timesmind you that the only thing not being optimal is my vid card.making the online experience one of the best gameplay features of Unity.Just for those who would still consider buying it. I strongly suggest you dont when your pc cant handle the weight this game will bring with it. If your video card is from Nvidia, is a  generation too less and its the only thing not optimal for Unity, you might want to take the risk to try it, if youre willing to go through 30 minutes of hell first in the begin missions.Conclusion For the average old gen pc user, i dont recommend buying it. For those with a weaker vid card, im suggesting you consider well before taking the risk to try it. But a life without risk, is a life not lived.
