This game is very fun. I have enjoyed it for the many hours that I have played it. At first the game was god awful it lagged all the time, the frame rate was awful, I would fall through the world then die, and one of the best parts about the game the muliplayer didnt work! They have fixed all that well only a few things are bad Club competions work, the online mode works, and no more lagvery little now. I would recommend buying this game now because when it came out I was very upset. Since the DLCDead Kings has come out I think it makes the game more enjoyable.
