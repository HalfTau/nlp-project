DONT BUY YETOH MY GOD. When I purchased this game I assumed I had the required graphics to at least play the damn game but I was dead wrong.Ive got a NVIDIA 630 and a 680 is required, so thats my fault, but I can still play but thats where the issues come in.Starting the game off, I immedietally encountered stuttering mouses, video, and glitches abundant. Arnos hair was as long as Paris itself and glitching to vertical and horizontal position in every cutscene. I lowered it to the lowest of graphics and removed all graphical affects, and then stared at the ground and still there was an enormous amount of lag and stutter, the audio works fine, but the graphics are no fun at such a low quality and ontop of the issues. I fixed the mouse although now the mouse lags with the videoNot to mention steam should provide a refund for a game this bugged, its pratcially broken and I do wish I could send it back in, two of the hours spent in the game I have was spent trying to fix the damn graphics in the first sequence and the other hour was spent failing miserably and lagging horribly trudging through the barely playable first sequence.Other than that, the games fine.Except the fact that I occasionally Quite often Just randomly get stuck on Freerunning objects and get stuck without any ability to move, or the platform continues beyond the object and I end up runnning on air, or the hair, as I said of course, grows magnitudes larger than Rapunzels braid and decides to do the windmill when I try to play. The camera angles can get screwed up sometimes, especially in the church scene when trying to find out what that coin is, its just like in Assassins Creed 2 when in the cathedral trying to unlock Altairs armor, except worse, my camera, instead of blocking my vision, became my vision and I ended up going into the floor.I dont know if Ill ever get to play this game, or if another patch will remove the framerate issue and at least let me play it smoothly on lowest graphics No lag, no stutter, just not broken like it is then Ill be saved, but I dont know how long that will take. I was bought this game for 60 dollars, and the only way I can see a solution to the issue at the current moment is toPurchase a 680770 graphics card 200600Purchase a PS4/XBOX1  400Rebuy Assassins Creed Unity 60 Purchase membership 50Total 510.I probably screwed myself over on this part, but if a patch comes out any time soon that answers my prayers I may enjoy the next installement in the series.But please, please Ubisoft, next time you make a game, warn the players if its screwed up and you know 10 hours ban on reviews, and just release it for prevGen console as well as nextgen.I need to go cry now, but the conclusion to my review is Do not buy it, check your graphics, dont make my mistake, and wait until its fixed.
