Though there are no ship games as AC4, the improvement is significant.1. Better optimization, i7 6700hq with gtx1060 got stable 60 fps all the time, though there is unnecessary cpu usage you can forbid the game to use 2 cores and it still work good. performance is better than BugCreed4.2. Frequent stop response problem on win10 can be fixed by renaming XAudio27.dll under System 32.3. Finally, I dont have to worry about stupidly runining onto trees or boxes or walls while chasing somebody. AC4s super bad automatic actionenvironment association disappeared. Though sometimes Arno seems still like to disobey my control.4. Enemies become more simple minded, unlike AC4 where 1 enemy call a bunch of person upon seeing you, AC5 is easier.5. Graphics is grey, AC4 is more vivid,6. No bushes and flowers for me to hide, I have to run all the way.
