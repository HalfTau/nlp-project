ing Gorgeous on max settings, played for 6 hours straight. Not a single crash or gamebreaking bug, though there is bugs to be had, trust me, but with my 780ti and i5 3570k I play it on 1080p with everything on max settings except AA, for that I use FXAA. I get about 30 to 40 fps in paris. I like the story and gameplay and theton of customization, and there is always something to do or explore. I went in to it not expecting much since all the hate it got, but lets just say I was surprised. Lets just hope they patch it a bit more to get rid of the bugs and popin of props.Kinda breaks the Immersion sometimesIf you have a PC like mine or better the game will run just fine, not at 60 fps, but good enough. PS use FXAA instead of msaa, gives massive boost in framerate. Make sure to get latest driver for your GPU also.
