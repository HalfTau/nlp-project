I have a decent enough computer that can run chivalry and planet side 2 on max settings and get 60 fps. i wasent hoping to get good graphics when i got this game, i dont cair if i had to play on low, but this game looked amazing and i had to get it. and when i did i was so disapointed. The game lags like a  on lowest settings, and its not that my computer cant run it. it totaly can. i get about 10 fps playing normaly. but when i go into egal vision for whatever reason it gives me 30 fps. and thatme off becuase i know my computer can run it but ubisoft seems to be helbent on geting the worst game studio award. My suguestion, unless you have a beast of a PC and i mean like a monster pc do not get this game untell the fix their  upsx.
