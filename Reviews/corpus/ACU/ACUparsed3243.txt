well i have writen a lot about this game but ill be quick since i lost all i had write. games good, setting must have v sync on and antialiasing FXAA disabled in order to play without stuttering. DO PLAY IT, COOP is awesome and yes it was  before the patches, but now is playable and enjoyable. Thx for reading.
