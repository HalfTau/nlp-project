Aside from the utter BS of microtransactions, it is a pretty damn good game. I recommend it.I honestly dont understand all these complaints regarding performance and bugs/glitches issues, because I have been getting 30 FPS w/ vSync, and rarely any bugs/glitches thus far.Have you guys maybe considered that you dont meet the required specs, instead of just blatantly blaming Ubisoft?But at the same time, I dont mind these terrible reviews towards Ubisoft because they deserve it, but for me, only because these greedy fs implemented microtransactions into a 60 game.Dont start talking to me about it being just optional. Sit down and think about it for a minute Does this not leave any sour taste or remorse towards Ubisoft? Theyre attempting to extract more money off of you for a 60 game! My trust and love for Ubisoft is officially broken.
