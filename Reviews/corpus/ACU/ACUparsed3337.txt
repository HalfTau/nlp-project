Cant even play the game it crashes when  i start the tutorial at main menu.0/10 And its on a new computer aswell. bought it yesterday and was excited to finaly beable to pay after my old said it wasnt strong enough to handle it.GET YOURTOGETHER UBISOFT!EDIT can now play the game but many textures have a pink or purple tone to them andwhile indors im covered in a thick fog that makes it nearly impossible to se anything. thanks to this bug i cnat make it past the first real mission of the game an the screen turns completly white while indoors.EDIT2 the game now works after updating drivers and i have now played through the story and done a few sindmisions in aprox 20 hours. the story is decent but can get a little confusing at times. bot the number one complaint i have about the game is that the background npcs that doesnt speak french aswell as the main charachters speak english with what i can only describe as a brittish accent, it would hav been better if they had a french accent while speakng english.
