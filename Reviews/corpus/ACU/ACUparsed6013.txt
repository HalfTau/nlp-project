Im extemley dissapointedWhile I appreciate that Ubisoft is really trying to deliver the best quality game possible, they very much overestimated the communities general ability, computer wise.I have a slightly modded x51, and it runs pretty much everything on high settings no problem.But this game, even on its lowest possible setting was still impossible to play. I see it being amazing on console, but I dont have the money to shell out for a PS4, and I dont have the money to shell out to upgrade my GPU either, considering they cost about the same.Overall, Id say its probably amazing if your computer can handle it, but even if you meet the minimum specs, youre better off not getting it for now.Sorry Ubisoft, you gotta cater to the general populous, not the people who have 500 to drop on a new GPU.
