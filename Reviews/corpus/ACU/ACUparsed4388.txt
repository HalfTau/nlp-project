Having an almost unplayable framerate constantly or getting terrible frame drops and the game crashing almost everytime I load it up really makes me hope that this is not the path Assassins Creed is taking with their games, really dissappointed that I cant even play it and enjoy it but then again all the reviews I read said the story was pretty bad which in my opinion was always a pretty good part of the series.
