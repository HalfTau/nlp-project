i love playing assassins creed games but when i play assassins creed unity i cannot see when i enter buildings its very hazy and sometimes i cannot see at all i actually use walkthroughs to help me in missions when i cannot see, some times i fall and seem to be under the city and i crash every few minutes i can barely play, sometimes i get stuck and cannot revive others while others cannot revive me as well, its especially hard when i cannot see anything and when i need to escape the building it took me about 810 minutes to get out and the fps is not good enough but still its fun if only they can fix this problems then i will have no complains
