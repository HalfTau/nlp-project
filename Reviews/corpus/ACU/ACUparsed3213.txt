Until all the bugs and especially the framerate issues are taken care of, this game is unplayable for me. Which is sad, because I enjoyed the return to the basics that this game brought. Right now its not even playable due to the crash to desktop issues. And I dont intend to go through all those motions that Ive found as a solution. I believe that that isnt my responsibility but the developers. So Im hoping for a ton of fixes in the next patch, and hopefully that will make the game playable.Got the game working by deleting temporary files and verifying the game cache once more. However, I think I was better off when it wasnt working. I find the controls lacking in a pretty big way. The cover system is utter crap to be honest. I often find that Arno suddenly clings to a wall all of a sudden in a fight when I was trying to dodge. The new improved movement system is just as crappy if not worse than AC1. I still suffer from stuttering. Ive fallen through the world. Ive got stuck on top of boxes etc. This is a highly unfinished product. This game is NOT worth any money spent on it. I wish I could give it more thumbs down than one.
