I must say, ive had less fun playing this than ANY of the other games in this series, the AIs are too bloody overpowered and have super vision, combat feels like the terrible combat from the trash batman games, much prefered the easier combat from the previous titles. Now regarding the nonaccuring bugs people seem to complaining about, I havent encountered a single one yet. Getting funds is about as easy as trying to do calculus, and not knowing a thing about math, I remained as rich a common man, whilst all the good stuff was far from reach. The story was meh, didnt care too much about, lacked in comparison to the previous titles to say the least. All in all, this fwlt more like predecesor to Black Flag or rogue which were pretty much the same game with different story, plot, and characters. Get this game if you want, but be warned, if youre a life long fan, youll be dissapointed in some way.
