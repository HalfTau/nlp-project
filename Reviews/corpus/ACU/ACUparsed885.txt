This is the first AC game for the next gen consolesXBone and PS4. So the game looks beautiful and is a step up graphically from the previous games. They added character gear customization and alot of new weapon types which was cool.The cons are that they added alot of coop/multiplayer t. For the most part it can be ignored, but if you want all the armor and weapons, you have to grind the coop missions, which is annoying. They even added some stupid mechanics that lets you make a guild of real players, it was a waste of time on the developers part.I liked the new mechanics, the only thing that annoyed me was that they removed the mechanic that lets you whistle to get the attention of nearby enemies while you are hiding, to lure them to you. The lack of this made the hiding places worthless unless the enemys pathfinding brings them right next to your hiding place.Overall though, the game was very good looking and I enjoyed the plot. The main character was charismatic and enjoyable to play as.
