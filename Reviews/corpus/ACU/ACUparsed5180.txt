Walked in the city and saw a floating basket of cockades 10/10Ok seriously?My Girlfriend who plays this, does have the occasional CTDs and strange glitches where after a jump, her character just sticks in the air.Some issues we had while in coop, that I cant get her in my game unless i take a mission multiplay is not only about the heist and other missions, you can just roam arround doing nothing then screwing arround killing thugs etcBut i just join her game, that works, seems it has to do more with my ISP.Now my machine runs a wooping 32 GB memory, and I run a Geforce GTX 680,  but even with this beast of a machine I got, still some in game framerate of the movies kinda stutter a bit but not as much to it becoming an eyesore,  and hey you can skip the story line blah blah and just brainlesly kill stuff Yeah you will find strange things like NPCs moonwalking, strange animations,  but thats what making this game even more fun, the weird stuff like for no reason floating baskets of cockades those are some sort of french round emblems with the colors of the french flag in them  just floating in mid air see my public screenshotsI like this game and we are having fun with it, despite the occasional CTD my Girlfriend has, I personally have not crashed once with this game.  Then again im running 32GB mem and not everybody has a pc with that or more ammount of memory.I would say, its a nice game, has it nasty stuff, but ubisoft will eventually pacth them up.Mini transactions and other mediaOk there are more games involved in this, Inititates which is a website based game that weaves itself into this game, if you do stuff in inititiates and get points it enables you to open inititate chests in the game, same goes for chest you can only open after playing a mobile app game.The mini transaction is not PAY to WIN,  as you can get the same items while playing and gaining the ingame currency.  Its just a quicker way to get the best gear.ok so yeah pay to win, when this game is still new and those who spend money will have an adventage, but eventually players who dont pay to get helix points which are spend to  hack and get an upgrade on an item will catch up.You can join clubs in the game, or make your own club, later on clubs can compete with eachother for  honor or rank i guess, i dont really care about competing, but me and my GF made our own 2 man club cause we are a team and she in my player 2 This game, yeah we have fun , and that is what counts, doubt about the game cause of all the bad reviews? its simple, just dont buy and wait till its cheaper , then buy, or  ask it as a gift and who knows someone might buy it for you, ask santa ? ok going back in, playing this game not even doing missions but just me and my girl runnign arround killingis 10/10
