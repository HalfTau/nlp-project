OKAY I had a very bad experience downloading this 37 gb game, waiting over 8 hours due to my bad internet. Not only that, but after that 12 files worth another 1 gb were missing, wasting another hour of my life. And to add to this disaster, the game was very laggy, even at medium graphics, while i can run high on Blackflag. There are bugs every here or there. BUT, aside from my bad internet, the bugs are patchable, and some graphical issues can hopefully be fixed. If you can deal with all those problems, this game is going great so far. Might want to wait for some patches before buying.
