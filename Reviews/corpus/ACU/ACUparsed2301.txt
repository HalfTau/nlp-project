This game is a Steaming pile of Sht, It still has 100s of bugs even a full year after release. Combat is unreliable and unintutive and generally badly programed. Freerunning is buggy and unresponsive, I frequently find my character running in to walls instead of climbing them or jumping off buildings or getting stuck on small walls. Its nearly impossible to go through windows from the wall outside even using the build in command they have for it. There is no way to start a new game so if you come back to the game after a long time or decide you wanted to spend your Skill Points differently then tough luck. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! DONT!
