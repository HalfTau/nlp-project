I really dont see why so many people dislike this game. I have never found a bug as bad as the ones people reported, probably the worst was either a floating person, or one time a guy went to the guillatine and even though it cut his head off, he stood back up with his head still on then ran into the crowd THEN acted like the cheering crowd. But overall I loved the storyline, one of my favorite in Assassins Creed, next to AC 3. Lets go to the pros  cons.ProsGraphics are outstandingGreat storylineGood/Realistic looking combatI love Arno and Elise both, their story together I thought was quite coolLOTS of funny easter eggs includingedible cakes, A boat full of like 14 cats, gollum in french, and a man cursing in french near a dead crusade knight surrounded by chickens The all around vibe makes me feel like Im in the French RevolutionConsFramerate I do have a complaint about, it usually is around 1530 frames per second, which didnt bother me cause Im not picky, but bugs a lot of other peopleOverall I would rate this game 9/10 awesome gameScorecardNever buyNot RecommendedBuy it on saleThis is an absolute must play
