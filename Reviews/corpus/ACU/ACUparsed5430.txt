I have loved everything about the Assassins Creed series. Everything.Until now.Say what you will about the graphicla issues, I myself only had some minor lagging and some dodgy camera work.For me, it was everything else. The climbing was weird, the story was haphazard and confusing, and it overall had the pervasive feeling that the developers got lazy in setting the scene of France. For Assassins Creed II, it took some effort to create a strong sense of Renaissance Italy. But Ubisoft, being a French developer, seems to have really slacked off in creating a vibrant and exciting world. For example, I havent played much, but Im walking along the Paris streets, just unlocked free world well and truly, and I find a little quest. An unknown man tells me to steal 2 artefacts from the Notre Dame to join his cult. This cult of which I do not remember kind of a case and point right there was not explained, had zero context and value or meaning, and I was expected to just grab some valuables and hand them over to this unknown man for no apparent reason. That is not good game making. You dont assign random quests for no reason with no build upon them. What? It felt lazy the whole game felt lazy.I would rate every other Assassins Creed 9/10 or higher. Unity I would rate 4/10, or 2/10 if you were someone unlucky enough to have buggy issues.
