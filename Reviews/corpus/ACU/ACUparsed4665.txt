I wait for this game for over half a year and I must say, Im not disapoited.Is an amazing RPG wit an enormous map free to explore and with plenity of side misions, enough to take you hr hr. Plus the graphics are gorgeous.But I may say, that for the moment it has a lot of bugs and errors, for example the game crash, of you go to the blue zone.I belive through some weeks Ubisoft will launch an update that eliminate these errors.
