The games not as bad as people would have you believe. Yes, it does have its fair share of frustrating bugs and Ubisoft may have neglected to fix them, but had they been fixed this game wouldve truly been something to talk about. Being a long time fan of the series I can say its what Id of hoped for, and it does do a nice job of variation in the game both mulitplayer and single player.
