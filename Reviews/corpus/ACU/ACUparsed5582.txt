OK GUYS, guess u have read enough below my review, my laptop specs are not the best, 8970m graphics, i7 4990mq 16ram. but i am able to play many good looking games without a problem in ultrahigh settings. however, ACU s completely unplayable for me. and i mean it. the game is slideshow even if i set every single setting to the lowest possible. the framerate is no more than 30 or 25. so if u r thinking abt purchasing,  just NO!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !    ITS NOT WORKING !
