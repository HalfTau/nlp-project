Have been played this for a long time and i can be sure that this is the best game in assassins creed series about combat. The combat is fluent and smooth, can be challenging from time to time but with enough practice you can find yourself almost invincible. The combat is definetly harder than other assassins creed game but i think its the right way ubisoft chose to go.
