i bought the preorder for like 100, NEVER WORKED PERIOD!!! ubisoft and steam stole 100 frome me, and when i tried to contact steam about it i just got the run around,  from day one to now its been months and it still refuses to work even after getting a new laptop, mind you i got farcry 4 at the same time the game were released at the same time so the requirments are similar far cry runs flawlesly, creed on the other hand crashed after the loading screen for the first mission. what the actual heck im seriously un impressed since i have gotten every creed in the past /
