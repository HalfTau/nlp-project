Dodgy in its release but has slowly crawled back in my book, the visuals are stunnings, the gameplay is alright, the fighting mechanics are nothing new even though ubisoft said they were reworked... But I think they just added some new animations, over all. It feels like another Assassins Creed game, nothing groundbreaking apart from the visuals
