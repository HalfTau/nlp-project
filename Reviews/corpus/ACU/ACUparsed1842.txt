I havent finished the game yet but had to comment on the expected performances issues. I am playing this title on a MSI GT72 with 16GB of RAM and a 970M. On it, the game is smooth and doesnt chop at all. I cant tell whether it was like this from the initial release or whether the pleasant experience is the result of patches but it works well which is great because the game is as good as the other Assassins Creed titles if not prettier.
