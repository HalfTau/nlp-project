Long time fan of the assasin, but this one is the utter definition of dropped the ball.   Same old combat, same old everything really, no pirate ships, no assasin recruits, heck, even no duel hidden blades.   The only new thing in this game is coop which is more bothersome than just plain singleplayer unless you know your teammate and are on Team Speak, even then, it hardly justifies the rest of this game.   Do not bother until the price has gone down to 20 because thats all this game is worth.
