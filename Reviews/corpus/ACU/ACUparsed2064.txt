WOW WOW WOW!!!!That was my reaction upon finishing this game. I have played every assassins creed game in the series and this was by far my favorite. The reason why this game received so much hate is because of its launch, and predominantly performance issues. I dont blame people for being angry.But my god there is absolutely no reason to not try it now. The game has been updated and patched to near perfection. Throughout my entire 52 hour playthrough this was literally just completing the story and doing renovating side quests and collecting things I never got a single crash. Not one. The graphics are absolutely beautiful. The amount of work put into this game is just astounding. The most ambitious game yet.I typically dont review games, but I had to put this review out there. Please try this game. The story is great. No spoilers. And the chemistry Arno and Elise share made the game that much more enjoyable. The ending had me on the edge of my seat. Its been a while since any game has had me so actively engaged in the story. Especially an Assassins Creed game.The city of Paris is so alive with literally hundreds of NPCs walking around engaging in revolutionary activity. If you still need convincing of why to buy this game, Im not even half way through the game! I put 52 hours into the game beating the main story and a good portion of side quests and I am only 40 percent through. 40 PERCENT! The amount of content from murder mysteries, social club renovation missions, collecting the chests, and more just add so much flavor to the game and I can say with confidence that an Assassins Creed game has never been more polished and beautiful and so full of content as this one.Ill be purchasing Syndicate soon. For Now Ill be playing AC Unity if you need me.  ONE MORE ENCOURAGING NOTE YOU GET TO PLAY THROUGH FREAKING PARIS IN WW2. LIKE WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR. MACHINE GUNS AND PLANES. HOLY SH
