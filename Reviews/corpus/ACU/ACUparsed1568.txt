The game is a meh at best. While playing the previous titles I looked forward to what will happen next, this time it was not even enough to keep me awake.I am playing with everything maxed out and somehow the game looks nothing like the screenshots on the store page. Framerate drops every once in a while with seemingly no apparent reason on a GTX 980 TI. Unbelievable.
