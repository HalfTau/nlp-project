Got this game because its asassins creed. even though its not their best game by a long shotOther then that, I also wanted to see if this game could run on my old hd radeon 7950, and it did very well on high settings. If you are worried about the game not running on a low end gpu. Id say give it a try, if you have similar gpu like mine. if it doesnt work you can always get a refund They fixed a bunch of issues with this game.
