1.Optimized poorly.  Framerate is pretty bad.  There are some ways to improve it slightly but for 70 I shouldnt have to.2.Barely much mention of what I am there for.  THE ING FRENCH REVOLUTION.  Guys come on.  There is some stuff there sure but it is pretty weak.3.Uplay blows  Enough said.  We keep telling you this but  the customer right?4.Honestly the story is not that great or engaging.  It is barely enjoyable if I force myself.  Maybe if the fps wasnt so bad I would enjoy it more.  Just sayin.Dont buy this game.  Ubisoft will see the money rolling in and think it is okay to sell us this horse  They are going to have to make a pretty awesome game before I buy anything from them again.
