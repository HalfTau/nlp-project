This game has been out for months! Months! And they still have not solved the stuttering issue! I thought maybe my PC mighte handle it differently than all those poor souls in the review section... Im an idiot!If you think your PC will be different, or immune to these MASSIVE GRAPHIC ISSUES, youre wrong! The game is unplayable. What a dissapointment. So much potential, wasted on a terribly built game.JUSTDONTBUYIT!! !
