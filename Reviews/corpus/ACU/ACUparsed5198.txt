  Zotac GTX 780ti amp edition cpu i7 4790k..     . txaa  pcss . . ...  npc          1 3 . ..        ...         . . .My graphic card is Zotacs GTX 780ti amp edition and cpu is i74790k 4.0ghz4.5ghzI think my computer configuration is not bad at all.In graphic option, i turned on all the options to the Ultra high, antialiasing to TXAA and also the shadow configuration to PCSS. I can feel the frame drops frequently but not that serious that i cant play the game. I also found out that there are few NPCs who are standing in the air!!!!! not on the ground.Another problem is that when I played the coop missions, my unity game crashed 3 times within an hour.I am writing this review right after the crash of the game during coop missions.The developers have to do something about this matter soon.I guess I will buy the season pass later when they release the patch for the bug fix and the frequent frame drops.I do not recommend the game for the people who are considering the purchase of this game.I think its better they buy this game after the developers release the patch and solve those problems.It is surely not late to buy this game at that timeisnt it?
