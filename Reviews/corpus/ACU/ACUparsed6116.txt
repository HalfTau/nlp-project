This game is A very cool game with a cool story and A good installment in the Assassins Creed game franchise.... That being said the PC Version is just aweful... Glitch after Glitch and aweful Optomization.... I wouldnt recommand this game ON PC at this state Obviously this is Day 1 but come on guys.... this is still really bad even for Day 1
