If you are a die hard Assassins creed fan, go for it. I personally cannt get passed sequence 4 because i am having zero fun. The other ac games i could binge for days and days trying to unlock everything. This one i cannot even try the main story and get hooked. It may just be me but i do not like Arno. I do not like france. I think what throws me off the most is the combat system. It just seems blah. I see everyone complaining about graphics and crashing but i can play on utlra no problem and the game looks absolutely beautiful. However to me the gameplay is the est it has been in a while. It went from the original ac looking at it knowing the series would be promising, then you look at how amazing it had gotten over the years for it to just go right back to the bottom.
