If you have anything other than a monster rig, dont even think about getting this atrociously optimized game. When I booted up the game, I was getting a framerate anywhere between 2040 frames per second. After reducing the graphics settings to minimum and changing my resolution to 1280 x 720 , it increased to 3045 frames per second which is still unacceptable. However, the models all looked like playdough at this point. To top it all off, it crashed roughly every half hour. None of the online tweaks or fixes solved this problem. A terrible waste of potential given the fascinating setting. Refunded.My setup for referenceIntel I7 3770, Radeon R9 380 4GB, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB HDD.
