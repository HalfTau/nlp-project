Really glad they fixed the issiess from launchdate, i mich enjoy this game, i feel like the stealth element has been put back again, no more whistling and stabbing them 1 by one,.If you want to do things from the shadows it takes a bit of strategical thinking.Also the combat is better because the frequent use of pistols by enemies, meaning that you can no longer endless parry everything and take on a hundred men in open combat as you could in the previous few games.You do need a decent pc to play this because the population density is HUGE compared to the other games.Paris is in a state of chaos, and the people have taken it to the streets so theres huge groups of people.As for the story, its just another adventure in the AC universe, sticking to the concept that works. which is great.
