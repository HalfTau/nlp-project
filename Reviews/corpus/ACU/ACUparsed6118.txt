Ive thoroughly enjoyed what Ive played so far. I havent seen any of the MP stuff yet, but Im still having a lot of fun and the game is running semidecent on my hardware Radeon 7950 and AMD 8320 w/ 12gigs of ram. Its not as smooth as I wish it was, but I might have to consider an upgrade sooner than I thought at this rate.EDIT I upgraded to an R9 290X after playing this for a few hours and was able to run the game almost completely on ultra settings with the Nvidia exclusive stuff and Anti Aliasing turned off. The entire experience was pretty enjoyable, but the end of the game definitely turns into a downside, due to all of the missions increasing dramatically in difficulty and it being almost impossible to escape a lot of situations. If you can run it, I would recommend it, but probably not for the full 60. Maybe if it goes on sale for 30 or so. The coop is pretty fun, there are a ton of unlockables that you can earn from playing the game or buying helix points or something.Aside from the end of the game, the other complaint I would have is that occasionally when too much is going on, bugs become a lot more prevalent. My personal favorite was seeing a guard that was chasing after me somehow warp up into the sky and fall to his death. Occasionally, your character will lock up in combat or the enemy will get stuck in damage animations without actually losing any health which is a major bummer and can lead to frustrating deaths.Im hoping things get cleaned up with a few patches, but I have a feeling some of the bigger problems with the game are just coded into the engine and it might take a long time.If there were no bugs, Id give the game an 8.5/10, but as it stands, its closer to a 7. Revolutionary France sure was purdy!
