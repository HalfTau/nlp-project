Crash, crash, crash. The game will only load maybe 1 time out of every 15 attempts. If you are lucky enough to get in game, odds are its only 15 miuntes or so until you crashout of that. Brutal and shameful.Game play features are consistent with past expectations, but it is just impossible to get past the hard crashes and technical failures.ps for ubisoft  your press release about the problems is full of bs. I have a nvidia card and intel processeor, so this far more than an issue that affects certain AMD user and gpu configurations. It is an all out launch day disaster.
