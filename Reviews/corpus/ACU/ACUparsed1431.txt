Most underrated AC release due to the release backlash. And since I bought Unity 6months after release, I never had any problems with it through my playtime of the game. Story worked really well for me, one of the better AC storylines for me, and MP was kinda cool with a friend.The thing that grinds me with this game is the NPCs having British accents... really Ubi...8.5/10
