The only reason this game was hated upon was because of the bugs and glitches. But when i played this game most bugs were fixed. So there isnt anything to complain about, except the story of the game isnt very immersive. But the games beautiful grapihics and smoothness made me forget that. Id highly recommend you to buy this especially for the coop.
