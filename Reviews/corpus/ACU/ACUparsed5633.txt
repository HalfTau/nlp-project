Huge disappointment. Not only did it take forever to download onto my computer, but then it doesnt play. Its choppy, theres no start menu so that I can alter the graphics or resolution, and its gone and messed up my controller options. Dont buy it now, wait for it to either go on sale, get a price reduction, or at least give a couple months to get some updates. Or, you know, buy it for the console.
