This game have many great ideas, you can have fun with it and with friends but its still not optimised for computer event with the 4th uptdate its still laggy and crash, have a lot of bugs etc etc. Its barely playable sometimes.Ending by the game is so not optimized for computers that require big cpu and gpu witch are not and really not necessary to play the game.Edit Since game patch 5 its ok.And we can also regret that devs removed some weapons from before, you cant do fist fight or only use you blade or choose to have two swords or two blade they removed awesome finish kills from asc 3 witch were in the 4 and the game is less and less spectacular like was  combat cinematics of the 3,  characters colors are in a kind of pack etc etc so its nice to customise your hero but we are not enough free i think.The stroy disappointed me a little, i wished it was longer with more missions and a deeper story. Campaigns not bad but i wasnt expecting this. Its alongside the French revolution and not part of it while French revolution was a fight for freedom and equality. Moreover the period from the revolution to the Consullat who later became the 1st Empire could have done one of the best story ever.Its still a good/decent game. Wait for price decrease.
