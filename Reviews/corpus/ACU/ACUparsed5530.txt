Still very early in the game, so ill write an actual review on a later date when ive finished it.Id wait a couple weeks to a month before buying this game. uplay working slow, pretty buggy and all that. Also read the minimum system requirements. GTX 680 MINIMUM.Update 5/12/15When i first wrote that review i was running a gtx 680, which as i said, was minimum gfx card. Bought a gtx970, and ive finished the game now and just going to give a very quick update.Uplay is working a lot better now but you still have to use Uplay, the storyline isnt great, but i did feel the need to finish the story. There are WAAAAY too many collectables, which wouldnt be too bad, except for the fact you pretty much need to wait until your lock picking is maxed. Not too much changed in combat, they added a bunch of different weapons which in turn use different fighting styles, but i would still end up using the good ol sword most of the time. One more thing to add, there was a huge difference playing on the 970 vs the 680, definately do not recommend playing with a 680. Unless you need an excuse to get a new video card like i did.Buy this game at maybe 10 bucks, and thats assuming your system can handle it. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and go buy assassins creed black flag. Now that was a bloody AC game.
