Attention to detail. Paris looks incredible. The story was decent, not great but as expected from an assassins creed game. I love the customization they offer. Once again though, its a game while set during an age of turmoil. Would have been nice to see a less hectic paris but overall this game is great. Fun to play and LOTS to do. 7/10
