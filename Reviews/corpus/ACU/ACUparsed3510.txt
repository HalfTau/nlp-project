Got this game AFTER the major fixes and patches had been initiated.Ive played every Assassins Creed, they are my Call of Duty... They are always the same, but I love the hell out of them.Far too easy though.This one? Amazing! I havent found one single bug, the fighting is very challenging, the sidemissions are GREAT, the story is GREAT, the freerunning is fantastic and is easily fun to just run around.I like to play with almost no upgrades as it makes the game even more challenging Whereas previous series, I played with only fistsMy only gripe is that Assassins Creed developers have just given up on the very cool fighting knives. I miss them deeply, they looked fantastic... And assassins use them all the time.. So where are they?Anyway, buy this damn game. Its fantastic. 9/10 Want a 10? Gimme my damn knife back
