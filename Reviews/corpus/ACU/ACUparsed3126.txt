I hope I can be an assassin again...without getting caught on everything but an open field. Thank you for a beautiful landscape, I like assassin gameplay better, though.Update August 13th, 2016Two years...two whole years it took for this game to run for me and oh my God has the wait been worth it. THIS HAS TO BE THE IEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED AND THEY TRY SO HARD TO SELL IT OFF AS A AAA GAME.If you are looking for hours of laughter and frustation because of terrible game mechanics, horrible glitches, riduculous AI, and an overall story that is no better than Twilight. Pick this up, but please, pick it up for like 10 bucks. The indie company that made this game should really only start selling games at AAA prices when theyve learned to master mechanics and story telling. This is the worst game Ive played in years, and my goodness is it fun to laugh at.
