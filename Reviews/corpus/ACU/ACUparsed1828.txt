With each passing AC game, the limit of what the series is capable of becomes increasingly clear. The limit is AC can provide compelling worlds, but it cannot provide a natural way to explore them.This is a beautiful game. It has really exciting, mysterious, and relatable moments. Running around Paris is amazing. All other previous AC games save Revelations and Rogue, which were more about wrapping up a narrative and refinement have captured this excitement effectively, and this is the greatest strength of the series.However, the controls are dreadful. All of the combat and movement issues from previous games are amplified here. Combat is overly simplistic, unresponsive, and repetitive movement is hindered by your charater doing things you dont want him to do. People have commented on this before, and they say fix the controls. But the controls cannot be fixed for this series, short of designing the game for keyboards.The reason for this is that the game worlds are so dense, and there are so many things to do. But all of these actions have been reduced down to a few buttons that are highly contextsensitive. Frustration arises when the context assumed by the game conflicts with the context assumed by the player, meaning there are simply not enough buttons for the player to use to control his character. As these games get more complex, there are more opportunities for these frustrating moments.I guess, short of designing the games for the keyboard, another way to adjust the controls in this series is to simply the game worlds and limit movement options. But that will make the best part of the series which I mentioned above less compelling.AC is not going to get better until its design philosophy is changed, after which point it may not be AC any more.
