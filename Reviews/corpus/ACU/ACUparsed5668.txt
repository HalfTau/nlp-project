After being fed alot of great qualities in the reviews i thought maybe AC had finnaly made good for their pats washouts. Finally a fun game i could pal around with my friends and have fun handling objectives in a tactical use of teamwork. But...I was betrayed on all accounts, i cant even MAKE a friend in game, everything that has to do with online is broken or not yet implemented. This is something i would expect from a low to no budget indy company but not from a well established franchise. This seems to be another game that should go the way of FFXIV, fire all the dumb  you have now. tear the game apart and rebuild it.
