Some people experience tons of bugs, but I only fell through the world once.  I had my ESC and TAB not function correctly a few times, and a 45 times the game just stalled for 20 seconds.  I had no other issues besides that.  The game felt short compared to other assassin creed games.  Only max of 3 memories per sequence and those are short.  However, some of the sequences have been to long in the past, but a bit longer would be better.  The murder mysteries are fun and I hope they keep them for the next installment.  Although, listening to sea shanties, ramming ships, and capturing ship, in black flag, was the most fun in all the series.  I still got my monies worh.
