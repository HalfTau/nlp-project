Before I bought this game, Id read many bad reviews about this game and t.b.h. I really didnt expect much of it.Thats why I was pleasantly suprised when I played it and all this talk about gamebreaking bugs and glitches didnt appy for me. I played it untill the end and have only encoutert 3 bug, all of which were more funny than agrevating. And all of them only lastet a few seconds and were easy to fix.Now that thats out of the way, lets talk about the game... Its decent. Standart combat, meh story, good controls.I had fun.
