i purchased this game when it went 75 off and played itThe System Requirements were horrifiyingly wrong and i didnt get to play this.i spend over 2 hours trying to get to my settings and set it to low graphics and it still didnt help.I requested a refund saying that even the recommended Requirements were wrong and that i wasted 2 hrs trying to fix it.they didnt properly read my request and then denied it.It hurts, but then i pray to gaben for a refund but he takes my hand he grabs my wallet and whispers in my ear buy those keys....i use my 500 on TF2 keysit hurts, but i do it for Gabeni then got a bunch of sharp dressers with the name no refunds on games played over 2 hrsi really thought i could give this a good review despite all these comments but it really sucks... REALLY sucks
