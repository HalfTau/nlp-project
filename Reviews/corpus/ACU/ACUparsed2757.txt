On PC even now I find it is a glitchy and buggy mess. The only way I suppose play it is if 1 you had a good PC and 2 you dont connect to the internet if you arent interested in the coop as being connected causes Framerate issues as of the time of this review.The game should seem innotive. Though it really isnt. Arno is Ezio 2.0 exept Arno doesnt have to rebuild the brotherhood like Ezio did. Exept the Brotherhood seems to be contempt with waiting out the revolution while all having a circle jerk. AKA brotherhood wise not the most rich story. The Templars... Arent really fighting the Assassins, Rather with... Themselves. A lot of the parts where you are sent to more modern versions of paris make decent minigames and a break for your PC so that you give it a break in its punishment for giving you information to the NSA/FBI/CIA etc...Though I try not to give games Numerical rating as I think they are meaningless giving a number to how well I likled something but If you held up a gun to my head and forced me or worse made me play this game I would give it aInteresting concept but Id buy it on sale and not make the same mistake as myself when I bought it in 2014 for 44.99 which I learned was a ing waste of A LOT of my god damned money
