Got this to play some coop with a friend. Didnt work. The game crashed to desktop every 15 minutes with an ACU.exe has stopped responding. Ive tried everything I can to make this game work properly, every throubleshooting step possible available from Google by other people having the same problem. Nothing worked. Shame, really. Spent over 2 hours trying to fix it, constantly crashing every 15 minutes.Windows 10 64bitNvidia GTX 107032GB RAM
