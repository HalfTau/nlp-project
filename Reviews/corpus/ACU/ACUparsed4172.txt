Contrary to popular perception, this game is great. I love the animations and freerunning as it is fluid and quick. I have had almost no glitches or bugs at all so my experience has been delightful. The story is alright but what makes it really shine is the characters. Character development and interactions are pleasent to behold and I really liked Arno and Elise together. While the character interactions and development are not as on par as Black Flag and ACII, Unity still does a good job, especially in comparison to ACIII. The combat system is extremely fun and engaging and even when you have the best weapons and equipment, there still is the possiblity of dying from a couple of missteps.
