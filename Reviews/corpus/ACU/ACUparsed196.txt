Note at this moment im not entirely done with the game.I am at the Robespierre story mission which is near the end of the game.Afte all the patching this game has become excellent despite the initial shameful state it was released in.In my eyes this has become one of the best assassins creed games so far.I find the main characters likeable. Both Arno and Elise are appealing.Templars and Assassins are and I find this a plus, depicted as shades of grey with good and bad members.The story is more romantic and though a bit clich a nice take within the series itself.Content wise there is much variety and the historicity is for an Assassins Creed game good enough. The creators put much work into the game with history hidden everywhere.There is a bit of a sidequest grind but there is variation in the missions and plenty of things to collect and upgrade.PRO TIP!! !Invest heavily into your caf and the other little establishments you can purchase. Also do the missions linked to each establishment as it increases your income.Give priority to thease missions whenever you can.SPOILER!!!! SPOILER!!!!!Warning... the ending was spoiled to me ages ago and it pains to tell me that the ending is painfully bad for the main character yet again.Which makes it extra bad as Arno to me is rather normal and not that big on the Brotherhood even.He just wants a normal and happy life.UPDATE!!Bittersweet. I was surprised just how attached id gotten to Arno and Elise.I thoroughly enjoyed the game and greatly recommend it.I did have near the end 2 or 3 moments I had to restart due to a faulty quest trigger.Also I had hoped for a little bit more Napoleon Bonaparte.All in all a musthave at a discount and even worth considering at regular price.Enjoy!
