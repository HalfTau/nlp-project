I played this game over 100 hours on PS4 and loved it, it was so fun.I bought it for PC and its fcking disgusting.Ubisoft didnt care a bit to make it comfortable for PC. The menu is SHT. The camera is SLOW AS FCK as if I was using a controller,  IM NOT. Theres literally only 5 options for GRAPHICS. If you dont have a powerful PC dont buy it because its not gonna run even at the lowest graphics.I still play this on PC but I wanna destroy my keyboard every 2 minutes.
