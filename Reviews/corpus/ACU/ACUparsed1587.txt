If you die then you need to repeat several minutes of gameplay before you can reach the same point.   The scenarios are very repetitious with the same 3 guys robbing the same citizen, the same guy robbing the girl, the same missions over and over.   The use of guns by the NPCs also ruin the fun of the game because they no longer have to apprehend you.   They just pull out their gun, stand a few feet from you and fire killing you.The older games allowed you to silently kill a NPC without creating a panic.  In ACU is not possible to kill silently.  Even if you kill a NPC without any other NPCs in the area suddenly an NPC will appear and chase after you.  The NPCs instantly know you killed.. and once again they pull out a gun and start firing.There are many other issues.   For example.. Unlike previous AC games the interface / map in this one is cluttered.  I mean.. really cluttered.  Its almost painful to look at because it includes so many junk / repetitious / useless missions.
