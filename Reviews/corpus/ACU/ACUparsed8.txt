I love this game. Ive played 42 hours so far, and am only 17 complete. Theres tons to do.Why you should get this game the crowd events are especially fun, because you will just be walking in a huge crowd and all of a sudden, youll see someone getting harassed, and you can kill the baddies and save the citizen. The multiplayer is really fun, Ive never noticed any lag, and it feels really good. This might be controversial, but I love the parkour in this game. In modern ac, the buildings are much taller, and I was glad that climbing speed and jump length was increased. Plus, it looks totally bad  The runable interiors add depth to the game, and its sad that they were removed in Syndicate. The graphics still hold up to games 4 years later, which is insane. Paris is always beautiful, and its even cooler when you are sprinting and leaping through the rooftops. One of the best things this game adds is customization. You can deck out your assassin with tons of cool cloaks and hoods, and The options are super varied and cool, so you can make your assassin more personal to you. There is lots of variety with combat, because the weapons have different classes, like spears, swords, axes, hammers, guns, etc. this is one of the best implementations of combat in ac even though it isnt always smooth. You get dead kings for free!This game gets a bad rap for the glitches and bugs that were rampant at launch, but I tip my hat to Ubisoft, because the cleaned most of them up very well, which shows their dedication to the game. Plus, Arno is a great character, who deserves more than one game. Overall, it is my favorite ac game to date, and its a total steal for 20 bucks.
