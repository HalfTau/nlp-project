So far Ive played 3 hours of this game and its not that bad, especially since theyve patched it like crazy. I havent had any major fps drops like people having during the first few months. I definitely recommend having the system requirements because this game is gorgeous. So I say if you have the system requirements buy the game if its on sale. Actually this game should never cost 60 dollars considering how many issues this game had.
