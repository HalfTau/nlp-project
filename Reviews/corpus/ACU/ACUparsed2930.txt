The movement engine for this game is absolutely unbearable. I consider myself a big fan of the Assassins Creed Franchise but couldnt play past the third mission after how clunky the game felt. I will be open minded to trying future titles, as Black Flag was a breath of fresh air, but in the mean time, dont waste your time or money.
