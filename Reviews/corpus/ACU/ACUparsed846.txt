I got this game on sale it was a good game no bugs well other then 1 guy running in the wall the game was fine for me high preset 2k 50 fps it was smooth for me graphics are 20/10 great story would be a 8 maby 7/10 i will say the parkour in this is pretty crazy sense i can supper jump and my hands are on 746 shots of steroids so i can climb a building in 6 secs but its a good game the multiplayer part is good too i would rate this about a 8/10 pretty good sometimes the parkour is a little crazy though i might be in a battle then i could jump on a ledge and get shot still good game.
