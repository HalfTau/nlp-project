I dont know how to start this, the game has a good story, great new features. what could go wrong?The graphics, thats what, they arent bad, no, no. the opposite of that, its that they run terribly bad. i can run ac 4 max graphics no prob, and this? 15fps at low graphics, for once, call of duty isnt the game that lags the most, fix this ubisoft.
