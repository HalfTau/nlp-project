I really like this game. This is the first assassing creed title I have played but the game play is great. There are many missions to do and little things to keep you busy that I am still not finding a boring aspect of the game. I do run into a glitch every now and then but what game doesnt have those issues. If your rig can play it, then get it. I did have to upgrade my video card to a gtx 970 to play it but it was time for a new one. My AMD Phenon II x6 processor along with the new video card allows me to play on ultra.  Remember, video game companies always release a game before it is perfect. Us players are the best testers for the product.
