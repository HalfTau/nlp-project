Assassins Creed Unity. Named after the engine it was made in.  A good friend of mineIve played over 30 hours of this game, and I have to say its been a tough 30 hours that I couldve spent playing something else. I basically payed 60 bucks for a group of very nice screenshots. Ill be straight, this game is horrible. The things you hear about Ubisoft and AC Unity are very very true. Ive played a little bit of this game on PS4, and I have to say ANY console can run this better. Aside from the atrocious gameplay and lag, this game can be fun.Looking past the lag, the game is gorgeous. Ubisoft is sort of fixing bugs, but not the one thats keeping me from completing the game.The world Paris is massive roughly 3 times AC 4 Black Flags landmass, which is why I think the lag gets so bad. DuhThe AI is very nicely done, despite some AIs doing weird things. Just today I watched a one legged beggar make a sprint for a butchers stand, vault over a dead pig, and promptly get killed Yes, I felt pity, but I also was a little shocked at his athleticism.Visiting famous landmarks and meeting famous dead people is really, really fun. AC has always been very historically acurate, and Unity is no exception. The voice acting is excellent, which makes for a very immersive experience. However, that high ends as you exit the laggy cinematic and head into an even more laggy world. Honestly, every good thing about AC Unity is partly a bad thing.All in all, I suggest you cross Assassins Creed Unity off your list for potential purchases.One more thing I have a pretty good PC. Dont think getting yourself something better helps the lag. Youll still have to deal with bugs.
