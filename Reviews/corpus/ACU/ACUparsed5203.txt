My computer has pretty end graphics, the gameplay is nice despite the quite occasional bug, but is very choppy. I had to configure everything to the lowest to even get a decent play. Which is sad. The previous AC games I could play very well at high settings, but not this one.So, hold off until there are some patches out to fix this.Climbing is a b! BTW! In previous games you could just hop on a wall, or climb on a window. Here, no such thing... Trying to scale the church in the tutorial section is very difficult now. Which takes the fun away from all the climbing. I can see anchor points where the character could hang on to, but doesnt want? Even though its like shoulder height. Just run in the wall and jump to that point... No, doesnt work. Need to climb somewhere else first and then come back to that same point and then he can hang on it? Really, not very good!For now my recommendation is dont buy until most of the bugs are fixed. I know I regret buying it so soon.
