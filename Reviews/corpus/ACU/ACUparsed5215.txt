The game is fun and looks awesome. Everything I expected from an AC game. I know other people are complaining about bugs and framerate. I havent had any issues. I believe most people didnt look at the system requirements which are relatively high. If you dont have the hardware, youre going to have a bad time.Also, Nvidia released a driver update specifically for this game on launch day. If you dont have your driver up to date youre most likely missing out on performance enhancements that are necessary for the best experience possible.Please make sure your system has the minimum recommended requirements and the latest driver before bashing this game.Intel Core i7 3770KNvidia GTX 780 SC16GB PC3 19200 G.SKILL Trident X
