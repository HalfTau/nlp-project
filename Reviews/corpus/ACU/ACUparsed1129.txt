The only reason that this game got hate was because of the whole xbox one situation. But if you get this game on a computer, it runs almost perfectly. The only times that I ran into glitches was when climbing, and that was only twice! Once I ended up hanging in midair, and the other Arno turned into a grasshopper. But the graphics are stunning and the story is amazing. I would definately recommend this game to pc gamers!
