Are there bugs? YES!!! But does it ruin the game? NO!!! Personally I think this game is the best so far in the Assassins creed  francise, it has really good combat and at times hard for the not so experienced player, the parkour and moving around is fluid fun and a big inprovement from the previos games. I have played the third game and some of Black flag on the PS4 but this is much better in my opinion. I never played the earlier games so i can not compare them. I do think it is worth the money but not enough to buy the gold edition.
