What a ing ridiculous scenario, just a typical romance between a templar and an assassin sorry for the spoilers assassins creed franchise these days has become more like those  blockbusters from hollywood where its gorgeous but with no soul, just a ing void as a script. Shame on you whoever was the  who wrote that piece of crap! Just shame on you! Ive scene better scripts onand thats saying something...
