Ubisoft. Only I can tell you that I feel cheated by you with this game. I want my money back. I dont have any interest for playing this incomplete game. No more!!! I was just waiting for this patch with the hope that you make this game stable. But NO!!! I want my money, I dont pay 59 just for add the game to my library and leave it there and forget the terrible mistake I made to buying this product. Im not going to wait for the 5th patch to came out. I dont believe in your words anymore. Im Uninstalling this game right now or software, or demo, or whatever you want to call it. But this is any thing else bot not a game. This is a sham and a scam for all fans of the franchise Assassins Creed.
