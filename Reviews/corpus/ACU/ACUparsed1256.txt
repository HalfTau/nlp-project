So AC Unity is, for short . U cant take a human shield u need to wait way too long for good pistols and rifles and the complete movement changed. Some changings are ok and well done , but thats mostly graphical . NPCs are way too strong at the beginning so u can forget to kill a couple of them because there is always that one sniper coming out of some weird house, even there was none before , that kills u with one shot in the back even when u r full hp .... ubisoft u can do that better. hope u didnt lose too much player because of this  game
