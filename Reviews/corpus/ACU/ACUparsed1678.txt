Recently this game was at a huge discount, so I thought why not? Ive played all the previous games in the series. I admit I had low expectations, but this was a huge surprise! This has to be the best one so far still havent played AC Syndicate. Everything runs smooth like butter, with no glitches or bugs I have an old i7920, 12GB ram, GTX 970, great story, HUGE city to explore... its just fantastic. Dont pay attention to the early reviews, this game is one of the best! And I still havent had a single issue with Uplay with any Ubisoft game, I guess not everyone experience the problems that lot of people report about Uplay.
