Even on low, my gtx 760 2gb, intel 17 3.5ghz, and 12gb of ram and Im lucky to get 30fps. Oh and on the cutscenes... yeah I never get above 15fps on cut scenes. Consoles are having the ame issue, what the hell was Uibosoft thinging releasing this carp in its state? I took two days off work to be able to record and edit this crap.
