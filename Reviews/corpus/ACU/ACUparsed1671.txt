Great gameplay and plenty of things to do within the game world. Fairly decent graphics and audio. Story is lackluster and dissapointing. If picked up at a discount, this game is worth it for fans of the Assassins Creed franchise.As a side note I experienced a few bugs and performance issues but nothing major that stopped me from enjoying the game.
