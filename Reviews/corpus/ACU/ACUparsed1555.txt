A decent AC game, but definitely not the promised comeback of the series... 8.9/10.0Highlights French Revolution Paris is awesome, the city and the people. Versailles inclusion is great, as well as the time travels Arno story is fresh enough Missions try to be innovative Many interiors, with nice decorations Several things to doCriticism Engine is badly optimized, the worst in the AC series by far seems weird that Syndicate flows much better One city, no matter how big, is just one city full of blocks and occasional landmarks, more countryside would be welcome The game lacks some innovation, which is a heavy burden after so many AC games The present story is worse than ever
