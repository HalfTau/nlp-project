I am not sure how to put this but this game is simply wonderful. If you have ever played AC2 with a controller you will remember how you have to hold down the right trigger then hit i believe B, might be X though to counter an enemies attack. Well i liked that because it actually gave you a challenge when fighting. Now its like press B to counter, then X to attack. Thats way too simple. But in this game, while its still B then X, you can use the right trigger for a cool counter attack also and it just brings back the good old days of AC2. Also, the parkour is pretty sweet. Now you can parkour down and up. Getting used to it is a bit tricky. So far, i give this game a solid 7/10
