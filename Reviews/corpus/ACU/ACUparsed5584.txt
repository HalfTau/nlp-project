Great story with twists and turns at every corner it seems! Sadly at this stage the game is VERY buggy, simple things such as parkour are really hit by the bugs, at some points in the missions you need to start all over again because something is broken.That and the frame rates are pretty poor, you have to play the game on low settings just to be able to watch the cutscenes! And walking into big areas with lots of people sometimes hits on the frame rates.For people with a slow computer I wouldnt recommend buying ACU until they fix some bugs, and work on preformace a bit more.Also, you can sometimes go though walls
