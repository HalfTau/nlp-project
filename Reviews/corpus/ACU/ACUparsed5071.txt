It is a beautiful game, the fighting feels dark and gory and the story is very cool. There are some core features which are very important which are missing e.g whistling, meat shields and it can make the game awkward to play at times.Despite these things there is a massive downfall to the game right now and that is optimisation. Now obviously in the near future all these problems should/will have been fixed. But for the meantime I suggest you dont buy the game unless you PC is a beast.Overall I do believe this game is very good with just some flaws and it can sometimes get a wee bit boring but I would definitely suggest this game for anyone with a bulk build as it will most definitely be needed for this beautifully designed game. I do recommend this game, but I must say that I dont recommend this game to anyone inferior PC players and this current time is not a good time while they are still fixing things.
