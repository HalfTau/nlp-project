I love the simulation of extreme drunkenness Ubisoft has created!  Every moment of the game closely mimics the effects of advanced intoxication with the stuttering, jerky visuals, unresponsive controls, and best of all the overly helpful AI deciding that I really really want to jump up on a barrel, or climb a wall, rather than continue running away from the armed men chasing me.  Assassins Creed  This is What Being a Drunken Idiot Feels Like, is a great experience that I heartily recommend for all.  Just make sure you buy it expecting a drunk simulator if instead you expect a stealth/parkour game set in revolutionary Paris, you may be disappointed.
