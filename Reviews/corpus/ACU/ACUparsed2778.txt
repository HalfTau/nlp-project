Im extremely glad I got this on sale, because this has been one of my more disappointing purchases to date. On the lowest settings physically possible Im still experiencing sub30 fps more or less constantly Im running Intel Core i74770  3.4 GHz, GTX 645 admittedly below the minimum 680 and 8GB RAM. From what Ive played so far this is a pretty nice game, but to play it at a halfdecent speed pretty beefy hardware is necessary.With that said, I didnt have the language availability issues that other users reported all of the languages listed on this page were included ingame in my case.
