This is the first review Ive ever written after having my Steam account for years. Ive played all the Assassins Creed games as Ive been purchasing them whenever they go on sale, but I cannot recommend Unity. There is terrible lag on actions whenever keys are pressed, and moving around can easily become infuriating as Arno gets stuck on ledges, walls, and many other obstacles. I havent thrown a game controller across the room since I was a little kid but this game made me want to smash my keyboard in frustration. Ive tried multiple times to get into this game but have found the buggy movement makes it unplayable for me. Ubisoft also needs to realize that not eveyone is interested in multiplayer, and there is a decent bit of content in this game that is unavailable in single player mode. Only buy this game when it goes on sale, and be prepared for a very trying experience.
