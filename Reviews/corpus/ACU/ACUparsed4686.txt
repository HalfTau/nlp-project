You get to pay 60 to be a playtester!! Report all the bugs to Ubisoft as you find them..and dont worry thatll keep you busy for hours. The fun doesnt stop there however. How amazing is it that you get to spend even more money via microtranactions to get upgrades for the game! You want to open the chests that give you money without these microtransactions?!?!?!? that wouldnt be any fun....so in order to do that you have to play the Assassins creed mobile game on your phone...with even more microtransactions for the burning money pile!!!!!!!! !
