I assumed critics and players were being harsh on this game, but I still gave it a pass at launch. Now with Origin on the way I figured Id catch up I also hadnt played Syndicate yet. They should have ironed out the creases by now. Turns out, this game is still riddled with bugs, but honestly, I wouldnt mind if it were just a few bugs here and there. The game overall just feels very unpolished. It definitely feels like an unfinished game, many of the quests feel completely phoned in, animations are sloppy. Its just not fun. There are some good and novel bits to be sure, but its really not worth the time and the frustration, IMO. Even the story is a let down. Theres nothing that advances the overall plot of the series. Eventually I just started rushing through the main quest to just be done with it. After playing this I was really worried about Syndicate. I thought maybe taking a break from the series highlighted the flaws in the AC formula. But only 2 hours into Syndicate and the difference in quality is huge. It reaffirmed that Unity is just a bad game.tldr Skip Unity, play Syndicate.
