Best Assassins Creed by far. Imagine roaming around with your friends, doing parkour throughout France. Catching thieves, assassinating criminals, and finding treasure along the way. Like every AC game, the map is MASSIVE, except this time many of the buildings have explorable interiors. Huge crowds hinder your speed, but updates to the parkour system allow for quicker, smoother transitions between buildings. Speaking of huge crowds, the amount of enemies in certain areas can be overwhelming. Updates to the combat system make fighting just a couple of enemies much more difficult, let alone a fortress full. Buying specific armor can prepare you for the longest swordfights, or the most harrowing heists.BUT, this game is buggy as all hell. Constant crashing, friends getting stuck in the floor, falling through the floor to your death. Still worth buying.
