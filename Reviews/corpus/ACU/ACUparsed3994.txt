Although I am a Huge fan of the franchise, i must say that this game does not meet my expectations.The stroy is ok, the gameplay is ok, the characters are really great, the whole design seems good.Which brings me to my negative review. I am running a 2500  desktop PC only tower without peripheralsand I am just above average, as far asgraphics and performance is concerned. My PC was running just fine, until i installed Unity. Ram is gone crazy, PC will notstart up, overloading happens. I mean all these years how is it possible not to optimize the game.... I am really dissapointed from the developers. But we should have all been warned that apparently this is what happens when a game company publishes a game every single year. Overall I might say that if one does not have the funds to purchase or upgrade to next gen his machinery it is definite that one will not enjoy the game. It is a real Pity.
