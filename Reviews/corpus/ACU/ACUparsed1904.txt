GTX 770  Impossible to get 60 fps.Such a shame really. It would be a really amazing game if it werent for the frame rate issue and the microtransaction. I would rate it neutral because despite of the problems, it actually pretty fun. Theres so much things to do. And the assassins tradition can be felt in the game. Where you have to go through the initiation process to actually be an assassin. I really missed those feels since AC3 and Black Flag kind of having an unsuitable era and situation to held an initiation event so they kind of just go with the flow and let The Connors be assassins. 6/10 from me.103 hours and 100 sync!! And I enjoyed it.I purchased the game for half price after it was almost 1 year old, so it worked well for me. I know they should work on launch date, especially on console but as we all know Ubisoft collapsed under the pressure of annual releases in the series.Things I likedBetter ParkourAwesome graphics even though I could only acheve 40fps at bestWeapon and equipment customization, including the melee, health, and stealth boostsMurder MysteriesHelix RiftsCoop missionsMore of a focus on strategy when it comes to main missionsThings I didnt likeFight mechanics, sometimes it takes way too long to clear 10 plus guards, cant assassinate with hidden blade while theyre defenseless under a smoke bomb.Story wasnt done very welllack of performance optimizationNeeded more variety of envionmentThis game is just barely worth playing if at all. Its still glitchy, and both the economy and skillpoint system are horribly offbalance. Im about to finish the last mission and I still have several skills left to unlock and many of the best accessories remain prohibitively expensive. Unlike other installations in the series you cannot whistle to attract enemies to your cover position. The throwing and berserk knives have been replaced by wrist shooters and you can never really carry enough blades, even with the wrist upgrades. Perhaps most annoyingly the map is cluttered with way too many minimissions and collectibles to the point where they had to add filters. This game is not nearly as fun as the ones that came immediately before and after it. It may even be the worst of the entire series.I recommend this game to people who dont look for graphics but gameplay even though there are some minor Bugsgarbage, just another AC, it looks nice and stuff but its the exact same game as all the other recent ones. I regret buying this, but what can you do.....Not a bad game but could be better. This game is also optimized very poorly! !
