Short review here, but this game got a lot of flack, and I didnt understand why. Apparently, it used to be riddled with gamebreaking bugs. Im about 68 hours in, and so far, the bugs had been very few and minor, not dissimilar to AC Syndicate the only other AC game Ive played so far.In fact, as enjoyable as AC Syndicate was, the side missions feel more varied and interesting in this one. Syndicate had basically 3 kinds of sidequests repeated over and over. The main drive to complete them was just to conquer more of the city.Also, if the recorded hours are anything to go by, Unity will have given me more bang for my buck. 68 hours in, and while I seem to have completed 2/3 of the sidequests, combined with the story missions, it says Im something like 30 finished the game. I know from Syndicate that you can complete the games well under 100, so it must be charting collectables as well, but still, I feel like it has more content than Syndicate.Solid game. I wish I could rank it among all the AC games, but with only one other under my belt, I have much more to go.
