You should wait for patch 100 before playing...Good story line and characters but a very rushed game with immense performance problems, Far Cry 4 has better graphics and run smoother.EditUp to this day the game is still poorly optimized and the gameplay stands at a low point in the series.I recently got a major hardware upgrade but it still lags and while I want to finish the game it is just because I like the franchise and want to try to immerse myself in the plot, however, I may not be able to play it til the end if ubisofts crappy server keeps pluging me out of my missions while the lousy controls keep making them harder.
