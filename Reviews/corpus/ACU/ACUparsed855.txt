The game was buggy as hell, detail distance was a joke on High settings, the writing was kind of a mess, and the AI could wallhack at times despite being behind full cover i.e. out of sight.I found myself hating the game the more I played and overall, it wasnt a fun experience. ACIII was okay, Black Flag was awesome, but Unity is definitely the worst of the bunch. Not worth playing, especially since the modern period abruptly stopped as in, after the game ended, there was no closure for the modernday Assassins tracking down Germains bones. In fact, there was very little by way of the modern side of the story. I feel like you wont be missing a whole lot by skipping Unity and going straight to Syndicate.
