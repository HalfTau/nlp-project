  It has bugs and it crashes a lot  Environment and city structures are great  Nothing new in gameplay and mission types looking on past AC parts  You need overexpensive PC to play this game in high resolutionSo, If you are not lucky guy with gaming PC, I definetely not recommend you this game. There is just nothing new and inovating worth 60 euros. You should best wait for Ubisoft to get It updated and Steam to lower its prize.PS. Bugs are driving me crazy!
