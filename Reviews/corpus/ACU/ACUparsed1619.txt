This is not a bad game. Far from it, actually!! The performance issues it had at launch are gone now and it runs smoothly on my computer. The graphics are incredible, the parkour system is really fun this time around, and the assassin missions are very methodical. That being said, the story is very, VERY underwhelming and the missions just kinda string together without any real emotion to them. Arno is a likable character for the most part, definitely moreso than the likes of Connor from AC3. The upgrade system is cool and it is nice to customize your character for a change.All in all, this game is worth buying if you are a fan of the series. Newcomers might find themselves confused and frustrated, as this game gives you A LOT to do right at the start. You might feel overwhelmed at first. If you are a fan of the series, this game is worth the money, but if you are new then Id wait till its on sale.
