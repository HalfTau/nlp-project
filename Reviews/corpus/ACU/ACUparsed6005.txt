I love the AC series and have been looking forward to this game for quite some time. I have a more than decent hardware setup on my computer including the GTX760. In fact, GeForce even released a new driver update yesterday specifically for AC Unity. I cant get this game to play well even at the lowest settings. Its the choppiest game Ive ever seen and very buggy. I got stuck in a roof not ON a roof and was unable to move. I was quickly shot down. What a disappointment. Does Steam have a money back policy Im unaware of?
