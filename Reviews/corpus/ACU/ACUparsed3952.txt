Let me say first this is really poorly optimized game.Even after all the patching so far things like random lag/stuttering happen once in while when turning the camera quickly or just looking around or having afternoon walkeven with gtx980 graphics card, 3770k i7 processor overclocked to 4.3ghz and 16gb ramAfter getting familar with the controls and knowing how to prevent Arno from jumping on the walls all the timeor atleast lessit was pretty entertaining game and lots of things to do.But these annoying addon featurescompanion app,initiate are just completely useless, poor way of trying to make more content to the game, quantity doesnt equal quality.They should have really focused on properly optimizing the game and working out the bugs/glitches and leave the useless extra stuff out.Being able to play with your friends and make club is nice feature but it shouldnt be a requirement for getting the high end equipment.Another thing that bothered me and my friend after she pointed that flaw to me was the lack of french accent in the english dialog. Sure the citizens talk few lines in french but the characters you interact with speak like they were natural english speakers and not french.That would have made the feel of actually being in france more realistic.But when the npcs and arno speak almost accentles english it looses the feel.Overall it was entertaining game with lots of eyecandyfrom my experiencethat just should have been delayed to beginning of 2015 to fix most of the problems. I didnt have any crashing problems with it so i guess im just lucky.
