ACU.exe has stopped working. .... BEGIN EDIT I have now logged 0.8 hours on this game. It has crashed on me 5 times. Nothing else crashes on my computer. I play all of the AAA games at high to ultra. Its not me. Ive been through every fix Google can come up with. Ive now spent 3 hours trying to play this game, and 0.8 hours IN game, which is not to say spent playing the game, which is closer to 0.25 hours.  you ubiEND EDITDidnt even make it through the first tutorial mission. I thought I was pretty clever this time around. Waited some years to give Ubi to fix their AC game and then picked it up for 10. Guess Ill try again. At least this time having paid just 10 I was more amused at Ubi than mad.BEGIN EXTRA EDIT I cant believe I have to submit a refund request for an ubi game. 10 is so terribly trivial, but this is principle. You know theyre always bad at launch, and typically bad for a while, but this is HORRIBLE and theyve had two years. Im still amused in a sense though. Ubisoft you have truly outdone yourself. Now Im going to try to play the other AC title I picked up at the same time for another 10 and i sincerly hope it is playable. Not holding my breath.END EXTRA EDIT
