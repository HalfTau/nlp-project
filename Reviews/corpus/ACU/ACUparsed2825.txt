As someone who only bought this game due to steams new refund policy, as there are an exhorbitant number of complaints about the game, I must say, the introduction of this new policy is a great feature.The reason everyone complains is because their system cannot run this game, which is clearly ahead of its time. All things that are ahead of their time are viewed in a negative light at the time of their conception, then to be reevaluated and reappreciated over time.This game I recommend playing in French for full immersion  is sensory experience. AC Rogue, which I also and more readily had purchased, pales in comparison with this game, and is essentially a rehash of AC Black Flag, if fun in spite of that. This game by comparison seeks to delve into new territory with visuals reminiscent of cinema depicting French history, such as La Reine Margot, and flawless integration of cutscenes with playing. This game doesnt throw you into a world, in which you rummage about to entertain yourself as with almost every other game frankly, particularly in this series, but invites you visually to explore your surroundings, an enticement that is on every level of finer conception than the regurgitated title of AC Rogue.If your system can handle it, THIS is the new generation of video games that Ubisoft has to offer.update on features/ recommendationsFeaturesFirst AC to feature STEAMPUNK elementsIntegrates multiple time periodsYou have to THINK this game encourages/demands you to be creative and precise in carrying out your tasks, you are an assassin after all, not a thug.
