Ubisoft was one of my favorite gaming companies but since Watch Dogs ive been losing all hope and respect i had for them because they dont respect us, gamers aswell. Im tired of this crap. EA, Ubisoft, Activison, they all make games with only goal in their minds, that is to make money, they dont care if we have a good time playing their games, they only care about building the hype so everyone can be fooled by them, I QUIT. i wont give any more money to those greedy s, im sick of paying 70 bucks to BETA testing their games, i hope they all go bankruptcy.This game is broke is unplayable, it is frustating because it had all to be the game of the year but they messed up, AGAIN.Good day to everyone.
