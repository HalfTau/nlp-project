The game does not support laptops...the entire category of laptops is unsupported.  That doesnt make any sense.  I have a powerful laptop specifically designed for playing high intensity games and I cannot play this game for longer than 45 minutes before it crashes.  What nonsense.  I was cheated out of 60 dollars.  Boycott Ubisoft!  Do not buy any of their games anymore.  They want to discount the PC gaming community?  Let them, see how well that factors into their bottom line.
