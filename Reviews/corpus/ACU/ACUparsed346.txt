I feel like this game has been recieveing too much hate and is highly underrated. Story is pretty solid, but for sure is not a classic Assassins Creed story. The game itself works fairly well now, gfxs are done more than well, game mechanics work as they should and I am not having any problems running the game. Id give it 8/10. And would reccomend to everyone!
