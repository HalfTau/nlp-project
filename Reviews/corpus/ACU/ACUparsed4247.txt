Honestly, I havent really had any problems with this game except for crashing during multiplayer coop and massive network lag during the coops as well. Graphics are beautiful, character animation is beautiful, and there is so much to do. But it does require some hefty equipment to run it. Running on Ultra with Soft shadows and FXAA on XFX R7 260X DD Edition  1080p with steady 3560 fps with a minimum of 25 in rare occasions. But I also have a Core i5 4690K OCd to 4.7Ghz. So please use your best judgment when buying this game. Also, I am in love with all the Assassins Creed games so dont use my review as a decision making one.
