I have the game and it runs smoothly if you turn graphics to low. But when I got to the mission where you have to confront one of the councles murderers. It tells you to tape E and i taped E for about 30 mins till i got bored and stoped. But when I stoped it killed me, plus I even retried the mission after that 3 more times and it never worked.
