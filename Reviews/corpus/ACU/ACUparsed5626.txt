i have no idea what everyone is talking about with glitches and all. not sure if everyone that made a bad review is using a toater to play but im running an OC gtx 780 and vishera 8 core cpu and have 60 fps on ultra with zero glitches and the game is just great. new mechanics and talents are awesome and everything looks beautiful.
