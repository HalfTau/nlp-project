I feel so let down / cheated. The game is super sluggish and littered with bugs. I can play Watch Dogs and Far Cry 3 with virtually full settings applied and have them run smooth as silk. This monstrosity on the other hand is flat out unplayable. Unplayable at minimum settings with NVIDIAs most recent 344.65 driver. The game looks stunning, which is what breaks my heart considering the painfully low frame rates I experienced. If you have a supercomputer, congratulations, because thats what youll need to play this game the way it was meant to be experienced. What a bummer. I was really excited for this one.
