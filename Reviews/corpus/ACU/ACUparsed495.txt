Worst Assassins Creed ever, even after many updates Its still the worst especially the fighting mechanics and scenery in the game. They took everything from  Black Flag and made a game entirely opposite from it. The story wasnt appealing at all for me. Also I stopped playing after 1 hour because it crashed and I didnt had any motivation to continu with the game.
