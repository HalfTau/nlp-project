This game needs way more praise then it gets. It may of had some troubles getting off the launch pad but it flew once it was patched up. I personally havent experienced many bugs or any frames drops.To start this game got customisations right the ability to build your assassin peice by piece was spot on it also gave you the ability to have specialties. Skill trees were great too, now I actually feel like I am training for somthing and Im not a over powered baddass before I even become an assassin. The story is predictable but how ever is still well written and engaging. also multiplayer works wonderously I would like to mention is this game is alot harder meaning you cant fight half a garison alone you have to think out your moves you cant go in gunsablazin and expect to win looking at you ac3ConclusionWe should try to get this into the positive reviews section. Ubisoft did a good job on this game.
