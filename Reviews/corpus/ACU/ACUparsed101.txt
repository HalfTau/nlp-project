Pretty much one of the most boring games in the franchises thus far. To know this came after the success of Black Flag its just boring. A flat, unexplained story with dislikeable characters, repetetive action and glitches beyond reason its not worth the buy, save your money and get Black Flags DLCs.You cannot dodge bullets unlike in pratically every other AC game, so you end up getting ruined if you cant charget he person with the gun.Only good thing is it has a better story and better characters than Syndicate ever will, but a flat, boring game didnt deserve my money and wasted electricity playing it.Thanks alot Ubisoft, you cant keep success flowing can you?
