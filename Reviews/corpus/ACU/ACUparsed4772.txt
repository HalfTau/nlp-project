Not even sure where to begin.  Others have pretty much covered it all in their reviews so there is probably no point in beating that horse any more.I will say that at the moment, whether you preordered like I did or purchase it in its present state, You will essentialy be paying to BETA test this product.  If the game was in order like it should have been on release, I would have clocked in those 23.4 hrs in three days or less...Not in weeks...If you are really interested in this title, I highly suggest you wait until next year...or for when it goes on sale.Patch 3 and still has more bugs than the plagues released by Moses!!!
