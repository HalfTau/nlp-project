So almost a year after its been released, I think I can finally give an honest review that does the game justice.ProsNew combat system, which is harder and a lot more fun compared to previous titles.New stealth mode, which captures the moral of a TRUE assassin.New parkour buttons, for parkouring upwards and downwards, which make parkour so much smoother.An awesome story that occurs in the French revolution, which is personally one of my favorite historic events.A big variety of missions, collectibles and side missions that make the game more fun, so theres always what to do.An online coop system, in which you could join other players in missions that are exclusive to the online gameplay.The atmosphere is captivating and very expressive. Makes you feel like youre really in a revolution.The graphics are heavenly stunning. They give the feeling of what youd remember Paris to be like in that period of time instead of making you feel like its happening now.ConsGlitches that make the game unplayable at time. i.e. glitching through buildings or falling underground.Low frame rates. Even on a powerful computer the game still struggles to find stability.Freezing and frame drops are annoying as hell, and most of the times it makes you put your controller down and quit.Graphics glitches, which to me were minimal to nonexistent.This game is broken!It couldve been a great game, because the gameplay, atmosphere, story, mission variety, combat system, graphics and mechanics of it are almost flawless! Yet my PC runs GTAV, Far Cry 4, etc.. at 3050FPS still struggles to find out how a game with such technical flaws works, which ,for that matter, it doesnt.The frame drops, freezing, and low frame rates are disgustingly annoying, still after a year of the game being released and patched a bunch of times!Moral of the story, youd be better off playing this game on a console, since Ubisoft ed up big time on this one.Heres to the next title, and heres to hoping they get it together, technically, since they have a solid gameplay base.Good luck!
