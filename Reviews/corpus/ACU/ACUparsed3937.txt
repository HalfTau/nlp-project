Ubisoft should be ashamed of this released, this game is by far the buggiest, most poorly optimized game I have ever played, while playing I will randomly hang for around 15 seconds until the game remembers its a game and not a still picture. The best part this happens during multiplayer and thats 15 seconds of you just standing around pretty much means your dead. I have a decent i7 rig and this game still hardly ever goes above 30 fps and there is little to no impact on changing anything from low to high, ultra settings net a significant impact on fps however. This game should have baked for another 6 months shame on you Ubisoft. Coop is a mess too needs a kick function.
