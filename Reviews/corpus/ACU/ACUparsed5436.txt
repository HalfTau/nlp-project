The game has had several mess ups including but not limited to map bugs, graphical lag, failure to start, etc. I would most likely wait this out for a later date to see if patches fix the problem. Other than the lag, gamebreaking bugs, and weird glitchy things that happen its a decent game to have just a bit pricy.
