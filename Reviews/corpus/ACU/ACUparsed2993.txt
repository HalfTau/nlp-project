Well first off, lets cover the basics of why you should not waste 60 of your hard earned money on this hilariously terrible game.1. First thing i noticed right off the bat is that the game does not in any way run smoothly. All throughout my explorationns of the open world, i had many times where the FPS dropped below 20 fps for no reason. Even when i lowered my settings to the lowest setting it still occured.2. I was convinced to get this game by my brother who wanted me to play coop with him. Once i bought the game and was able to do coop missions, it was to my frustration that we could not get the connection to work. I went down the list of the FAQ and tried every solution i was able to and none of them worked.3. Uplay itself is a reason to not buy this game. I dont understand why Ubisoft had to make a wannabe steam application. Let steam do what it does best Ubisoft, stop trying to make it all your own.The only positive things i can say about this game are these1. The customization is amazing. I love being able to mix and match tons of armor and then change the color schemes of it all. A boat load of weapons to choose from as well.2. The time period the game is set in is fascinating. I just wish they hadnt made the game so terrible so i could have enjoyed it more.
