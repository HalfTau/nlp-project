This game was ok, saying it was bad is saying truth, saying it was horrible is ridiculous. This game stood out from trailers, and played in  an interesting fashion, but there are two reasons I and many others downrate this game.First GlitchesTHis game scared theout of me. Why? because there were special characters who could remove there ing facial skin!! if u keep up with the gaming press, u know what im talking about, otherwise look it upSecond MisleadingThis game was misleading not in the sense that it didnt give us what we wanted despite the fact that saying that would be very true. It was misleading because this wasnt an AC game!!! the hidden blade was not a weapon, but a literal kill animation that could no longer be used freely. Also, these games thrive on the concept of DEBATED good, over DEBATED evil, yet the templars won thisto be fair the same thing happened in AC rogue yet they did it right,All in all, dont play this game. It is the biggest failure of the AC series yet and with assassins creed 3 existing, thats saying something. If u want the best expirience out of the AC franchise, then dont play this game AT ALL.Thx for reading
