Things I like Beautiful scenery as always. Cool looking and practical equipment as before. Nice assassination tools, including the iconic hidden blades. The usual freerunning aspects of AC which make traversing more fun.Things I dislike Less tools and tricks to use than before, missing the bombs of Brotherhood, multiple weapons of 3, etc. It adds some new pieces of kit yet foolishly removes others. Helix ability to affect gameplay based on Microtransactions for REAL MONEY! Its not just cosmetic but instead causes nonpayers like me except, you know, buying the actual game like were supposed to do to forcefully grind for hours. HORRIBLE optimisation. I can barely play it on minumum settings yet many other games like Fallout 4 are fine.Overall, I would say its actually regressed from the earlier days, which is a shame considering how much promise the franchise showed. Try out some of the ones featuring Ezio Auditore 2, Revelations, Brotherhood instead, those were amazing.
