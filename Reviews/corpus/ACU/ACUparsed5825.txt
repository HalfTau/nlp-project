This game has more bugs than features...Since I have started the game I have had back to back issues and I am suprised I have put up with it for this long.  The most common is the locking up or a random black screen.  Im currently stuck in the game and have no access to my Social Club missions, they just dont show up.UPDATEI was being an idiot, there was no marker but I was able to get to it in the progress tracker.  After playing several hours of this, I think if you can look past all the issues the game is great.  I really love the skill tree, equipment upgrades and the coop aspects of the game but its just so annoying having to redo several missions because of falling through the floor into infinity.UPDATE AFTER COMPLETIONI feel the game was rather short and plagued with Fetch quests.  There are so many I litteraly spent hours just trying to clear most of them off the map.  Also I am deeply disappointed in the Chemical Revolution DLC.  The mission took me about three minutes and most of that was just running.  The only good cut scenes are in the main story line.  I didnt have to many issues after the recent patch and found the game quiet playable but I still have issues doing something as simple as jumping through a window rather than grab everything around it, drop to the floor and repeat until I manage to get through it.  Path finding just sucks...i72600K  4.2Ghz16GB DDR3 24003GB GTX 780
