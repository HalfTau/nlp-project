I was on the fence to buy this with all of the performance reviews but I am glad I did.It takes tons of cpu that is for sure. Dont know what that is all about.Runs fine on a haswell i7 4800 series with an r9 290x and the latest catalyst drivers.I did have to turn off uplay overlay and the steam overlay google them if you dont know how.I also turned off the online voice thingie from the options in the game because I have no friends. LOL.One thing for sure, and this is the same in far cry for me, when you start the game it can take forever to get past the black screen. You will think it is crashed but it is not I think this is because it is trying to connect to uplay which is totally busy and . So you just have to wait for it to either time out or get a proxy, I dont know which. Just go get coffee and a smoke and it will be running when you come back.The menus lock up on me when I change stuff but alttab into the desktop and then come back to game and they are unlocked.The game does look stunning aside from the hair being a little weird. Water is good and the clothes are like real. Faces are realistic and lips match dialog.There is now a controlled discent in free run mode that keeps you from falling and bumping into everyone when you get down so that is very cool.Just about every building is open with people who react to you.I think it is worth the money.Graphics are like 9/10Play is like an 8/10 because it is a little jerky at times and the boxes around objects are  a little too big sometimes.Sneaking is pretty cool and the AI players feel pretty lifelike.
