Even with all the bugs and crashes i decided to give the game a shot. To my suprise the crashes and bugs were not as serious as expected as well as the fps ran with a stable 35 frames with a gtx760. Yes the game does crash once in a while but if u simple just end the task  it will  relaunch just fine. Concerning the more important matters the promised amazement i sought within the new features actually exceeded  my expectations. The coop is down right fun, and the customization had me like a kid in a candy store.Rate  8/10 stars yet  once the technical issues are resloved then my new rate will be an absolute 10/10
