Beautiful game, poorly optimized.I run World of Warcraft ultra at max settings in a 40v40 pvp aoe sh!tstorm with a stable 5060 fps.I run Black Desert at max settings at 60 fps.I run Battlefield 1 at high settings and get 5060 fps.I run Assassins Creed Unity on minimum settings at 15 fps, and my computer sh!ts iself whenever I look at one of the crowds at one of the hangings.Sometimes it will randomly decide to run 60 fps, even at max settings.Game is very fun when it works, but most of the time it runs like garbage.My specs if curiousFX 6300GTX 95016g ramSolid State Drive1400x900 monitor
