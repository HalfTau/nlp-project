Okay, I will admit performance is lackluster and the game is horribly optimized, but if you get past the performance issues and the occasional glitch where the wall eats the player, youre really left with a very solid Assassins Creed game. Lots of customization, AC2esque story along with Coop, and some RPGlike features all bundled together in the wide expanses of Paris.If anything, wait a little while before picking this title up. Maybe Ubisoft will have patched some of the performance issues.
