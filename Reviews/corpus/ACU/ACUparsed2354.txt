I dont understand the mixed reviews as of now. I purchased this game last week and have played enough to see that this game is a definite purchase for the current price 40. I can honestly say I have never felt so immersed in any Assassins Creed title as I do in Unity. The mobs of angry civilians, the thugs beating upon the innocents, and the chatter in French which I am guessing is about whose mother baked who a crepe. The lighting in the game makes you appreciates the city of Paris with even more fervor. Freerunning has become more fluid than ever before, however not without a few falls and missteps of course.Free running can aggravate me at times and the overall story is lackluster in bringing anything new to the franchise so far. If you are like me and can immerse yourself in an openworld game, get this game. I have had very few bugs which correlate to the sometimes janky freerunning and batty A.I. If you are hoping that Unity will push the boundaries, try new game mechanics, and revamp their previous system from Black Flag, maybe hold on until the next Steam Sale.OVERALL, I love this game just as much as I did Black Flag, maybe even a little more PC SpecsGTX 760 4 GB GDDR5Intel i7 4770K700 Watt Supply1Tb WD Black HDD
