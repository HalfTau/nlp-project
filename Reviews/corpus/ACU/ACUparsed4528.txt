This is a great game, but it has a lot of bugs. I have walked under the world, seen people shoot up into the sy as rockets, floationg items and suddenly stopped out of nowhere. Some of the parkour is not the best at times. The story is great though. It starts you out as the adoptive son of a templar and works its way from there. The customizations are exeptional. You can customize all of your apparel and use heavy, long and short weapons.I would recommend this game, but not yet. It has some major bugs that Ubisoft has so fix as fast as possible.
