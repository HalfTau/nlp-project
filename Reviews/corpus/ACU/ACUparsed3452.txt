Do not buy this game. You will end up frustrated. I am running 4.6 4960k with GTX 980 G1. My processor utilization is 100 on 4 cores running this game.This guy even 8 core with SLI gtx 980and cannot run it with 60FPSThey claimed processor is the culprit but not when I watch the video. I am a fan of Assasins Creed, even this game if properly made is good.,I think this is the end of this franchise for me..
