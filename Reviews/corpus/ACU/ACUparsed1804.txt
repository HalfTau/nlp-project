ACU seems to gotten its share of the peverbiel torm.but i dont see why the gameplay is tight, the story might be a little dry but at least its there.also where are all these glitches and bugs i keep hearing about, i havent seen any. sure theres the one or two bug, but nothing gamebreaking like people keep saying online.the only glitch i found seemed to intentional.and just look at all costumisation options.
