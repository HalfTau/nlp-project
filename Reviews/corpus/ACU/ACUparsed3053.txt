They are working on the patches but still this really stinks. This is unacceptable they expect me to pay 60 of my hard earned cash on this! This game could have been great but they released it while it still was in beta. Ubisoft keep your games in development longer! We can wait! If any of you want this game, wait some time because it definitely needs more patches even after the 5 that it has already had. You need a GTX 980 to run the cutscenes at 30 fps some times lower. This is ridiculous! While I know this is still a very graphic intensive game Ubisoft really needs to finish their games. We had it with Watchdogs now dont make another game like this! Although this game is pretty fun in some ways despite its numerous performance issues. The game is pretty beautiful and takes a lot out of high end PCs. The consoles even had to downscale to 900p and set the graphics to medium. So if you want this game either wait till the patches are finished or just wait for the next installment in the series. I hope they use the same engine and improve on it. This will allow less bugs to occur with their aditional experience.
