I would love to give a clear and concise review as to the state of assassins creed unity. However, my high end PC is unable to even launch this game despite beings verified a thousand times over. I have looked to find I am not alone in this issue. 2 months in and the issue is still here..... how? If you plan to get this game, know that you are taking a risk that you may be unable to even play the game. How good your PC is is irrelevent and it seems in my eyes that Ubisoft has completely abandoned the shambled mess that is Assassins Creed Unity. Ubisoft love your series, but at least fix what you started before moving on.
