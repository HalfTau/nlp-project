This game is officially the worst Assassins Creed game by far. For starters let me point out that at anytime you would like to start a new game or restart your current play through that there is no such option available in the game made by a AAA studio who praise their own work as being revolutionary. Secondly, the era this game was supposed to be based in is a very important and interesting era where the people of france are trying to first for real freedom, this game completely ignores that major elements of the French revolutions and completely the actual war period of the people fighting for their freedom by putting in a time skip when our main character is being lazy and depressed. Thridly, this game had a devistating launch, many people were unable to play the game for multiple days after its release simply because this game was so poorly optomised. There are countless other reason why you should not buy this game but i do not have to time to write a disertation on why this game is basically a scam and has no real worth. Thats all.
