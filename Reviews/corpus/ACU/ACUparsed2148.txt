After messing around with the settings and the settings from my GPU I finally got it to run a little more stable and it was then that I realised the followingThis game is pretty good but the devs have been listening to the wrong players.You cant use a human shield, if someone is going to shoot you you need to evade it and thats not as easy as you might think.They also removed the whistle, the one thing that made the stealth bits a bit more doable.On the other hand the game does look pretty good and the customisation is pretty elaborate and so is the selection of weapons. Tough it is quite noticable that they intended the selection of weapons for coop, considering the big differences between the weapon types.In the end, its a pretty good game. Its just not the most stable game and that is the biggest downside.
