I love the idea of the French Revolution. Its one of my personal favorite events in history. I like the concept of the companions. The game is supposed to show next gen possiblities but for PC its jaggy and slow. The ideas and concepts of this game are AMAZING but the gameplay is...not so much. If its on sale, might as well buy it!
