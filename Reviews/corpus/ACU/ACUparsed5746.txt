Ive played this game for only about 1.5 hours, and I can already say that IT IS AMAZING! Yes, I agree, the game needs a little bit of optimization for PC, but it is still playable I have an Nvidia Geforce GTX 870m and get around 30 fps. The story line is absolutely stunning, the graphics, the combat system  everything is incredibly detailed. However, there are some bugs that need to be fixed, but I definitely recommend this game.
