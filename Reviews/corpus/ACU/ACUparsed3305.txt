Not bad of a game considering the outburst of complaints. ACU does bring forth a new set of mechanics to the Assassins Creed world. Personally, I enjoyed it. If you are looking for a game that have good visuals, this is the game for you. Improvement wise, gotta work on the controls abit, I find it easier to die but meh, I switched from PS3 to PC so cant complaint there.
