Hmm... I could write of this all day... So start at the beginning. Why arent the people prepurchased it before its time? This is the question. 2 things1. Price prephurcase2. System requirements recommented specificationsWhat was the softwares realy big problem at its start?The software and patch bugs. This aint been fixed by that lots of updates by Ubisoft that lot updates made that buyers did not want to play game becose ubi didnt let them. Since 1 year ago ubisoft almost fixed all the bugs. But I found some during playing... Now, after 2 years of start, I must say that this game is really good. And bugs can be forgetted of the game enjoy. Thank you Ubisoft for this game. Loved it at all...the story has been too short
