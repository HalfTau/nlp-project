Yes Unity is broken and has alot of problems. Despite that fact the game if you can get to work is really good it has a good amount of innovative parts like the open missions with multiple ways to approch a assassination, coop, harder combat. Paris as expected is huge and full of things to do. The story while uninteresting does have a good main character. Arno was by far the best assassin since Ezio. If you are an Assassins Creed fan get this game you WILL enjoy it, if you are not, this game will not change your mind and is a horrible game to get into the series with. Unity has its problems, major problems, but it is still very fun and worth getting.
