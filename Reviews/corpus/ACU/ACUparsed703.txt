Assassins Creed Unity, despite the various bugs and glitches, is a superbly executed stepping off point for the Assassins Creed series. The entire thing seems like one great experiment, and it really works well, reinventing a lot of things from previous games to make them better. When replaying older games, I find myself wishing for the fluid parkour and climbing that this game provides, and I cannot wait to see how this technology evolves and gets perfected throughout the rest of the series.
