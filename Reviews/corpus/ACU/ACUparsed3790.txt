I really wanted to like this game considering I spent the money to buy it for me and my wife. I am dissapointed at the sloppy execution and over all lack of polish. Here are a few of the worst flaws1. Bugs and glitches, there are a lot.2. New climbing system would be asset but its ruined by things like , crowds not moving, glitching on tables, and issues hitting target jumps.3. Combat  enemies swoop to you to complete animation. I get killed all the time as im running away through a crowd becuase the enemy covers the distance to me to complete the animation even though I am at a full sprint.4. Guards  shoot him first and always they hit you even when running through a crowd5. Cover system  I have wanted a feature like this for a long time but its horrible, you can be crouching and a guard will see you behind the desk but your invisible if you hit the cover button?6. Crowds dont move?! AC has always had decent crowd movent and animation but not here even through mass crowds are a game mechanic.7. Common sense  Goal is to sneak into party. Climb over gate mingling in huge crowds of people. Step too far away from crowd and guards spot you instantly. While I undestand that there wouldnt be anything to do if you werent avoiding guards, that doesnt mean that in a huge crowd for some reason you are always the person they should see instantly until you take 1 step back and they all walk up asking Where did he go?I could go on but you get the point. I have always enjoyed the AC series and they all have quirks but this one goes beyond that.. it feels lazy.
