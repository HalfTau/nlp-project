I have two R9 290xs in crossfire and 16gb of ram. CPU is top end too, cant call it off the top of my head. this game plays like old people fck. Its no fun, no one wants to see it. If they dont fix this is a timely manner Ill be doing my best to get a refund. I didnt just waste money on the game, I bought the seasons pass only to realize the park isnt open for business. Dont buy it until you can read a bunch of updated reviews that this game runs quite smoothly on gaming rigs that are affordable. Fix it ubi.
