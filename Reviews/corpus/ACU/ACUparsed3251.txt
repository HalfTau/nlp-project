Dont buy this game. Even a couple months after release it is still riddled with problems like frame freezes and shuttering. Ubisoft has produced a genuine pile of vomit once again and I am ashamed to have said that I have bought it.During its rough launch I even defended it saying that Ubisoft can get it right. No, they havent. Months after and they still havent fixed fundamental issues with the game. Here I am on a Sunday afternoon trying to enjoy a product I bought for 60 dollars and its glitching out. The screen freezes the freerunning is atrocious.This is a poorlymade, appauling piece of garbage. A better use for your money would be literally buying dog feces.
