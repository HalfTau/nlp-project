My game has run smoother than all of the other reviews are putting it out to be. Yes there is frameoccasionally, but it isnt unbearable. I have not had my game crash as others have said. And I am running this game on a laptop with the following specsintel i74810MQ8 gb DDR3Nvidia GTX 860MTurned my settings down a little and it works well enough to still get an enjoyable experience and still looks fairly decent.Now to the gameplay. I have only played some of the solo missions and so far it has pulled me in like all the other assassins creed games have. Will be tough to stop playing this for a while.
