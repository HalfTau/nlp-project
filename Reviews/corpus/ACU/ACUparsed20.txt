One of the worst assassins creed games I have played. It is boring and repetitive and uninspired.The story is very dull and does not go anywhere. The characters are very poorly used, like for instance the romance between Arno and Elise is forced and very sudden. There is no build up to it and elise only appears in quite few scenes for such a major character.The world is impressive with the sheer number of npcs but it is very annoying having to constantly run the full length of the map just to get the next missions.P.S. I only have 8 hrs because I played 1/3 of the story then watched the rest in a youtube lets play because I was so bored. Im also glad I did the story was
