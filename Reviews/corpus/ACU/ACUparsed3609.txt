Dont get this game. If you decide you must play it, get it for console, and get it on sale or preowned. It looks very pretty, but its buggy as hell, it doesnt perform as well as comparable games, the changes to the fighting  movement systems are unnecessary  counterintuitive, the story is not particularly innovative or enthralling and... just, everything. I knew there was something wrong the moment I loaded the game and rather than being taken to a menu to change the graphics settings, it loaded a forced intro movie  opening sequence played on less than optimal settings, and I had to finish the opening mission, then actually quit and reload the game before I could even access the settings menu. To be honest, I prefer Rogue to Unity, despite being last gen. Not at all a good sign for the franchise or for Ubisoft.P.S. Dont ever buy a game that has a review embargo until a day after its released.
