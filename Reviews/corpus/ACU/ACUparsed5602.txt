I played a bit and havent run into many problem. Running a i53570 and a AMD R9 270 with High settings and a get a steady 2630FPS. It has random lag spikes and I glitched and fell under a building 20 minutes into the game...DWL... But other than that I dont recommend it till they fix it. The game is beautiful but its glitchy still. I would say wait about 2 or 3 months and see if there are better reviews.
