Well So far I am having a blast.I see no lag whats so ever.I have a Core i7 Gen 2 at 4.9Ghz, 32GB of Ram and 780Ti.The settings in the game are MAXED ULTRA QUALITY, shadows are on PCSS, Ambient Occlusion HBAO,  and AntiAlliasing is TXAA.Make sure to update your NVIDIA drivers if you are running NVIDIA. Since NVIDIA just released specific drivers to fix the Assasins Creed Unity lag...they end in .65 and not the .60 that was on their site few hours ago.No mouse lag, no thing...so yeap..if you want a trouble free system and dont have the CPU or GPU for it then buy a console version.P.S.They are releaseing a GPU patch in 1.2 shortly 2 days max.
