So after a few hours in the game I can say that it works... Mostly. Ive noticed that people are constantly going on about it not working at all and that they cant even run the game. I cant say why this is happening to people since they say their specs live up to the requirements but it totally works for me. I only have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 which doesnt even exceed the minimal requirements NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 but it still looks decent and it works fine for some weird reason. Buildings in the distant look likebut there is so much stuff to see around you so there is no reason to focus on the distance.Now, the story didnt really live up to my expectations. It isnt bad, however it isnt good either. The gameplay exceeds my expectations though. The coop works perfectly with the geargathering and the different missions. I do believe Ubisoft have created the most detailed, interactive and simultaneous world ever seen in the franchise. Its incredibly fun to simply run around in Paris with the new parkour system and huge crowds and the random street events create a deep immersion unlike anything Ive ever seen.But now it sounds like Im saying ACU is without any downsides at all. I have however fallen through the world once and the framrate is quite low but not anything I cant deal with. Overall the game is decent, the new customization is really fun and the abilty to build my own assassin has always been a dream. For a straight up rating I would give it something like a 5.5/10 because 6 is to high
