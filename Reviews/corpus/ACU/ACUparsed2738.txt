Long time fan of the Assassins Creed franchise.  I went ahead and bought this even though there were mixed feeling/reviews about it.  After an extensive amount of time playing, I can without a doubt agree with the negative reviews.  This game is poorly optimized with horrible graphic setting options.  It took me a few hours just to arrange the settings for a halfway decent gaming experience constantly adjusting resolution, ratio, etc.  The game is also full of many...many bugs even after being out on the market for so long.  Ran into a couple quests where the target became invincible or the game could/would not detect me smashing my E key for some stupid cinematic effect.  Truly disappointed...one of the worst big title games I have had the misfortune of buying and playing.
