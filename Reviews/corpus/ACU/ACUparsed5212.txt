Do NOT buy this game right now. I run a pretty decent system I can play most games on high and ultra including games like BF4, but I can only run this game on low graphics with 510 fps. It has very bad optimization, which will hopefully be patched. But I do not recommend buying this until then. Other than that the concepts implemented into the game seem very interesting, and I am still looking forward to being able to play it when it gets patched.
