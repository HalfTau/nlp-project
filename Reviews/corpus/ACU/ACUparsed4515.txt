Although it is not as good as the other assassin s creed games it is still pretty fun. I only crashed 3 times in my 20 hours worth of play time at the time of this review. It runs pretty well on my pc and it is not a high end gaming pc it is a moderate gaming pc. I would give this game a solid 7/10 its slightly above the average and slightly below a high score. I would recommend you buy this game when  it is on sale and the price is pretty reasonable.
