repetitive boring story... this game is not even close to what black flag delivered.. i played without crashes but fps did suck..  after an hour or so of play i always restarted the game because it seems to get more and more laggy the longer u play.. its the boring story that killed me. and i personally did not find this game that visually attractive. i felt so trapped in this tiny world compared to black flag..  it just didnt touch black flag.. i dont recommend it because it feels like a huge step backwards and its just boring...the coop is fun for a few mins till u get bored of the same 2 or so missions everyone does.. and no one plays together anyway.. its just 4 guys doing their own stuff messing up the missions... no voice or text chat... GREAT IDEA!! ubisoft lets make a coop game with no voice or chat options.... guess its back to wrecking cars in bugbears next car game for me til something good comes out..
