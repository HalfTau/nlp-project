Sure the game has optimization flaws, but the game itself can be fun and the graphics can have you in awe. Sadly the game has been abondoned and tesselation has never made it, but the game isnt boring. In fact, if the devs fix the optimization flaws I believe this game would beat Syndicate as I personally dont enjoy that game. Unity is remarkable, however performance issues and glitches killed it.
