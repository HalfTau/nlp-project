One of the best games I ever played in my whole life, I just dont understand why this game is so underrated and hated, because I loved it.Gameplay is just amazing, you have a lot of things to do like COOP first AC game with COOP mode, heists, secondary missions, quests, detective missions etc.Parkour system is much better than system used in previous game from this franchise. More unique and developed.Storyline is good, it makes you do more and more missions just to see what happens between you and Elise or between Assassins and Templars.Also, there are a lot of weapons, upgrades, skills, unique clothes that can be purchased with ingame money that makes cash an important thing in the game.A lot of people said that this game is buggy and unoptimized. Well, that isnt true at all. I never saw a problematic/extremly serious bug in the game except some crashes, and optimization is average, but Assassins Creed Syndicates one is better, thats true. But the game is playable on ULTRA on a GTX 1060 with i5 6500 setup, so thats alright.
