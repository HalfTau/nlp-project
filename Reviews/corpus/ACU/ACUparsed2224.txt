No matter what you do youll have frame rate drops, and it gets damn annoying. Just was playing a coop mission and it glitched my character randomly into a place that I couldnt move so I had to quit the mission. Basically there are bugs which totally screw up whatever youre trying to do and there aintyou can do about it.As for the controls I use a controller, much better than any of the other AC games as far as that goes. Graphics are quite awesome. Still unsure on the in game mic, cant seem to get mine to work if it does work. Needs to have ability to chat though.
