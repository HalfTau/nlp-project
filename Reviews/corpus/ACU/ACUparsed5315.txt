Look at right side of store page. There are 14 languages which game must support.But I have only russian text and russian/french audio. Yes I am from Russia, butI want original English version.In other Steam games I can download other language pack but here I cant.And yes, performance of game is very poor, but at least there is System Requirements althoughthey are very high, but they exists. There are no messages about language restriction.
