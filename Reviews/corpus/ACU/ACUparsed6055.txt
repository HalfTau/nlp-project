Bugs Everywhere. Very good game. if your a console user. witch your not b/c your on steam. i cant even play the game b/c my computer crashes when opening it. and its not my computer b/c it was 1300 and i bought it less than 5 months ago. its a very demanding game. my computer can run Advanced Warfare just fine. so i think they just dident really care about pc gamers this time arround. dont but this game. even if you think you have a beefy computer, it wont work on this game.
