This game... I love this series... even though ubisoft delayed this game for two weekseven though they give  30fps to consoles for cinematic feelUbisoft ruined my experience with no optimizationThey will soon be like EA and voted as worst company in my opinionI love how the game looks. its got gorgeuos visual.Of course being able to see what it was like to be in Franceduring the period around Frech Revolution.Combat is somewhat different. Definately harder than beforeProbably because it was just too easy before that It only was able to get harder hahaAs for performance issue frame rate could be all over the place sometimes even thoughI am running this game on near recommended specs with gtx 970However, I only came across this problem 5 minutes ago for the first timeNone of my other parts bottleneck my gpuwith 2 weeks they had, they optimized nothingoptimization is  in this gamebugs and glitches here and there as this is made by Ubisoftif it wasnt for frame rate issues and glitches, I would recommend this game toany of the assassins creed fansMy specs i7 4770, gtx 970, 8gb ramMy rant video about thisIf any of you want to check out the gameplay or frame rate issues, come check out my lets play here
