I was really excited to play this game since it seemed like a beautiful and fun assassins creed game. I got it just in time so that I would be able to play it on my new computor. Sadly theres just one small problem, THE GAME WONT START! Everytime I click it to play it just opens a small picture and nothing else happens. I would love it give my actually opinion on the game, but it doesnt seems that ubisoft wants me to play it. Upon further inspection it would seem that Im not the only one who has this problem, will have to refund sadly, Thanks goobisoft.
