Its not good but it isnt bad as well. The story is based more on the main characters personal vendetta not much stuff being an assassin. I think its similar to Assassins Creed Rogue because 1. You killed your mentor 2. Your lover is a Templar and you are helping her not that its a bad thing. Coop wasnt as much fun as you would expect as communication is difficult when you are playing with random players. Aside from the bugs and glitches the game is beautiful with the attention to detail on the buildings. 8/10 would recommend buying this game.
