Played this for 15 hours, was having a blast. Game ran flawlessly which I thought was great considering all the negative feedback. Then they patched the game today to fix all kinds of bugs. Then all of the sudden, for the first time ever, the game crashes for me. No big deal right, just load my save game after rebooting. Nope, game crashes everytime I load my save game. There goes 15 hours of gameplay Ill never get back. Im not starting over, consider this game junked. What a shame.
