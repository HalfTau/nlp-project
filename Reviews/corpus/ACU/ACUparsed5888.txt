I got to admit I was hype for this game because with all the new features and cool missions they added in the game. Preordered too but once I launched the game I regretted, everything went downhill as the graphic frame rate sucked donkey balls even if you put high or low settings and it doesnt matter as well if you have the system requirements or not. Everytime there is a cutscene playing, it gets very glitchy and laggy. Not to mention there are so many bugs in the game, I remember I was trying to climb down, and it resulted of the game to crash. Hopefully this game gets good amount of patches to fix all these bugs, then this game will be great overall. Nevertheless, Ubisoft has failed once again of maintaing their integrity as a company and did they ever check back to see there wont be any mistakes before selling to the public.
