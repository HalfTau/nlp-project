Ok so i wrote a bad review around a week ago because of constant crashing, I contacted ubisoft support via email and they fixed it. It turns out it was to do with my graphics tablet. Heres my updated review on unity.You play as Arno an assassin in the French revoloution. Arno is a very likeable character in my opinion and was made really well nearly one of my favourites behind Edward.The whole storyline so far from what ive played has been very enjoyable and has a good plot.I liked the addition of Coop and customization as weve never really had that except from new outifts. In Unity you can get better swords, guns, heavy weapons and even muskets!The graphics are good except from a bit of grain that is visible at night. I play on an i7 6700k GTX 1070 pc and I can run at ultra high without lag.If you ever have problems with this game just contact support and they can fix it! Only took 2 days for my problem to be solved The support team are very good and helpful. Also if you couldnt be bothered waiting for a response message me as I might now because they gave me more than one solution. Rating 8.9/10Thanks for reading!
