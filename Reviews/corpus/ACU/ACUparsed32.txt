so overall the game is alright. other then the fact that the screen bugs out when you use a mouse to turn all the time resolution looks like its trying to keep up, but doesnt all the time. from what i seen about people complaining about glitches its quite a bit better now. love the detective version of the game, quite fun that you get to piece clues together to solve riddles. the nostradomas things are a bit tricky. still trying to figure the first one out without looking online for clues to get started. im sure that online is better when you have more then 13 mb/s for speed which is dissapointing. but for skills. it would be nice to get points from more then 3 different spots, but then youd have tons left over come end of the game.
