About 95 of bugs have been fixed i just played it recently was not completely unplayable. The story is finethough at times i do feel like they are milking to series a bit too much , still worth a play specially the co op missions. The graphics are good though hair textures are a bit meh! But as an assassins creed fan cant stop following the series xD
