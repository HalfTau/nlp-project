Unless you got a computer that can run as fast as a mutherfuking horse. Then your wasting your money on this game. Got it on sale for 40.19 when in reality I only should have payed .02. Also... Ubisoft  I start the game up. yea looks fine till the start screen then it starts to get a little laggy. then ingame. i try to run I do what it appears to me as running while my hair is going all over the place. Then a pause. Then game crash. So yea.... untill they can fix this game. No one should buy it. If you play tf2 buy a hat. Buy a nice game on steam thats cheaper. Binding of Isaac Rebirth I hear thats a good game  But in the love of Gaben Christ. Dont give your money to him.
