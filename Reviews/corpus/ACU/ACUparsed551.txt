I intended to give thumbs up for this game when I just several hours in, but I eventually changed my mind after completing the game. Like most of other Ubisoft games, AC unity showed a great potential at beginning, but the game experience started to decline dramatically after a couple of hours play and I had to force myself to finish the story.ProsConsEven with GTX 1070, the FPS will drop to 40 at some cut scenes when the camera is rendering a close up character shot.which consumed CPU horribly. FPS suffered most of time.The entire world seems to be over exposed and over brightened at distant view.Prosand that is all.ConsIt is obvious that Ubisoft wants to make some changes to ACs combat system, but sadly it went the wrong way. Unnecessary delays are introduced in almost every single combat and freerunning movement you even have to lean forward before a leaping from a fast travel point, otherwise the system will repeat the synchronizing cut scene.The stupid mechanism keeps changing target during fighting enemies and keeps targeting the enemy I dont want to target. The snapping mechanism also did a terrible job. You get easily snapped to weird positions for example, railings, corners, tables, and chimneys when free running.  It might be ok when you just wandering around, but it gets super annoying when it happens during a chase or escape. It happens almost all the time and ruins the game experience every time.Just too many of them to list one by one. They kept repeating during my play through the game and ruined the game.It is a potential game with a lot of new ideas, but killed by lacking of punishments and countless bugs.
