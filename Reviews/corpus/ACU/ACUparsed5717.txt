THIS IS ABSOLUTESHITE!!! they cant have possibly thought this was ready to be released to the public. on any pc the frame rate no matter if your build is god like orits always chopy at the most crucial moments.they worked more on the trailers than they did on this game. honestly if your thinking of buying this game DONT. i cant stress this enough its not worth the 70 bucks you put into it. probably worth 20 bucks no more. the game is way to buggy to play.
