I7 4770K Overclocked to 4.5 GHZ2 Gigabyte GTX 970s  G1 in SLI overclocked to 1514 GHZ Clock16GB of RamInstalled updated drivers that are optimized For Assassins Creed UnityAverage FPS at High settings 35FPSMan I thought Watchs Dogs was bad. This is even worse. I have a PC that can run Metro Last Light at Ultra settings just fine and I cant even run this on high. Obviously this is not optimized for PC. It is becoming clear that Ubisoft does not put much effort in to PC. Right now this game is unplayable. I was very exited for Far Cry 4 but after Watch Dogs horrible launch, and now this game. I might skip it all together. I am a huge open world fan and I am very dissapointed.
