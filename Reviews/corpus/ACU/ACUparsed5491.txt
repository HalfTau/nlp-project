I can easily say now that this may just be the worst buy ive made this year, in terms of money vs value. I knew i should have waited some reviews but they got me with their presale bonuses and i threw 100 at them for what i now consider my personnal biggest ripoff of the year gamingwise. Apparently this game have issues with some AMD cpus and gpus and oh!!! sorry we forgot to mention that when you bought the game and all the season passes and stuff...
