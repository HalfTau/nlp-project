The game crashes on startup every. time. Buy at your own risk.Win 10 / GTX 980 Ti FTW / Core i7 6700kEDIT Expanding my review by a bit to be more thorough.Gameplay 8/10. Quite nice, a definite step forward for the Assassins Creed series. Freerunning and combat are both quite fluid and feel very well thoughtout. Missions are entertaining and moderately challenging.Optimization / run issues 2/10. I literally could not get the game to run after the 5 hour mark. I tried everything and it failed every time.Graphics 9/10. Very nice. Not Crysislevel or really even AC Syndicate level, but nice.Game world 10/10. First AC game where the world actually feels alive, breathing and moving. There are riots in the streets Game is set in the French Revolution, debris everywhere, almost every interior is fully enterable, and Paris is more beautiful than ever.CONCLUSION 3/10. IF you can get the game to run A MASSIVE IF, its beautiful and arguably Not by me, Im partial to Syndicate the best game in the Assassins Creed series, but its optimization issues prevent many from playing it and earned it a 3/10 and not recommended in my books.
