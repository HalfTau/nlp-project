Do not reccomend for AMD users, not optimized at all. bought it on sale, and cba to get refund from Steam for it.I have a powerfull gaming PC, using AMD, and framerate in this game and this game only is like 10fps which is horrible.On top of all, Ubisoft have the nerve to blame AMD for the low framerate and not their own incompability to program an 3d engine that works on all platforms. Shame on you Ubisoft!
