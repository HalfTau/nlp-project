So, to curb all of the hate  the game is decently solid. It is a pretty good storyline, and I enjoy it. The only real flaw I found with the game is the combat has changed. Each enemy is a separate fight. You cant get a kill from a combo or link kill after kill. It is slash under they are dead, change target, slash until they are dead. Firearms are now a standard weapon for your enemies. During a fight, theyll start pulling out guns. One or two hits  youre dead. Get ready to drop smoke bombs a lot.I bought the game on sale, and I dont regret it. It was a bit different gameplay, but the storyline was enjoyable.
