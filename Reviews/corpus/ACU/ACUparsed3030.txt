Too abitious for its own good.Assasins Creed Unity tries so hard to impress with its great graphics and new engine, but unless you have a video card for 500 euros like a gtx 970, things will backfire...I played the tutorial first chapter with a regular fps of 30, dropping as low as 1 with high graphics settings, though this could not be prevented since the graphic options dont scale with the fps, seeing as the fps has nothing to do with the graphics, rather the engine being uncomplete and full of holes. I started the first sequence with litte trouble, but when I got to episode 2 or there abouts, the game was simply not playable.I do not recommend this game, its an utter fluke, I knew this but bought it several months after thinking they would have patched it, however Ubisoft have already released their new game, totally ignoring Unitys issues and its fanbase. In essence Unity did not sell aswell as they had hoped, so they rushed Rogue off for shipping to get their moneys worth.I run a Nvidia gtx 770 twin frozr 2gb graphic card and an i5 t3 intel prossessor, my rig runs ultra Far Cry 4 in 60 fps!...This is simply not acceptable.
