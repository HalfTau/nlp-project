The people who are against this game arent looking at it artistically. Theyre focusing strictly on the idea that every piece of technology in this world needs to be absolutely flawless, regardless of how rushed the release is due to high demand.Play the game, and look at the beauty of the storyline, the incredible views take a look at my screenshots for examples and the weaponry/fighting style. It truly is an amazing game now that ubisoft has patched like crazy and apologized profusely for the minor inconvenience of a couple temporary bugs.Personally my favourite thing about this game aside from the brand new fighting animations and style is the database, showing their take on history. Youll learn a lot about the revolution, and the database has a lot of interesting facts, opinions, and hilarious takes on historical figures and events.Theres a reason the hype for this game was so high. Its great.
