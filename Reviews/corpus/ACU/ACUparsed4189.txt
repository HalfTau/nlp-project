After the scant towns of America and Pirate adventure I was looking forward to a return to Europe with sprawling cities reaching into the sky and the puzzle of killing targets again. Then they shipped a game that was not complete and loaded with ads for other content. When I purchase something for entertainment purposes I want it to entertain me not try to sell me addition things. Unity is like getting a movie sequel you always wanted but the climatic scenes are pixilated and there are commercials. The requirement to finish targets with the assassins blade also breaks the flow of game play. I would much rather have a Hitman style experience where it is kill target and get bonus scenes or points for how it is achieved. In previous games targets would at least flee if you where spotted and you had to actively engage them while fending off guards but now there seems to be no consequence to walking in and stabbing the first two guards in the face only to alert the entire group and have your target come to you. With purchasable weapons constantly flashed in front of you this becomes even less of a challenge. At this rate the next game will give you an option to buy a one use tank every 5 minutes that has to be declined then you will just roll in blow everything away only to get out and stab the target with the hidden blade to kill him.  When Assassins Creed first came out I was overjoyed that they seemed to combined two of my favorite series, Hitman and Prince of Persia but with each installment we seem to be getting away from having that mix of free running and having to plan approaches to stab a target that I liked.
