10 hours are not enough,I know,but I got way more than 10 hours into this game,sadly the rest of my hours were on 900p 30fpsbarelyps4,since launch,fell in love with the world,graphically great,it had its issue,but,they fixed the most,now,I gotta say,ubisoft got a great engine and combat system on this game that they can do something out it,something great,not for honor,I saw they using the same engine kinda better,so yes I recommend this game,of course be aware that to have the best experience and have a the full beauty of france,you gotta saldy have to grab a nice rig capable to run this at max settings,story is good,could have been better,youll get lots of hours out of this game.
