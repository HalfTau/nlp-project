Falling through the world map. Glitching in mid air. Stuck on combat mode when not in combat. Unable to attack when being attacked. Backwards much and just about every other glitch/bug/and fail that has already been posted before. I may have been one of the few who was excited for the Coop, And let me say it was a let down. Not only to me as the consumer but as a fan of the AC series. Glitching while playing with friends, having to disconnect and restart the whole mission because I got stuck in the wall is NOT acceptable.Beautiful story, sad that it felt cut short. Could of used some more character build up. Other than that I only have the DLC to look forward to. 5.5/10 play at your own risk
