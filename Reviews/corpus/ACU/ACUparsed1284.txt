Unity is for me a very good AC game. I know, many people disliked it, but that was when it came out, it was a totally broken game, it was literally unplayable, but after lots of patches, its actually very good. And still, after 3 years it looks beautiful. The story is immersive, graphical quality is stunning and customisation is just immersive, this is the only AC game with this much customisation.ProsStoryGraphicsCharactersCustomisationNew movemen and pretty smooth parkourConsSome bugsNo day/night cycle, time of the day changes when you fast travel.
