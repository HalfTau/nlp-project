I am an absolutely massive fan of the Assassins Creed series. Ive played through every single game, and have gotten to 100 in almost half of them. Ive liked them all besides Revalations, and was very excited to play this one. And besides a few minor glitches and one crash, this game is fun.By this point, Ubisoft has patched pretty much everything up, and if you can forgive some minor bugs, AC Unity is a very fun and playable game. Theyve improved the gameplay, its more challenging, there is alctually stealth, and the graphics are some of the best Ive ever seen in any video game.My main issues lie within the story. The main character, Arno, is a carbon copy of Ezio, and while he still is fun, its just more of the same. The story can get quite repetitive too. Also, even though the backdrop of the French Revolution is beautiful, it doesnt really lend much to the overarching plot of the game. And the Animus section is complete t at this point.However, Assassins Creed Unity is still a fun game even though it has many flaws.
