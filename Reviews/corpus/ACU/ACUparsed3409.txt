I am at a sort of crossroads. While the game itself is certainly enjoyable, and the gameplay is mostly solid, I have encountered one, and only one bug in the game. Unfortunately, it is quite severe. When I go to purchase new equipment after beating the game, it does not stay unlocked. If I switch to another weapon, I must buy it again. I would suggest waiting a few months to purchase this game, in order to allow Ubisoft time to work out all the kinks.
