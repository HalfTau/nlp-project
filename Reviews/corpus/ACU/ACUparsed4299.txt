Dont believe the people complaining just because their computers arent good enough. before you buy this game make sure you have a very good computer. The game has been running perfectly other than some occasional crashes but im sure that will be patched in time. remember people this game is new there are bugs. other than some techincal difficulties this game is amazing the blood wounds are much better than any other game youcan go into almost any building and the fighting is just exilerating with new controls and better mechanics. the story is a little bit hard to follow although. I would recomend this game to anyone with a good computer i have a laptop and it runs smoothly overall i give it 9 penguins out of 10.
