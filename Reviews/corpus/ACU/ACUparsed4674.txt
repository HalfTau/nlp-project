Let me start out by saying that this game has its bugs. That does not bother me. When they fix them, this game will have pretty awesome gameplay. But the story sucks, for lack of a better term.I love Assassins creed. I do. But this is not Assassins creed. Its a fantastic game. But Its not Assassins Creed. From the first game onward you have the option of leaving the Animus and looking upon the choas that the Assassins V Templars conflict is causing on the world. You get to play that. Your character took the knowledge gained from ancestors and applied to the real world. Unity has none of that. In fact, you could completely miss Unity in your AC playthrough Meaning if you were to play all the games in order and you would miss no important segments of the AC real world Storyline....Like excuse me, did the world not end? Or come close to it? What happened to that precursor being that you just unleashed on the world? She just vanish in to thin air? I am very disapointed with the story. Even the historical parts were off. I had no attatchment to any of the characters. SPOILERS INBOUND When Elise died I brushed it off. END SPOILERDespite the bugs, even, I manage to love it. But Im also disappointed.
