OK I just bought the game two days ago. I read a lot of the reviews here and I was really hesitant to buy it..but since it was 50 off, I decided to try since I loved it on PS4. The game ON MY PC runs fantastic! 60fps and each setting is set to high or very high. The only thing I noticed were very faint lines on the screen. My graphics card is updated..so this could be a vsync issue. If you have a system like mine, you CAN play this game smoothly. Its not perfect. You can definitely tell its a halfport. When you compare to Grand Theft Auto 5, the game does not look that great. But overall I love it and it hits my expectations.
