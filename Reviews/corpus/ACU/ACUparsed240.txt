I dont know, why people hate this AC so much, I really dont. It has awesome gameplay, also, amazing graphics. The game itself is runing very smooth. Working perfectly. No bugs and glitches at all. At least not for me. I definitely recommend this game. People who have never tried this game should do it. You will not repent. And also, story of the game is very cool. And the best thing is, that you have the ability to choose yourself how you will pass each mission.
