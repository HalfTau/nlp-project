So, when released this game was a broken mess, but that was a long time ago. With all the patching thats happened its now very playable, and dare I mention enjoyable. Graphically its easily the best looking entry in the series so far. Game play wise its assasins creed, most of the time its a great romp and then the game just does something you didnt want it to do and ruins the whole misson!! I enjoyed the story, its not the best by any stretch but good enough to keep me wanting to see where it was going. All in all the game gets a lot of unfair critism, I really enjoyed the time I spent with it and would recommend anyone that likes the series to give it a chance, it will more than likly suprise you in a good way.
