You know Im gonna be that one guy that gives it a thumbs up souly because Ive played assassins creed since the first game and will always play them. Im not gonna rip on them for 1 bad game just because it has slow frame rate or a lot of glitches, I feel like the gains of the game out weigh the costs.
