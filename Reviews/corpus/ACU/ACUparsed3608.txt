Alright so I normally dont write reviews. This game has gotten a really bad reputation for which I understand. Ubisoft was stupid for putting such a broken game on the market in the first place. However, I bought this game in the holiday sale and I have been pretty pleased. I am running the game with a much lower rig than recommended at 1600x900 res which isnt great, but it gets the job done. Since the patches have come out, the gameplay has been dramatically improved. Technical issues aside, this game has been fantastic.The city of Paris is huge and gorgeous and a blast to run and climb through. Arno is fully customizable and has loads of different outfits, weapons, and skills to buy and upgrade. In my limited time playing, the missions have been fun. The mysteries are a good change of pace even if they are a little too simple. Still you get the boring follow and protect this person mission but the world is so huge and emersive it has a much better feel.Combat is one of the things that suprised me most. There is still a parry/counterattack system but it takes a few ques from the arkham series. Counterattacking is no longer an instakill and other enemies will attack while Arno is in the middle of counterattacking which you must parry. It has been different getting use to this system but I have enjoyed it.Now I have been a huge fan of the AC series since the first installment. I am probably biased here, and I know I got the game later after a lot of issues had been fixed. If you are a fan of AC, I would say get the game. Maybe not for full price and make sure you have a rig that can run it. If you dont like AC, this game will not change your mind. Overall, I am a fan. I just hope Ubisoft has learned its lesson and wont put another game out for sale before it is finished.
