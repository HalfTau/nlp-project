Update Finished main quest line story. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt exceptional. No similar WTF moment like at the end of ACBrotherhood. Just an average predictable ending with nothing special to it.Combat is a lot harder, not that thats a bad thing. No kill streaks. Tougher enemies are tougher. Whistling enemies to their doom is gone and will be missed. The only issue I have with the combat is that there is no counter measure to enemies shooting at you no human shield counter measure. Having two high tier riflemen shooting at you will kill you, and there is nothing you can really do to stop it except throwing a smoke grenade which isnt my favorable approach to the situation. I really miss the human shield counter measure.One thing I really did enjoy about the game were the investigatory quests, Sherlock Holmes style. I hope they carry on these types of quest into their following games.Hopefully in near future Ubisoft will optimize the game on PC, and polish the game some more so that Im not so reluctant to recommend the game to others.Day 1 review   Story is decent, main character is decent.PC optimization  absolutely horrendous.Mouse/ Keyboard setup is bad. No Arno thats NOT were Im telling you to go! Bad, Arno! Bad!Glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy glitchy ......Distant textures are non existent, its a smudge of color.sigh this game could have had such a good welcome if it only had been optimized for the PC properly. Too bad...Well, theres always Black Flag. They had done such a great job with Black Flag! Why did they go so wrong with Unity?! !
