I have been a fan of the assassins creed games since the start of the series. As a sequel to the frankly excellent Black Flag, this pales into insignificance. Theyve patched out most of the absurd bugs, leaving just a slow, sluggish, and worst of all dull experience. There are some characters, I dont remember who any of them are, some things happen, and I cant tell what exactly has happened, and nor do I care to find out.They managed to make one of the busiest periods of European history mindlessly dull. For this reason, and many more, Id heartily recommend avoiding this, even if it was very cheap.
