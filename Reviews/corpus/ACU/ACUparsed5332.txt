Assassins Creed  Unity is an unpolished mess of what the series used to be. Ive been an enormous fan of the series through its life span, playing almost every iteration of the game as it comes out. Unity is the first one that leaves me immediately and immensely disappointed.I feel like Im in an abusive relationship with this game. I want to like it, I want to love it. Ill stop playing after its crashed for the third time in an hour, and swear not to start it up again, but I always do. And it never gets any better. It still keeps torturing me with horrible controls, framerate and performance issues, and the sense of a game that was rushed to production.Make no mistake, this is easily the most gorgeous game in the series to come out, but with the myriad of other issues plaguing it, I cant help but feel like this is more of a performance show, and the game has plenty to show. But, It feels like the game is unpolished and unfinished, and as a fan of the entire series, Im immensely disappointed in the fact that this is the first Assassins Creed game Ive ever asked for a refund on.
