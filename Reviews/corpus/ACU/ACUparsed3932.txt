Everyone thats putting negative reviews, you better respect how much effort it took them to make this game, there is a lot of problems I know, but just remember that they will need a lot time to improve it, I myself have a lot of problems with it but I dont say stuff like DONT BUY THIS GAME! or ITS A WASTE OF MONEY because of the bugs and glitches. Just try to have fun and dont give up on it.
