I feel like this game was exagerated because i actaully do parkour in real life and am really pro at it. But what annoys me the most is that they only put like 4 parkour moves in it others are just jumping and falling. The story line is good but when your going to name a game called Assassins Creed Unity make it a massive multiplayer online game, NOT JUST SOME DUMB MISSION COOP, WITH FOUR PLAYERS. I wish they made the game with a better senery like a nature parkour areas like ac3 and less people on the streets every second of the game. I really hope the next assassins creed game Ubisoft makes is in like present day New York, because that would be really cool. Thanks for reading peace out!
