Brought me back to why I love this series. It had the old elements I loved while having good new/recent elements too. I was not a huge fan of the ship mechanics, and missed the old type of assassin style. This game felt the most close to actually being stealthy than any other game in the series. Also, the skills that you now have to unlock instead of being given adds an aspect to the game I enjoy, while including new skills that made the game even more fun. The game preformance wise runs just decent cause i do have frame drops and the cut scenes can be occasionaly laggy, but it does not take that much away as the graphics are stunning, and there is not always frame drops. Overall i would rate 87/100.
