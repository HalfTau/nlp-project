Finish your ing game before you release it.Im not mad.Just disappointed.I spent my birthday money on this game......EDITIts Christmas break, and I decided to try this game again after the release of patch 4, which was supposed to fix many issues with the game.Now, my game wont start. It tries to load the main menu and freezes. I had to restart my computer, task manager wouldnt even open.A reminder, friends, for the holidays. Do not buy Ubisoft games at full priceor at all. Dont preorder these games, because they will push it out the door early as an unfinished and unoptimized piece of trash due to demand. Do not let Ubisoft keep ing us over.
