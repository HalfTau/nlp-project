Had horrible frame rate issues during in game cutscenes to begin with, issue now fixed. Now experiencing crashes upon the game loading. 20 progress, game crashes upon continuing the game and crashes immediately after getting past the initial loading screen after the continue button. The game was running fine up until now.Definitely do not buy right now.
