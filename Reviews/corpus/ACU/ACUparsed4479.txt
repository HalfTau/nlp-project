Its a buggy piece of  but i love it no matter what. The story is the best since Ezio, Arno is an awesome dude and Paris is a beautiful city,If you can play it without lag and to meny bugs then it is the best since the second one. you get right into the story from the moment you press play and it keeps you there.I wont go into what my pc is fillled with, but i played it on low and allmost 45 hours of it now, its a good game!
