HEY! This isnt your usual review, but I feel the need to for this game. First off pretend that thumbs up is just nonexistent for the rest of the review. Now for the actual review this is probably a good game however, I would only say get this game if you for sure know you can run it you better have a really good PC. I made the mistake and bought this game thinking I could just adapt to a 800x600 window and turn every possible setting to the lowest. Now most games, even the newer ones, would probably give me 30 fps out of pity, but this game is not like that at all. It will be downright brutal to your hardware and put you in your place if you didnt come prepared. To put my experience into one sentence My PC got completely annihilated by a game from 2014. I would go back and try to pull out more gameplay information for you, but Im actually trying to get my money back for this one so I dont wanna add anymore time than I need to.Edit I kept the game because it made me giggle.
