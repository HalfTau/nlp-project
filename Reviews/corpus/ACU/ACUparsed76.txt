Im going to be retracting my initial review here.The game is the beginning of changes withing the gameplay of the AC series, but once you get used to it you can start to enjoy the game. The story is a tad cliche however, it is the city of love! The game is still buggy, but it isnt game breaking. I recommend the game since it is not release price. I was lucky and got it on a sale.So, allinall it is an enjoyable game and worth getting.
