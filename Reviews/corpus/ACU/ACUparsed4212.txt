ok, so looking past all the initial bugs which at times were funny, and other times down right frustrating, this was a great attempt by Ubisoft to get back to their roots in this series. Even the main menu music is based off of probably their best game, Assassins creed 2. The story is pretty good havent finished it just yet and the modern aspect they threw in is good as well good to see Mr. Hastings humor still in the series. Please dont get rid of him Ubisoft!! !MY FAVORITE PART BY FAR is the customization. Im a sucker for games that allow you to make your character unique, like Skyrim. Ive probably spent 100/800 hours in the character creation menu in Skyrim, if that tells you anything. I always thought it dull that all you could in previous games was change the color scheme, unless you did all the special quests or collections. Black flag changed it a little, but not by much. This game went above and beyond there.Another awesome change was the parkour system. So, so much smoother than previous games. Climbing towers in this game goes by so much faster, the fastest since the inclusion of the hookblade in Revelations please bring that back Ubisoft.One thing I would have liked to see, was crafting of the bombs like in Revelations. They added a bunch of bombs to use instead of the usual boring smoke bomb, but dont give you the chance to truly customize them.Overall, Id give this game probably an 8/10, simply because of the bugs, and the random crashes that occur. I know Ubisoft went above and beyond trying to fix these, but even still. I feel like they should have known that something was wrong during testing.Do I miss the sailing? Well, yes, but if I do I will just go play Black Flag. I mean, not much they can do there to improve that. Not sure they had ships in use during the French Revolution.
