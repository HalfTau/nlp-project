I love AC, but this game is a hot steaming pile of crapola.Ubisoft... get yourself together.1 ridden with bugs, crashes and fps drops. And i mean lots, if u can even get the game to launch.2 why paris, i still dont understand this. The gameplay is fun for a couple hours and then it starts to feel like a boring version of AC2 with a sorry excuse for coop.3 Arno is more boring then Connor in my opinion. I find most of the side characters to have more depth then him.4 last but not least, ALL THE HYPE. Oh and the Embargo. . save your money ppl. Just give up on AAAs
