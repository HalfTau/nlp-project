I loved Blag Flag, and really looked forward into this. What a dissapointment. I have Recommended specs, and it does not run well at all. I have to lower the settings so low that i might as well play AS 3. What a example of bad coding and game industry rippoff. I pity eveyone who decided to rush in the project and release this tard.
