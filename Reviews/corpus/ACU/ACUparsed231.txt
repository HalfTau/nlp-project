Assassins Creed Unity is my favourite Creed game to date. At release, and even to date there are some minor glitches  characters becoming stuck looking as if theyve gone for a swim into the wall and are drowning at the same time  which, I find rather funny sometimes honestly haha. The aesthetic is beautiful, especially if you want to delve into the some of the history in Paris, its very immersive in that sense. I absolutely love it and have completed it twice on PS4 and PC, including 100 achievements on PS4 and hopefully soon, PC. I love the game and would definitely recommend giving it a go rather than listening to the complaints of bugs, as a lot of the time many people wont experience the bugs others do.
