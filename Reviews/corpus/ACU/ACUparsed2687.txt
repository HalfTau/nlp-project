Man, this is a polarizing game to critique.  As much as I enjoy the game itself, theres just so many other negative factors that bogs this game down from a recommendation from me.ProsBeautiful game, if you have a monster of a rig to run it.Hard, combat is reworked once more, stealth plays a bigger emphasis and free running is the best its ever been.Coop is fun.Tons of content to keep you occupiedConsHORRIBLE OPTIMIZATION. Game is poorly optimized even at minimum specifications the game runs likeMicrotransactions for customization seems way too forced in.
