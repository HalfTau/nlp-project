Honestly, I got a 1.5gb update today and the game still has all the bugs it did before. Im not sure if the update was meant to be Patch 3 or not, but Ubisoft said they would release it this week on PC so Im really jsut assuming. Either way, at least Ill be able to get Far Cry 4 for free and play that instead.
