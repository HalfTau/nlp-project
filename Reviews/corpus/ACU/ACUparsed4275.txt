After fixing all the bugs, I can firmly say this is the best Assassins Creed I played. Story line is engaging, believable characters as much as Assassins Creed can be P, all the side activities were helpful and fun! Didnt even start doing side, and it was already not boring when I was walking from mission to mission! And there was a LOT of walking, Paris is HUGE. Also, it was set in the French Revolution, and I was studying for a test on it when the game came out so I can verify, almost 100 historical accuracy! Even though Napoleon was only a teen in the French Revolution, not an adult.A few things I didnt like about the game though, is the fact all the character even soldiers you were fighting had British accents and most of them never even said a sentence in French! The only people that spoke French were the unkillable NPCs all the Paris population and the shop owners. I give this game a solid 7.5/10, a very solid and fun game, and I reccomand playing it!
