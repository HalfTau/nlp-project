I simply cant recommend this game,I hate following the hate over things but this game is too buggy,When I started playing, the game crashed after the first sequence, after a relaunching and playing for a while I tried to run around just for fun, then I ran into the wall, got stuck and had to restart the game.I finished the intro missions and got to choose skills, but no matter which skill i choose the game crashes, and is no longer playable.And the graphics, wow.I have a pretty powerful PC, but I cant even run this game on 30 FPS, even with low graphics, its not the fault of my PC, its simply a poorly ported game.Cant recommend. do not buy until theres a patch that fixes some of the major problems.
