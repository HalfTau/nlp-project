After 90 hours ingame at the time of writing this, I can safely say that I really enjoyed my time with Unity. The changes to core gameplay mechanics took a bit of getting used to, but ultimately they suit Paris landscape very well in terms of free running. I also enjoyed the fact that combat got a bit tougher, forcing more forethought to any given mission. Paris is rendered in stunning detail, which really made me want to exploreadding to this the fact that side missions feel fresh and have a bit more context than usual. A great cast of nuanced characters and a downtoearth story was also a welcome feature for me. Some minor bugs and annoyances remain but I think its safe to say that Unity has come a long way since its disastrous launch, and can now stand proudly alongside the best instalments of the AC series.I personally havent experienced any crashes or difficulties in actually being able to access/play the game.
