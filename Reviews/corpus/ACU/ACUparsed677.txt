Assasins creed unity is underatted game but it still good, well...i would be lying if i said it was spotless but as with everything it doesnt come perfect. This game could have been better in terms of technical standpoint caues the the only real complaint i got. Is that it so hard to even startup the game, some will experince bugs etc. Thats why  i must warn you before buying this game is really finnicky and may work for some and not others etc.Some solution will work others will not you just have to be willing to look forem.Consider it first when you think about this game, overall its good  game and its playable you just have to bee paticent and resiliant to get it to work properly. In the end i would give it a 7.5 out of 10 possible. Assasins creed series have never dissapointed me.
