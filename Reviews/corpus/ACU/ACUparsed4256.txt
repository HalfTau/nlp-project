This game is a complete mess, to the point that I frequently dont know what Im supposed to be doing, or why. The way it forces you to do things on mobile or online Nomad stuff, coop stuff, Initiates stuff is infuriating. It feels like they just came up with a bunch of different interesting ideas for a game and threw them all together without a lot of thought and planning, and here we are. As a bonus insult, 10 hours in, the metaplot basically hasnt made an appearance yet. I was disappointed at the metaplot in AC4 after the great one in 3/Revelations/Brotherhood/etc, and this one is well on its way to disappointing me even more I hope it surprises me, though.The performance is really awful, as well. Even with things turned way down, on a decent system, the controls still feel extremely sluggish combat is outright difficult to the point that its hit or miss whether Ill even survive a given combat, even though I had absolutely zero problems with combat in previous AC games. Its an extremely frustrating experience, and not at all fun.UPDATED 30 hours in and most of the way through the main plot, and the metaplot has yet to make an appearance. ANY appearance. This really, really sucks. If I could give this game a doublethumbsdown for it, I would. The way the plot and the metaplot twined together in previous AC releases is, in my mind, what made them truly unique, and they completely left it out in this one. I cant remember ever being more disappointed in a game.
