Its difficult to put a word into this review, since this game is basically terrible.Ubisoft removed the fun and simpleness by adding Microtransactions lots of it! Requiring an Initiate account which is bugged, forever stuck at level 1 even if you own other AC games and the Unity Companion app, in order to unlock various chests and outfits in game. It uses Uplay. If playing this game causes you whole computer to immediately shut off, you WILL have to start over from the beginning. Cloud saving/saving fails miserably.Aside from those, theres also the immense amount of bugs and glitches which ruins the game..UPDATE Ubisoft has begun fixing most of the performance issues, making the game more smooth. Bugs are still being worked on, but other than that, the gameplay isnt that bad. What I dislike is the microtransactions, Unity Companion app and AC Initiates.
