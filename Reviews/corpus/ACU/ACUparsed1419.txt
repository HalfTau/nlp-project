Iv been playing the game for about an hour. During this hour the game has been crashing five times.ACU.exe has stopped working it says.Im playing on a computer with a 980ti, i74970k and 16gb of ram. I am frequently playing many other demanding titles  with no problem handeling them at all. My temp on the GPU is about 70c on 100 load and the CPU on 67c 100 load.Dissapointing experience that make me want to uninstall the game.
