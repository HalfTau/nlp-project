love the game and story line and how they brought back concepts from previous games as well as adding in new concepts that make you think riddles and actual problem solving as well as some detective work would rate 4.5 out of five stars at the moment until they make it a little more compatible for computers that arent set up for next gen gaming, once that happens its definately worth more then five stars. LOVE THIS GAME!!!! !
