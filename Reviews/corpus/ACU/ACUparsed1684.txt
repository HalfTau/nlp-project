Just bought the game, havent gone too far but I can say that I get solid 60 FPS all the time with my GTX 970 in u current state of the game.I have exprienced a few crashes that drove me crazy but other then that, a game runs flawless. The story seems to be interesting . The environment is just a pure ART, I love that ubisoft is trying their best to deliver a best game possible even when they fail at doing so.Get it on sale,I really recommend it. 8/10
