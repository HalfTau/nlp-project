Honestly, singleplayer doesnt seem so bad, except its a little too hard at times. Ive played syndicate and black flag with a good playtime so far and this has to be the worst of AC games. Or atleast somewhere in the end. I bought it for COOP, but its not so fun like I imagined and missions feel extremely hard. Altough its not so bad as you can FINALLY play COOP in AC with your buddy, its still not a good game. There are some problems like people seeing when you throw a smoke, bugs, bad controls and for some reason I feel like the combat system is so much harder in this game. In black flag IV its more like a hack n slash you come and go and slay and slay, but in this game its just 1 vs 20 another guys who RANDOMLY appear from nowhere and start chasing you.Sadly, Ill give this game a bad recommendation,  atleast for now, because right now I wouldnt really recommend it.Im sad that Assassins Creed Black Flag doesnt have a COOP. We need more ACs with CO0P feature!
