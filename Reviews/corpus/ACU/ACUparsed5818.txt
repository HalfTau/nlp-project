Although I am a huge fan of the game, there are a lot of issues with the gameplay performance right now, ive only come across a few issues unlike others.I have had the following problemsRandom NPC spawns in the air.Falling through the map on buildings and the ground. FixedMassive Frame drops.Glitchy sequences.Lack of advanced graphics settings.Common Mouse lag on menus and other screens. FixedUneventful and glitchy combat. FixedPlease note the Fixed issues are what I have seen, experience with these issues may difer on your system.Edit 11/22/14After playing for a few more hours with the latest patch, the game runs better, no crashes, map glitches or freezing for me, however, I still experience a glitchy type lag, until Ubisoft fixes this I still do not recommend this game.This game is buggy and once again is another example of a horrible pc port by ubisoft.Assassins Creed Unity had note had huge potential but they managed to screw it up in every way possible.All of these issues are easily fixable with updates and patches but for a 60 dollar price tag, to put it in one word, disgraceful.As for the game itselfGraphics are good and I can run it on Very High settings. The sequences are short which results in the main story line being short as well however, there is plenty to do after the story is completed. The Coop mode is amazing and it is really fun to play even with just one friend. Coop is one of the strong points of the game, the experience is unlike any other Assassins Creed or Coop game.
