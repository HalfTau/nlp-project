As a hardcore fan of the assassins creed franchise, I will point out the elephant in the room and acknowledge that this game has its problems. Constant bugs and glitches bring down a rating if its a game breaking bug as i have unfortunately discovered myself. Although it is rare. Other bugs are pretty fun to be honest as some NPCS are falling and having a spaz while you are casually enjoying the beautiful graphics. I would go in depth about everything but im just gonna mention re abit. The missions are more that fun they are awesome. The story and characters are pretty forgetable but arno isnt the worst character. All together around a 8/10
