The PC version isnt worth 60 USD at all. Very laggy, poor fps and some glitches. I havent encountered any terrible glitches that break the game, but there is the occasional glitch or two, like heads flying through the air or civilians floating into space like team Rocket. My main problem is that it is poorly optimized for pc I use an AMD graphics card, I know it was optimized for Envida but it shouldnt preform this bad. I can run most games like Planet Side 2 and Bf4 on ultra settings, so I was disappointed I couldnt run this on anything higher than medium.
