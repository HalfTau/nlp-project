Ok, so Ive only been playing Assassins Creed games for a relatively short time, and so far every one has impressed me in one way or another. Please dont listen to the haters who got salty at launch, because after waiting for the patches to come out which I did before I bought it, I can honestly say that this is a good buy. I really love the story. Its kind of your run of the mill love and betrayal story, but I found it to be surprisingly emotionally involving, and it came with a few unexpected plot twists along the way. Also, staying true to the AC formula, theres a crap ton of side stuff to do.The game is full of all kinds of eye candy, and is by far one of if not the most graphically gorgeous games Ive ever played. Yes, the system requirements are ridiculous, but I can run it on High settings with my GTX 960 and i7 3770 with the FPS rarely dropping below 35, even in the most intensive scenes.However, this game does have some cons. For example, I appreciate the devs trying out the whole new parkour mechanics thing, and to a degree it does work, but it still seems rather Betaesque in terms of its reliability. Many times I found myself shouting Why did you jump there?! or Ok, so I can leap over buildings but not a chair? !, especially when these bugs caused the death of poor Arno.Overall, this game is fun, beautiful, and a good buy if youre looking for an exclusively nextgen game to keep you busy for a long time. So again, please dont listen to all the butthurt people. Yes, the launch went down the toilet, however, this game is now in a spot where it really is a great buy.
