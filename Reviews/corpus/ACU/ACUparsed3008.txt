well, where should I start?THIS IS AN UNHOLY BROKEN MESS, AN EXCUSE FOR A GAME, AND THEY ARE ASKING FOR 60 DOLLARS IN THIS.this game even demands an absurd graphical setup, that it does not even deserves. ive seen games from 2012 that look better than this game, and take much less of your processing power. even if you have an high end pc, this game still has an absurd amount of lag, it is like passing the slides from a powerpoint presentation as fast as you can, but with broken fingersseriously... your money is much well spent on something that is actually an finished game, not a Alpha version that is said to be a full product.yes, there were games in 2014 that were far worse, but seriously... even they were more entertaining than thisthe story is just a copy/paste of assassins creed 2, youre a young man that is framed, someone important to you dies, you decide to become an assassin, then you quickly rise throug the ranks, and some unimportant things happen, and whatever, i couldnt even beat this game, it is just too boring...oh, i almost forgot, there are microtransactions in this that cost almostly 100 DOLLARS.i believe i have nothing more to say about this, you probably already got my point, so im gonna do something that is actually productive with my life and forget about the existance of this.
