I have the recommended specs for this game. And every game i get i can run at max graphics at at least 60 fps. But for some reason this doesnt run that fast. And the max graphics is quite ugly. I have seen the console version of this game and it looks a lot better. This is honestly in my opinion a bad port and you shouldnt waste your money or time.
