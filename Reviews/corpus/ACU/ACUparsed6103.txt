Main PC Specs GTX 660s in SLI, i7 4790K 4.5 ghz, 16gb 1600mhz memory.The game runs fine for me on high for the most part but I am encountering a pretty irritating stuttering issue constantly in the game. Its playable but after awhile you wish it would stop. I have no idea if anyone else is having that issue but thus far that is really the worst problem ive had with it other then the occasional frame drop which i believe will get squared away as the game is further optimized. Im just hoping the stuttering problem goes away as well.
