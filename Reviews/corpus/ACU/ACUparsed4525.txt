Im a big fan of the series but Ive got to tell you, it looks like the game was PC deoptimized.Ive got a gtx770 SLI and I need to set the graphics do something between medium and high to get a constant 60 fps without lots of drops. Having to do so with a beast machine was a total turn off.And the bugs, ohh the bugs... you probally know about them, so Im not even going to enter in the subject. They should finish their game before realeasing it.Im waiting for more patches and fixes specially performace ones before continuing my game.
