I LOVE THIS GAME! It is probably my favourite assassins creed I dont know why people hate it its ing awesome.I dont know why people hated the combat system eather, it isnt easy at first but once you get used to it, it grabs a special place in your heart. Im not going to lie I liked black flags combat system a bit more this game would be even better if it had it, but the combat system in this adds a bit of a challange. I thought that it would be worse than it is but nope its a lot better. Plus there is customization and the customization is good. oh and for some reason i can run this with a 660. sorry if i spelt things wrong.
