Please read.Please note This is written from somebody below minimum specs, but also somebody who has played the XBOX One version.AC Unity... Its pretty good. Its probably my favorite AC gameplay mechanics wise we got a hipster here, but the quality... the performance...Isnt... that good...Yes, Im below minimum specs, but Ive heard NUMEROUS reports of others having the same problems... ABOVE RECOMMENDED specs. Let me tell you my story.Buys game on sale for 30 bucks. Notices Im below minimum specs, figures oh, well Ill tone down the settings. Notices black flickering in game finds out its a common problem.Does some stuff. Fixes it, but causes more problems, like messed up cutscenes, and MASSIVE stuttering finds out BOTH are common problems.First quarter of game glitchy, but playable.Second quarter running smoothly after messing around a bit.Third quarter  messing up a little... But still, for the most part, playable.Fourth quarter crashes twice during final boss once midfight, once during ending cutscene.Poststory CANT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT STUTTERING. I try to load a mission, it crashes. I try to customize my character... Crash. I run around aimlessly trying to find other stuff to do stutter, freeze, crash.Storywise, I LOVE AC Unity, and dont see why people hate it.Gameplay Ideas, I love, and find absolutely genius and incredible.Technicalwise, I want to burn this game. Not onto a disc... In a FIRE.On the XBOX One from what Ive played, its great. And from the sounds of it, with a good PC, and some messing about with the technical settings, its absolutely brilliant...But, if youre the kind of person who has a belowminimumspecs PC, and just figures oh, Ill tone down the settings and itll run fine...YOURE GONNA HAVE A BAAAAAD TIME.
