This game is great, but it lacks features from AC3 and so on. The climbing can be annoying sometimes because you literally will grab on to something you dont want to in the heat of the moment. The CPU requirements are too damn high. I ran at 3.4ghz and this game constantly freezes and makes my character glitch out, ie I fall through the world a lot and get stuck in midair. This game is good but youll have to deal with release bugs if you want to buy it early.
