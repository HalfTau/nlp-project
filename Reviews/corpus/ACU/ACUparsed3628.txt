I want to love this game, but Im finding it so hard to!The graphics are great, the gameplay is good, but it is just overwhelmingly broken with constant bugs, terrible optimisation for the PC, wonky animations, the list goes on.Its such a shame too because I was so excited for this game after the stellar Black Flag. This isnt to say the game isnt good, thats far from true, its just so rushed but when it does work properly its great but at the moment its not a good purchase IMO.Then there is the Coop, which is the biggest feature I have wanted since the AC series began and we get it finally!! Is it good? Yes but again, only when it works properly. Roaming with friends seems ok, doing missions is another beast entirely. Wonky AI, FPS up and down like a yoyo, enemies randomly spawning next to you and with players using smoke as a way to escape a fight barely works as the AI seems to use 18th century thermal vision or something and still sees you, being spotted through walls etc!I would recommend to get the game but not just yet, wait a while until Ubisoft pull their fingers out and fix it but given what they did with Ghost Recon Future Soldier on the PC, I really wouldnt hold my breath.
