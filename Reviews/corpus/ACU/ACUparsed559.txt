Second sequence first mission  Stuck either in a wall or other object that doesnt exist 3 of the 3 times Ive tried to play through it. Game runs awful on MINIMUM settings, even on a PC that blows the recommended hardware out of the water. My specs areTitan X Pascal32 GB DDR3 Corsair Dominator Platinum RAMIntel i7 4790k ProcesserAsus TUF Z87 MotherboardAll settings on lowest with everything that off that can be turned off, and I cant even hold higher than 16 FPS. Its sad, as literally probably 2/3 of the AC playerbase uses a PC due to the availability of games on there, yet these same people cant get even a stable 30 FPS even when the refresh rate is SET AT 30 FPS? I almost gave up on the previous mission, as the game loading in the fireworks caused the framerate to chug to the single digits sometimes locking the game up entirely. I wouldnt even recommend this on sale use the money to get something better thats also on sale.
