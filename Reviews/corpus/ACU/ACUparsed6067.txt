I love AC so it hurts me to say this but the game is unplayable to me. I have a GTX 720 card and even after turning all post processing off and set all graphics settings to low, I still cannot fix the frame rate problem. From what I have played 2 hr the game and story are fun, but until the game is optimized to fix the frame problems I cannot recommend this game. There are also several problems with falling through the world, getting stuck and not being able to move on ledges.
