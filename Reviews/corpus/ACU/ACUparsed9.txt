If youre a fan of the AC franchise I see no reason why you wouldnt enjoy this game. It has gone a long way from the problems of launch day and is now, at least for me, perfectly enjoyable. 1700s Paris is absolutely gorgeous and the main story, while not one of the franchises top quality plots, can be interesting at times. Gameplaywise it feels like some imporvements could have been made, especially in combat, but free running and stealth works pretty much as youd expect from previous AC games.Would highly recommend getting it on sale.
