Im sad this game still has mixed reviews! OKay... OKAY! So it was a bad launch back in November 2014, but its fixed now.. kinda.And alot better than it was! I feel sorry for those who have not returned to this game due to the problems that are now in the past!I played the console version on PS4 and it was TERRIBLE but I still played and loved this game!For now.. as of 04/July/2015 I will happily give this game a solid 8/10!
