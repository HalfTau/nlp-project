I have almost minimum requirements but the game HUD is all white and flashing which I can assume the FPS is bad. Is there nothing that can be done to fix this? I mean there is no way to see the items in the store because everything is white in the game and I cannot customise my loadout at all because everything is WHITE. WHAT IS THIS WHITE NO COLOUR GAME OPTIONS THAT I AM LOOKING AT? MY GOSH PLS FIX THIS AND THE REST OF THE BUGS COME LATER.
