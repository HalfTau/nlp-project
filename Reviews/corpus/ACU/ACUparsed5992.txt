I honestly never had any issues with this game thus far. Framerates are good and textures look pretty good as wellI have this game maxed out with a 780 ti with about 55 fps but can jump up to 144 my screen vsync limit.I must be lucky. But others were not. Wait it out and purchase it later on to avoid the headache
