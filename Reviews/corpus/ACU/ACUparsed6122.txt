Well, I really enjoy it. Despite what problems others have, I waited till the release, and played it. Got past the first few missions, some bugs, but not something that wont be later patched Im sure. considering this is day one release I Run it very smoothly, average between 4560 frames constant unless Im in a cutscene, they dip down pretty low. But from what Ive noticed, its just another bug because after the cutscene, Im back up to 60s. I run off an AMD FX8350, GTX 780 sc, and 16GBs of ram. I also run it maxed at 1080p with a little tweak to the antialiasing, just incase anyone would wonder. Story seems to have modern day humor in it, very enjoyable as well as returning to the feel of the first Assassins Creed. Coop, is very fun too.
