Yes, Ubisoft made a mistake and released a very poorly functional game riddled with bugs and performance issues moreso than the average game.But these days  thats almost expected.So when everyone else acted like it was a huge deal and started raging about it, I just sat back and waited for the patches to roll in.About a week ago from posting this comment I played through for the first time so I can give an honest review about the game itself and not how terrible it is because theres bugs.Looking back on the game, I only have one complaint  GUNS.  Yea  I know, in this time peroid guns existed and in a realworld scenario it would be much worse.  But this is a game.Ive never been frustrated more out of any Assassins Creed game than this one when it comes to guns.In Assassins Creed 3, Black Flag and Rogue   you could easily counter bullets by using humanbody shields which caused every bullet to be shot and blocked whereas in Unity youre forced to dodge them manually.The dodge mechanic in Unity expects you to know exactly when the shooter is going to shoot  and if theres more than one shooter youre practically screwed since their shots will be on different timers and you can only dodge one.That along with keeping up with melee combat is just too much.What makes it worse?  The shots practically onehit you, forcing you to chug medicine down everytime you get in combat  that and it seems like the NPCs automatically resort to shooting at you if youre more than 5 feet away from them.I wanted to use stealth gear, but was forced to armor up like some sort of medieval knight just so I could live through the bullet storms.Allnall, guns aside, the game itself was pretty decent.It felt a lot like Assassins Creed 2 minus a few features.The focus on multiplayer would probably be the reasoning for that, if they hadnt focused so much on multiplayer then the game would have probably been a lot better as a whole.
