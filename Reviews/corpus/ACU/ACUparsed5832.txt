I couldnt of asked for a better experience from Ubisoft this time around. I took a vacation day from work today to enjoy this game and fortunately it was a good day. The game runs perfectly and it is a beautiful one at that, espeically in 1440p. So far its very fun and the new free running mechanics are amazingly responsive. Highly recommend this game.
