I was hesitant to buy this because of the mostly negative reviews, but Im glad I gave it a chance! Not quite as easy to get swept away in as Black Flag, but easily in my top 3 AC games. Beautiful setting, more personal story, and genuinely difficult stealth driven assassination missions. The customization is also the best its ever been, though not as engaging as Black Flags crafting was. 4 out of 5 stars, pleasantly suprised.
