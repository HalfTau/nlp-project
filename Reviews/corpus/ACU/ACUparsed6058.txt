PerformanceVery fun game, I have not had any issues with crashing, fps drop or anything, Running on Ultra settings Its amazing D. Yeah its got bugs but it is nothing detrimental to gameplay in any way shape or form. As with most games these days just like the whole GTAV online debacle, Ubisofts servers arent working to allow for coop but hey, I can wait for it. I did notice the game freeze up on me once for about 15 sec then resumed where I left off.GameplayGone are the days of the 1 button counter attack instakill. You know have to time your blocks and resume attacking rather than them instantly dying. Combat is still pretty easy once you get the hang of it and you make sure to upgrade your gear.I do have a BOSS computer though so that might be why the game works great for me P       10/10
