Got it on sale for 9.When it came out on launch it was the most clusterfudged release of any AC game on PC. But Ubisoft really seemed to have update and optimized it since then. The game ran and looked good, with a couple of very minor bugs dead AI flying in the air and popup AI.The story is really good too, very important to play it if you care about the AC storyline. Recommend you play ACIII, Black Flag and then Rogue first as it all ties together!
