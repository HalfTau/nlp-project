I wanted to love this game. I wanted SO much to enjoy the coop and new features, vast expanses, and great new introduction to the series. It really does have an easier story and the freerunning is AWESOME, and it ALL is amazing. When it works. This is the FIRST game i have ever refunded on steam. It just was NOT tested and adjusted enough for being ported to PC. It almost feels like they want you to ONLY play it on console.Why I cant play it I have a powerful system that can play games WAY more advanced than this. But when its chugging on a limited small level, and creating a 1second lag between button presses and execution, it becomes less about fighting the bad guys, and more about fighting the game itself. I found myself jumping off buildings, bumping into guards, and getting hung up on geometery because the game simply wasnt running efficiently.I understand if i had a  system i shouldnt write a review. But i dont. The game just wasnt ported well. and its WELL after release now. Lets hope future installments get thuroughly tested before release, because I WANT the AC series to be loved and fondly remembered.
