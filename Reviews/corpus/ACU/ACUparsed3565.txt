Look i loved this game due to me being one of the few that could run it, the people who say this game is flawless because they can run it are idiots i would much rather everyone could play it if it was devved right then there would be ppl to club with. The game itself is great, excellent vistas good missions, still classic ac derp gameplay but the directional parkour system does give some control ie. you can choose not to launch off a tiny rock just because the assassin is always trying to go up. Overall best ac game so far including 2 and i can see how they are trying to blend the mp and sp into one game hence the customization and the dozens of unlocks. Anyway your entitled to your opinion and this is mine, probably should play it before you buy it as there are some differences that some fans hate.
