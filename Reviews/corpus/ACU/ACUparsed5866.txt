The controls are akward, glitchy, and unpredictabe. The story so far is bland, trite, predictable, and not even slightly immersive.I absolutely hate that semicontrol cut scene crap. It is like they reached deep into the bag of things to do to ruin a game and took all of them.I am sick of getting shafted on preorders it is becoming a hallmark of a bad game.After trying to get my money out of this game since refunds dont exist in this industry I wanted to update with a few more hours into itStill sucks although I like the story even less.
