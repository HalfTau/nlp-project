For all people with average pcs, STAY AWAY! This game is not worth the money spent on it unless you have great graphics cards and large amounts of RAM to dedicate to this. I wasted 40 on rhis game, thank god i at least saved 20 on this crap. Im upset with the devs for making this game so challenging to run. If i could get a refund i would, but steam sucks this way.
