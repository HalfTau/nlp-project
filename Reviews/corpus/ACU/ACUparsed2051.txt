I tried my hardest to enjoy this game. What finally broke it for me was the parkour system. Its great when it works, truly. You can go everywhere with such ease. This one however? Dont dare try to actually go where you WANT. Youll end up jumping between beams, jumping over alleys, or just plain out missing exactly what youre aiming for, or even jumping to your death on a synchronization point. The combat is challenging, but not horribly so. Its a good challenge. Some of the stuff you need skills for is amusing. Double assassination, double air assassination, ground assassination, etc. Overall though, I honestly would not recommend this game to anyone. That, and its optimized horribly. I can play Witcher 3 on ultra without a single problem or below 60fps drop. This game? Even on medium Im suffering at around 40s. Its... pretty poor.
