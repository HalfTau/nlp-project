This is one awesome game. Dont know what all this negative talk is. You just have to adjust the detail according to your computer. At medium detail the game looks awesome and runs smooth on my machine. I adjusted the details to low in order to add my little review to this post, and it still looks very good. This game was designed for the next generation of computers, but has setting for the current and older generations.I definitely recommend this game. It is a well put together game.
