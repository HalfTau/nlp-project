When playable its a really good game, this time around you have like only one city to roam about but its a massive one, enemies are more responsive than before, climbing up and down is also much better, history itself and the main character arent strong this time around but there is plenty to do, like the new random event system when you are just about the city,  in this events some times you witness a robbery, assasinations, bullying, etc., wich if completed awards you with point that can be used to upgrade weapons, armors, etc. The bad things in this installment for example are the diversity of chest, because many ones can be only open if you have the companion app on tablets or phones, others require you to suscribe to some ubisoft services also some weapons and armor can only be unlocked if you enter club competitions, service that has yet to be activated after a month or so. Anyway I would recommendit event with flaws couse the gameplay feels more natural than before, giving you the impression to really be an assassin.
