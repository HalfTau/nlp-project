This was honestly my favourite game for the lsat year. It had a cool story line, Arno was wicked and the game in general was fun to play. I met some great people playing this game, shared a few laughs and played the unique multiplayer. resently you made some changes to the game to help patch the game. I love the fact that youre trying to fix the game but now Im unable to play this great game. Honestly Id get a PC up grade for it and everything jus to see the game at maxed out and well be able to play the game beyond the now 10 FPS since the update. I use to be able to run this game at 30 frames at a decent setting with my Alienware 17 containing a 770m. Can you please do something so I can play this game again. I would really appreciate it. This game has truly made my year, from school projects, to hours of online gameplay which I spent with friends I met on here from across the globe.
