Good game but seriously fix yourubisoft!!! They have released 2 updates and are doing the 3rd but they never fix the problem we all have... the ing massive fps drops. Im dissappointed in the issues and the rate they are fixing them at. Im starting to belive they dont know how to fix the fps issues. Farcry 4 better be good because if its as ed as this game ubisoft will be in big trouble with consumers, anyway im gonna go play advanced warfare a triple a title that actually works!
