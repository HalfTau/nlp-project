Bad. Very bad.I could see this being a good game if it could get past its glaring performance issues. I have a GTX 980 and I cannot ever get above 40fps, and I regularly drop into the 2025fps range. That is totally unacceptable, especially considering the graphics card. The textures are horrible, there is a ridiculous amount of popin, and the input lag has made me miscontrol my character more times than Id like to admit. Until theres a huge patch to fix all this, and maybe even if that ever happens do not buy.Dont.
