The new mechanics implemented into Unity are simply amazing. The freerunning capabilities are endless, allowing for endless variants of escape and chase sequences. For me thats a relief, because we all know how much she likes the chase. But regardless, it is a beauty. The customization, you could literally cry over, theres nothing you cant change really. I highly recommend this for any Assassins fan.Yes I have a good computer, no I dont give aabout the ThumbsDown Parade
