This game is heavily dependent on your graphics card. I have tried to play it will my Geforce Gtx 650 and i am getting around about 10 frames. However i bought it the day it released and i have ordered a gtx 980 4g gddr5, if the new card does not work i will be extremelly however i will make an edit when i get the new card. I have a feeling this game is just hasnt been optimized for PC at all. from what i have heard its got a good story and good game play but am only halfway through the first mission so i couldnt say more.EDIT OK, so this game has good gameplay and a fairly decent storyline. It is, however, incredibly GPU dependent. Your processor matters very little  as it does in most RPG, rather than strat games The game is semi demanding even on my 980. I am getting about 4860 frames depending on the environment On ULTRA. I have seen the game pull 3.5 gigs at times out of the 4. The game freezes frequently 2 times an hour for about 4 seconds and then works well. The graphics themselves are stunning as they should be i feel this game is just very poorly optimized and was released way before it should have been. I feel if it had some good optimization it would be an overall 8 or if im generous 9 out of 10.Storyline 7.5/10Combat 10/10Optimization 2/10Customization system 6/10Depth 8/10Side missions 9/10Graphics 10/10
