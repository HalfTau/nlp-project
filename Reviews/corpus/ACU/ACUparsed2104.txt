So I havent finished the game yet, so I cant comment much about the mainstory, but after finishing sequences 15 the mainstory feels quite short and rather simple and easy. That being said, the game runs fantastic, on the highest settings possible for an AMD graphics card I get between 1930 FPS, which sounds horrible, but I think my steam counter is a little off because I see absolutely no juttering or any issues normally associated with such low frames. The game is amazing, and although there are a few bugs, there are very few that I have experienced and none of them are game breaking. The game is beautiful, and I suggest for the best immersion to turn down the brightness to around 2 or 3, and use eagle vision in dark places, and to have the audio set to francais with English in subtitles. It really is a great game so far, and if you enjoy the Assassins Creed series, and have a decent rig, there is no reason you couldnt enjoy this game when it is on sale.My rigi7 2790AMD sapphire HD 7850 1gb12 gigs of RAM
