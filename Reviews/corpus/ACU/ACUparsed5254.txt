Just bought the gold edition and boy do I feel stupid. I have everything set to LOW, and ran every other AC game on Ultra, so wtf is this with the shadow flashing, and my head leaving my body etc... I hope I did not waste my money, and that they fix the problems in this game or I will not be buying the next one!Until they fix these problems, and stop blaming AMD, I suggest you not only look away but run away. Maybe even throw in some parkour.
