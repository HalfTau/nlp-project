The return to familiar game mechanics far more like AC2 than Black Flag is not unweclome the buggy controls are less welcome. The decision to also make two changes to the parkour system are questionable firstly, the habit of leaping on top/behind/beneath random objects, combined with blocking any jump from a rooftop, etc. that would be unsafe.The plot is a little on the dry side to what we have come to expect from what is still an excellent AAA title. However, for such a huge game and AAA endeavour, the single player campaign feels underwhelming and too short.This is an excellent game overall the graphics are beautiful, the music stirring, and the exercise an enjoyable one. But it could have been so much more.
