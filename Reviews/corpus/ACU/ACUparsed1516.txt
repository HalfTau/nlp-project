Definitely the best Assassins Creed I have played yet. The story is somewhat a continuation of black flag, and while not fantastic, is good, but some of the missions get a bit repetive. The story gets better toward the end.I am playing on Win 10 with an FX6300, 8gb ram, and an R9 270 on a 1600x900 monitor with everything high, except environment details, whish is set to medium, averaging about 40  45fps in most areas, except for areas with a lot of people, and oddly,  caves, which cause a fps dip to 29  30. I have not really seen the fps lower than 30 for the settings with which I play. I also see no difference between this and high, but I do get another 10 fps on medium, so dont worry about turning the settings down a peg for the environment.In more than 60 hours of play, I have experienced one crash to desktop and one bug where an air assassination left me implanted in the ground, unable to move, requiring a restart of the mission from current checkpoint. If youre worried about bugs and you have a setup similar to me, dont. Ubisoft did a great job fixing this game. I had a blast with it.
