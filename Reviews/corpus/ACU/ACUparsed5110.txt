aparantlig im the only one whos going to be honest  the game have some major issues like all citizens looks like one giant blob  the character refuses to do what you want him too do  its a little laggy not so bad it stops and need some time before he moves but so laggy some people stop for a sec glitches will happen so far i would not recomend it on pc  but on ps4 or xbox  its probably better its not the worst game i playd its not the best the good part is team work you can do well you have to play it anyway if youre still reading from a scale from 1 to 10 i give it a 6 on pc how it is on console i dont know should you regret not preordering it no
