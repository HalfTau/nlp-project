A few hours in and Im really enjoying the game. I cant understand all the negativity surrounding the game but I get that most of it is to do with performance rather than the content of the game itself. So far the game feels like going back to the AC2 formula, Im hoping there will be more Assassins/Templar lore focus in this game like AC2/Brotherhood/Revelations because AC3 and Black Flag were very good games but the stories just werent as focused on the actual assassin aspect and I already prefer Arno more than Edward Kenway, Kenway was fun but he was an assassin for about 5mins. So yeah, Im hoping for good things, lets see how it goes.
