Now that Ubisoft has fixed a lot of what was wrong in their recent patches....BUY THIS GAME IT IS AWESOME!!!!!Old review belowThe gameplay is fantastic and you will want to keep playing the the coop and the side missions but the main storyline is some what lacking and the combat system is very different and while I like this I also want some of the old combat styles back and then there are the glitches that really make you want to pull your hair out and there is also crashes after 34 hours of gameplay and right now some people are having problems with the game crashing right after they load up their game and if ubisoft can fill this crash problem then this game will be fantastic, but until they fix these glitch and crash problems stay away from this game
