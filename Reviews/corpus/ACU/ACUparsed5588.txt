The most amazing Assasins creed yet. Beutifully rendered and the game play is smooth and precise. I love the way the graphics look down the the steam on the tea you drink. amazing game. though i will admit it takes  a very beefy computer to even touch the game. for those with a high end comp i would suggest this to any library for older comps i would say save up it is worth it. i have yet to drop below 120 fps. And i dont drop below 60 when streaming on twitch very awsome game. love it!
