UPDATED 11.27.17 Just tried loading up the game for a bit  literally took 10min from launch to get the world to load to ingame. I think I saw there was a small update not too long ago. Not sure what it was or what it did but Ive changed nothing on my system and was running great at 60fps on high earlier this year. Anyone else have this issue recently? Completely underrated AC. Most if not all the technical issues that were rampant on release are fixed. I actually never had a single issue with graphics since day 1 I think I might be the only person. Amazingly beautiful game, fairly well optimized now, and a lot of content to get through. A mustbuy for all Assassins Creed fans. Def pick it up on sale if youre unsure. If you have the rig to run it and the time to play it you wont be disappointed.
