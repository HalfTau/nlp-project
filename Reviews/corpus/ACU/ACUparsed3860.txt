Ah, Assassins Creed Unity. Though most people had a fair share of glitches and that caused the game to get worse reviews, I was fortunate enough not to get those glitches during my playing of the game, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The multiplayer, while still a little limited not all missions can be done by multiple people, is still much better than Black Flag, and I found it enjoyable to play with friends of mine. The clubs are an interesting feature added, and though I didnt play around with them too much, still I personally think a cool idea on Ubisofts side. Overall, I liked the game, and recommend it. The singleplayer has a good storyline, the multiplayer missions are fun, and you can get plenty of hours out of the game.
