Graphics are great, the French Revolution setting is amazing and it plays like a normal assassins creed game. You can get a variety of weapons like swords, 2 handed axe, spear, rifle, pistol. I havent tried to play any of the multiplayer stuff.This must have had a really bad launch but its a good game now.
