I feel like Assassin s Creed cannot offer anything new but a different time period and place. It s not totally bad just to create a new story in new city, because reliving historical moments in great cities is why I play these games. Paris is absolutely gorgeous, it is pure joy running around the city, seeing all those monuments you can see in Paris now. Gameplay is even smoother than before and combat is finally pretty hard and challenging. After a while I noticed that setting into French revolution is not used fully, yeah there are some historical figures, spewing some nonsense about will of the people, but in the end I didnt feel like revolutionary material was used correctly mainly because of story which is well...it is not good or bad it is just one of those random stories, templar and assassin nonsense makes even less sense than usually with no bonding elements. They get a plus from me now, but next time, give bigger space to your screen writers ubisoft, or change them.
