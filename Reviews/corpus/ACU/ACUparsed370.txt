Im only an hour into this game, but considering the glitchridden bugfest I was expecting, I had to jump in and write a positive review. Im playing across three screens 6000x 1080 and so far everything is as sharp as a polished console release. The cinematics and UI are nicely centered on the middle screenthank you, to whomever that was at Ubi. I havent played an AC game since I got burnt out on AC3 on PS3, and the trailer for Unity intrigued me when it was announced, so altogether, I am pretty psyched right now to dive into this one.
