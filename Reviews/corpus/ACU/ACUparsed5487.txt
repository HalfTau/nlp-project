Really dissapointing because it was looking like an amazing game, and it proabably is, but not being able to play it because i fall through floors, game crashes, and i cant get fps above 20 is honestly unacceptable. Really hope they fix this one. As of now i wouldnt recommend buying it as it will just be 60 dollars that you spent that just kinda sits there. I would wait for the game to be fixed and for people to give the green light. Good luck to those of you that already bought it and lets hope this thing can be salvaged.
