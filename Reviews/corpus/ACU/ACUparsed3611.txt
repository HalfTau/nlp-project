So far I have been a huge fan of the genre and the previous games, and while this game holds up to the standards regarding storyline, it is just so insanely laggy constantly that it is absolutely unplayable. We were promished a patch that would fix all this months ago and yet nothing has happened yet.DO. NOT. BUY.At least not untill you know for certain these issues has been fixed. Its unplayable as is right now.
