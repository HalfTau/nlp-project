This game is fun, awesome, and offers lots of options for approaches. I see all this hate Ubisoft and the game are getting and I dont understand, ya there are bugs but lots of games have bugs and Ubi is working to fix them, my cpu runs it i finished the game no problem and i still love it seeing as how there are lots of sidequests and collectibles. Only downside I can see is that some content is locked behind the Companion App and I dont like that seeing as how everytime I try it, it force quits, all in all i would rate this game 7.58.5/10. Also the bonus Coop is nice but competitive multiplayer was still fun I like them equally.
