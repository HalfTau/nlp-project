Ubisoft really put in extra effort with this game compared to the rest of the series and it really shows. Crowds are massive and can have hundreds upon hundreds of people in them at a time and the scenery is outstanding compared to the blandness of the rest of the series. Running this game on ultra is quite the experience and is the only fun Ive had in an Assassins Creed title to date. This is really the only Assassins Creed title where you can slip in and out of sight using the commotion of the hundreds of people around you and truly act like an assassin. It is safe to say that when they were met with mediocre reviews due to people with poor computers being unable to run the game they decided to return to their old formula of doing the bare minimum and playing it safe with 1020 people on screen at a time so everyone could better enjoy the pos that is Assassins Creed Syndicate.
