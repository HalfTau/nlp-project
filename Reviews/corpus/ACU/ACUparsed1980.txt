This AC is... the same as every year, but more refined.PROS Great graphics Gorgeus recreation of Paris The gameplay is the most polished of the franchise It have lot of things to do, even if they are sometimes repetitive The coop misions are a very enjoyable The story is better than the others AC You can get into almost any buildingNEUTRAL The soundtrackCONS Is still buggy May get a little bit repetitive Horrible optimisation, with a 980 OC i get 24 fps on ultra Arno Ubisoft UplayRATING 65/100Good game from my point of view, that is ed up by its many flaws.
