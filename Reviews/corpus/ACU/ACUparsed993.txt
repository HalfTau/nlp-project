I absolutely love the AC franchise. I even liked AC3 when it was the action American Revolution missions as opposed to wilderness ones. This game, I was very excited for at first. Bought it at launch. IT SUCKED! The optimization was pure crap, when the game did run. Bugs were everywhere. The game was far from finished. I couldnt play it. I decided to revisit it2 years after release. This game is a completely different being. I get a solid 60 fps with everything up. It looks great. It feel much smoother. I would definately give it a chance if you like this series. I willa dmit the first stealth mission I did not like, but after that its been fun. Is it AC1,2,3 or 4? No, but worth playing! This is the game that should have been released 2 years ago, not that pile of dung we got instead.
