Id recommend it on a sale. I bought it at launch because I was in some huge Assassins Creed obsession. Anyway, this review is based on my experience with the game. So far I havent had any terrible glitches, and I can run it on Very High with a rare tiny bit of lag. Whats weird, is Id say my PC is mediumhighish end. The only thing which is bothering me SO much, is that when I try playing it while talking to friends on Skype or Steams voice chat, their voices mess up so bad I can barely understand them. Their voices go quiet as hell, then loud, and sometimes their voice doesnt even come through. Or, they come through at delayed times. I would REALLY like a fix for this, seeing as no matter how much I search this problem up I cant find anyone else with the same problem. Anyway, the co op, from what Ive played with randoms, has potential. I can imagine that it would be brilliant fun with friends. Unfortunately for me, none of my friends own it. I found the story, so far, to be somewhat dull, but I went to the DLC area, not realising it was intended for players who had beaten the main story, and I liked what I saw. Everything seemed dark and kind of eerie. Im looking forward to playing the DLC.Scratch that. This game is a ing disgrace.
