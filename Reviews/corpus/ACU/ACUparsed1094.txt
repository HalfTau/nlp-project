I usually judge games by one easy criterion If I ended up paying less than 1/hour of playtime, I consider my purchase well picked. Ive been playing this game for five days got it for 16 and have already spent 27 hours on it. Im sure my playtime will continue to skyrocket. Unity has a good story and a great immersive version of revolutionary Paris. I highly recommend it even if its not on sale if you want to wait for one, go for it as the singleplayer is fantastic and multiplayer adds a whole different element. You dont even have to be on a mission to play with friends  you can just invite them to join your version of Paris and screw around for a while. Make sure you have a good graphics card, as that seems to be the main issue. My only complaint is that one of my assassin quests ended up with him in a wall shooting at me until I ran away. Other than that, 9/10.
