I really liked this AC game!So I ended up staying away from this game until now in May 2016 becuase of all the horror stories, but for me at least it looks like the current patched version I played seems to have solved all the bugs I have been reading about since the game came out.  I had none of the glitches or slowdowns others have written about previously.  Playing on Win 10 I dont even remember it crashing out once in my 66 hours playing.  So if you have stayed away because of technical fears like I did, I guess its safe to play now based on my experience at least.I have to say as somebody who really loved the original AC1 game, this game felt the most like that original one to me.  After replaying through all the AC games in order, I can say that they really brought the game back to that special feeling I had in the first game.While I enjoyed the previous pirate games, Im glad they pulled it back to its roots of running around a large detailed city with a bunch of fun stuff to do.  Im really happy all the hunting, sailing, finding a million dumb collectables is gone!The only thing they stripped out too much and was missing to me was the modern day stuff.  They stripped it all out and I do miss that part  maybe not how it was handled in the pirate games but how the modern day stuff was in the original couple games.  I did like the crazy Lucy story.The DLC was also a nice diversion once the main story was over  finding a piece of Eden really took me back to the original games.In Summary Highly recommended
