I would suggest not listening to the reviews quite yet. the story picks up, most people arnt even done the introduction yet. At first the game was buggy and crashed a lot, then they came out with the large patch this morning 1gb worth, fixed most of my problems, i was still crashing at certain points, so i did some troubleshooting, i turned off the game overlay in uplay, and instantly my frames increased, no more crashes so far, and the game runs a lot smoother, i wouldnt say this game is buggy only because of the developers, ive always had problems with uplay.
