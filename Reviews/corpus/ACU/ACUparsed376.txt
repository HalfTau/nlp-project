ProsBetter graphics than any other AC gameOnlineConstons of glitchestons of clipping issues, get stuck many placesmovement and parkour have been reworked, making it more versatile but at the same time creating many more issues to easily get stuck places, its horrible if you have played every single other gamenew parkour mechanics completely blocks player if it believes the character can/is/will be in danger, except it mostly works when its not needed, i can jump off a viewpoint and die, but a smaller building it will block the player from jumping because you may die.. it appears they are trying to make the parkouring more realistic, but at the same time failing the users in other areas i.e. the steam vents under the cafe, maneuvering side to side in buildings, etc...HORRIBLE controls see abovepoor storylinetypical ubisoft open world game, its a medium sized world jampacked with useless collectibles and sidemissionsmicrotransactions
