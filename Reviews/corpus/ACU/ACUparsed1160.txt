I have been a fan for the series for a while now. Even though the reviews were not that great, I decided to buy it anyway. This was a mistake. I have never had an AC game with such a bad story, which in reality has always been 50 the reason to buy it. The glitches have been fixed though, so dont let that hold you back.A final tip for those that decide to buy it play with the hud off! Greatly enhances the experience, it will be easy enough anyway.
