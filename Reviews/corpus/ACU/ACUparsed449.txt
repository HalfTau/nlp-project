Never played it when it intially released but Im glad that I bought in its current mostly fixed state!I thought I was going to hate this game, both as an Assassins Creed and a game in general but after getting a bit disappointed in Black Flag Still like it btw for being more a Insert Pirate game here instead of Assassins Creed, I enjoyed this title for what it was.It has some of the best and challenging combat in the series and does not just rely on 2 button press per enemy like the newer games in the series. The graphics are wonderfully bright and makes France seem super vibrant, the towns are heavily populated giving the world an alive feeling. The parkour like most of the games in the series is always a bit off and sometimes you get climb things you dont want to. The new stealth aspects are real refreshing to see and I thoroughly enjoyed the stealth sections. I really dont understand why this game gets as much hate as it does other than for glitches.Dont know if anyone really played coop but I have no experience in it.Side note Played most of this game on console but bought it again for those sweet maxed out graphicsAlso Personally never had a problem with Uplay8/10
