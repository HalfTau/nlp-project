So today was my birthday. I spent my money on this game preordered it. I finally sat down to play it and what do you know, the game cant even run. Its not the frame rate issue, the pause menu is unreadable mulitple crashes and gltiches. Today was suposed to be a happy day.... instead it is full of dissapointment. I will never forgive ubisoft for what they have done to me. This game runs worse than Rust when it first came out on steam. YET IGN STILL GIVES IT A 10/10 SMH CANT RATE A GAME YOU CANT PLAY!!!! !
