I know there are talks about this game sucks because its fps is always dropping! or too many bugs! but honestly Ive played more and more now, and overall its a pretty good game. There are a lot of contents which makes it fun to play and the story is kinda like Assassins Creed 2 lol.But if anything... if youre the type of person that could adapt to fps drops and admire what the game has to give then I would recommend this to you.
