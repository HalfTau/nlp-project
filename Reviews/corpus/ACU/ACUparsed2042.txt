Cant get it to run. Keep getting ACS.exe has stopped responding. For me this also effects AC Syndicate. Ive verified files, reinstalled games, modified firewall settings, compatibility settings, run as admin, modified antivirus and malware programs, reinstalled PhyX. Seems to be a problem a lot of people are having. I have newest drivers for all my hardware and my computer could run these games at Ultra no problem. Sure hope someone figures this out before the game stops saving Black Flag wont save anymore.UPDATEI was told that any in game app will cause this error. For me, it was AMD Rapture. Once I closed out this application, the game runs fine with no problems.
