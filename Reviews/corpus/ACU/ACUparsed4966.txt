My Specsi7 4790k  4.7GHz, 8GB 1866Mhz, AMD HD7850 x 2 crossfire 2GB VRAM, Windows 8.1I havent upgraded my GPUs in some time because so far I havent had the need to do so. I am able to play pretty much every game on high to ultra settings and get a smooth 60FPS. In most games the performance of my system is comparable to a GTX770 if not better, yet in AC Unity my performance wasMin FPS 18Max FPS 43Avg FPS 25Even when I set the game to the lowest settings, my Avg FPS went up to 28I even tried reducing the resolution to 1600x900 and still my game ran in the mid 40s dipping down to mid 20s in some scenesI have no idea how people are still going on completeing missions. I could not go for more than 5 mins at a time before pausing the game, lowering the settings and trying again. Nothing works. I have spent a ton of money building a decent gaming PC in hopes that i can play the AAA titles at medium to high settings but this is just unacceptable. This is not just a PC issue, its the same for all platforms so I doubt that any patches or updates will drastically improve the performance of this game. If you are thinking about buying this game then dont. wait a few months till Ubisoft does some sinificant performance updates and till this game goes on sale on steam. It is not worth wasting 60, if I had known better I would have waited till this game was on sale for 8 or something.
