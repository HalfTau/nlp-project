So heres the thingIm a fan of AC franchise and also kind of stealth game. But heres the thing.The graphic is legit...So many action, great finishing movements..if youre the guy who love parkour and fighting move, this game will satisfy you.The online feature also actually great about the idea to playin with another assassins and kicking some arses off, but its kinda lack of feature.. maybe to talk each other.. basically we need to communicate in the game.. at least thats what i felt in the online feature.But when the mission is over.. seems like too boring to be played with.And btw the story line is a bit random i think?But overall yah its just good. Not too bad and not too overwhelming great..7/10
