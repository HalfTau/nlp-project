The game as it is on day one is in a ridiculous inoperable state unless your computer is powerful enough to handle the extremely poor optimization that went into this games initial release. Mind you, my computer isnt the greatest in the world, as its coming up on her two year mark, but even with that most games that Ive played recently only required turning down a setting or two here or there. This game required me to turn down EVERY SINGLE SETTING, just to get choppy framerates at best. I dont know why in the world a game company would release a game in this state, with requirements that only the highest end rigs can run, but I have to say that for what it takes just to RUN this game without horrible framerates or crashes from changing the graphics settings, its just not worth it to try.Paris in beautifully done, the massive crowds and open buildings really give the city a more breathable lifelike feeling than pretty much any other assassins creed game that has come before it, yet all of this contributes to the poor performance, leaving this games best assests to be its downfall. I cant recommend this game unless a patch is released or someone finds a way to run this game without the sheer brute force of a VISA assault.
