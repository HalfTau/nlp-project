well after a week and a half of playing this game. i can say, starting the game is slow and slugish and you really have to work hard to get any where in this game. it almost feels like its not worth it. but eventually when you get your charactor built up to a point where you can make real progress. the game gets fun to play. but g.o.d.. d.a.m.n...! it takes forevor to get that badass feeling and acomplishment. the multiplayer aspect should have been much easier at lower levels, so you could build your charactor much faster. but that is easier said then done.anyway..now that i have taken so much time playing this game. as i said it now feels worth my time. the beginning sucks a.s.s. because of how slow it is to get good at this game. there are a few things i got annoyed with tho. an example would be something that was used as a skill that should have been given to the player to begin with. like sitting down and using it as a hiding spot. you had to earn that ability...like WTF ubisoft?skill killing 2 people at the same time?skill sitting at a bench as a hide spot?skill ability to air assassinate 2 people at the same time?i mean its not like they couldnt put the charactor in a training session where he learned these skills?these are like no brainer skills that were way to easy to figure out in prevous games. but for some reason they made them really hard to achive in this game.these are the kind of abilities you would expect the game would at least give you a training on throu arnos training with belec. but no... belec didnt know s.h.i.t. beyond fighting with a sword.the only thing that makes this game fun now is, the fact that i am of much higher level. and thats it.
