The gameplay itself is very similar to previous games, the city is absolutely gorgeous, and the missions are pretty well designed. Stealth doesnt seem to be as much of a factor as in previous games since you can generally sprint in to get the target then fight your way out in most cases.Unfortunately there are a great number of bugs that cause crashing, texture load issues, and problems connecting in multiplayer. There are also a number of objects in the game which you cant acquire or access without metagaming with external apps and the uPlay web community which is currently not implemented or is just broken. I very much want to like this game but until they resolve these issues I cant recommend it.
