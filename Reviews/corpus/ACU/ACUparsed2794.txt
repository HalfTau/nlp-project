Had to take the refund on this one unfortunately I couldnt tell you if it was good or not because it was absolutely unplayable, on the lowest settings, on a PC that handed Rogue which was released at the same time, or thereabouts just fine on high settings. Huge disappointment, but surely there will be further patches to address this.Edit Have now played through the entire game. As of the time of this writing, every issue with the game appeared to be repaired. Never had a single glitch issue or hitch and the game ran at maximum settings no problem.As for the game itself, excellent installment of the AC series. Its what you expect from the game, improved upon the last game. Not much else to say. If you have played Assassins Creed games in the past, you know what youre getting here. As a protagonist, Id rate Arno Dorian about the same as the last couple. Well written, in depth, but not as memorable as Edward Kenway, or Ezio.With this game, as with all past installments of the series however, I recommend buying it on a sale, if only because this is no Black Flag, theres no ground being broken here, for the most part.
