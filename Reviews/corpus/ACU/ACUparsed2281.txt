Despite its infamously rocky launch, I actually feel Unity is one of the strongest games in the series. Big improvements were made to combat, stealth, parkour, and level design. Paris is gorgeous and bustling. I really enjoyed the character customization and coop modes, and Im quite sad they didnt return in Syndicate.The game has received a number of performance patches, and content is no longer gated behind the companion app/Initiates/Club Competitions. With Steam now offering refunds, I really encourage fans of the series who skipped Unity to give it a shot.
