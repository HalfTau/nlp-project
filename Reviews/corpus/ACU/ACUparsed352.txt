Full of bugs, Uses Uplay, but still gets positive because even Goat simulator has bugs, doesnt look as good, but still great fun. Ubisoft really should get its bugs sorted though, with the size of its teams and multistudios, there really is no excuse for some of these game breakers. Regardless, its still a great game.The worst bugs people experience are the game just shutting down with various different errors, usually to do with connection issues, which you can get around in single player... but the point is, this is a mutliplayer experience.Kick in the knee to ubisoft, and pull your socks up now!Most people would rather get a finished delayed game, than an early broken one, but unity is a 2014 game. Pretty ancient now.
