If you dont have a highend PC, youll be very disappointed. If you have one, you still will be disappointed by the low FPS and multiple bugs. My PC 16 GB RAM, good CPU, overclocked Nvidia Titan, latest drivers can play the game at 1080p with everything maxed out Ultra High, TXAA, HBAO, PCSS at 4045 FPS average but during one of the cutscenes I noticed 1718 FPS. At least you dont need D3DOverrider, which I was using with AC4 Black Flag because it doesnt have VSync triple buffering this one has.There are multiple bugs  people half in the ground or inside walls, people appearing from thin air, gaps between textures, the game crashed once when I was browsing the clothing menu, rewards unlocked in Uplay remain locked in the game ...The game is an example of some of the worst business practices in modern gaming  microtransactions, chests that require membership and particular level on AC Initiates, chests that require wasting your time with their mobile Companion App ....  On top of that AC Initiates is not fully functional and partially broken at present time.The gameplay is almost unchanged except some small improvements in the free running and the halfbaked cover / stealth mechanics. No more chain kills. I was pleased that many buildings are accessible and you can enter them. Paris looks really beautiful and some interiors are amazing but this is pretty much the only innovation youll find in this chapter of the series.Unless you are a really big AC fan, dont buy this game in its current state. AC 4 Black Flag was a better game and until they patch Unity and reduce the price, its not worth your money.
