Poorly optimized and glitchy. Also in the menu instead of having a section for the actual game and then the DLC, the main game is thrown into a big list along with all future DLC they plan to release. Straight off the bat, it feels like you arent getting what you paid for.Putting aside the big problem with MACROtransactions, Ubisoft has failed to deliver a fully functional game. Take all the time you want. Delay the release date if you have to. All of that would have been fine. Just seems like you tried to build a brick house with raw clay because you didnt have the time to make bricks. A company that releases AAA games does not get to have the excuse of not enough time.Edit After updates and completion of the game. Im going to add onto this review. Currently, the biggest problem you will run into are the crashes. This might be a special case, but for me the game will crash every hour or so. Though the game saves every damn second, so its not the end of the world. Multiplayer is fun and the customization is a great feature that gives the game a lot more longevity and replayability.
