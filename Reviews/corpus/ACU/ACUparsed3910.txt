Youll probably see a lot of negative reviews for glitches and bugs. I too experieced this, but I figured out why. This is anextgen game that uses nextgen graphics. If your gpu is below a generation 720 Nvidia Geforce is all I know or so, the game is unplayable. Thats not the games fault. Thats your crappy hardwares fault. Beyond graphical glitches involving the gpu, the game is the best in the franchise. The new parkour system is wonderful. People say you cant enter windows, but if you read the tips it says press LT to enter window. The only downsides Ive noticed is an occasional framerate drop in crowded areas and a lack of whistling. Please add whistling Ubisoft. Oh yeah, and club competions are now active so you can obtain legendary armor.
