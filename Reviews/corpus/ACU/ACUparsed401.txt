Are you actually serious. I tried to play this game when you first launched it. I litteraly stopped because i couldnt move anymore 200 000 bugs in 20 hours of gaming. I asked your support team, no understanding or answer. 3 years later im saying hey, lets give them a chance, I still love their games. Well  YOU. You cant do games on computers, stick to console and nothing else, this is a shame, a SHAME. Should not be allowed to sell games like this, this is a disgrace.
