Well, when it comes to this game people have mixed reviews because some experience fps drops, game destroying bugs, poor navigation, and so on. Now I have a GTX 780 and i run this completely fine at ultra. Its relatively smooth and I rarely see huge fps drops. When speaking about the game bugs like npcs falling through floors, I still have yet to experience any. The only bug ive seen which only happened only once, was when two npcs floated up towards the sky. Now, we get to navigation. For me navigation has sometimes been, treacherous, but most of the time I could get around quickly. Dont get me wrong, the gameplay can and WILL seem like Arno is covered in superglue, but that is self explanatory. When people buy an Assassins Creed game these are things that you KNOW are going to happen. I still dont let these bugs and problems hurt my reputation for the game because I consider myself a relatively die hard fan. Assassins Creed Unity, I think, deserves a thumbs up because I had a fun time enjoying the game and still do. For others I understand if you hate it because you probably do experience these bugs, but for me its definetely minimal.
