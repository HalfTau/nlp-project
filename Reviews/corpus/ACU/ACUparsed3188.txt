TLDR Great potential, marred by random framerate drops, game freezes, and the biggest issue of all, save games being lost/unreadable after a freeze.This game has so much great potential, a great art style, great graphics, and gameplay.... But is still marred by framerate drops at random points, LODs popping in and out. Im well above the recommended system requirements, but its still having issues after the update.However, this would be bareable, if it wasnt for a complete game breaking fault. The game can have hard crashes which require a system reboot to get out of. The problem? This wipes the save files, and Ubisoft cloud sync doesnt appear to function. This has lost me 1520 hours of gameplay, and the latest game has made me backup the save files every 2030 minutes. Good job I did, as Ive had 2 hard resets since.Overall? Fix the hard reset and the framerate, and you have a very solid game that has a beautiful, breathing environment.
