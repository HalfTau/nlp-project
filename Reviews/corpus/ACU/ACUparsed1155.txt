How do I put this game into retrospect?Its like biting into a chocolate chip cookie, only to find that the supposed chocolate turns out to be raisins.Its like asking for a dog for Christmas, just to come downstair seeing that the present is smaller than a dog, and a part of you die on the inside.Its like buying something on Amazon, and when the package does arrive you are dissapointed to only find it to be a bootlegged version of it.Need more analogies? Buy this game and youll surely come up with more that you can relate to.Please save yourself from this monstrosity and buy any other Assassins Creed title than this one. For it is that I dont want you to come through the anxiety like I did. This game truly made me buy more Clorox than I needed to.
