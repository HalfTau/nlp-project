Another great Assassins Creed game! The atmosphere is awesome and the more populated streets do really work in that favor.There are a lot of side missions, collectibles and chest to open and maybe to many. The main story is as always not that long.The only thing that I really hate is that lockpicking. It is awefull, not fair and way to arcadi.
