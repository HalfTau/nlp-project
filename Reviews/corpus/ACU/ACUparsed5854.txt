probably the best looking game I have played in sometime, and probably the best old time Paris walking simulator I have played. runs smoothly when using proper settings for your rigvery high in my casethe combat is fantastic, the customization seems pretty great too, not to mention the weapon choices.navigating the world feels great, overall I am pleased with this game.of course, I have notced a couple glitches here and there, but im sure that will be worked out in time. Part of me actually enjoys watching pedestrians sink into the street and disapear, snd the other part of me is kind of upset that I havent seen any of those wierd skinless faces, people are posting in the hub.
