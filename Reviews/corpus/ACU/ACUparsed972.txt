I originally preordered tbis game when it was first available, because the story occurred during my favorite time period. The game was awful, it lagged, it skipped, it crashed. Ubisoft had released it too early, and the patches werent coming in fast enough. So I waited. NowI cant stop playing. Assassins Creed is my favorite ame series, and Unity is absolutely my favorite. Now that everything is corrected, the game runs smoothly, sound is crisp, motion is fluid, its an incredible game. The only problem is sometimes there is massive lagging on coop, but that could be my internet not being as fast as my teammates. Overall, 9/10
