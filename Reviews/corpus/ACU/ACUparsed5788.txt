This game has a lot of potential but they fail to hit the mark. There is alot to do in the game almost to much but the main problem is the fps drops and the fact that if feels that Ubisoft sold out. There are so many micro transactions that it hurts to see, and we are talking like increase your sword damage for 3 min stuff. Its a low blow Ubisoft and im sad to see it happen. Oh and they took away the combos you can do with killing the dudes, how you can go from one dude to the other after killing them.
