Ive been in love with the series when the first game came out up to now and even further on, this game may have bugs and may be glitchy at times but its actually fairly great. Combat is really good but can be glitchy if more than 1 person is attacking the same guy the stealth is fantastic, and everything about it is fun but it gets way way WAY better if you have friends to play along with.i toatally recommened this game, like i said would be much better with friends though.
