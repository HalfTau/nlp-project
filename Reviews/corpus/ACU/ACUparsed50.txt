Unity is a huge improvement over the last game in the series. However, even Packman released now would be better than Rogue was. Just the improved performance in itself makes the game much more enjoyable. However, there are quite a lot of bugs still in 2018. Floating people etc. You can get stuck on the DLC if you accidentally travel there before you intended to. Things like that. And the map navigation is horrible alongside with quest tracker. I never really learned where the home of Arno was. It was easy to lose sight of where you were supposed to go next because the map is full f objects that dont really need to be there.Anyways, it was a decent game. At least I am closer to getting to play Origins now.
