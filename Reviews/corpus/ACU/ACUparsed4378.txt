Yes its true that there are some problems with it, I have had my share of dropped frame rates and coop matchmaking issues, however I was able to play the game from the time I bought it up until now and still running strong. For those of you having trouble, here is my build AMD FXtm8350 EightCore Processor, 8GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970. Runs a solid 60 fps on low settings and goes down to about 40 when not overclocked, overclocked using firestorm software gets between 50 and 59 fps. I totally recommend this game who loves the story line, and with patch 3 that just came out, I have been able to enjoy coop missions with my friends as well as having them join me in my open world of ACU. Happy Gaming people.
