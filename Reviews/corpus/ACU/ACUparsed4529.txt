I love this game. Plain and simple. The combat feels amazing, the animations are fantastic and the voice acting is just as astounding. Ive come to love all of the characters ive been introduced to and I havent had one bad experience with the game itself.Bear in mind, the bad experiences I have had were entirely graphical. I have not run into bugs, although supposedly theyve fixed them anyway. The game is not optimized well. Im running a Nvidia 760 2GB with an AMD 8320 8core 3.50GHz processor and I can only get 30 FPS on High/Medium with FXAA.BUT. It has not ruined the experience of the game for me. Its one of the most solidgameplay titles ive played in quite some time. Dont let the bad reviews get in the way, the game is absolutely fantastic. The customization is MASSIVE with tons of weapons and gear, although I found myself sticking to one chest/hood/legs and such once I got to that point, I find myself constantly changing weapons. All of them and their AMAZING finishers, specifically the spears feel totally badass.Coop is a really fun experience regardless of cooperation among the members, although I found it to be even better when everyone is trying to stealth rather than go in swinging. 2man missions seem to be the most fun and easiest to coordinate.Keep in mind that combat is challenging this time around, its not like the other ACs which from what ive seen you just counter which  a kill. You actually have to plan engagements, try to stealth, or if you ARE going to go headon, take them in strides. Dont try to 1v8. You WILL lose.If you were on the fence before, id say give the game another week or two, wait for the optimization patches Ubisoft announced theyre working on to come out, then pick it up. Its definitely worth a buy.
