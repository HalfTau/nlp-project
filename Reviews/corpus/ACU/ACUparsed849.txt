Well. Before I start, I want to mention I played every Assassins Creed title and have to say this is the most disappointing one.Beside gameplay and technical issues, 9000 bugs and a lamestoryline, theres like millions of collectibles and othernoone cares about just to fill this wannabe open world game with something to do.Positive The mystery murders were pretty cool, parisian stories too, and I like that you can create your own style with various clothes etc. Multiplayer is fun, too, though there are not enought missions.Absolutely negative Everything else.And the ingame microtransactions are just disgusting and a ing SHAME to an Assassins Creed title.3/10, would not recommend buying this piece of trash unless youre a true fan of the series.
