Well theres a lot of haters out there.I played a lot of AC Unity, and got like 2 bugs. None of them like the ones people are crying about.Some people said the game has no story... WTF?The graphics are nice, the plot is cool better than the AC III.Insane moves, its really like Arno is a le parkour pro.Descend controls, you dont have to go to a ledge, than turn around, press b... and so on.The customization part is nice, you now can only carry a light weapon and a fire weapon. Or heavy weapon and fire weapon. You have to choose between a revolver and a rifle, you cant have both... Makes sense.The gears, the skills... Its a pretty nice mechanic.Havent played coop, nor joined a club. Just finished the game with some side quests.Some people were crying about the sides... Havent seen any problem, the sides are fun.Its like any AC game... The game core is the same. And thats the formula Ubisoft will always use... S dont cry when another AC game comes out.
