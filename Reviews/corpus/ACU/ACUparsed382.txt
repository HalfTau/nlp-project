I would buy with exreme caution.........Out of all the assassins creed games i own on pc i own all of them... this game still runs pretty bad.Tthe DLC underground areas run at like 15 fps on my system. I also own the game on xbox and runs liketheir aswell PC master race will always win... anyone whos played the game knows its one of the worst ports even to this day. Dosent matter if you crank the settings on anything below the current generation of hardware. the story is pretty boring and is not nearly as good as any previous creed game.I know i have older hardware. Really dosent matter becuase I can still max out games that come out in 2017. so whatever anyone says about how great the port is it wont matter because most people cant afford a 600 doller GPU for a game that isnt good to begin with.SPECSFX 6300 Overclocked 4.4 ghz ON AIR hyper 212    likely the bottelneck here but still withen games specEVGA GTX 770 SC slightly overclocked    card is withen games requirments12gb of 1333 ram ram spead has been proven not to matter in gamesADATA SSD/ game on 7200 RPM drivePast the systen requirements I would say they put enough time into this game for a ON SALE buy only.
