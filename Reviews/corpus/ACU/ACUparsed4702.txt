I have played the game for about 40 hours now, finished the story and played lots of coop. Do I recommend this game? Yes, absolutely! Its a fantastic game and I have yet to encounter any gamebreaking bugs and glitches. It runs good at very high settings on i5 4670 and GTX 760, and the graphics are stunning!Score 9.6/10
