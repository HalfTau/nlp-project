Honestly, for how muchthis game got with its horrendous launch, its not the worst game ever. Arno and Elise are fairly interesting characters, the story wasnt too bad, the french setting was well done, and the addition of the multiplayer missions was a welcome feature even in late 2017 there were still people playing them so I got to experience a few of them with other players. However, the game is still, after all this time, a buggy mess certain cutscenes still bug out, the new freerun mechanic was implemented poorly which causes a bit of navigation problems, and overall the game still feels like its unfinished.I usually 100 these games as I do enjoy the franchise a lot but this was the first game where I decided to skip all of that, and halfway through the game it really started becoming a chore to finish because I wanted to get it over with so I could move on to Rogue which is fantastic by the way lol.
