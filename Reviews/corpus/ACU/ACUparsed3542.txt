Even though this game has a lot of bugs it is still fun and has a nice environment/story.The major 2 bugs I experienced are freezing for about a second every 5 minutes or so my save got bumped back 3 sequences with the latest patch but it doesnt bother me that much. I have a 970 and a i75820 4Ghz and I get about 55 fps on ultra. If you dont have a highend computer you probably wont enjoy it much.
