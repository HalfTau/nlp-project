I have only one problem with this game, the frames per second are just laughable. I get 20/30 FPS on a GTX 980... it drives me up the wall. I would say to anyone looking to buy this game that they should wait until Ubisoft releases patches that fix this. I mean come on, what does it take to run this at 60 FPS? An Nvidia Titan?
