I like this game, I really do, but theres just so much mistake in this game. I finish the game already and after a few days, my data was gone, had like lots of credits in it too and that just pisses me off so much. And this didnt just happen to just me..... so until then, I want a refund unless they can comfirm that they will fix it, its just heart breaking to see your data fly away when you put in so much effort in it.
