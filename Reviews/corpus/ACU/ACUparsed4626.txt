Why would they do this? Why would I buy this? HOW DID THIS MAKE IT PAST PLAY TESTERS? WERE THERE EVEN ANY? Did Ubi pay Satan to give them hells sewer offrun to create this colassal piece of ery? Is an asian man driving this game? I dont even like racsict jokes, but this game made me so upset that I had to use an asian man to describe JUST HOW MUCH this game crashes. Ubi, you were okay, I hated UPlay, and now, I hate to say it, I hate U... bisoft. Get it? I hope Far Cry 4 isnt as ed as this game is...R.I.P.
