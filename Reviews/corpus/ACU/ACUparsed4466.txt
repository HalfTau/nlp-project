The game is amazing, with cinematic graphics, great story and a really immersive gaming experience, bringing us back to the French Revolution. But as everyone already knows probably, the game is filled with a bunch of annoying bugs, that should have been fixed before the game release. I noticed that the story isnt like the other games of the franchise, because it is WAY more focused in Arno Dorians story, and not in the history itself of the French Revolution, wich i a BIG disappointment for me. Dispite this, I think the game is worth buying, with a whole new awesome features, like Arnos customization and the Coop mode, wich is probably the most expected multiplayer mode of all the other games.7/10
