I bought it with two friends for PC during the half off sale. Two of us had never played anCreed title before so it was a new experience.ProsSingle player is relatively short but fun, you start to get sick of it right as it endstheres a lot of subquests you can do which range from alright to pretty decentlooks pretty enoughsome RPG aspects with being able to choose gear and buy stuffwhen multiplayer works, its fantasticYou can set up private lobbiesConsWhen multiplayer doesnt work which is like 30 of the time the game is damn unplayableFor a game where coop was so advertised and marketed, you can get through all the coop missions in an evening, so the coop content feels short and lackingThe glitches in this game are mostly aesthetic and funny, but there will be times when an NPC might not spawn or might glitch out of an area, which could cause you to fail a mission or you and your teammates might be killed by ghosts who you cant target.Overall what the game does well, does well, but what it does poorly, does very poorly. I got it with friends and we had fun, but if youre just getting it for yourself Id say hold onto your livres.
