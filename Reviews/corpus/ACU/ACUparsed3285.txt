I Do not recamend this game to anyone becase it has contless bugs. The first bug of this game is geting it to run if you dont have a super computer this is imposable. The seoned bug is if you open your contacts list evryone in the list has the same name. The next bug is when you kill someone their modal glichis out and sometimes his face disapers. Another bug is there is a guy that will randomly telport to you to ask you to join a coop game most of the time he is stuck in the grond and you cant interact with him to join the game. The next problum is the game can get so laggy that the game looks like a slideshow. Ubisoft released a patch to try to resolve it but insted it made it even more laggy. I extremly recamend that you dont buy this game. I have a 1,000 pc and I still have bugs and the game lags.
