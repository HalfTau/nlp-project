I am a big fan of AC. I pre ordered this game and was extremely disappointed by it...............I will start with something nice, the city of Paris can be very beautiful in this game. Thats all the goods I have to say......Now the truth, its buggy, its laggy, I played for 20 hours, completed the main story line, worst AC storyline and ending ever, 80 of the ending doesnt make sense as if someone came up with the idea in like a 30minutes deadline. I fell through the floor into whiteness a few times, coop mostly laggy where we all stand around not able to move or fight at all 100BM cable and no issue with other games. The so call mystery games are like 5 years old detective games and again those arent really that logical at all. And the worst part of the game, the enigma is a total wtf? I would play AC 1, 2, 3, 4 all over again than play this disappointing piece of crap. Its like that want us to hate this game, maybe the Templars overtook Ubisoft and want to kill Assasin Creed and Start a new Templars Greed or something.
