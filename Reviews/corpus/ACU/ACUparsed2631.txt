Im a real fan of Assassins creed, and im always passionate about every serie I love. I can love almost everything FF13 and cie, for example... but... this game... just no. The gameplay inovations are good and Paris is beautiful even with the bad graphics I have to use because this game is so demanding, but this is all that I can find enjoyable. Honestly, Ive never given a bad review to a game, but this game have so many glitches, bugs, I question if it was even tested before its launch... even after the patches, crashes, getting block on nothing, fraquent server problems and one FKING near impossible QTE. This is my first dissapointment in the series, and it even make me douct about buying Syndicate.
