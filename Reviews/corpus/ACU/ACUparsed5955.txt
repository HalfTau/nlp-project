As of this moment this game is horrible. I played about 10 or 15 minutes of it and found that the game was not graphically optimized. Also, I jumped through the map twice randomly walking around. First mission was bugged for me and I had to restart, the game at this point is unplayable. Back to the optimization, you cant run this game on 40 frames! I was on low and pulling 20 at best and my specs are pretty good. Ill put it like this, I pull 60 frames on BF4 on the Shanghia map, I pull 20 while walking on the street on this game.UpdatedI have delved deeper into this game and it is still trash, the AIs gun usage is insane! Guns were probably the worst addition to the Assassins Creed series by far. The gun usage is very annyoing, there has been many a times where I have been fighting 10 guys and at least 4 of them are shooting me at point blank range. Now some people dont have a problem with this, to those I say this How? mainly because they lock on, and in the middle of a fight with like I said 10 guys, its hard to try and roll around and parry incoming attacks at the same time.
