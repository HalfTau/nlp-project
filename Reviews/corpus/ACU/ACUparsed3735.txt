Well the gameplay seemed fun I didnt personally have any real framerate issues personally. Well then why am I giving this a bad review? Well to put it simple bugs ruined what could have been a really great experience for me, if you want more details keep reading.Ive fallen through the mapIve lost my save file on the cloudAfter turning off cloud saving my new file became corruptedSometimes I encounter a bug which causes nothing but my map and pausing to workI cant open initiate chests now that Im not saved on the cloudvarious other bugsNon bug related things I hated about the gameMicrotransactions?The companion app, yes its useful and I like the idea but certain chests in game are not obtainable unless you use the app. The app also has a premium version... Its not needed for anything in game from what I understand but seriously?If you die the spot you marked on your map disappears.In my opinion the interface could be betteronly 1 save file slotThere are some good things thoughGranted Im only on sequence 3 the plot seems really interesting so farFreerun has been improved in my opinionthere are now skills you can unlock, I havent progressed far but it seems pretty solid so farCombat is harder, the counter kill and chain kill skills are gone but I kind of felt it should have been a high level skill instead of leaving entirelyThe game looks greatpretty great animationsAgain the game seemed pretty good when it worked, I just cant recommend this game until all the bugs I have run into are fixed. I have asked some people if they have founded a fix and the general responses I get are Get a better computer and Use patch 4 I am using patch 4 and I certainly dont need a new computer to play this. If These issues are fixed I will glady update my review once I finish the game but until then I will wait for patch 5 and hope that it fixes many of these problems.
