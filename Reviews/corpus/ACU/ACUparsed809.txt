Assassins Creed Unity is the best game from the series Assassins Creed because of its narratives and endless procesion of historical figures that have come to define the series. Firstly, Unity  is the only assassins creed game that has the mode COOP which provides players the chance to focus on a completely different  story with their friends . In addition to this , I trully believe that COOP is better than multyplayer because I think that killing each other for a rank is quite boring when playing side by side to assassinate some bad guy can get you more focused on the game or simply more relaxed . Secondly, I consider that Unity has the best story so far , after Assassins Creed Brotherhood , ofcourse , because is keeping your mind in the game with the assassinations chain from the lowest rank to the highest and I think that the most important part of the story is the moment when Arno is being fooled by the blacksmith.
