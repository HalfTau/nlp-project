i was very skeptical about buying this game, given all the negative reviews concernig the bugs. I downloaded and started playing a couple of days ago, and i have to say that this is one of the best assassins creed i have played. I am not sure if others are still expericencing the technical issues they had, or if it has been fixed with the latest patch. Anyways, i haven an  i5 processor,2gb 750ti video card, and 8gb of ram. The weird thing is i have all but shadows on ulltra settings, and experiencing no framerate drops or technical issues. I Should also mention that my motherboard has a 120gb ram dedicated to it for performance.
