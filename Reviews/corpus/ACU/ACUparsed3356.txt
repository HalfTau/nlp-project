This game tries many things, but sadly failes miserably. To keep things spoiler free Ill say the plot is boringly average. Its the standard revenge trip and you have to kill countless people to finally reach the person responsible. Its boring plot and you dont really care about any of the characters within the game. Now stepping aside plot another big issue this game has is its controls. Yes, the horrible controls return and worst then ever. Arno wants to grab onto anything and the controls are responsive some of the times, but still there will be momments when you want to rip out your hair due to frustration. And Finally the cherry on this painfully average game. The glitches/ai. Yes even after patch 4 the game still stutters and has framerate drops. I have a lenovo y 50 with an 880 geforce gtx graphics card and the framerate dips under 30 on MEDIUM graphics settings many many many times. And there are still bugs to where there is clipping disappearing and reappearing civillians, Civillans that drive around in an invisible clown car and run across the streets. I dont know what ubisoft was thinking but quanity over quality is never a good thing. Especially when the game will run like completebecause of it. Another gripe I have with the game is the detection mechanic. Sometimes the Ai will be completly ing stupid and forget where you are even though you are in front of them. And then there will be times where they can spot you miles away. Another thing is the combat. Yes it is difficult but only difficult because the game fights with you because of the controls. If youre going to try to copy Arhkams fighting then atleast do it with respect. Not this halfgarbage. Seriously I was looking foward for this game and to see its still this bad is disappointing. Stay away from this game. There are better games out there worth your money. If you are a fan of the franchise, still stay away. Ubisof cannt get a pass for this piece ofexcuse of an assassins creed game.
