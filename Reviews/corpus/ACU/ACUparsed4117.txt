What to say.... Its okay.... Assasins Creed games after revelations havent exactly been  wow. This game packs lots to do, varying from coop missions, a sadly short campaign, things to find upgrades to be had an all that other good stuff. However. Buggy characters, ocasional glitches and horrible framrates no matter what setting you choose continue to plauge the experience. There a few things that could make this game worlds better. For instance patches which is a no brainer. FPS fix because honestly i dont mind lowering my graphichs if my fps is smooth but seeing as it really makes no difference its just sad. I would love to see more coop I honestly enjoyed them and played them over and over. However i evaded some as they are hella buggy and you seem to die from invisible enemies but again patches. This game promised alot and it deleiverd but subpar if they patch these thiings up and throw in a few more coops ill have almost no complaints besides the story Dont get me wrong this review isnt the most positive but this game was honestly great to play. Im also very happy wtih the compensation to AC gold owners like myself and the suprise that they didnt downgrade the graphichs this time because the game frankly looks amazing. Im not really looking forward to victory until they patch up unity then ill consider the new ac game next year but until then get your act together ubisoft and you might just have a loyal customer D
