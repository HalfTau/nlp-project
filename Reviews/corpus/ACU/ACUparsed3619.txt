This is a good game and a gorgeous one when it works as intended. I like to play Assassins Creed in the most stealthy way possible, minimal kills non lethal if possible and avoiding open fights if I can the way the major assassination target missions are structured fits my desired playstyle quite well. I have enjoyed my time with Assassins Creed Unity so far, only being annoyed by the random technical problems here and there. Nothing can excuse this games disasterous launch though, we must make sure we never forget that when talking about Ubisoft.
