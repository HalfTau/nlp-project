I always liked the AC Games, mainly because I liked the stories behind them, the brotherhood vs the templars conflic is amazing, I always enjoyed jumping from roof top to roof top, and no other open world game got me reading every little piece of detail I find. So where does Unity stand?Gameplay  The same mechanics from pass AC games is here, you roam around the world doing side missions or follow the main story, you can run the roofs of buildings of france during the great french revolution or run the streets of violance filled and torn down city. The game does a great job with the same parkour system, and the new one button hold smooth decline system works great, even tho sometimes the parkour system does get in the way of the new implemented stealth system, cover needs work specially in areas where I intended to free run but put me into cover against the wall and died.Visuals  AC Unity is by far one of the prettiest games I have played, France looks stunning, the texture work is jaw dropping even on low settings. But the game has serious performance issues. The only way I can get 60 FPS is if I turn shadows to low and AA off at 1920x1080p resolution on a single GTX 960 card. Which kind of does let me down, but since launch most of the bugs have been gotten rid off, into the 7 hours I put in I only ran into 2 graphical glitches and some pop ins in majorly populated areas.Combat  The same combat system is here, you attack, perry, shoot or dodge. Nothing really new but still works.Overall AC Unity is a solid game, but I do wish Ubisoft took some risks with the AC games and introduce something new, the games do feel washed out but the story and lore of the games are very much still rich.7/10 Great game with some let downs and performance issues. I do recommend this game to any AC fan. But things like microtransactions and the same combat system doesnt let this game reach its full potential.
