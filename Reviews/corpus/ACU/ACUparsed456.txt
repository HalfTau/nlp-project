I dont like to complain. I really dont expect much from half the games i buy either.However... during the sale last week, I picked up two copies of this game for mlady and myself, so we could play coop.It is giving me hell, i dont think i should have to alter my firewall settings, or open all my ports to make a game that has a major coop portion work.After adjusting my settings a bit, Ive managed to group up with a stranger. Cool, i guess, but this is not what i want.I didnt want another single player experience, but it appears that is what I am stuck with until I spend several hours attempting to teach myself a good bit about networkingvery disappointed, will not be buying another ubisoft title again.TLDR Coop connection is trash
