Still stutters every 3 or so seconds, which causes your camera to turn 90 degrees in a random direction and loses imput commands. Makes the game unplayable and frustrating. I tried the community suggested fixes and a few I found on google, but they didnt work.Graphics look good and the story seems interesting for the little bit I was able to play.I do not recommend getting this until it has been fixed.UpdateAfter turning off sli the problem became less frequent and the game was much more playble. Though sometimes it would return which required restarting the game.5/10
