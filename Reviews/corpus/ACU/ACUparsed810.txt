Not a very enjoyable game. Mechanics and movement are completely off. The biggest challenge in this game is to get Arno to go where you intend. Hes magnetic when close certain surfaces that he either goes the wrong direction, go further than you intend or refuses budge, etc.Maybe its the broken mechanics I grew weary of, but now, I SIMPLY have no desire to play this game. I really dont much care what happens to the characters either. They just fail to grow on you.The story line is boring. AC3 had a way more polished story compared to this.Only good thing I have to say abou this game is the graphic mostly during the cutscenes.I have TRIED to invest time in the story line, but, this game is just not very good  even after the patches that allegedly fixed the game. The 29 whatever hours was me trying restart the game multiple times for fresh play through in hopes that it might eventually be interesting  clearly it hasnt worked.Get it on a sale if you still have a burning desire to waste your money and time.
