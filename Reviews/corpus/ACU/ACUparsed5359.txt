Im running on a GTX 980 and i7 4790k with 16gb ram, and I have been playing with the graphics settiings maxed out. Between the game patches and my own troubleshooting, it took me a week to make this game playable. Be cautious about buying this game if you have a less powerful systemthere seems to performance issues with most systems.GRAPHICS  Unity takes photorealism to a whole new level. Games like bf4 are photorealistic, but they look like a 2D photo. AC unity is the first photorealistic game I have played that actually looks like a three dimensional world. Lighting effects and textures are better than I have ever seen in a game. I have not yet benchmarked for framerate, but it does not look noticably low I would guess im around 4070fpsGAMEPLAY  Crowds are bigger and more lively than ever. This has some unexpected downsides, as it was difficult to run through the city on the ground. The climbing system has been improved so much, you wont mind. The weapon system finally give us some customeization in the AC universe, but combat plays out the pretty much the same no matter what you choose.OVERALL Expect your traditiional ACa world that is more realistic and lively than ever.
