UPDATEThere are still a lot of tehnical problems with the game but the more I start to get into the game the more i  like it,the story is amazing and the gameplay is fun,th combat is a lot harder than other ac games and I often find myself killed or running away from a figth when I battle too many enemies at once,I still reccoment you buy the game.This is coming from an Assassins Creed fan.First I wanna say that Ubisoft made a great job with designing Paris and the story is good so far,I dont have an opinion on gameplay yet because I cant run the game at decent fps even on low,the problem with that is that I have an R9 270x and even on low I cant run the game at solid 30 fps,the PC port is a mess,there are animation bugs and you will get stuck in place often for no apparent reason,I have played 3 h so far and I dont intend on playing anymore untill the game gets fixed.Remember how WatchDogs PC peformance was bad?This is 10 times worse.I remember a year ago Playing Black Flag on my PS3 at launch and it was amazing,there were no bugs and glitches at all and I could enjoy playing the game unlike Unity.Ubisoft NEEDS TO GET THEIRTOGETHER and stop with publishing unfinished games across all hardwarethat means ps4 and xone too,I do actually reccomend the game because the scale of it is amazing,im just gonna buy rogue for ps3 till this gets fixed.
