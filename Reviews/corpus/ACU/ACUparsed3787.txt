POST PATCHES REVIEW. So this is a review for the game itself, not the plethora of bugs. The game is pretty much patched up.ProsNear perfect parkour, reminisant of AC 12BEAUTIFUL graphicsA couple of interesting Side acticities such as Investigations.Decently implemnted coopActual assassination missions a la AC1ConsStripped away presentaion No homestead, no boats, one city, no competitive multiplayer, a lot of these previously implemented things are absent for no apperent reason, theres nothing much to do at all.Micro transactionsCONTEXTUAL HIDDEN BLADE meaning no running with ur blades out and more often than not, having to fight people you couldve just instastabbed in previous games.Terrible combatMICRO TRANSACTIONSResetting missions w/o restocking ur equiptment, meaning youll have to go regather equiptment after each failure Unless you want to instantly pay for them with ing MICRO TRANSACTIONSBoring storyUninspired Ezio 2.0 with less charm lead characterRediculous difficulty spikes Seemingly to make you buy upgrades with MICRO ING TRANSACTIONSDid i say the hidden blade is contextual now? Cause thats really ing irritatingShoddy cover/stealth system that is a massive hinderanceHawkeyed AI thatll spot u from across a courtyard if u move out of hiding for more than a split second.Theres more cons, but writing this review is making meoff. The point is, AC UNITY is a nice little tech demo, but its completely soulless and incredibly lacking compared to previous games like the stellar AC4. Hopefully now that they have the basic technical aspects down, they can make a FULL game on the new engine that doesnt resent its players for not shelling out more money.
