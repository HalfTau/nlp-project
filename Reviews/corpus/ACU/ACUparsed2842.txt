Its a great game. I  recommended it except for a couple things. I still like it, but it couldve been far betterI think it is worth buying now for the discount and that a few things have been fixed. Its still a fun ASSASSIN game, not so much for an AC game.ProsGreat Main missions and some side missionsgreat navigation, stealth, combat, customizationlooks amazingfun coopwhen it worked...Consstory line was all rightreally poor optimization. I was fine except for a white fog glitch, but that turned out to be my graphics cardcompanion chests and initiates chests BUT thats fixed nowThis is a more personable opinion but there really wasnt as much french revolution as I thought there would be. Napoleon got little attention. As did Robespierre, he was in a couple ending missions, there wasnt as much guillotine action as I wished there was. There were a few dotted around Paris, I just wished more missions involved that. I guess I wished there was more Reign of Terror stuff and Napoleon. But thats just me.
