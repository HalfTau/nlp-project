ProsConsDespite the minor technical issues and the lack of replay value, this is still my favourite AC thus far. The drawbacks are not as noticeable as the game itself is actually quite amazing. The graphics is amazing, the narrative is relatively engaging and interesting, the parkour and free running system is probably the more fluid next gen game VS Syndicates horrible system. In this game, parkour has been made significantly easier with the newly implemented parkour up/down system, which allows you  to scale buildings with more ease. The ability to gain access to virtually every single legacy outfit is a huge plus as well. I strongly believe that this tradition is one of the more important elements of the game, and its a huge pity that Syndicate decided to only introduce 2 of the many possible legacy outfits.This game attempts to bring back the oldschool combat that was seen in the first AC game, and I really like it. Im also a huge fan of the wide variety of customization items available. However, its a real pity that this game had so much potential yet Ubisoft decided to just downgrade it as usual. Even the mission we saw in a trailer/walkthrough at some gaming convention was designed specifically for showcasing the game. It wasnt even in the final game. Nor were the other 3 assassins that worked alongside Arno. Its a disappointment that this game couldve been so much better, with the newly reworked parkour system, new graphical engine, the vast open world, and the coop missions.
