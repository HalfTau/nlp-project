Ive spent my first 3 hours doing everything I can trying to keep this game from crashing. Ive rolled back the drivers for my video card. Played the game in Offline mode. Disabled the Overlay. You name it, Ive tried it. However the game still is unplayable for me. The term that comes to mind is that its A Broken Piece of and thats only 40 anger talking.I had less problems with Arkaham Knight. What the heck Ubisoft?!?!?!? !But seriously, its a shame that after 2 years this game is still unplayable for many. This is probably the first game that I would say just buy the console version for. Although I dont want to in any way encourage lazy behavior on Ubisofts part for future PC ports, so Id just say skip this game.UPDATEAfter upragding to an RX 480 I was eventually able to play through the game at a solid 40 fps, the true cinematic expericne Ubisoft envisioned... While the game didnt crash after that, my performance still seemed to be bottlenecked by my CPU i5 2500K so areas with large crowds lagged horribly.
