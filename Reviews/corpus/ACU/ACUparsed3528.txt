Manage to punch in 7 hours in one sitting, I havent gotten up, and I havent got any work done what so ever. And I thought the sun was still up.... This game melted my day away for sure. 9.5/10 .5 off for the very occasional bugs, people tend to exaggerate about the bugs, theyre still there, but its not horribly unplayable.
