Extrememly poorly optimized, shadows jump around seemingly randomly, controls are confusing at times and at others completely unworkable, game freezes constantly even on a well built system and physics objects cloaks, scarfs etc. flail about randomly I do not reccomend this game in the slightest 0/10.
