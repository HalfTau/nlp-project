A lot of time has passed since this game was released, but it looks like they never managed to fix the technical issues. Every time I tried it, the game stopped working after only a short time of playing. The longest time before it crashed was about half an hour, and eventually I reached a cutscene during which it would crash every time. Im going to request a refund.From what little of the gameplay I could see, it seems like a standard fare Assassins Creed game. If you like the series, you could go ahead and give the game a try. If youre lucky itll work for you.
