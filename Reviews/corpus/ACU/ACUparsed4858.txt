I think its an alright game. I dont have much experience with Ubisofts games having only played AC Revelations before.Ive had a LOT of fun playing this game. Sure, there are problems like freezes, little glitches here and there, etc., but overall I think this is a fun and immersive game.8/10 maybe being generous here, but I havent experienced ANY of the problems people are saying they are experiencing. The only strange things Im getting are freezes during cutscenes that take maybe 10 seconds, and then the odd person going through a floorOverall, a fantastically fun game, with absolutely stunning graphics. Maybe a bit more worth it at a lower price.
