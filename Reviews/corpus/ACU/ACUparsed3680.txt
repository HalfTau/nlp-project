I keep buying AC games thinking Ill be entertained  and I keep playing them in a feeling of deep frustration. I have not found a single AC game fun. Sure, there are fun moments, sometimes fun long interludes, but these games are so deeply flawed at times its a wonder that they dont come with a warning  You will be annoyedUnity is no different. Its horrible. Theres an interesting story, beautiful graphics, fantastic settings, good acting which is all ruined by completely hopeless, useless, face slappingly bad controllability of the character nothing new of AC and that constant nagging thought in the back of your mind think just once theyd get it right.If you can stay away from this title you will miss out on a great story but save yourself hours of frustration. If I was a bit smarter I wouldnt have bought this and saved myself the aggravation.
