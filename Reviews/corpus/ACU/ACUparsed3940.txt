This game is so unstable its almost unplayable. Ive spent 26 hours in this game and AT LEAST 5 of those hours were spent replaying missions that I had to restart because the game suddenly became unresponsive for no discernible reason. Will be running at a consistent 45 fps. then BAM! Go  yourself.Processor                                IntelR CoreTM i54690 CPU  3.50GHz, 3501 Mhz, 4 Cores, 4 Logical ProcessorsInstalled Physical Memory RAM24.0 GBAdapter Description                NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770
