I have grown tired of the Assassins Creed franchise shortly after Assassins Creed 2. While I have put approximately 6 hours into Assassins Creed 3 and Black Flag I never found myself interested enough in sticking with them to the end.Unity is actually a very impressive feat for Ubisoft and for the franchise and despite a few very minor bugs that may pop up every few hours most of the bugs seem to have been addressed and that ones that linger seem to be aesthetic glitches the game is actually a joy to play!My favorite aspect is the setting of the game, Paris is recreated with such mastery its incredible. Controlling your assassin is SOO MUCH BETTER that it doubles the fun in running around this virtual playground. Story isnt bad, kind of standard but not bad, though I donr really care for the main character as much as I did Assassins Creed 2s Enzo.Being able to traverse through out door to indoor interiors back to out door is seamless and fantastic keeping up the momentum and cool factor.Try it! You can always get a refund from Steam if its not to your liking or your PC cant run it.
