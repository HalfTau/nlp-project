I will update this if patched.Systemi7 92012gb RamGigabyte 7870Apple Cinema Display 30I disregarded the overwhelming number of negative reviews and still bought this game.  My computer isnt nearly as powerful as it once was, but with a 7870, I can run most games on very high settings with decent FPS.  I figured that the bugs might be annoying, but with patches already being released, I wasnt too concerned.Big Mistake.In AC5, I can barely control the main character.  I wasnt even able to complete the opening sequence without quitting in frustration.  In fact, I can hardly control the menu when attempting to lower the graphics settings.Im not expecting perfect frame rates with my system, but I at least should be able to play the game.  Shadow of Mordor worked fine.  AC4 ran perfectly.  Skyrim runs in 2650x1600 resolution in Ultra on my computer.This is just plain bad.
