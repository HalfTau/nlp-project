I pre ordered gold edition in order support the developers. Overall, I am very upset about optimization and glitches, it is horrible really. Contextually I do not have anything say because most of the assassins creed games are written well.  Graphics looks decent. I am sure art direction is great too,Please do not buy until bugs are fixed. Save your time and money. I am still trying to understand how big company like Ubisoft does not have enough testers on board. You work on this game for four years and this is what you come up with?To be completely honest, I rather prefer to wait six months more but to have something decent,If they fix bugs and optimize this I will be happy to change this review,UpdateAfter 1.20 update Game still not good. Hair is all over the place. At least you do not fall to eternity for now. Frame rates still sucks. Maybe Ubisoft should put a new setting called Very Low.I guess it will do the trick for some of us. In order to play this damn game you have to buy new hardware. Maybe even two GPU s to run perfectly and invest at least 1000 bucks.Also why is everywhere is so crowded in the game? Do we have to see thousands of NPCs? Well if we have to see why do not optimize it better?Probably I will not buy a UBISOFT Game for a very very long time. Even though I like series. I hate you UBISOFT. So so bad.Stay away from this game like plague. Only support developers who deserve support.Some companies still pay attention how their game stands by itself like Remedy, Valve, Rockstar, Square Enix These names are like quality stamp. When I look at Ubisoft, there is no such values, no ethics.
