Oh God soooooooooooooo laggggy!! !Not at all optimized. I am running pair of AMD 7800s crossfire and it lags like hell on medium.the clothes flop around everywhere, i cant get past the first level because of the lag and the awful camera motions.Day 1 and already this game needs a patch release!! Ubisoft, please do some more testing and make sure your games work before releasing them.As of now, wont recommend buying it....not until they do a patch release and fix it
