i bought this game the day it was out and i have 20 hours in it. i only ran into one gamebreaking glitch.this is probably the weakest entry overall since AC 1. i actually loved the story, but be warned, it isnt the over the top AC story as usual. This is a love story between assassin and templar. it also grays the boundery between templar  evil and assassin  good. i appreciate stuff like that. also there is basically no modern story like in other games. idc about that thoughprosgraphics  amazingcombat  harder than previous games but still funside quest  plenty to do including the new murder mysteries which are so damn funconsweak storythe characters arent very memorablepredictable story
