Many people talk about the bad release, not many come back to talk about the overall great experience that the game provides today.If you were looking for a new kind of Assassins Creed game, your in luck! Unity gives you the same feeling you got when you first played Ezio in Assassins Creed 2. The city of Paris is massive and there are interesting stories down every dark alley.When it comes to performance, make sure you have a strong PC, you cant really enjoy the game at a low frame rate.Last words wait for a good sale to buy it...
