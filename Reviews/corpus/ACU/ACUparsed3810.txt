Game is unplayable on my rig, and its not because of my rig. Ive been waiting since it came out, and still havent been able to complete the game. Still getting random freeze/hangs that ruin gameplay and SLI is now broken with patch 4. DO NOT BUY for pc. I would love a refund, but that wont happen. Never buying from UBISOFT again!
