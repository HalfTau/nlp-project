I honestly dont undertand what all the negative comments are all about. Game runs fine for me, all graphics settings are on high Preset Very High and I still manage 40 frames. My only issues with preformance have been occasional freezes that last about 1015 sec, but the game resumes right after. I have not crashed once, guess im just lucky? Other than that I have been very impressed and have been having a lot of fun with it so far.BuildIntel i5 4670k 3.4 ghz quadNvidia Geforce GTX 780ti16gb DDR3 ram
