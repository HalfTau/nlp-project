I had some good memories from this game, and thought itd be worth trying again, especially now its better optimized. Frankly I am very disappointed, the gameplay and AI mechanics are way too illogical and player unfriendly. The weirdest things will happen to screw up all your plans like a corpse ragdolling out of place into the enemys line of sight after a coverkill. For some reason the entire area will know if one enemy found you and there are walls everywhere to block sound and vision as if they use some sort of artificial radio. Controls feel too bulky as if its unresponsive to your commands but thats something you can get used to after playing a while. Entirely counterproductive if you know what to do but the game controls simply do not allow it. For instance You studied a patrol route and you know the kill order to stay undetected, but then due to game mechanic slowness of response or the game picking the wrong ledge to grab due to some trollvariable, you will lose the window of opportunity and there was nothing you couldve done. Whatever you do assume the worsest will happen to screw up your plan A, B and C so might as well skip to the part where you slay 3 city blocks in order to advance in your mission. I do miss some mechanics that were present in ACII like grabbing slain enemys weapon which can come in handy with those snipers.If you have to buy the game, remember that you must activate the DLCs manually in Uplay by entering the Activation Codes that you receive in Steam. I wouldnt recommend buying this game unless youre an Assassins Creed series fanatic and need to complete the set.
