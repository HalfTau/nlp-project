If you have a powerful pc which can run this game at highest level graphics you should buy it..Paris is looking absolutely great , graphics are one of the best I have ever seen ok maybe senario is the weakest point but I liked new combat system which is very hard ,  push to be acting like an real assassins which is good , side missions are not boring  , new crime scene missions are like L.A. Noire , try to find killer by doing some searching at crime scene by talking some witness.. thats awasome..
