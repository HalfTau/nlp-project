I have been a long time fan of the Assassins Creed games for a long time.  I have played them all up to the most recent one due to hardware limitations.  This one is by no means the best, in fact, its the worst.  I cant quite put my finger on why, but movement doesnt seem as natural as in the other games.  Combat is also much more difficult than in previous games, which can be looked at as a good thing or a bad thing.  It defintely promotes stealth over open combat.  You can also crouch in this game which is something that AC fans have been wanting for a while now.  Even though I like this game, and there is so much to do, I cant reccomend it because it didnt live up to the previous games.
