Verdict 7/10The gameplay design and the writing for this series need to mature in order for this series to reach its true potential. That said, should you decide to play this game, you will definitely have fun, because the mechanics have been completely overhauled and the gfx and animations are phenomenal. All in all 20 hours of good fun, but no more than that, because the game is shallow and stale at heart.Full review belowShares identical game design as last gen AC game  Certainly a disappointment in that aspect, but also completely overhauls combat and parkour animations and the entire engine for the new generation. Fans of the series will be pleased and disappointed at the same time by the truly impressive new graphics that genuinely herald the new age of hardware, and the stale gameplay that just screams for an overhaul.Purchase comes down to three factors Visuals, gameplay and whether you are a fan of the series. If you are a graphics  with a good pc who doesnt mind stale gameplay THAT much, then this game will be worth a try. Otherwise, just wait until a sale, since there is really nothing here to see than the new graphics.
