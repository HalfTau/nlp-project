Personally Ive liked it and at least on my system it seems to run about the same as all of the other games in the series and I own them all.   One thing that seems to have changed, but it is still very early going for me so that  could change as I get more into things, is that the environment feels like there arnt as many unique areas to explore / climb as we have done in earlier games.  I have a high end rig so was not expecting problems at HIGH settings and have not had any so far.   I would recommend this game to others as another interesting game in the series.  Oh, I NEVER go in for multiplayer, so Im only making these comments from a first person view point.
