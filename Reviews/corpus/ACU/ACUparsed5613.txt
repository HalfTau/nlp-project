I had posted a review earlier, and gave the game the benifit of the doubt.. but unfortionately in its current state i cant give thumbs up.. but lets start with the good..Beautiful graphics,Nice story so far,more polished smoother freerunning when frame rate is 60Some really beautiful and cool missions so farMore challenging combat yet so far, not as fun, as you dont feel like a badass assassin like in earlier games ie, no counter kills so far, only one weapon can be held at a time so far, and no hidden blade combat so far.And that ties us into the bad.. on a high end rig with a gtx 780 TI i cant even manage a steady frame rate using recomending graphics settings.the unstable framerate results in me blowing my cover, feeling like i have a ball and chain on me when running, and losing fights with the new combat system. very glitchy, i fall through maps, get trapped in bushes and have to restart the game, and lag teleport blowing my cover. I expected better from an assassins creed game, and as gamers, we definitely deserve games to be a finished product on release.Now this game still has potential but they need to fix it, as PC gamers we also expect that when we purchace a game, it takes advantage of our rigs power. If this game can run on an Xbox one or ps4, it should be able to run like a dream on a gtx 780 Ti, And all of these issues are using the latest geforce expirance drivers..Black flag was so badass... what happened /..I really hope for the best with this game, i love the assassins creed games, Ive been a fan since the first game came out. It was my first game on ps3. I am in no way a Ubisoft hater... but they need to fix this.. And thats my stance on all of this.
