Huge fan of Black Flag, enjoyed Rogue as well I like big boats, I cannot lie. But I cannot recommend this one, mainly because it is a laggy mess on a high end PC with GTX970. Paris is beautiful, and filled with an incredible amount of NPCs, but I would happily have sacrificed half those moving, talking NPCs for the sake of performance.Also, there is such a thing as too many chests/collectibles. I understand these are optional but Ubisoft, which of you played through what feels like thousands of collectibles and thought it was fun?! And the locked chests... Bad enough that you waste time to reach chests, only to find you cant unlock many, many of them until you complete sequence 9 of 13.All in all, Unity is an exercise in frustration.There are some notable improvements though which are worth listing Stealth is better, you can crouch! Customization Harder combat Side quests are mostly fun, enjoyed the murder investigations in particular
