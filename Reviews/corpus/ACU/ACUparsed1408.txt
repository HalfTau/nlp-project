There is a lot of controversy surrounding AC Unity due to how broken it was on release. While there are still issues in the game, I never encountered anything game breaking and the game itself is actually fun. Well, it is still Assassins Creed, so if you dont like parkour and murdering Templars then this game wont be fun.I got AC2 vibes from Unity quite a bit, which I guess is a good thing as that one was a solid entry in the series. I cant really complain too much about it being more of the same when that seems to be the driving force in the series.I didnt notice much difference in the combat in this compared to Black Flag or even AC3 but the freerunning system has gotten some additions which lower the instances of your assassin doing something completely different to what you wanted. The story is your typical AC stuff but with thankfully few interruptions by the real world.Overall Unity is a decent entry in the series but I could only really recommend it to fans of Assassins Creed. Its not really a good starting point and the bugs are enough to put less determined players off.Oh and I think the French soldiers are just reskins of the British ones from previous games, they even have a British accent most of the time.
