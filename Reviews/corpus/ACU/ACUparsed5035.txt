Edit 3112015It has improved since the initial release, got it running faitly well with a lot of tweaking. I have since upgraded my computer to latest i7 processor and 16GB RAM, but it did not make any significant difference. My son still plays it on low quality single screen, but it is fairly smooth after four patches. Probably as good as it is going to get.Original Review CommentsMade the mistake of preordering becuase my son is an AC fanatic.Buggy mess, pretty much unplayable. I have an aging multi screen rig with dual GTX670s and an i7 950. I play Crysis 3 and DCS worls on 4900 X 900 with moxt of the settings maxed out.  Black Flag ran perfectly on max settings. Unity struggles on a single screen running   1360 X 768 with all the settings on low. So many issues with the graphics, from strange hair textures through to feet vanishing into the tiles on angles roofs. I cant imagine it is fixable, I imagine it would take months of effort and by that time Ubisoft will probably be out of business with two disasters in a row.Needless to say I wont be preordering Ubisoft ever again.Update After a lot of tweaking I can get the game to run relatively smoothly on low qualiy 1080p. Paris is impressive. Such a shame, hope that they can fix it.
