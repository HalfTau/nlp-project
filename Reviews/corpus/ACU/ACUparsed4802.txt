I love all of the previous games but i have never been sooff before. Wall climbing and combat suck terribly now. Most of the time i cant get my character to do what i want him to do, or go the way i want. Combat isat best. Never can dodge attacks and blocking attacks with 3 guys is almost impossible. All you end of doing is trying to block the whole time before you get shot.
