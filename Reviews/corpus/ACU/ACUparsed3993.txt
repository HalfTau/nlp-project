Theyre still working the bugs out, but I already like it more than 3 and Black Flag. The system needed the overhaul, and the free running aspect is probably the most improved by the new engine. No more competitive multiplayer which never should have been included in Assassins Creed in the first place. Overall, it should only get better with time.
