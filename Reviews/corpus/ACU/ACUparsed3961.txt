I have been a huge fan of the Assassins creed franchise, before every game I go back and play the last two, but this one just falls short on too many levels. The environment and the time period that you play in is excellent, the added mechanic of being able to get behind cover is much needed, and the new enemy difficulty levels generated from the ship battle difficulties from previous games adds a new level of necessity when trying to be sneaky instead of just slaughtering everyone. Unfortunately this game crashes everytime I play it!!!! Even with my settings adjusted my framerates are too low to enjoy running around, I constantly find myself getting frusterated with the charecters lack of proper response when trying to traverse the side of buildings, and nothing is funner than a nice glitch that sends your charecter jumping to his death. It is really disappointing to know they had it so right in Assassins creed two, several games ago, and they somehow manage to screw it up. I will reccomend this game when it is playable.
