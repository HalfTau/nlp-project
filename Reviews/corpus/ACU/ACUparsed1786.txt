This was one of the worst experiences when it comes to playing a game I have had.i encountered countless glitches were you get stuck in mid air, floor or the wall. In the begining of sequence 2 the AI character that you were escaping with kept getting trapped in the floor and it is now impossiable to finish the mission.
