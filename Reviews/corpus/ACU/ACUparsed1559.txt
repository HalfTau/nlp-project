Graphics look washed out if they are not on very high or ultra. Combat system is flawless however disabling the ability to counter enemy bullets makes it harder to survive in combat with tons of enemies as double takedowns are equally as difficult as dodging bullets. You can now keep a vast variety of weapons and clothing on you customizing your gear load out for different missions.Multiplayer seems dead where I live or it my be everywhere who knows. But the social club is an interesting experience if you can get into a coop mission with other people willing to play seriously.The city is lively but I get the feeling it is a bit too much for the game to handle as I do see many NPC bugs and errors when walking the streets. It feels surprisingly dead as there is nothing to do when you arent directed to do something in the story campaign. More of a walking simulator as there is many different things happening in the streets painting a picture of everyones daily life in revolutionary France.It is almost never night time which is unfortunate as your color variation has no purpose if you choose the all black colors. Finally the only true problem I have with this game is the economy. There are about four different currencies in the game where you must collect them by doing different things and it seems purposeless to have different currencies when you can stick with one main and play the game how it should be in all the others before.
