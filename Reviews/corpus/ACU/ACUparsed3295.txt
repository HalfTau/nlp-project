I will recommend this game to anyone with a hardware at the recommended hardware specification. Otherwise, this will only be a choppy game for you.The game is okay really. I am an Assassins Creed fan and I just happen to like the series story wise. Gameplay wise, you will enjoy it as long as you get a smooth play, otherwise skip this one for now until you get a really powerful rig or perhaps when Ubisoft optimize the game to actually run smoother.
