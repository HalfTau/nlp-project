Character turned invisible for solid 9 seconds. 10/10 would play again.Edit This game worked perfectly for me after the first patch, however, after the last few patches my frames have gotten significantly worse. They worsened even more after reducing my video quality settings Yes, you read that right. Ergo, I am reducing my score to 3/10 because it is unplayable yet when it works it is probably the best Assassins Creed game since Assassins Creed 2.
