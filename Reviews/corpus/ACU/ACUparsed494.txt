The graphics in this game are still better than Syndicate even 3 years later. The animations, parkour, and combat are all superior than any other AC game. It launched a mess but wow did they fix it.  If you want to put your graphics card through the ringer, try this game. There is a reason it is still a benchmark game for graphics cards. This game looks amazing and the story so far is really well done. This game is much more cinematic than other AC games and I quite enjoy it. On sale, this is a must buy.
