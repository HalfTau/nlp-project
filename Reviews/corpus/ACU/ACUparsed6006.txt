IF you are a fan of the Assassins Creed Franchise then Obviously you own this game, alot of people are bringing up issues such as Crashing, Lag, etc i have had a little lag issue then i adjusted my settings still Ultra High and run it smoothly.The only issue that i have with this game so far, is that everything is running through Uplay. Certain chests cannot be accessed unless using some crap on uplay. so all these purists that have issues playing this on Ultra High at 60FPS, if you care enough about the game/franchise youd suck in your pride and play.Im not a die hard AC fanboy, but as said the problems people seem to be having with this game i havent experienced.
