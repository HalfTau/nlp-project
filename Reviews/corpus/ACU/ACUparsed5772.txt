I have to admit that i hated this game the firt time i played it  because of the random crashes every 10 seconds, but after the update that came from NIVIDIA, all the problems were solved. People should understand that it is normal for every game to have technical issues in the release day. And please do not complaine about the Random Freezes in the game and make sure your ing peace ofgraphics card can handle the game. If it cant handle the game, stop ing about it in the game reviews and stop blaming the game for your  PC because i dont have any of this Random Freezes issue.And yes, i highly recommened this game to all Assassins creed fans, it is totally worth it. The controles are smooth, the combat is harder than it was in Black flag. I mean, i got stapped by a dude in my balls and i died with one hit! You gotta parry them all man.
