Im a huge fan of AC. I have played all of the games. In all the time I have played thi series I have never had a complaint, until I played Unity. This game probably has more bugs than Skate 3. It also crashes all of the time. 2 minutes into the first mission my character got stuck in the air. Then later on in the game I had to escort someone but the kept falling through the floor. I have nothing good to say about this game. It is one of the worst games of 2014. I cant believe I wasted my money on this piece of garbage. I strongly reccomend not buying this game until Ubisoft fixes all of the bugs in the game.
