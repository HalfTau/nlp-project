Im almost done with everything in this game. Ive done just about every quest, collected every collectable, etc cept 4 coop missions and im just waiting for my friends to be online until I do that but im sure a few days after this review goes up itll all be completed.Now with that said this game is fun it does have its problems but it has a lot of good and I wouldnt have put this much time in it if didnt.I bought the game on launch when it was a broken buggy mess. I probably would have given it a negative review back then but I decided to wait until it got as many patches as possible and then play it again and yes they did fix pretty much everything stability wise and most major glitches aswell as some convenience problems.Ill give the quick rundownProsCombat is harder than every Assassins Creed Game but once you master its still relatively easyGear matters moreThe Game has COOPIt has quite a lot to doConsThe COOP is only for a select few coop missions instead of the whole game. This is a problem all games in the main Ubisoft Universe have up until Far Cry 5 I believe which is their first game in this universe that has full coop for EVERY mission.The games main ends with a very /r/atheist propoganda tier fedora quoteThe game has a few of unrealistic pro feminist missionsFinal ThoughtsIf you dont like AC games you probably wont like this one. If youre one of those people who only likes AC4 because its a pirate game you definitely wont like this one because its a traditional AC Game.
