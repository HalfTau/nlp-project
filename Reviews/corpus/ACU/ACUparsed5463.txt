Id recommend it if you enjoy the AC series.  However as the countless negative reviews state, the optimization for PC is nonexistent.  REALLY poor effort by Ubisoft  how could you release a buggy, lowFPS pile of crap like this and call it playable?  Stupidity at its finest, release a game before its properly finished.  Now we have to wait for patches to fix it I guess.  Ugh.
