Performance ReviewSo, just to start off with, I have a BELOW minimum requirements PCGPU GeForce GT640CPU i53330  3.0GHzMemory 8,00 GB RAMAfter a few minutes of tweaking for the first time of running this game I find it amazing looking even with all the graphic options at Low. With the new patch the cinematics run great and the whole game is what I call pretty playable. As for now, no overheating, the proc. is usually running at 60 of the whole capacity, no crashes AT ALL and coop is running just perfectly. Not to mention I did get the latest NVIDIA drivers which got some specific stuff for AC Unity to run a bit better and Im glad to say it did work.So, you got a few options here. If you have a minumim spec. computer youll sure be able to run this game without lots of issues. Yes, Im not playing at 120FPS or something and Im not playing with maximum settings I mean, is that really necessary for a game? but hell Im happy my low setup is able to run a decent playable version without issues compared to the HighEnd setups that keep crashing all the time.If you want to have fun with a great game and you got a decent setup, get it. If you dont have at least a decent video card, you are probably going to struggle a bit. Like I just exposed, mine is nothing above minimum specs. and still can play without any sort of issue at all.If you are only looking for the graphics and FPS and you dont have a decent/maximum setup, dont get it. Youll regret it.
