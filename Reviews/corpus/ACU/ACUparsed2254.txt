If you are looking for a game similar to the past Assassin Creed games I do not reccommend you to buy this game. The tutorial part of the game was very long and lasted until sequence 2. Fighting is a bit more complicated making you unable to take on 10 enemies at once, thus having to use smoke bombs more often. While freerunning, it is much much more difficult to control where exactly Arno is going to climb due to a bit of fps lag. Lockpicking is a whole new concept in this game. The difficulty of a lock pick varies no matter what your level is. Some chests I can open with one try, others I will have to go through 15 picks. There are now 4 different forms of currency you can use ingame and one of them being helixes where you pay to win. It is a bit confusing at first in order to distinguish which currency is used for what because the developers decided not to include this in the long tutorial in the beginning of the game. I find the game less enjoyable and not worth 60, good thing I bought it on sale.
