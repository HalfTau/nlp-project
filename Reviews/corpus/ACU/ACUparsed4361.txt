This is ridiculous. Im a fan of this series and have bought all the main releases on the PC. Ive been able to play all of them without much problems. This game though is a completely broken mess. Performance is horrible. On dual 780 Tis in SLI the game stutters like crazy. The latest patch, patch 3, has managed to make the stuttering even worse. It was very annoying to play, now it pretty much is unplayable. Please do not buy this game. Even if youve been a fan of the series. Ubisoft needs to stop releasing broken games. Watch Dogs was never fixed on the PC and it honestly feels like this one may never be playable on the PC as well.
