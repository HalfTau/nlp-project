Okay so, Ive just bought this game on sale for about half the price, Ive wanted to try this game ever since I saw it come out.Ubisoft hooooooolyplease optimize your games. I have a GTX 770 4GB, and a i7 3770s 3.7GHZ. Im not even running this game at full graphics and its lagging, not terrible lagg to where its not playable, but its almost never 60 FPS. Especially in dense areas. There is also some glitches, the combat seems slow and it seems glitchy, civilians glitching everywhere, parkour is glitchy sometimes but relatively pretty damn good. BUT, all this stuff doesnt mean its a bad game.If you buy it on sale its a good buy for sure, Yeah it has its lagg, and its glitches, but the gameplay still is very well done and the missions are very interesting. The combat is actually quite difficult for once unlike the other titles, which I quite like actually.To sum it up if youre going to buy this game, buy it on sale. It is NOT, I repeat NOT. Worth the full price. Its a good game, if you want it buy it. Serves quite a bit of time for fun.
