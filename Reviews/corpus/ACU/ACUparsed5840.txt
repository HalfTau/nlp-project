I am disappoint.The three Assassins Creed II games were some of my favorites, ever, and Black Flag was well done and enjoyable, as well.  III had a cardboard cutout for a hero, but had some interesting ideas, and was at least technically well done.V?  Technically, its a steaming pile of...well.  My rig is a little behind the times, now, but still above recommended spec.  Despite that, the flickering, graphical glitches, and stuttering make the game unplayable.  I can only hope that a patch will eventually be released that fixes this debacle.Thatll teach me to not wait until after release for reviews.
