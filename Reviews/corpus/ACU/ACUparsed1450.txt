In the first 12 hours the game was disgusting. Its buggy, runs like s?t, peapole spawns withoun clothes from the sky.When the story begins to flow this things just... amm... you just dont notice them. The story is just fantastic and that feel on the streets like I was there for real. One thing whats bothers me is I really dont see any progress in the revolution, and the ending was a bit weak for me.So lets get in to the the pros/cons Great map design visuals Great grephics from a distance Good price on 3rd party sites The story is just awesome Stunning gameplay Nice to see realistic historycal places OK graphics up close Nah ending No memorable side characters Arno just dont give aabaut the bbrotherhood ubi please dont do this dump omg server problem jump into a hole... oh now you are in the ww2 paris climb the Eiffel tower and shoot the planes whit mgs Its just grabbing me and pull me out of the game.Cant change weapons on the go sword to spear to axe If you want to play AC on COOP... you dont. S?t controls Dumb bugs Some ugly effect on the screen I think its because the this is a simulation thing ubi please dont do this dump omg server problem jump into a hole... oh now you are in the ww2 paris climb the Eiffel tower and shoot the planes whit mgs Its just grabbing me and pull me out of the game.I think it worth a few hours to play the story for this price.FFS I do recommend it!
