This is by far my favorite AC game yet followed by 4 and brotherhood.  Arno is such a fun character to play and the coop is pretty awesome along with the ability to visit another players Paris to help them and play in Heists. I play Stealth myself and its fun to see other peoples play styles. I really like the parkour down feature as well and the scale of Paris is amazing. The only thing I wish that was kept from the previous games is being able to pick up bodies to lure guards to a certain position though the cherry bomb is good for that and whistling from a hiding place to get enemies closer to do a stealth kill faster. I highly recommend the game! Just make sure your system can handle the amazing game play. I had very minimal issues with the game, no more then the other games. Only really experienced the floor fall through glitch but I was always laughing instead of mad and they fixed that one fairly fast. My brother also experienced little to no prolems playing.
