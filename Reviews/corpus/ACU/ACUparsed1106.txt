This game crashes every 10 minutes. I get the ACU.exe has stopped working error and tried every fix I found online. I built my PC a few months ago and I am pretty sure it should be able to run this game as it was released in 2014. After a few hours I, just gave up and uninstalled it due to the crashing frustration.
