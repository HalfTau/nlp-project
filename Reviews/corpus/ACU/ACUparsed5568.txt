I have delved into this game for around 2 hours and I am enjoying myself. At first, I had my settings on high but the framerate drop is just too much to bear, so simply  toning it down to medium still produced a beutiful Paris. In terms of the game, everything else is just amazing. Gameplay, story,  setting....everything is improved upon.
