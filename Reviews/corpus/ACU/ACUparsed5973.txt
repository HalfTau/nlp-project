Disapointment.  That is the word I would use to describe my experience with the game so far. I love the Assassins Creed series, and I was really looking forward to playing this game.  However, when I booted up the game for the first time, the picture was extremely laggy and had very low fps. It looks terrible!  I then decided to try Black Flag to see if it had the same problem. Black Flag looked just fine. My PC has an i7 processor, a GEFORCE 860m graphics card, and 8 gigs of RAM. I hope they will fix this because I feel completely ripped off. Hopefully, they will change this soon...Update 1Switching the graphics settings to medium or low improved frame rate quite a bit. One thing to understand is that the minimum requirements for this game are surprisingly high. I have no idea why this is. My graphics card can handle high or ultra settings on Battlefield 4, AC 4, COD Advanced Warfare, Watch Dogs, and Skyrim.  Also, I encountered a glitch the floor disappeared and I fell into nothinness pretty dramatic. I stand by my first assessment. Do not purchase this game unless Ubusoft updates and improves the game.
