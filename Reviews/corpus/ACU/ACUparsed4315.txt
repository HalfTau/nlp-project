A major disappointment, after Black Flag. They added a few things, but then made everything else worse in the process. Added crouching for stealth, but removed whistling, hiding underwater and moving bodies. Added the ability to quickly move downwards, but give you areas with so much clutter that youre constantly getting stuck to them. Made combat take a bit more thought than just constant countering, but then removed the ability to shield yourself against gunfire.The character advancement is a mess, with little indication of what, exactly, the stats on your equipment do. Youll get equipment rewards from the main plot that are garbage compared to things you can buy from doing just a few sidequests. The map is littered with chests that you cant open until you max out the Lockpicking skill, but you cant tell that you cant open them until you actually get close. The less said about the Nomad stuff, the better, and Initiates has been ridicuously buggy. It still hasnt given me credit for other games in the series, even though elsewhere in the same system it notes that Ive beaten them.The setting is irrelevant for more than half of the main plotline, as is Arnos membership in the Assassins. The plot does nothing to advance the overall plot of the series. I didnt run into the craziest of the bugs missing faces, etc., but Ive had multiple crashes, and could not get the unique assassination on one of the missions because an NPC kept walking into a wall, breaking his script.Id recommend avoiding this. Even if youre a big fan of the series, you wont actually miss any plot development.
