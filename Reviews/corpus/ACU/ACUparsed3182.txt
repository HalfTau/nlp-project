This has the potential to be an amazing game, however its  bad porting slows it. As of Patch 5 they still need to fix the hitboxes on everything. I constantly find myself stuck floating in mid air, getting stuck in rooftops and the ground, and falling through the world among others. However if you ignore the constant 10FPS and glitches, this is quite possibly the best AC yet. You will need to buy the 6000 Steam Box Coming later this year to run it though. P I want to post this neutral, but I cant, I dont want to not reccommend it, but I cant reccomend it until Patch 6 and until its possible to run it without a gaming PC worth a small fortune, so I have to say I dont reccomend this. Get the console version, people!Edit Fixed the patch numbers after looking at news and seeing Patch 5, still doesnt fix the bugs though.On the bright side you dont need a smartphone to get 100 now. Just a gaming PC. P
