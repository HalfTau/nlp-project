The game is incredibly buggy, as buggy as the Fallout games and thats seriously saying something. For all its flaws however, which are far too many than should be, the gameplay is pretty darn good fun, especially when you play with other people. The new parkour system is both better and worse than the old system, but for the most part is better, more fluid and dynamic. The combat is also quite satisfying, more challenging, gone are the days of being a one man army, in are the days of to a certain degree skill based hack and slash. The customisation in the game is better then any previous title in the franchise and there are a lot of different styles and choices to personalize your character which is great. The story was in my opinion, interesting, it is somewhat a cross between previous titles and black flag, an assassin vs templars story like the old titles, but also a personal story like black flag. The bugs...the bugs in this game are horrendous, as is the optimization. I havent encountered the infamous no face bug but l have encountered quite a lot of crashes, some crashes which even forced me to restart the game as they caused my save to corrupt. So on one hand, you could see it as the game is so bad in the sense that it crashed so frequently and even forced me to restart lm currently on my fourth playthrough, On  the other hand however, it can also be seen from a positive perspective, being the game is that fun that l was willing to play through the game four times from start to finish. Performance flaws aside, this is the first, in my opinion real Assassins Creed game, proper stealth mechanics, overhauled combat, l would definitely recommend the game, but only after its flaws are fixed and the game is better optimized.
