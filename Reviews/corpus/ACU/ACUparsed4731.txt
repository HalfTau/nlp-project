I have  Windows 8.1, 12 mb of XMP memory, Asus GTX 970 graphics card. I had some initial difficulty of getting the program to run however I was finally able to get it to run at Ultra settings with little if any stutter. Sometimes I would have to restart the computer for the game to start as it would not start on the first try. I played about 32 hours and my mouse unresponsive so I stopped the game for awhile. When I tried to reload the game it gave me an error that my game files were corrupt and would I like to start a new game. I chose NO in hopes that it would be able to recover but the computer went into an enless loop to nowhere...which means that I lost 32 hours of gameplay! I prepurchased the game but I will never do that again and I will not play the game again until most of the bugs are worked out. I thought that the files were backup up to there servers??? The game itself I really enjoyed. The scenery is beautiful and theres a lot in it with the crowds and different things going on. The GTX 970 handled everything beautifully, however I was reallythat I lost all those hours of gameplay. I was on Sequence 9, about 25 of the story completed. I also might add that the way they did coop is really interesting and fun. I do recommend the game when they get rid of most of the bugs, but even though I own the game I will not play it again until the bugs are worked out because of the lost of time invovled...that was very dissapointing.
