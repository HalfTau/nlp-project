As much as I love AC games, I just cant recommend this game.First of all, I like the story, ambient, graphics, parkour and everything but there is just too many bugs.I get that no game is perfect, and every AC game had some bugs, BUT THIS IS BUGFEST! /NPCs are falling in the ground, bodies being twisted into unlikely poses, missing faces, etc.Im 8 hours into the game, and I tolerated the bugs just because I love AC, but now I cant even play the game.Every time I click continue button my game crashes. I tried every ing fix there is and nothing helps.EDIT Ive found a fix, you need to stay offline on Uplay, which is silly if you ask meAlso, I have decent PC i53450  3.5Ghz, AMD Radeon R9 270X, 10GB of RAM and game runs on approximately 25 fps.Assassins Creed Unity is still badly optimized!Dont get me wrong, I really love AC series, and in Unity story seems very interesting. Im not recommending this game because I dont want you to spend your money on something that has so much bugs and CTD, which if you want to fix, you need to stay offline on Uplay.If you want, grab it on sale, definitely not worth full price. Hope this helps.
