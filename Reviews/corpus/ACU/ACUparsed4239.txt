no, do not, i repeat, DO NOT buy this. does not work or launch. look at the other reviews for christs sake. right now, everything is broken, even my dad who couldnt care less about gaming said hey, i heard theres this game called assasins creed unity, and people are saying its the worst of the year...the gameplay itself doesnt look half bad, just it doesnt launch. it launches, then i press start. i am greeted with the message acu.exe has stopped working. in addition to this, it also screws up your machine to the point where you actually need to restart it, because firefox and chrome just goes completely whited out and when you read text on an app you cant cuz its just a yellow unicode square.very broken, wait for a fix, then i will update this.edit holy crap, 60 ratings this is the closest ive been to fame.also max452314, if youre reading this, thanks for the game anyways! hope ubisoft fixes it.also, did i mention their drm, udontplay?
