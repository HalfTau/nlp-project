well what can I say?the game is a pure mess! not only because of random fps drops, there are more, so much more. the game sometimes freezes, well it drops to 0fps for like 4 sec.there is a SLI bug witch make the game flicker until your eyes bleed, but luckly there is a fix for that.On the other sidethe story is great, the dead kings DLC was both long and good.I love the new mecanics of assassins creed and that there are like 200 people on the street, it makes the game feel more alive and really ads on the revelotion.the multiplayer was fun.BUTthe most horrible horrible horrible thing about this game is the random bug witch makes ur character leap on a leadge witch donst exist and u get stuck. and you have to restart a sick long quest or leave the multiplayer. this bug is just pure evil.even tho there is more negativ then positiv I liked the game.I knew of the bugs and preformance issues before i bought the game so I  was prepared ofc.
