A beautiful game for me. I can run it with 30  40 FPS on Ultra IN A LAPTOPMSI GT 70 Dominatori7 4800MQGTX 880m 8GB GDDR512 GB RAMFor the story, its nice but not as nice as Assassins Creed II!The side missions and murder mysteries are fun, the only thing I dont like is that you need to play AC unity Companion to unlock chests and what not.As a warning you really need a POWERFUL GPU to run this Mines mobile so I cant really judge
