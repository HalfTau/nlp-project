Not gonna beat the dead horse and mention the bugs and glitches like getting trapped in a corner by a door, or a cover assasination glitching me into a column. Its just the story that bugs me, its such a cliche revenge story that we have seen before with few really exciting plot twists. Coupled with the bland totally saw it coming ending and the anti climactic resolution to the problem of the current day assassians was a let down. The combat was decent, even fun, when i was able to get a decent frame rate, but overall not enought to save my opinion of the game. Maybe the DLC will improve my opinion at a later date, but current game is not one I would reccomend.
