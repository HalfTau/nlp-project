Amazing game at its currents state. Runs pretty well for me too. The stories very entertaining and enjoyable, and yet also quite sad at many times. There is of course still the problem of Assassins Creed being to easy, but you have to admit the combat is as fun as it is easy, especially with five differant weapons. Coop is also great, and adds to the feel as well as the badassery. Then theres the amazing customization, which really allows you to use your own playstyle with the oh so many weapons and armor, perhaps too much. It seems the only major problem, for me atleast, is that glitches litter the game. The first 2 second in i was already stuck into the ground frozen solid, and had to start the memory again. But besides that Unity is a great game.
