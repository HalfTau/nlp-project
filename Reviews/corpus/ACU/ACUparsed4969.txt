This is the first game since the MSDOS era Myst and Journeyman Project that I just cant keep myself from wandering away because Im bored. The game crashes dont really bother me, those just go along with the 1bit combat system quite well oh? more than one guy? desynchronized...I had a GTX 680, and I bought a 980 to see if it made a difference. It didnt really notice any differenceBetween this crap and Far Cry 3 Im def done with this Ubisoft shtUpdate 2 years later Bored, I click launch, and it says Uplay has detected an unrecoverable error and must shutdown. Not really surprising. This was more of a waste of money than lottery tickets...at least with lottery tickets youre playing something.
