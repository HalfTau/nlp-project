The game looks great but it very demanding of brand new hardware, and my computer is able to play everything else in the market with no problem, up until this game... I have a GeForce GT 650, it is just a bit too slow and I did not know that the 680 minimum requirement was necessary until the recently released those stats! I would love ot play it but I just cant! Besides that all my other hardware is at or above the recommended but its still choppy and low framerate...Update May 10th Still not working properlyIm afraid to buy Rogue...
