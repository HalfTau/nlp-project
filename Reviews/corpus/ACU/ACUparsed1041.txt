This game was great when it released, now not so much. Im an avid fan of the AC series and this game is definently an excellent addition to it. Sadly it now has a number of issues with Windows 10 and crashed 1030 minutes in whenever I play it, regardless of what fixes I attempt. I cant recomend it because it doesnt really work anymore, which saddens me because i loved it when it did.
