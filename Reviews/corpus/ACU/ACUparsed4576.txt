The Game is fine, Except ALL the bugs.Ubisoft support is terrible, My Game crashed while writing save file.This partial save file uploaded the Uplay cloud sync.The game become unplayable.Opened support ticket on ubisoft site but took them few days to answer.Meanwhile for some reason the game progress restarted.The new save file uploaded to Uplay.Back to square one.Called ubisoft support, the can do nothing.Not worth the Money!
