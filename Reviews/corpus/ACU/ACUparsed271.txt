I remember after release, all hell broke loose there were numerous bugs, glitches, and the like.I played this game 2 years after release, and while many of the visual aspects of the game seem to have been more or less patched or resolved, there were many issues with the game that were nonvisual issues. The story was much like any Assassins Creed story, vaguely attaching revenge to justify your seemingly endless slaughter of miscellaneous Templars, officers of the law, and the odd thief. But the issues were mainly in the coop aspect of the game. Many times, I had issues attempting to attack, seeming only to be able to pull out or sheathe my sword. Technical errors aside, the game is tolerable beyond that, although I wasnt a fan of the combat mechanics, which felt clunky and not very streamlined. In missions, instructions were vague, but that was justified so that the player could approach it any way he/she wanted. This idea was probably good in the drawing room, but was never executed well. Also, it seems like Ubisoft hasnt touched the game since the months postrelease.
