Assassins Creed Unity is an Assassins Creed game taking place during the French revolution, with a young nobleman, Arno Dorian, joining the assassins brotherhood in order to help her fiancee and adopted sister, the templar Elise de la Serre,  avenge her fatther, who was killed by fellow templars wanting to change the order on the weave of the civil unrest in Paris.Gameplaywise, Unity severely changes several previous traditional mechanics for the series, in an effort to improve the games world and make the combat and stealth more challenging the setting now spots varied, fully explorable indoor areas too Arno cant sustain much punishment in open combat, with counter hit kills and kill streaks having been removed and your enemies being able to chain several hits one after another you can order your character to move crouched and take advantage of the covers around the are to hide from guards money are very hard to come by in large quantities main assassinations are held in large areas with you being tasked to find your own way to your target the way you see fit you can fully customize Arno with your own weapons and gear, with each piece having a different look and perk ... While such changes set a great tone for future games in the Assassins Creed series, there is still room for improvement namely, the cover mechanis is extremely clunky most of the time, the main missions arent immune to some railroading you must figure out by yourself and freerunning feels still unresponsive in dire situations. On a side note, the constant popups and invites you recive from Uplay and its app and website  to access several side features like chests or outfits are definitely very annoying and should be cut down in future games.You may also want to know that the game has been generally poorly optimized for PC, with even a highend rig such as mine experiencing annoying fps drops during cutscenes and lights/shadows bugs from time to time, among many others. While these problems dont break the game as a whole, their appearences are somehow annoying, to say the least.Unity also offers a pletora of different, historydriven sidequests around Paris, which are definetely something you should look forward during gameplay.The multiplayer mode of previous Assassins Creed titles has been reworked in several coop missions you can join around Paris. They display various degrees of difficulty and are tailored for two or four players they also award you gear pieces upon beating them. Your tasks may range from protecting a target to steal evidences or infiltrate a restricted area to kill someone. While this new coop mode is far more enjoyable than the previous multiplayer, its worth mentioning that such missions are only an handful and are almost impossible to go through in solo.To come to the story, Elise and Arno heavily centers the story around themselves while they are interesting characters in their own right, this leaves very little time to the other side characters or the historical events going on in the background. This, united with the extreme historical liberties the developers took in pretty much everything from the setting and your targets not being that memorable, makes the whole French revolution setting look like a missed opportunity for more complex plots. That said, the city of Paris may as well be the best map from the Assassins Creed series and the whole setting looks full of life and majestic.While I think Assassins Creed Unity missed several good opportunities to become a great game, it nevertheless amused me with its new gameplay changes and could serve as an excellent base for future games in the series
