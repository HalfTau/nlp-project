I see what ubisoft was trying to do. They wanted to make a multiplayer AC game, which Im all for believe me.  However, in the process, they stripped the game of everything that people love about the franchise and added arbitrary new features that make the game near unplayable. They basically took Ezio, nerfed the living crap outta him, drained off his personality, and named him Arno. Not only that, but they just completely did away with the present day part of the story. Ill admit, it was a tad confusing in Black Flag, but that doesnt mean trash it. They made combat ridiculously difficult. Ill admit, you were OP in the other games, but now youre so underpowered that if youre facing more than three foes, you should just run.  The skill trees are the most idiotic things Ive ever seen in these games. Not only are most of them pointless, giving you little to no applicable skills, but they actually force you to work for skills that every other assassin has had as a base, like double assassination, running assassination, and aerial assassination, just to name a few. As far as the multiplayer goes, its... ok when it actually works. However, thats so rare that all the multiplayer feature serves to do is slow the gmae down and orce it to lag more than it already does. Finally, customization. This was one of the few things this game did right, but so many of the useful options are blocked by hat stupid companion app that you either have to stick with inferior amor or have your charcter look ridiculous because you mixed sets.  In summation, if youre a fan of the AC franchise, like myself, do not waste youre money on this game.
