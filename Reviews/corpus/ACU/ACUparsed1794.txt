Although this game at release, was full of bugs, the game in its current state is an enjoyable experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and the Parisian scenery was wonderful. The French revolution is also, a great mark for a plot to revolve around. I felt obliged to leave a review considering all the negative press this game has received, dont get me wrong a game shouldnt be released in the state this was initially, but the team at Ubisoft must of continued working on it to get  this great game to its current state.And in its current state, Id recommend it.
