I tried it on launch. Full disclosure, I got very little in terms of glitches or stability issues, but the game itself bored me after a couple of hours in.Tried it again months later. After you power through the first couple of hours, the game actually becomes fun. It got way more flak than it deserves thank the borked launch for that, and its far from the best AC game thats probably Syndicate, but its actually fine, and probably the prettiest..
