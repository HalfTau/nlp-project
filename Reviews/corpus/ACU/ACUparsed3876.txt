This game is a complete waste of money and time. Even if it runs smoothly like it did for me and does not crash constantly like I did not experience. Every time they patch the many many issues with this game  your save game and everything you have worked for will be gone.There is no way to restore do a few google searches and see how many others have this problem. I bought the season pass and I am not getting my dlc or free game from ubisoft. I have uninstalled and chalked it up to a complete waste of money and time.And yes I have played every assasins creed game when they were released starting from the original. This game is complete st!
