I got a good 30 hours out of this game, including chasing down some collectables, but the overall experience was drastically worsened by all the random game crashing and save game corruption after patches so I had to start over again. It just made it hard to appreciate the game when the game is so badly optimized at launch, and its been hyped up for so long by ubi/nvidia. I cant help but feel like Ive just been milked for money and been lured into buying a halfproduct that has been shoved out of Ubis studios without bothering to finish, just so they could cash in and leave me hanging.The story is allright, I enjoyed it at least. The open world looks nice, and I enjoyed the side quests. The combat feels nice and responsive, I like it as much as in the other games even though they changed it a bit. Graphics look nice too if you are able to max out everything, but it FAR from justifythe INSANE performance hits and low fps on high end hardware. I played on a 780 and 4770k with really high overclocks, and I had to turn down some settings and just force FXAA through software instead, because the in game AA / graphics and shadow settings just cost too much performance. It just doesnt feel good to have 30 fps in a game like this, not responsive enough for me. After I tweaked it a bit and turned off the in game AA and used forced FXAA instead, I was able to get 5060 fps most of the time, but it just doesnt look that great without proper AA.If they had postponed release untill they could smooth out the bugs and the fps issues, I would rate it way higher and reccomend the game, but Im sad to say I cant do that even though I love the AC series and the game itself would be good and worth a playthrough if it just worked as it should. I give it a 5/10. 8/10 if they fix everything
