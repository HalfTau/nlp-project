I built my first PC and this is one of the first games I downloaded. I read a bunch of terrible reviews, but I have had no real issues playing. At most, a couple of tiny bugs when a civilian does something a bit weird  nothing new for an AC game! Ive had a great time on the COOP, this is a feature I have been dying to see in the franchise, and it has worked great for me. It seems the last patch 5 must have helped a lot, but I think it is important to remember the sheer scope of this game. From the top of the tallest building, I can see the rioting mobs for miles around. I have never seen such a living city in any other game. Freerunning is awesome and the combat is both simpler and harder than previous generations. Massive thumbs up, especially if you get it on discount, just make sure you have the specs to run it
