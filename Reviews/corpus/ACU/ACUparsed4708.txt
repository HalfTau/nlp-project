If you are a Assassins Creed franchise fan,this is a mustbuy for its gameplay.But if you are looking for story quality like AC2 then it is very likely you will find this games story predictable and weak.About the performance all I can say is that its not that good,I did experience framedrop but not game crashing.PSI am using 1920x1080 resolution with the game maxed outMy rigGTX 780Not overclockedi54670KNot overclocked16GB ram DDR3
