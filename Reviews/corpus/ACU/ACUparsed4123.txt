You know what really grinds my gears? Its people who tend to seek something completely innovative in new AC games. There is not a big difference between Unity and previous one. However, I found it extremely satisfying to feel the atmosphere of the time period and the city itself. Reminded me of my favourite AC II. The main character himself does ressemble Ezio in some way. It feels just like the old times. Coop mode is not as badas it looks in the trailer. However, if you get matched with awesome players you will have a good time. I dont get all this fuzz going around about humangous amount of bugs in the game, didnt get to see any of those. If you want to experience just a classic AC experience, that game definitely able to provide it.
