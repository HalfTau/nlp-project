I built a pretty beastly machine for exactly the purpose of playing high end games with good graphics settings.  Even with the settings turned all the way down the game skips and causes the camera to jump all over the place.  This essentially makes the game unplayable.  I will be asking for a refund.  I dont want this game anymore.
