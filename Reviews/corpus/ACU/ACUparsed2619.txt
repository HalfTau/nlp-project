after recent patch this game works brilliantly, advice would be to either bring a fiend or find someone ingame to play in a brotherhood with you, much more fun when you work together rather then having randoms just alert all the enemies, really fun campagne brings back assassins creed 1 and 2 where you have to assassinate targets and there multiple ways to get to them, the stealth is fun and combat is hard, would recomend this game
