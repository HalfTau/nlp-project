I dont know why people say its not good, if you mess around with the graphic settings you can configure it to play perfectly on your computer. I will admit though some bugs are there but nothing to big to ruin the game. Theres one bug after you escape the prison you cant jump off the ledge and you get stuck on it but im not sure if its common, other than that. I wanna say 8/10 not bad. Nice missions.
