Assassins Creed Unity is a new taste into the Assassins Creed Franchise.For it to be good or bad in players taste I cant tell since everyone has their own preference but I liked the gameplay mechanics quite a bit.I rarely ran into any glitches or FPS Drops but one thing is for sure the games crashing is annoying.At some points every hour the game would crash even when I am in the middle of a mission whichme off.But other than that this game is fun if you like the stealth type of games.One thing I didnt like is the playthrough time, It took my roughly 20 hours to finish the game without any extra sidemissions in singleplayer.This dissapointed me because in the previous Assassins Creed games it took about 2535 Hours.Even on Watchdogs it took me 37 hours to finish the game and the dlc and just 30 hours to finish the game.I felt like Watchdogs was a nice game since I never hyped it up during the EA Presentation period.Assassins Creed Unity is a new addition but it will be up to you if it is up to your taste or not.
