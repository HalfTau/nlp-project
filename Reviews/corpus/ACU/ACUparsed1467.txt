I bought this quite some time after release on a steam sale hoping that the bugs that marred its initial release had been ironed out. While I found the game less buggy than expected that just exposed how trash the rest of it was. This game is only good in very short bursts, any time it asks you to do one activity for any length of time all that happens is it expsoses the horrible underlying flaws. The controls are unresponsive at best, the chekpoint system is mediocre and free running ranges from pretty decent to absolute garbage. I cant even reccommend this game the price I paid 5. Avoid.
