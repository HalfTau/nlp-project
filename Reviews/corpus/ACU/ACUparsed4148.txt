For a Assassins Creed fan i still love this game but there are some things that bugs me terrible.First of all is that you need to play whit some browser game or app for your phone to get all the stuff you want and get the cool armors. Why ubisoft? just ing why? i bought the game for my pc so that i can play it on that. I dont want some crappy app or whatever to unlock items. That also means no forced coop to unlock more items.Second, it is kinda buggy. I didt hade major bugs but more small things like people falling from the sky or falling true the ground.Also didt got major frames drops, most of the time around 50/60fps whit everything maxed out whit FXAA, it whas rare that i got under 50 but it droped sometimes in some places to around 30fps if i used the special power.It does look amazing though omg but the engine really need some fixing.Story whas mwe but still fun to play.Fighting is alot harder but not over the top, its more of a challenge.Annyway, if you are a big fan of Assassins Creed and got a decent computer then buy it.My system I7 4770K  4.5gig 16gigs ram 1866mhz GTX780Ti Core  1200Mhz
