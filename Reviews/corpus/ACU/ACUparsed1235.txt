OK, so this game.... At first it starts out pretty engaging, and you develop a good idea of the series, the graphics are well made, and the game performs decently.The way they changed the free running in this game is... well its got better controls, but its still basically the same, your character will just jump in random directions sometimes, so that hasnt changed.The combat is nice and fluid, but the camera is your worst enemy, and it will kill you...  a lot. The camera during combat will sometimes get stuck, or not move where you want it to, and an enemy will blind side you. which sucks... a lot.The strory is nice, but as you progress through it, it loses its meaning. Every mission becomes an assassination mission, which is kinda cool, but the story fades away, and its very much like batman arkham series, but assassins creed style.Ive experienced BIG FPS drops during cut scenes, which is odd. My equipment is a bit out dated, and im already at 30 fps as it is, but during cut scenes, it can drop down to 9fps.I wouldnt recommend this game for 40, its not worth the money, its not a good port.I got this on sale, and i recommend you wait until its on sale as well.
