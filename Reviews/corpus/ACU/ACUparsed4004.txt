One word ANNOYING. Protect missions? They walk so slow... for a mile. Chests you find? 1/10 chance that you can open it because they are LEVELED. Trying to shoot someone on a timed mission? Be sure you are standing on solid ground or a roof any ledge/pole you CANNOT shoot. And just trying to walk down a street? HAHA, you will grab every ledge and corner all the way down. Oh, except for the one you want. Redeeming factor? Multiplayer. Believe it or not. I have NEVER condoned a game with a bad single player for a good multiplayer until this one. Single player story is ok so far, but frustrating. Multiplayer? Actually fun. Things for 26 players all to do. Group communitcating, shared eagle vision, and multiple tasks/targets are actually kind of fun.All in all an ANNOYING 6/10.Sidenote Small foothold glitches, havent had the crashes or glitches reported by most so far. Maybe the 32gig of ram helps.
