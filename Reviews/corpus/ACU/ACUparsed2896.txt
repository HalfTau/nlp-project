Assassins Creed Unity has had an interesting new development. It has definetly changed in a few ways which are noticable. In some ways they have definetly not followed suit in all the previous series. Character Moves, Layout and controlability is different and I believe dont think its been for the best. Having said that, the stunning graphics and the epic storylines still continue to shine through and the architecture of the landscape and buildings are still top standards. I still love it.
