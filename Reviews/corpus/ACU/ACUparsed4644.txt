Caveat emptor There are serious performance issues right now, buying in right now will likely leave you disappointed with performance.Despite its myriad of flaws mostly on the polishing and optimization, the game is still absolutely playable for most including myself. The exceptionally low fps is something many might find issue with, but you always have the option to play with high quality at low fps or low quality at high fps. Despite what a number of people have said, the voice acting isnt lacking, and neither are the facial expressions. at 1080p you might get more detail than at lower resolutions, which could make a difference as many of the visual cues are extremely subtle realistically and enjoyably so. I honestly DO feel like this is a step down from black flag in some ways, but its still very fun, and story driven players will still enjoy the plot.
