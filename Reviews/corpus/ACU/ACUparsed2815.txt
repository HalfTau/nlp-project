I want my money and time back.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!I had hoped the rumours werent true, I wanted to at least try to play with my best friend in a game mode Open ing world CoOp you but not five minutes into the tutorial before I tried scaling a wall, I fused with the wall and had to restart. Then when trying to climb a ladder, templar tom boy decided to flip upside down and backwards, no longer capable of moving I turned it off. I may try again, but no time soon.
