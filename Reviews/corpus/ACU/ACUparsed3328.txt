Ive bought the game when it was 20 off. I would recommend to wait until you can get it for 50 or less.For sure the game is fun. But the perfomance is really poor. It doesnt matter if I crank the graphics settings to high or keep them low, the FPS count is not really affected. Sometime you run around and try to make a slight left turn just to end up turned 180 or 170 degrees which is really annoying while trying to keep up during time critical missions.Another point that annoys me is Ubisoft trying to force you to stay online and spend hours in the Companion App. While the app was fun in Black flag since theres no need to play it to make a progress in the game, you have to play the app to open certain chests. And since my ISP has some serious issues with intermittent connection some days I cannot play without a window popping up, pausing the game, telling me that online contents are temporarily not available.
