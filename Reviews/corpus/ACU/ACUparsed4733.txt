I actually have no idea what people are talking about in terms of performance.  I have a GTX 750 Ti and am running fairly well 21 fps average on medium settings.  Its not good, but its not unplayable either.  No clue what people are talking about.Gameplay wise, though, I think Ubisoft could have done better.  Black Flag was amazing the huge feature for that game was being able to command ships on a higer scale. AC3 had it too, but not as much. Unity on the other hand, does not have any ship commanding at all.The game isnt amazing, but not terrible either.  Play it if you want to, but its recommended you would have a better PC than me. GTX 770 or higher
