Overall, this game is pretty good, except the fact with the extremely poor optimization and multiple bugs and glitches throughout the game, but Ill get to that later. The controls are a bit wonky, I think its just me because Im too used to playing with the other AC games in the past. Ive played a couple hours today, and Im still getting used to free running, until I can run quickly to and from buildings. The story is confusing at times with all the time anomolies, and with the modern story being told as well. Generally, it is quite entertaining. Character customization good, with alot of different gears and weapons that you can buy and hack in the game Yes, you can hack gears, but Im still learning. The combat is pretty hard, if its just 2 guards, you can kill them easily, but when theres a bunch of guards, thats when the best advice I can give you is to run away. Its not that easy to kill a ton of people like you did in AC III and Black Flag. Ive only played a couple games on coop, and its good. All I can say is to try to get better gear and play with friends, that helps a lot when your playing coop.Now, to the bad part of the game.....When Im playing, Ive experienced numerous glitches and bugs, and honestly, its a lot of them. I always knew the 2 week delay wouldnt really help fix some of the bugs, but oh well. Im running a GTX 970 and a i74790k and the game has an average fps of about 2040... sometimes even dropping to a ridiculous 5 fps. Its really messed up and to the point where I cant even enjoy the game. The glitches range from peoples faces are messed up or gone, my character just randomnly falls to the center of the earth, stuff like that. Did the nvidia drivers and the day 1 patch even do anything? I really hope they update the game, because Im just gonna wait until they do, so I can finally enjoy the game Ive been yearning for the past few months. Overall, its a good game, but the optimization is just terrible.
