Most likely my favourite AC Game next to AC4 Black Flag, This one has definetely the best looking graphics, and smoothest/fluidest realistic looking combat and oh boy! dont forget about all the blood and gore Unity has, its sad that Ubisoft skimped down on the blood, gore and physics in their latest AC Game Syndicate, which was quite a big dissapointment, Hopefully Origins will have the harder/better looking Unity Combat! Instead of Syndicates cartoony feeling combat.
