THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE, IM NOT GOING TO DISCUSS HOW THE GAME WAS ON RELEASE AS SEVERAL PATCHES HAVE COME OUT THE FIX LOTS OF ISSUES THE GAME HAD TO START WITHSo far I really enjoy this game. The multiplayer bits are extremely fun when played with a full group. Some of the controls are a bit different from the previous games and you really need to get used to those before expecting to be great at this game. Free running takes a bit more effort as its been divided into a free run up and free run down catagory by pressing spacebar and E respectively. The graphics are really good when you have the hardware to support them, the recent patches by Ubisoft have cleared up most of the glitches and frame lags that have been present in the earlier editions, I havent stuttered once in the time Ive played it.The Companion app which you need to open blue chests really isnt a huge deterrent from the real game, its very similar to Kenways fleet and other minigames of that sort in the other AC games and if you have windows 8 you can use the app for free or put it on your smartphone.As for people complaining about microtransactions in the game, there are relatively few. You can unlock things quicker by paying for Helix Credits but the only things unlockable soley through Helix Credits are timesaver packs which are wholly unnecessary. Skills must be purchased with sync points which arent extremely difficult to earn and I feel like it adds a new angle to the game as you have to prioritize your skills and arent immediately thrown into the game knowing everything.TLDR This is a really good game, it takes some getting used to and if you have a low grade system you probably wont be able to run it extremely well but if you have the hardware to support this game and the patience to learn the intricacies of it, its certainly worth picking up Especially on sale.
