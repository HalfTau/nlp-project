At release, it was a mess. Long time after release, still a mess. Now, I had no major trouble to get through... and only a few minor inconveniences like 3x short freeze during the whole game time and sometimes parkour and enemies going weird on me the two weird things are kind of a trademark of AC Series, so.... Otherwise no crashes and graphic/body/mission glitches. The next game Syndicate felt too similar to Unity in most aspects towards the end. But, I enjoyed present Unity so I have to say, despite the labor pains, it matured well. Well done.Note Didnt play multiplayer/coop and totally evaded the so hated microtransactions, still got everything I wanted and more, just not right away.
