Quite disappointing. For the amount of Hype the producers put into this game, it sure did not meet expectations.The storyline was decent but yet somewhat brief.Progressing through the storyline and getting better equipment really simply and easy to do.For the price this game is worth I wouldnt recommend it even if your playing for the storyline, or the coop.As for computer specsCPU i5 4670 3.4ghzRAM 16gbGPU AMD Raedeon R9 270X 4gb OCI was able to play this game on High graphics settings without a problem, though the game did freeze for a few seconds every now and then even with lowering the graphics settings, and the FPS didnt not drop that substantially. But I believe these problem lies within the poorly ported game.
