Because this Game has so many negative Reviews I feal the urge to also tell about my expierence with this game.My rigGTX 770 4gbi5 4670k16 GB Gskill Ripjaws2TB HDDnothing is overclocked my driver version is 337.88 yeah I know its old, but Im modding skyrim update my drivers only causes problems for the game and as you see the game works well with old drivers updates are only needed if you have issues related to drivers...Well Im playing now for about an hour and if anything changes I will update this review.I have expierenced some slight fps stuttering in cutscenes on ultrahigh setting, but thats it Im running around for a while in the town without expierenceing any issues so far and again I do that on Ultrahigh preset. When I started this game this morning I had to download an update downt know if this is why its running better than for other users. What I have read so far is that people like me with the 4gb 770 often give positive reviews so I can only assume the game works better or at least for now best on this card. Since I cant say anything bad about the performance I can only recommand the game for everyone who has a 770 like me Im not saying other people are talking crap or have crapy hardware, but it works flawless besides some slight stuttering in cutscenes for me so thats it for the performance.To the actual game its like every assassins creed the assassins story is well integrated in the actual france story and actual history happenings.The gameplay feels nice and easy like in all other assassins creeds the controls are also the same as allways, well overall its just another assassins creed I personally like the character even tough I liked the pirate outlaw feeling of Black flag a bit more than the french wannabe Casanova.Well thats it for now cant say too much about the actual story I have to play some more to get more in detail.Even if I personally with my specs dont expierence fps drops lags whatever I would not recommend the game to anyone right now. I would only recommend it to people with the same gpu cpu combination since my review is based on my personal hardware and a lot of other users have obviously problems with hardware that has similar performance.I personaly would test the game before buying it I dont have to say you guys how to do that, but at least be a honest person if it works buy it. Otherwise wait a week if you see the game got a update try it.A short word for the overall nextgen games Im honestly disapointed how bad the next gen looks if this is the future of gaming graphics I can only say I have games that are a few years old that have more detail in textures. The effects got quite nice tough. I really can only hope that other next gen games get better since if this is ultrahigh it is more like a step back in time for PC gaming the game is fun anyways that are just my two cents so if you hate me for it so be it.
