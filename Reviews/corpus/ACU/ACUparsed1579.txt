Not worthy your time or money. This game falls short of so many essentials of the AC franchise its unbearable, not only is the preformance absolutebut the controls at least on PC are literal cancer, if you do buy this game you will most definitely find yourself repeating long and tiresome sequences due to Arnos inability to maneuver the cityscape and sword.Again, this game is NOT worth your money, do not make the mistake of buying it like I did. I know the French revolution was just bursting with potential and to an extent Ubisoft nailed the setting and background but that doesnt justify your purchase at all. Thank you.
