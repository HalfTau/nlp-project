Its not a bad game. Ive always liked the Assassins Creed games but this is probably the worst one Ive played. The story is pretty good but I still notice some graphical glitches and other glitches that they couldve patched. If you want to keep up with the Assassins Creed games then get it to play through it like I did. If you just want a new game and havent played an Assassins Creed game then either find another game entirely or buy a different Assassins Creed game.
