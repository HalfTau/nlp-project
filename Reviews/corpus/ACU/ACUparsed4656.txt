The game mechanics are really good. Movement seems to be very fluid and easy and combat is now actually challenging. There is more emphasis on stealth, so its finally an actual assassin game! Now lets go to the bad part, which is low frame rate and frame drops. One segment in the game I would have a solid 4050 fps, and in the next sequence I would only get like 20 even though the scenary is still the same. The other problem with the game is the frame drops. Every few seconds, you would get a quick frame delay that makes you change your movement direction and pretty much messes up your entire gameplay expierence.Now lets go on to the wonderful city of paris, which must be my new favorite game setting. The developers of AC Unity made a beautiful and realistic looking city. It feels very realistic due to the little details that they added everywhere. One thing that makes the city look alive is the people. They are always moving and waving their flags, talking to each other, or stealing/insulting others. The problem with that though is I think its partially the reason why the game lags because it requires intense CPU usage to process all those movements and characters, even though Ubisoft said that the number of people on screen dosent affect frame rates at all, but that is something must people are calling B.S.If the patches are going to fix the stutter and fram issues, I would rate this game a solid 9/10 and it would be my new favorite Assassins creed game. However, in its current state, giving it a 6/10 is a little generous of me. I would only reccomend buying the game when the game is actually patched.I currently do not reccomend the game but when, hopefully, frame rate issues are fixed, im going to change to a reccomendation because the game is pretty fun.
