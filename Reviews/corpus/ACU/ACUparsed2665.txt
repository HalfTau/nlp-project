Another AC game reached its end... well 99 of its end due to a really mean Rift mission Battlefield. So, after the various updates it has received from Ubisoft I can safely say that the game is finally optimized. With a GTX770, 4770 CPU and 32GB of RAM the game ran at 50 fps average the whole time, with the majority at 60 fps too. Graphics are amazing and the settings I used were FXAA, Ultra High in everything except shadows and no AO. It looks amazing, combat is quite different than the previous games, story is interesting but nothing too deep. The Dead Kings campaign is also quite good but nothing special  thank the Godz it was included. Arno is the worse protagonist of the series so far though imo.So get it on a sale and youre good to go!
