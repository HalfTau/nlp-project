 PC USERS BEWARE!!  Note This Review is subject to change IF they can correct the Corrupted Save bug, but Im not holding my breath Having fought horribly through the random screen freezes, dropped frame rate issues, random clipping glitches which get you stuck in midair or send you plummeting through the map to a random Desyncronize / mission failure, I tried my 1st Multiplayer match 30 hours into playing with maxvalue gear and ready to tear things up.This is where bad goes to abolute St,,,Midmission, randomly running through an alley which wasnt even intensive on my morethansufficient beats Ubisofts recommendations, game freezes up indefinately, PC chokes and kills ACU.exe.Attempted to relaunch game, continue from the latest save, and while opening, just after the Saving message clears in the topright of the screen WHY Ubisoft thought they needed to save the game when youre opening the application loading loading the save is completely beyond me, the loading animation froze up entire, and the game has turned completely unresponsive.At this point, Im over a day of my life invested into this game, with absolutely no satisfaction left from the positives experienced while playing through what was hoped to be the highlight of the upcoming months of snowfall.Ive played some bad games before, but Ive never felt this cheated by a paid game which I actually WANTED to finish playing through to see the ending.
