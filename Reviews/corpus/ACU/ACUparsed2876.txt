I love the Assassins Creed series and I really wanted to like this game, but thanks to the massive performance issues Unity has made it onto the list of games I truly regret purchasing. My fault for ignoring what everyone was saying about it, I guess. Syndicate is going to have to get some amazing reviews when it comes out or I think Im done giving my money to this franchise.
