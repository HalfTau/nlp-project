Patch 4 and still unplayable. Admittedly I have only a GTX 660 but everything else is speced out and the framerate is horrible unless I turn the graphics settings to the minumin and then it looks like crap. All that and the usual UPlay annoyances makes for one big NO most disappointing game of the year for me.
