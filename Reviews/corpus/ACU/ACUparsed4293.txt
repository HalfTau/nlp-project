This game is entirely unplayable. Its broken all to hell, and the lag is terrible, no matter what graphics settings you have. Ive tried and tried to play it, but when your game skips every few seconds, it becomes pretty impossible to play. Ive been a huge fan of the Assassins Creed francise, but I simply cant recommend this game in its broken state. More patches are severely needed.EDIT So Patch 4 released the other day. Downloaded it, just attempted to play, and it has changed nothing whatsoever. Well, except for one thing. Thatd be the fact that I crashed about 20 seconds into the game, which wasnt an issue before Patch 4 released.Picture relatedI dont know where Ubisoft went wrong with this game, but they are messing up at every turn.
