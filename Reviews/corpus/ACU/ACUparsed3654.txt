I dont have any of the problems everyones talking about. Weird. This is a good game when it run properly. touching story  good parkour system. Theres also a book written by Oliver Bowden. If you want to truly understand the game you should buy it. The book is Elise de la Serres journal. Also good graphics quality and Paris is very beautiful  Recommend it
