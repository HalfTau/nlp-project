Im honestly blown away by all the negative reviews. Being an Assassins Creed fan from the very beggining this game has come a LONG way. Those of you who are experiencing problem so bad that you cant play the game are doing something wrong. Im running an Nvidia GEFORCE GT 630 synergy, which is quite a ways below MINIMUM..I tweaked the graphics quite a bit and Im enjoying the game very much. Its not runinng as optimal as Id like, there is some lag and in crowded areas the framerate drops. That being said Unity is leaps and bounds ahead of Black Flag and the likes. The sheer scale of paris and the bustling activity at ground level is amazing. Ubisoft has worked for years to put this together. Ive fallen through the map once and got stuck in the ground once. Over the years Ive learned to expect these kinds of things on launch day only been a pc gamer for a short time and ive NEVER had such problems on a console. That being said Im sure all will be fixed asap. 70 is alot to pay for a game and I understand that it should be polished. Dont let the negative comments stop you from purchasing. Its well worth the money! The new free running down ability is very smooth and gives parkour a new, fresh, fluent feel. I highly reccomend it!
