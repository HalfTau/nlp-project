I am going to be honest I was really looking forward to this game. I loved the Assassins Creed games but this really left me disappinted. It is a fun game so far but it has bugs and in cut scenes my frame rate drops from 60 to 15 . The rendering at some parts is pretty awful and I really wouldnt recomend this.4/10
