Strong 8/10, ignore those negative reviews! Perhaps the game was really buggy at the release but it works great now!PROs absolutely beautiful graphics, incredibly detailed Paris to explore works great on my GeForce 960 with a weak processor! You do not need a very expensive PC to run it smoothly! lots of side activities cool main character small but interesting changes, fighting is a lot harder now, new items, new cover system, more emphasis on stealth you can now enter most building and a lot of missions take place inside of huge locations great new system of assasination missions of main characters, it brings back the feeling from AC1! feels a lot like AC2 sometimes! really cool coop missions!CONs some of the side activities feel lazy and boring like assasinations marked blue main story is fine but not very captivating, also could contain more connections to the typical AC story aspects like the first civililization, temples, sage etc. could be a bit longer  Ive finished the main campaign and most of side activities in 30h still a bit buggy sometimes... nothing big, but some glitchces can be annoying I felt like it was hard to control my character in the fight sometimes and he sometimes wouldnt respond fast enough to my commands, e.g. dodging doesnt seem to work properly, throwing smoke bombs is slow etc.
