The game is still largely unplayable as of 1/3/2015. Even set tto the lowest settings  it lags out like im playing a crowded mmo. More updates are needed to deal with the overdone graphics effecting gameplay by bringing it to a crawl.You cant parry or effectively freerun if your screen is skipping all over which is a big portion of the game.I was simply hoping that it had been patched enough so I bought this game despite the reviews. Steams sale helped too but ultimately it just isnt worth it yet.And to those saying just get a better rig, no one wants to spend 23k on a computer to play one 60 game. It reminds me of how Final Fantasy 14 was graphically upon release which caused similar issues. An art team that was allowed to run wild for the sake of it simply being pretty instead of functional.
