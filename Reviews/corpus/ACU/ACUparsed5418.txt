Yea... you know a game has completely failed you when it wont even effing start sigh. I thought Ubisoft would have gotten their act together after the failure that is Watch Dogs, but it seems they actually got worse, becuase the game actually not starting and always crashing is definatly worse. If you go through these downvotes reviews the game is running like complete sht cakes for alot of people, which was the exact same problem with Watch Dogs, isent making me keen to play this now anyway even when they do fix it. Another expensive failure by Ubi, yay, I cant even say anything else about this right now becuase it wont start up no matter what I do.So yea my faith in Ubisoft is pretty much almost gone now, I can barely only give them another chance becuase Black Flag was so good but they are really pushing it now.Oh and yea my game time by the way, is me waiting for it to start up, even after 3 hours... its still just a static splash screen. 75 bucks to buy a splash screen in the middle of your desktop... thats not a ripoff at all, totally not.DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD BUY THIS GAME, IT DOSENT EVEN START! SPEND YOU MONEY ON SOMETHING USEFUL, LIKE A CHEAP LOVEABLE GAME THAT ACTUALLY WORKS AND A DONUT.OR GO AND BUY SHADOW OR MORDOR, THAT ST IS AMAZE BALLS! ITS BASICALLYCREED IN LORD OF THE RINGS! OH AND IT WORKS TO, SO CURRENTLY, ITS A MILLION TIMES BETTER THEN UNITY.Dissapointment out of 10
