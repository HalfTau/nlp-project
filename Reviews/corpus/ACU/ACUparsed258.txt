It has its flaws. Its clunky, the AI is too sensitive, and the story is good not great at best. However, it has its charm and soul. Paris is fantastic from the atomosphere, the design, and the large crowds, this game makes Paris feel alive. The gameplay, when it works, offers the best intrepretation of being an Assasssin being a blade in the crowd, striking from above to make a statement, or sneaking your way into a heavily guarded area.Ive finished this game on XBONE when it first came out and my thoughts then are the same now. When this game works, it works very well. While Origins is a better game, it is not an Assassins Creed game. Unity offers the best concepts/ideas for an AC game and if you give it some patience and some work. It will reward you with great moments that hasnt, in my opinon, been replicated, or created, in any AC game.
