Did I hate this game? No. Did I love this game? No. Its decidedly meh. When the game is working correctly its beautiful. When its working normally its a mess of people walking on top of each other and glitching out. Its an Assissins Creed game. Run around, climb stuff, kill stuff, listen random French words. If you want to play it get it cheap and enjoy it. One thing is that the DLC is awful. Even by AC standards. It barely works, its boring, and a total waste of time. Dont play it. If you like AC games give it a whirl, if you dont like them you can be guilt free skipping this one.
