I had a really fun time with this game. The story progress is nice and exciting IF you havnt played any of the prevous games, but the ending is kinda clich. As for the gameplay they added some nice new features into the game, and i dont know if Ubisoft was too lazy to put in a present day story arc, or if they actually thought it was a great idea to let us, the players, be the protagonist, but i dont like it!If you kinda rushed through the story and ignored maybe just half the side missions, it becomes too stressing to look at the big map with all the undone objectives popping up STechnical difficulities Updated my drivers. Problem solved. It did have a terrible launch, but i think they did a nice job fixing the major issues. I think we can call the game finished enough so we can move on to the next AC game now, and if it was released today it wouldnt have as bad steam reviews.7/10 Would recommend it for console playersMy system64x Windows 8Intel core i73630QM, 2.4gHz CPUGeforce GT650M yes i have a laptop O  SLI yes i have SLI in the laptop O 8gb ramThis is officially just below the minimum, but I am never getting below 30 fps on Medium settings...
