Great game love it!! It is well done and doesnt have very  many bugs anymore but there is one major down side to it and that is that you need a really desent computer to run it. I mean the reccomended system requirements are an i7 and a GTX 780 or AMD R9 290X!! I have a GTX 660 and I have to run it on pretty low setting to barely get 3035FPS.
