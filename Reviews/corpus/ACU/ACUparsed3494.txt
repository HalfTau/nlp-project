I fell from a wall about ten feet up and proceeded to watch Anno run into said wall for ten minutes, flailing his arms around like an idiot. I also died while standing alone in a street without being touched by anything or anyone. This game is the buggiest game Ive played in a long time, and not a good buggy like Goat Simulator. I havent been able to play much due to bugs, so I am sorely disappointed.
