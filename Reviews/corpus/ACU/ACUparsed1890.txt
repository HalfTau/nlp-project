This piece of  controls are impossible. Even with the obvious bugs like water disappearing fixed, it is incredibly frustrating to play. The fact that the character never runs where you point it to can be explained   I guess people with a controller instead of a mouse need to be told where they really need to go, but for the ing lockpicking minigame where the game reacts 300 ms too late??? How can you have nonresponsive controls in a minigame about reaction time?!?!  you Ubisoft. How about trying to run through a crowd and running inplace while being shot? How about opening a chest and being teleported in the middle of enemies? How about the ING pay to win content?To put philosophical questions like the dumbpaytowin content aside I have died 6 times. 4 times I died because the character was stuck somewhere or moved left when I pressed right and looked right. Once I died sliding, because the controls they tell you to move only really work, when you are practically not moving at all. This is a terrible piece of software dont buy.
