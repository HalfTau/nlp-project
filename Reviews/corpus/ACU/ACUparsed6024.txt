I had huge hopes for this game, like I thought it was gonna be a hella gamechanger.However, the game doesnt quite work well even on a highend system. The sound is fine and I get decent FPS, but every now and then the lighting will turn super weird into all these different shapes, to the point where its not recognizible as a game. I literally cannot get past the third mission because of it, and its making me disappointed.Also the game crashes way too much.Truthfully, I have probably played one hour of real game and two hours being played by the game trying to fix these stupid bugs.Hopefully a better patch will come because I did spend 60 on it.Im a huge fan of AC but this is really, really disappointing.But hey at least the graphics are good! We can see every last strand of Arnos gratuitous ponytail!
