Graphics are just too much. Unplayable. I need to either buy a new graphics card, or get a refund. You dont actually start in Paris. Whats going on???????? Im confused because it looks like you just do a bunch of levels in different time periods as different characters. Ubisoft is leaving PC users behind, so I guess I wont get Syndicate either. Getting a refund now.
