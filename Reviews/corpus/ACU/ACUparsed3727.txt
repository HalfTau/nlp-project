So after finally finishing this game im gonna tell you guys what i think about it1. Storywise its okay, it had some interesting characters and a little twistiness, but the ending was predictable. I didnt really feel as connected to the characters as in black flag all hail blackbeard and kid. Also the real world almost doesnt exist. you see some nowadays assassins on screen telling you to play the game and thats basically it2. I recently got a pretty good pc so the game ran pretty well, except 2 times when it crashed. So all in all its playable on a good pc.3. MOST IMPORTANT The game on its own is full of amazing aspects and terrible things.... For example the city looks gorgeaus but it doesnt really render far so you always see some super pixelated stuff. The stealth and fighting system were mad way more complicated, which is awesome, but on most missions its almost impossible to stealth and fighting many enemys is to hard so you just rage quit. coop is fun, but the club guild type thing only shows myselfe instead of the other club members. and so on....TLDR Its not the strongest out of the ac games but if you enjoy the series, have a good pc and its on sale buy it! if not       go buy black flag mate7/10
