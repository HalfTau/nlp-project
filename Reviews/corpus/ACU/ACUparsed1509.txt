Hello,The game is as usual.Its really good to run in Paris 1789.Yes, I took good time to play it. Main story is ok.its not as good as before but you will love it again.Personnaly, I really appreciate the extension death of kings,this DLC gives me a better assassin while I was at 5 of main story.This let me have a stronger guy to continue the main story.While I played it only in 2016, the game didnt have bugs.I only recommend you to have a good Gforce GTX.So If you like previous Assassins creed. You love it again.You can  see my screen captures here
