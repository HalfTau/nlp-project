Not the best Assassin Creed game Im still a fan of ACII but it is still a lot of fun.  Once you figure out a setup that works for you.  For me by far the biggest improvement was switching off the Vsync.  With Vsync on it was pretty much unplayable.  I only have a 760 so apparently my system is below spec, but with the Vsync off I get a decent game.Im actually enjoying the game and I really like the detective missions.  A nice addition for when you want to just take it slow.  Im not finding the AI too brutal.  Fighting is possible but with much tougher NPCs but it can be over before you know you are in trouble.Some of the missions seem a little easier than other AC games, but there are plenty of ways to achieve the result, so may be I just figured out the secret.Over all I like it, but man are the specs high.  I have had random crashes.  Usually if the PC has been on for a while.  So its back to the old way of restarting the PC before playing and making sure only the necessary are running.  Havent had to do that for a long time.Im hoping they optomise it better.  For now I am able to get a relatively stable game, but I can totally see why many gamers are getting frustrated.  It is good to see that the developers are listening and being transparent with the updates.  It helps, but many of the issues I feel should have been solved before release.  And being in an IT professional I do know what Im talking about.So stick with it, it is worth it.
