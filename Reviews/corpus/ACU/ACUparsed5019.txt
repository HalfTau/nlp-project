The game is good. I like the story and the gameplay. The new combat is more difficult and forces you to play it a little safer when approaching situations. Problem is that the GOD AWFUL optimization makes the game completely unplayable. Forget stealth because lag, rubberbanding, random 180 degree camera turns, framerate drops, and falls through the map make sneaky approaches damn near impossible. Same thing on the combat side. If an enemy pulls a gun, game over. Framerate drops will cause you to not even see it, much less dodge it. The situation gets even worse in coop. The epic cutscenes are ruined by the framerate drops and texture pop in, which is a shame, because they felt very well crafted. Im upset that this turned out so poorly. I love the series, and I love the game, but the optimization is so bad that it makes it a chore to play, if you can play it at all. The recently released patch did next to nothing as well. I dont know exactly who is to blame here, but it saddens me that they ruined this game for us.
