I dont care if your a fan of the series or brand new, DO NOT GET THIS GAME.  It is littered with bugs, glitches, bad code, everything that could go wrong goes wrong in this game.  Youll experience crashes and your save files disappearing on you, not being able to progress in the story up till seq 7, random popping in and out of npcs and textures, did I mention your game not saving either?  In my honest opinion this is a great game.  The launch sucked because they wanted to rush it out before xmas because this is their money maker.  the parkour is super fun, the missions are fun with the freedom they give you, the story is okay but not great.  Unless you want an all around glitchfest with no option to play with your friends or even finish the story then by all means pay up that 59.99.  Save your money for a couple of months.  I reccomend black flag or brotherhood if you really wanna play an AC game right now.
