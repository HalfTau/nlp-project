This game has the potential to be a good game. However, the constant glitches, frame rate drops, and crashes severly hamper any fun you can derive. As well, halfway through the game my physical and cloud save file became corrupted after one of these crashes. I had hoped that buying it after the main patch would have sufficed, alas this was not the case.
