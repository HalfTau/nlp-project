I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The games graphics are beautiful. I believe the problems with the game at release was the development team tried to do so much with this game, and I believe they might have been ahead of their time even. You will realize it when you look at the amount of assets, and NPCs in this game. If you look at the AC gamesyndicate after Unity youll notice there isnt nearly the number of NPCs. I liked the story and gameplay. Arno is a more fun charismatic character then Connor in AC3.
