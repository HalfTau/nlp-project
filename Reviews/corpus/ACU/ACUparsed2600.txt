when this was the only one i had played, i loved it, but now that i have played more all of the assasins creed games, i will say that there is still more to be praised than criticezed... yes, the storyline is flat, but the parcor is awesome... the fighting changed, but the graphics are great... overall it is a good game, but as an ac, not what the fans have come to expect
