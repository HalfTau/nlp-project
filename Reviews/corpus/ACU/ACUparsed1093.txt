Its another Assassins Creed game, so you generally know what to expect. The graphics on this one are great but are very taxing, even for high powered systems. Expect performance issues unless you are close to top of the line with your graphics card or are willing to turn settings and resolution down. In terms of gameplay, Im enjoying it but not as much as AC IV or Rogue. I miss the sea battles. They made some improvements to the parkour system but theres also a lot of extra stuff they added to this game that makes it hard for those who play mainly solo. Fortunately theyve removed the need to use the companion app to unlock things. Overall, this game is a lot more tedious to get all items on, and not quite as fun as some of the entries in the past. This will probably be the first game since they implemented the sync system that I havent gone for 100 sync.
