When I first loaded up the game I changed my settings and everything to low because of all the reviews about lag. Still, I had moments where the game derped and I couldnt do anything about it. I blamed it on my pc and my drivers that werent updated. After playing for an hour the game crashed without reason and brought me back to the uplay screen. I didnt want to continue so I closed it. A few days later I updated my drivers and got a new hard drive, so I reinstalled ACU on the new drive. When I wanted to launch it, it launched uplay, uplay seemed to launch the game... but it didnt. I had a nice picture of 4 assassins on my desktop and nothing else happened.I deleted everything, uplay, ACU, the saves and everything, reinstalled it again and it still didnt launch.Im done.Dont buy it, please.
