This game has great new additions to gameplay, however it is unplayable. More difficult and complex combat is great in principle is unpleasant in this game. The lag is terrible and lacks any of the smoothness Black Flag hadwhich i could run at the highest graphics, and Unity lags on the lowest. The new navigation system is a great solution to improper jumps that lead to deaths and looks great, but doesnt always turn out how you expectstill acceptable. Story also falls short compared to Black Flag.Overall concept great, execution fail. Ill stick to earlier versions.
