A shame that the brilliant work of the graphics department is coupled with a bugged engine that keeps crashing you out of the game. I managed to stop the crashes in my case by hooking up an extra card and going SLI mode but it doesnt stop the bugs.The rendition of France is amazingly done, but the streets appear  overcrowded and chaotic and quickly become overwhelming. The combat engine also appears to be sub par. All this make it a stressfull drag on you brain instead of an enjoyable experience.Solving the murder mysteries is a very nice addition to the AC genre. I really like it, if only i could find that jailhouse again on the map which is also a chaotic mess compared to maps of previous editions.I would not recommend this  game unless you have a top notch PC but judging from the complaints i see on the internet even that is no guarantee for a crash free experience.
