I do not Recomend this game for two big reasons...If you want to do anything besides basic controls you have to use mouse and keyboard, for example get ride of a msg telling you how to throw smoke bombs, you have to click the close button instead of pushing A on your controller, If you want to switch to a diffrent wepon you have to use mouse and keyboard. Secound reason if you try to use the mouse and keyboard after you tried the controller, it does not work at all.
