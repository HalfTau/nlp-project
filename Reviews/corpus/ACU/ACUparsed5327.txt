So many bad reviews ,but this game is lovely in my opinion D But you need a powerfull pc to enjoy this game. Min req Geforce 680 or AMD 280X to play it on Ultimate. Somethimes there are some framedrops and glitches, but what do you expect from a game that just got released. I def recommend the game, but wait for a decent price drop or buy it via Kinguin or G2A. 50  cheaper, but you have to live with the fact that you will have to use the Uplay Platform instead of Steam.
