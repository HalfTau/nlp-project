Assassins Creed UnityUbisoft MontrealUbisoftActionadventure, StealthYesYesOverall, Assassins Creed Unity seems to have lots of potential to keep the player entertained through the amazing graphics and partially enjoyable coop mode only when you play 4 man with some IRL friends, I would not recommend this game unless you have a really highend computer.If you can put up with the stuttering performance and some comically ridiculous bugs then theres a decent Assassins Creed experience to be found in Unity. The fact that its never more than decent makes those glaring technical issues much, much harder to excuse. Despite some good ideas and an entertaining tale, this isnt a revolution for the franchise. Considering the hype and the promises made compared to the final experience, it actually feels like a step backwards.
