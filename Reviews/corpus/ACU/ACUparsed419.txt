The microtransactions feel very intrusive and break immersion for me every time I see them.I played a few hours of Assassins Creed Unity, but the fantastic gameplay of the Ezio games is long gone.I guess that the graphics were probably better, and what I did see of the story looked intriguing, but the game just isnt fun to play. Im moving on.Oh, and uPlay is a gigantic pain in the butt. It feels very intrusive. Even though I told it not to remain running after my game started, it was still there in the system tray every time I looked.
