What everyone else is saying is true, it has terrible rendering. The game simply is so glitchy that looking up is a peril, even more so than anything else in the world. Beware the terrible glitching and god help you if an explosion should go off and throw off all of your framerate and get you killed. I recommend Ubisoft Recall this game like a bad car with a safety design flaw to save some face before people get migranes from its annoyance. If I could, Id put two thumbs down.   I recommend anyone reading this waits a solid month or at least until reviews start rolling in positive to even consider buying it, Id honestly like my money back but we all know thats not going to happen, so at the very least I can try to stop them from getting any more for this shoddy piece of work, good luck recovering Ubisoft.
