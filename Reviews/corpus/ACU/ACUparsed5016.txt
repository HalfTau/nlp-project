Very good game, its just laggy! Why is it laggy? You may ask, it seems to be shadows and the execive hair and cloths flapping around, for those whom dont have very good pcs I wouldnt get this game till it has resolved some... Fps issues example Being able to deactivate shadows, it might make the game look worse but to save peoples pcs. I would make this a option. Also to deactivate the hair and cloths flapping. But for an assassins creed game, its 9/10!
