Alright, I gave this game another go after all the patches and that I cooled off, and to be honnest I ended up liking the game much more. In between my first time playing it and my new playthrough, Ive done multiple essays, one of which was about the French Revolution, so this made me much more aware of the historical/political events in the game. Reading the database entries made the entire experience feel a little more immersive. Knowing this, the story was more bareable and enjoyable even if this isnt the better story experience the franchise has to offer. The characters made more sense on my second playthrough.Gameplay wise, the game didnt improve uppon my first playthrough. I still believe the combat was still somewhat easy harder than before, but still easy. The AI was still dumb and laughable, same goes to the cover system which is clunky at best. The stealth was a step foward and a step backwards, it improved and worsten on many occasions. The side missions are okay but became a chore after a while so I stopped doing the typical Ubisoft sand box thing. The assassination missions are some of the best in the series, reminding me of the first Assassins Creed game.As for the port, it has majorly improved since release but I still do notice some issues frames still drop in cutscenes for some odd reason and there are still bugs applenty. However it is much, MUCH better than what it was before.In conclusion, if you like the series, I do somewhat recomend this. I believe it is a step foward and a step backwards for the franchise. Purchasing it during a sale would be optimal, 69.99 CAD  is far too much.P.S. IF THERES ONE ING THING I CANT STAND IN THIS GAME ITS THE ING VOICE ACTING. THIS IS FRANCE, NOT ENGLAND, PLEASE ROLL YOUR ING RS. AS A FRENCH SPEAKER, HOLY  PLEASE LEARN HOW TO ROLL RS IF YOURE GOING TO VOICE ACT A CHARACTER IN FRANCE.
