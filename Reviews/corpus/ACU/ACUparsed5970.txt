Well  you too UbisoftI honestly have no idea whether the gamestory, gameplay,AI, level design.... itself is any good but it runs atrociosly, perhaps its my mashines fault, its not the newest or most expensive thing on the market,but it ran shadows of mordor well, and from what i have seen Unity doesnt have overwhelmingly better graphics. Also the bugs... So yes, dont buy it, and yes I regret buying it myself. But maybe this is that last straw that breaks the camels back. Maybe this poor release will lead to some sort of production/quolity controll reform in gaming industry. Also its a nice contrast, We had DivinityOriginal sin see a great release, bug free and good game overall with fraction of a budget. we have seen Wasteland 2 enjoy similar sucess, again with fraction of a budget. sector is becoming more efficient, dinasours like AC francize are destined to die out, and we should welcome it. Yes Im disapointed I didnt get to play my AC today, but I am comforted by the changing tides of the market promising cheaper and better games in the future. Go free market and responsible consumers also consumers please be responsible unlike me and dont buy this game.
