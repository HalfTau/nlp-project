I see all these not recommenced reviews of this game based purely on weather they can run it or not maybe you should read the Recommended System Requirements, if you dont have that, dont set it on high graphics. .as for the bug, just a matter of time before they fix that.This game it far from bad, it harder than before but not so much so that you wanna rage quit, you cant really kill 100 guards just for sport like in the other where guards just stared at you while you killed them.there is also some problem with sticking to walls, but thats not so much the games fault at its just uncommon controls.other than that, the game is fun, well made and have alot of interesting mechanics.
