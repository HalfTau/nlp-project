This game works perfeclty on my computer!Everything maxed out ecxept AA which i set at 4x.MY rigCPU Intel Core i75820K 6Core 3.3GHzRAM 16GB DDR4 2133MHzGPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 Zotac 4GB EditionOS Win7 64bitResolution 1980x1080 60fpsThis game is the same old Assasins Creed as you have come to expect from someone like Ubisoft.Its a great game with lots, and then i mean LOTS, of content. Ive 45 active hours so far and completed 8 total.Everything works effortlessy, exept the freerunning, as usuall. Arno will jump up on benches, confuse himself on where he is supposed to go when climbing and especially when climbing in windows...That is one grande task for Arno, but after 5 tries, he manages to figure out how to climb in.Other than that its great. it runs really smooth on my rig, never stuttering or lagging in any way, so far.
