I honestly have no idea why people say this game is bad, i absolutely love it. I havent encountered a single bug or glitch and i find the characters interesting and likeable. The multiplayer can be avoided completely for those of you who say the multiplayer is terrible and unneccasary. There are puzzles in the form of riddles which i googled the answers for with no shame at all and combat is fastpaced and involving.Is it worth it? Yes. Should i buy this over Syndicate? No but if you finished syndicate and are looking for more AC this is the place.
