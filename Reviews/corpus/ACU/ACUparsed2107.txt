The game world is great though the story does a pretty miserable job of explaining the French Revolution and honestly I couldnt keep up with who was who as the story was just 100 total . Arno is not a memorable character and youll be happy to see the end of him when you finish.Probably the only Assassins Creed game I rushed to finish ASAP so I wouldnt have to keep playing the thing.Best part of the whole game is the rift scenarios where you are trapped between servers and see memories from other time periods. That was interesting. Dont buy this game.
