I was very hesitant to buy this game because of all the glitches and bugs this game had when it just launched. Which rendered the game unplayable for a lot of people, including some of my friends. However, I just couldnt resist buying it, so here I am writing this review.Damn, am I glad I finally bought this game!The attention to detail is fing crazy, the graphics are incredibly beautiful and the city really feels alive!Also, the gameplay and story are better than I expected and I enjoy it a lot so far. Arno is not half as bad as an assassin as the internet is trying to make him look, I like him quite a bit!I really feel that Unity is a diamond in the rough and it deserves a second chance. Yes it suffered from a terrible launch, everything about this game was a mess technically speaking but after all the patches that Ubisoft put out I think they finally got it together with this game. Believe it or not, but it runs surprisingly smooth on my system AMD FX8320  ASUS GTX750Ti OC 2GB DDR5  8GB RAM, at relatively high settings as well!Recommended!
