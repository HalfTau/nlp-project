Co op is amazing and a lot of fun. It is a little hard to run with a GTX 970 and 8 gb of ram i get between 4060 fps but the game looks greats and there is a lot going on at all times still looks really smooth. this so far has been my favorite AC since Brotherhood. If you like AC get this game and if you have a friend who likes AC then you should both get it and enjoy a great co op experience.
