Horrible game. I got it the day of release, and it released buggy. I waited over five months for it to be fixed, and it never was. The game is badly optimized, glitchy, and totally unplayable. As for the story, characters, or any other aspect, I wouldnt know. It barely even starts up. I will definitely be eyeing any future Ubisoft games with suspicion.
