Very fun. Had some memory leak/CTD issues at first but they got resolved quickly. Played solo and have started doing the solo missions. Have the best gear available currently, and cant wait to unlock a few of the items only available through the coop missions. Pretty much just going to be aesthetic upgrades.Id give the game 8/10. The story could have been a bit deeper and developed the characters some more, but fun nonetheless. Multiplayer is fun, but so far has devolved into smoke bomb murderfests. Hopefully more skill will be required in the future.
