I been playing this game for several hours. I have not run into any major bugs, including issues with framerate or optimization. The only issues I have on my end is npc pathfinding trying to go through a locked door. Other than that everything runs smoothly. Great gameplay, still waiting however to do co op. If I have to rate it right now I will say 9/10, I will rate it 10/10 once the pathfinding is improved a bit.EDITAfter a few more hours of playing this, I did find a few instances where I fell through the map. It wasnt too common its just rarely happening when I get hit by a running NPC. But none the less, I still reccomend this game. Its pretty damn good.
