Get this game if youre using Windows 7 or 8. If you have Windows 10 stay away. Game crashes every 510 minutes for me and what makes this even worse is its a known issue ubisoft is unwilling to patch. I even got in touch with them and they simply blamed it on the OS saying they would not support it. This has made the game completely unplayable for me.However, from what I have seen so far the game is very good. Being new to Assassins creed the game looked great, with a really good story, character development and fight/climb system. Infact, I enjoyed what I played so much I have just purchased syndicate as I hear that works fine on Windows 10.
