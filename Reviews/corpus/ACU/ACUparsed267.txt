This game is way too underrated. I understand why it gets a lot of hate it broke from a wellestablished pattern of Assassins Creed games. True Its nothing like the other games It has minigames and miniquests, creed points and helix points, coop and rpg elements. In an AC game? Heresy. In any other game? Good qualities.This was my first Assassins Creed game, so I was able to experience it without comparing it to any precursors punpunpun. My experience was wholly positive Great graphics, engaging revenge/redemption story, a 11 replica of Revolutionary Paris, and unlimited amounts of cool parkour moves.If youre a newcomer to the AC series, and you still have an open mind, give this game a shot its worth it. Bugs have been patched and price is lower than the other nextgen AC games. If youre an old follower of the series, Id still advocate trying this one out and doing your best to view it as a completely standalone video game that just happens to borrow the plot of AC.Point is, EEEZ GUUD.
