Assassins Creed is a great game.. It runs fine on my system as well as on each of my three childrens systems.. The visuals are outstanding and I love the Paris architecture.. I also have enjoyed the story line.. I would recommend that you make a backup of the saved game files.. I did lose some data because of a sync error.. This has only happened once though.
