The story and gameplay in this game is fantastic! Transitions from cutscenes to movement are fluent, and it really makes you feel involved. I run this game flawlessly on ultra high graphics and I play with an Xb1 controller. I can see how people with lowend computers or good Alienware pcs would get frustrated. But, if you have a good rig, this game is ing beautiful. Walking through a hallway and the light passing through the windows with these graphics are just fantastic. Im glad I got this on PC instead of Xbox, the graphics are way better. I would totally recommend this if you have a good enough PC to run it.
