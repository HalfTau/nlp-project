I have played the whole AC franshise from AC 1 on xbox 360 to AC Unity. By far the best one for me personally was AC Rogue as it featured more land play than AC 4 Black Flag but was still balanced with alot of Sea battles and challenges.I always enjoyed the AC franchise due to their combat system. Yes it has gotten too easy but completly taking the counter ability away was complete idiocy. Yes as an assassin your not suppose to kill of 100 soldiers in a battle but it was what made the game so enjoyable, and besides if they wanted to get technical, the guy doesnt die with slashing him with a sword 3  5 times unless your a complete retard playing with a butter knife! What I am saying is that take away the counter ability yes, but dont make me slash a enemy freaking 500 times to get him to die, if your a assassin kill the guy with one strike or does the assassins also have to warm up?I have read that Syndicates combat system has been improved, I have not played it as I am still playing Unity and I am playing in sequence. So please give the guy who created this combat system a butter knife and give me an assassin who doesnt cut a guy 500 times to get him to die.Whoever created the new parkour system heres a tap on your back, great work. I personally think you should advise our butter knife assassin on a better combat system. I will even settle for the old glitcy one.Oh and Graphics, yeah buddy!I am not going to recommend this game because with its combat system I was disgusted that I had payed R600 which is 40 for a game that disappointed me in the first 20 minutes. So I beg you, as a true Ubisoft customer which plays most of your titles and a real AC fan sort out the combat system before launching the new title cause whoever designed this was definitly trying to get us to start playing other games instead!Regards
