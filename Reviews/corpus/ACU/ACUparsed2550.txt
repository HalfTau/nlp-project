Just bought a new computer so that I could play games like AC Unity as well as Batman Gotham Knight, and Ive found that even on the lowest settings, AC Unity is almost unplayable, the graphics in the cut scenes are jumping about all over the place and the actual gameplay is just as bad! Id heard this game was broken when it was first released so I thought Id wait a few months for them to iron out the bugs, but theyre still charging top dollar for a broken game!!!
