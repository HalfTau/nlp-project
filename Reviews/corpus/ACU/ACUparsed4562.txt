Im not sure why everyone is dumping on Unity so much. The game does have some glitches mostly visual and with the crowd animations and you need a pretty powerful machine to run it at a decent frame rate but Ive yet to seen anything game breaking. Ubisoft does seem to be pretty proactive at patching any bugs that have been found.As for gameplay it seems roughly to form for an Assassins Creed game. Ie, lots of open world filler but still reasonably entertaining. The combat seems fun even thought it is the now ubiqutious Batman style combat system.The graphics can be quite arresting at times. Really great lighting.Im running this on an i7 3770 3.4Ghz and an nVidia 780 running the game at 1080p with most settings at max and get around 4555fps. Ive had the very occasional crash but nothing that has really stopped me from enjoying the game.
