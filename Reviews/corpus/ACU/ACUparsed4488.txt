Cautious recommendation as of 12/14/14About performancei7 4770k7950 3GB16GB RAMIm pretty close to the recommended except for the video card Im at the minimum...3560 fps average  900p on ultra high with aa changed to fxaa30 to 60 average  1080p on same graphical settingsGame runs decently now after the AMD drivers update...still waiting for patch 4.Under the technical issues though, the game is mostly excellent.Graphically, overall this game is amazing looks better than Black Flag for sure but I see a lot of lowres textures even with texture settings on ultra high....There are glitches and popins, but its not a big deal for me....game works fine.Gameplay...I prefer this over naval stuff anyday...However, there should be more coop missions and theres no PVP multiplayer.Speaking of coop, it is glitchy and sometimes takes a while to find a public game.The customization though, is really good. Masterpiece compared to Watch Dogs customization...lol. Different skills, weapons and different looking equipment with different stats! It keeps me playing to unlock the better equipment and weapons.The story is kind of cheesy and cliche but I prefer this over AC3 and AC4 Still prefer Ezio trilogy the best.Overall, Id recommend you to buy this game when it goes on sale at least. I just bought it for 60 and Im happyGotta get my landlocked AC fix.This is my favorite AC game...overall.
