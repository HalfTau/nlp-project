All the hype about this game is good, but there seems to still be a lot of glitches. Just playing it for the not even 4 hours I have, Ive experienced at least 5 times where I have been desynchronized because I jumped and got stuck in a wall. This game is also extremely laggy. Ive turned down all the qualities to their lowest, and Im getting the worst feedback. I understand its a large game, but I should easily be able to run this with little lag. These are the only problems I have experienced with the game, and I hope that they can be fixed soon, because it does have an interesting storyline thus far.Currently with the glitches though, Id have to say I dont recommend it that well. A good story cant make up for a bad experience.
