The hardest one of any AC game Ive played so far.The worst thing about the gameplay is sometimes character will jump into random directions , which sucks ..Bad camera also cause awful battle experience.However, really engaging graphics, impressing details, and the story is not as bad as many people said.Fairly nice game to get on sale,  dont recommend for the full price.
