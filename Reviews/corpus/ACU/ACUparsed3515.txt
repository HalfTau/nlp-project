This has to be one of my favorite Assassins Creed games I am a strong fan I have play all the games except for freedom cry and liberation. I have to say the best part was the new combat system, it adds a new element of realism.  The story was on the so so. All and all its a good game the system requirements were a little bit high.Combat 8/10Story 7/10Over All 7.5/10
