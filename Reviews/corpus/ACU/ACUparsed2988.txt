Yes I like the game, but yes it has a few problems. Those being the following Sometimes when I come out of a hiding spot, all the extremists in the area see me, doesnt matter if they are on the other side of a wall or not they still see me. Sometimes when I dodge or parry I still get hit and I usually die from it. And a lot of the time I get hit no matter what I do in any scenario. Other than that this is a wellmade game and a good one to play at that. Definitely reccomend getting this game, only if you have a powerful machine. There machines saying the performance is low and it keeps crashing on them. Thats not the game thats their machine. I have never run into a crashing problem or lag in my 14 hours on the game.
