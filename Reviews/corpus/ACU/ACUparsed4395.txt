i still have problems whit this game even after the 3rd patch. I have a PC that should support this game at low graphics but it is stuck at 20fps!!! also in some places, the video disappears and the grafic tilts! I m very disappointed because i wasted 60!! I hope that the 4rt patch can correct ssomething. Now i can t play it and I invite anyone to DON T BUY IT.If you have a computer beast maybe you can play it at 30fps....
