If Ubisoft stopped making so many Assasinss Creed games per year and focused on not rushing games out to release and making a better quality of game then this game would of been great, sadly even now it is riddled with glitches and numerous other issues that plauge this game.Assasins Creed Unity needs to have alot of time spent on fixes all the issues with it but Ubisoft, being Ubisoft will just focus on their new game assassins creed syndicate I hope they do fix this game as It would be a great gme to play if they did.If they released One game every 1216 months I feel the overall quality of the games would start to improve and the issues I mention and the other problems other users have reported and reviewed would go away overnight.I would rate this game in its current state 4.1, but if the issues were fixed I would double my rating of this game So if any employee of Ubisoft is reading this pull the finger out of your fucingand do something about it. Players before profit!
