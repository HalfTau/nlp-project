First of all i love the assassins creed games.I just finished the introduction scenes. so my impression is only about the first part, but confirmes the overall mixed feeling of the reviews,This game has the elements we know of the other AC games. I love the fact that it is in Paris. But when starting the game, you will quickly see there are lots of game bugs.  In the opening scenes, i actually needed to  switch resolution various times, sothat a door would open.... major bug that is is not fixed... in the opening scene! how can you miss that, after all the updates?Be prepared for some frustration because of lots of map glitches, and bugs i guess...Downvoted because as the top commenter mentioned, this game feels like an early access game.EditOn the otherhand, if you see all the horrible bugs as another metagame, it is quite fun to play and get to the end of the storyline, having to reset videocards, rebuilding gamecache, just to be able to play etc.... So, it is playable, but only if you are prepared to search for the bug fixes.
