Well the short version is this Unplayable. Even though Ubisoft tries to patch it. It is still not in a state that i would spend money on it. The game wont even start. Although there are some solution to the problem its complicated and long.I think that, when i buy a game i dont wanna spend time on patching, reading forums on how to fix it, i wanna play it.Simple is that, and Ubisoft is failt to deliver that.
