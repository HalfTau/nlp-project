This review is written by someone who has played every AC game with the exception of Rogue. In each installment, I have achieved 98 synch with 100 in Black Flag, Liberation, and Brotherhood. I have completed the ACUnity main storyline and am leaving the game at 62 synch. I just cannot continue navigating around the map doing all of the side quests and gathering the collectibles.The beauty of the older AC games is the ability to enter a new zone and clear the map. This is nearly impossible in ACU. Aside from the Nomad chests littering the map of which I have been playing the Companion App since release and am about 70 done completed Rift and Coop quests still remain on the map. This makes it harder to prioritize what stil needs to be completed, etc. The older version had a map filter, so does ACU. However, the filter does not allow for customization like the older versions and you cannot filter Collectibles.Graphically the game is amazing. The story is ok. There is not realworld connection outside of the Animus like Black Flag had. Youre just locked in there the entire game. This creates a lack of depth which made the other games so involving. From an AC fan with over 300 hours invested into the series, I am fairly disappointed with this installment.
