Good graphics and storyline, but...The controls are an absolute mess most of the time its sluggish, sometimes its completely unresponsive, and other times it does whatever it decides to, and those problems extend to the combat system as well. I was under the impression that as an assassin youre supposed to be an efficient killer, and yet there have been many occasions where Arno is supposed to perform an air assassination, but instead knocks over the enemy and then waits for him to get up again before attacking. Sometimes the enemy glitches and simply ceases movement.Other glitches include not being given the option to unlock doors, even though youve trained for it, and not being able to sabotage alarms.And then theres the t collectables which only artifically extends gameplay, but are an absolute annoyance to pick up.It doesnt help that Ubisoft is seriously milking this franchise as well, which is leading to boredom of the series, as theres really nothing new in this title. If you really must pick up this game, do it when theres a sale.
