I love AC but this is too much, The thing keeps crashing, My machine is old but not bad  32gig Ram i7 3930  pros.,  my vid card is a 680 that could use an upgrade but in spec. I have never spent 60 bucks on a game this buggy. I hope the genius that said this is ready for prime time gets canned.Actuallyl, I think the story might be good and if the thing worked it might be a good game. But right now I want my money back. Black Flag was so good what a letdown
