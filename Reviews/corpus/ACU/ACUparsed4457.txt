For some strange reason, I rarely experienced any performance issues at all. I never even crashed. Im not sure why there are so many negative reviews out there based on the performance, but maybe Im just an anomaly.The one thing I am the most disappointed about is the story. I just wanted some more depth and quests and focus on the actual French revolution rather than a feud between assassins and templars. I cant say I didnt enjoy the game, however.I would recommend this game to a friend. Well, a friend who has a good enough PC to run it.
