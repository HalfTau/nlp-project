Since the first patch has been released, here is my review after playing it for 22hrsWell, overall the gameplay is great and beautiful. The frame issues has been fixed almost 80 and also the glitches/bugs.The only thing that it doesnt satisfied me is, the optimize settings. It still very poor and hopefully the next major patch will fix em all.P.S I suggest you guys those who has the minimum requirement for this game can buy it now, you will be amazed with the gameplay. Just a matter of optimizing issues now. I will change my review once the 2nd major patch release again.
