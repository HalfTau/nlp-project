Ok, let me prefix this by saying, I have no idea how a game this awesome gets such  reviews, I played it and my computer handled it finebetter then fine actually, although this game is not without flaws, such as the absence of pickpocketing from civillians, as well as a multitude other cons, but never forget the plus points, they have totally improved the freerunning system, they have given you the ability to strengthen your assassin, it rewards you for the more activities you complete as Arno, all in all, this game is flawed, but what game isnt?
