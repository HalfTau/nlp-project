The issue with gamers is that they expect perfection, without really even know what they are asking for.The creators of this game had a vision, and we should respect that vision and ask ourselves  did they set out to do what they wanted? or are we upset because it didnt meet what we thought should be in this game?That being said, for what they wanted to get across, this game is fantastic!Yes, there are some framrate issues here and there, but they are minor when compared to the sheer amount of detail and thought process into what it takes to create a game of this magnitude. I mean, the fact that this game can even run should be a testiment to how far we have come in the video gaming world.Gameplay  8/10Graphics  9/10Story  8.5/10This is a great addition to the AC franchise, and to miss it would be doing yourself a diservice.
