 Way, way, WAY too many worthless side quests and activities. Its all timewasting padding to disguise the lack of a compelling main story arc. The little jumps to different time periods are weird, pointless little arcade diversions. The main story is boring and predictable, and the main character Arno is devoid of charm or depth. The leveling system is confusing there isnt really a coherent EXP tracking system, but quests have a recommended level. Perks and abilities are buried in a bewildering stack of submenus. The controls are clunky and feel like a step back from games like Black Flag. Switching weapons is difficult, and the dynamic abilities that change based on your proximity to an enemy, such as melee vs. assassinate are clumsily handled ... I have hidden blades selected and try to make a stealth kill, only to punch the guy instead, alerting the guards and failing the quest. Ive played all the AC games, and Ive never seen an AC with more arbitrary and frustrating quest restrictions dont be seen or the quest fails, dont kill anyone or the quest fails, etc. Theyre just there as a pacing speed bump, not because there was a compelling storyrelated reason for them, and it feels forced and speaks of lazy quest design ... lets forbid you from using all the hardearned weapons and abilities that would be most useful for this quest, and make you complete it like a noob, stumbling through crowds and past guards to kill some guy like you never made it past level 1, because we, the developers, were too lazy to find a more natural way to make quests more challenging.I never bothered to finish this game, and I never will.
