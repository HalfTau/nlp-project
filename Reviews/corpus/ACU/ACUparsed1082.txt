Decent enough game. 2 years later and its bug free, looks amazing, plays decently. I really enjoyed the game, still dont think its as good as Black Flag but still pretty good. The only thing that rings out to me is how hard it is on my 4930K GTX 1080 setup, I play in 2560x1080 and to maintain VSYNC75hz I have to turn the graphics down one notch. With games like this, it makes me giggle to think some people actually think we are even close to 4K gaming... A great game if you have the HP to run it.....
