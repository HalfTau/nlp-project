I cant understand that. There are some areas in Paris and your fps cant go above 50 even if you have a beast gaming setup i7 cpu gtx 780. I wonder what will happen if i change my settings to low and surprisingly nothing changed at all. I  set my resolution to the lowest and the same thing, nothing changes. This and all of these frame issues should be fixed.This is a good and also an enjoyable game but completely unplayable at this time. Hope it gets fixed soon...
