Why did I buy this? If you consider buying this game, wait! It is like buying a nice piece of dinnerware, except all the plates are broken and you need a wonder, not glue, to fix it.The controls are messed up, the animations are broken, the story is as thin as a layer of graphene I dont feel anything for Arno. I dont even know who he is., and so on...The Assassins Creedgames have potential to be something great. In this game, Ubisoft could tell an amazing story about the French revolution that really grasps me but, alas, they dont. They could make a visually beautiful game, but no... They produce an Assassins Creed game every year which is great. And they produce an Assassins Creed game every year that makes the series so thin, uninteresting and bad that it makes me cry. Dont get me wrong, I love the series but this is really disappointing. It has potential. The multiplayer is a nice touch but all the bugs and messed up things makes it near implayable.Buy it when it is on sale. Buy it when Ubisoft have fixed it. Not until then!0/10, would not buy Assassins Greed again.
