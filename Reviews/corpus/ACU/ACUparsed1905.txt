Such a shame really. It would be a really amazing game if it werent for the frame rate issue and the microtransaction. I would rate it neutral because despite of the problems, it actually pretty fun. Theres so much things to do. And the assassins tradition can be felt in the game. Where you have to go through the initiation process to actually be an assassin. I really missed those feels since AC3 and Black Flag kind of having an unsuitable era and situation to held an initiation event so they kind of just go with the flow and let The Connors be assassins. 6/10 from me.
