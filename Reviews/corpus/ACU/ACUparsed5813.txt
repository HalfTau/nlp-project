Since the large amount of reviews are pertaining to performance, let me say that my AC unity runs perfectly fine using a GTX 760 2gb vram i7 4790 and 8gb of hyperx ram. By fine I mean High settings hovering around 50 fps, and at high settings the game is GORGEOUS.Now that thats out of the way, let me start by saying gameplay wise this is the pinnicle of AC games, and there is very little they could improve on past this point. The parkour is seamless, a constant flow of movement ensures the player is never stuck performing tedious climbs and descents ever again. But more importantly, there is finally a combat aspect to Assassins Creed, no longer can you jump carelessly into an army and survive with no hiccups. At least to the point where I have reached the fights are difficult, and no longer can I cruise through a combat situation. There are minor clipping issues here and there with combat/movement however the amount is negligable. So much love has been put into the world, and finally you feel like youre actually part of a virtual city. Pedestrians are everywhere and much more unique than past games, and the city feels alive as promised by ubisoft. Coupled with masterful storytelling as always and incredible voice acting, this game plays just as delivered, and definetely exceeds my expectations. Do not let the other reviews fool you, the COOP is incredible, the gameplay is damn near perfect, this may well end up being my favorite game of the decade.As for what I would like to see changed, optimization definetely needs to take place as far as graphics, although I am more than happy with high I would like to see how the game plays on ultra high.
