I was incredibly disappointed with this game. Not only are the graphics advertised completely false, but on high graphic settings everything from the gameplay to the cutscenes are laggy and glitchy, and this is not just my computer as it is a gaming computer. Also the game has several general glitches, such as a dense white fog that will occur whenever you are inside a room, allowing you only to see those very close to your character. This exists even thoughout the cutscenes.Terrible game, do not buy!
