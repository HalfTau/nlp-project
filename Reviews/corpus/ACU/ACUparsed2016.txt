I have to say Im pleasantly surprised.When the game was released around a year a year and a half? ago, I heard so many negative reviews about this game. Even today, Im still hearing negative reviews about it. So, naturally, I started playing the game with a rather negative mindset and very high skepticism.The first thing that came to my mind was Oh my gosh, this game is pretty. And it was a really pretty game. Im fortunate enough that Im able to run the game without any FPS drops, and Ive heard that people had this problem.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, though IMO its a bit too short.For the negatives... firstly its got to be the clunky controls. Free running now is more of a pain in thethan the previous games in the series. Sometimes my enemies glitched and became invulnerable, and sometimes I couldnt interact with them at all. This, however, was easily fixed by being notorious then reverting back to being anonymous for some reason.Multiplayer is dead. And also, dont buy Helix Credits PTLDR, I failed to see what the fuss was all about. Sure, the game could do with some more improvement, but allinall, an enjoyable AC game. Get it during a sale if you can!
