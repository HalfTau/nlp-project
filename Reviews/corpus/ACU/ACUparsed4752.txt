There is nothing special about Unity in terms of the story my opinion, its not bad, its just not that great either. In terms of the style of missions comparing it all the other assassins creed games, this has to be one of best and enjoyable  experiences you can get in any AC missions, especially the coop missions which i loved that it has a small story at the beginning of every one and the side quests where you become sherlock holmes and solve murder mysteries. Ubisoft did learn from AC4 of the completely useless and dull tailing missions that was just a pain in the nutsack to complete, no doubt i spent most of my hours just doing those small side quests and coop mission instead of playing through the actual story.I would recommend this game, but not for the story, but for the amazing world ubisoft has created that you can get lost in and spend hours and hours having fun, doing some detective work, creating your own assassin to match your playstyle and then chaning your entire build 2 secs later cause you found better gear, and ofcourse cockblocking AI who wants to make out while youre trying to assinate your target.
