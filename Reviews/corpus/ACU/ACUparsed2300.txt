Even though people said the game was glitchy, it was still an assassins creed game that will revolutionize and help future assassins creed games better Syndicate. Just finished it and it was fun. The coop was fun except for the people that decides to afk, but there was always an option to play alone which I prefered. The story was well made all history characters were like the things i did try learning in history classes. knowing that there were some glithches that are going to pop up, it didnt stop me from playing it. i didnt bother trying to get any microtransactions and hack in the op equipments, but still i got through it by looting. Near the end I didnt have enough money to buy consumables but that lead me to be more sneaky. Thats hard considering that I play merciless. So far though i love to give this a game thumbs up.
