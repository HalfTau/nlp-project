Yes... there have been many crashes and it is a bit laggy, but the game overall is pretty fun. When I had first gotten the game it could not start, but if you install GeForce Experience, the started to work and I could actually play. The game is really fun and looks nice if you can turn up your settings even a litlle bit. Coop is amazing and playing with friends is awesome  I wish this feature was in earlier games. There are tons of side missions so you wont get bored after the story. This game does have its many downsides as you can probably tell from other reviews, but it has just as many good things to show too. If you meet the recommended or minimum requirements, I would definately recommend that you buy this game.
