People complain of the bugs and other displesantries that annoy them, but Ive yet to run into anything game braking or anything that would truely stop me from playing it. Dragon age Inquisition had such bad bugs I had to stop playing it because it would randomly crash.Unity however is quite pleasnt. It delivers where it promised to with seamless transistion from single to cooperative play, all off the same character with the same skills that you work on from the begining. It carries a heafty collection of color schemes and options of play styles, making it pleasantly customizable.Truely my only complaint of the game itself is the better weapons and armour all look stupid. All I wanted was a dirty rustic Assasin with a huge overpowered ax and a dirty tattered hood so I could look much like the peasants. That, and I cant seem to figure out how to play with my Clan.
