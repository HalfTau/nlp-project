heres my rigCPU FX8350  4.8GHzMOB MSI 970 GAMINGGPU 2 Radeon R9 290 XRAM Vengeance 32 GB DDR3 2400MHzI have changed my review after three weeks of going around with tech support via email finally figured out the issue on why the game was playing so glitchy. I have three hard drives one SSD and two WD Black Drives for some reason the game would not play correctly when installed eather of my two internal WD drives, when steam and uplay was installed on  my SSD my primary drive. After a complete uninstall and reinstall on my primary drive this game so for has been playing flawlessly with all settings on Very high. I still have all my other programs and games installed on the other drives as they play and run with no issues. This game for some reason seems to need to be on the same drive as the launch program.
