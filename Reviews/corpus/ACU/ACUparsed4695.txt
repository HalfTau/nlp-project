Dont get this game not yet, as you have probably already noticed Ubisofts most recent installment of Assassins Creed suffered a catastrophic launch. The game is plagued with innumerable technical issues ranging from unavoidable bugs, AI issues and crippling frame rates and graphics issues. Like many others I was excited and pumped for this game as I now regrettably fell for the brilliant marketing. Right now Ubisot are in damage control and are scrambling to address these issues. Ubisoft reputation has no doubt taken quite a blow from this dismal disappointment.So If I were you, wait, there is no point in buying a broken game.
