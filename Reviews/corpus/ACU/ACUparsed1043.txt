For the first time to play Assassins creed, originally began to be very happy, suddenly came out of a modern story, at the moment did not play mood. Dont you think that modern elements are redundant? Cant you think of the story? Can not think of the copyright sold to other game makers to make it, really, I bought I regret it.
