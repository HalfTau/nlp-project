What workedStory, graphics, fun gameplay, murder mysteries  coop.What didnt workDrastically different combat that I never got used to  never enjoyed.Removal of ships/naval combatA pretty weak story overall.  Arno is an interesting character, but the story is only as good as the supporting characters.  Aside from Bellec  Elise, I never knew or cared about anyone else.   You never befriend the other assassins or do missions for them like in the Ezio games.  The amount of interaction they give to the story was very distant and cold.You only meet the main villain twice.  Its almost as bad as the AC Revelations Villain that you literally never meet  youre surprised he even knew your name.  Ayala, Haytham, Rodrigo, Cesare, these are the characters that are supposed to steal the show, draw sympathy  taunt you through out the game.  You never meet Germain until the end of the game.The game controls pretty weird too, the thousands of NPCs in Paris is amazing to look at, but they didnt get Arno to control as smoothly as I had Edward or Ezio down.  I really think they were changing what wasnt broken just for the sake of changing it to say that they had innovated.For whatever reason, they removed all the real world 2014 interaction and replaced it with these  Helix portals.  Sending Arno to occupied 1942 France?  What the hell are you doing?  As much as I often hated the real world/modern day timelines at times, at least they were seeded with the fiction of the story.Overall, if you like the Assassins Creed games, this is enjoyable.  However, the main character is better than Connor  Edward, but worse than Ezio, Altair  Shay.  The main villain is very weak, the supporting characters are all nobodies compared to the memorable cast from the Ezio trilogy.  And thats really a recurring theme every time I play AC games, Im always comparing them to the Ezio trilogy.  I had more fun in Black Flag  Rogue even though they were earlier iterations.
