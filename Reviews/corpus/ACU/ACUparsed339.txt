A seriously underrated game. I havent had as much fun playing AC since the Ezio era. All of the major bugs which were present at launch have been eradicated. Yes, there are a few minor problems here and there, but nothing game breaking even with the use of SLI. The story is decent not the best, not the worst, but the most captivating part of Unity is the stunning realisation of France during the French Revolution. The world feels alive it is detailed and intricate. You can tell a lot of time has been spent painstakingly recreating the incredible architecture.I have just started playing Syndicate, and whilst it is clearly more polished, it doesnt capture the same spirit of Unity.All in all, I would definitely reccomend AC Unity.
