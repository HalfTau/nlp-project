This game suffered bugs in its early release, but for the most part these have been fixed. It demands alot, but if your computer can handle it it is a welldetailed, decently functioning game. It has some interesting new side activities murder mysteries for instance, though these can occasionally be less than satisfying.It also fixed a lot that was wrong with the previous titles. Arno is the first Assassin who can free run down buildings, a much needed development. He can also crouch and hide behind objects properly. These are skills you might have expected to appear in the franchise earlier on.My complaints though, are not technical. The characters in this game failed to intruigue and excite me like they had in its predecessor Blag Flag. To be quite honest, I couldnt care less about Arno. Not to mention the landscape is bleak and repetitive. The story is mediocre, and at times difficult to keep up with.I have not played the multiplayer feature very much, and dont feel able to comment on that.If youre committed to the franchise. I would recommend this game. But I would certainly rate it one of the poorer titles in the Assassins Creed collection
