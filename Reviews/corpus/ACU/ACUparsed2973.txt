I cant recommend this. I love this series, I really do but holythis game has made me want to smash my head into the wall.PROSThe story is really good, and the Abstergo intel you gain from Helix rifts is always interesting to read. Thats about it really.CONS1. Performance issues.I have a GTX 780 Ti, and an i7 and this game brings my system to its ing knees, and doesnt even look that great. I can get 60fps with everything on Ultra/Very High except PCSS and Anti aliasing FXAA only, MSAA and TXAA is a big fat nope. Drops the fps by about 20 but it is not even remotely stable. Drops for no reason. The game doesnt look good enough to justify the performance and system requirements. THIS RUNS ON A ING XBOX ONE AND LOOKS ALMOST AS GOOD. Sure the framerate is lower for sure, but seriously? Get it together Ubisoft.2. The controls.The amount of times Arno bugs out while climbing, gets stuck on NOTHING, jumps on everything except what I want him to or wont jump to something he can get to any other time but just randomly decides nope, dont wanna now is just stupid. Dont reinvent the freerunning system if its inferior to the one in previous games. Freerunning had its problems at times in the older games, cant deny that at all but this is like mental breakdown inducing bad.3. Loading times.They hurt. Especially having to be stuck in one after dying because Arno decided to jump in the wrong direction completely to his doom or the combat controls suddenly stop responding has happened at least 4 timesGo play AC Rogue instead, youll have a better time. Trust me.
