Im not sure whether to recommend this or not, but after completing the main story may continue on with the Dead Kings DLC and report on that, but considering how much of a struggle the main story was, I kind of dont want to, Im leaning towards not recommending.Im sure we all know about how disastrous the PC and console launches for this game were. Ubisoft wereambitious with their updated AnvilNext engine which they have since further refined that they ended up going way above the max amount of drawcalls for the DX11 API, leading to major performance issues, and just general lack of polish. Its still not great, but its an improvement. Framerates were not great on my system  the difference between low and ultra excluding antialiasing and Nvidia GameWorks settings, those arethe only graphics options that affect performance in Assassins Creed Unity is virtually nonexistent in terms of performance, so I just ran most of my settings at Ultra except for shadows, AO, and antialiasing. My average hovered around 50 FPS 45 is where I tend to draw the line, however I saw drops into the 30s and even 20s during my playthrough, albeit not very often. The menus often felt laggy and unresponsive as well.Gameplay is very frustrating if you get detected, which for me was fairly often. Stealthing missions was a struggle, and the combat when you get detected is only really manageable if youre handling one or two enemies at a time. Ive heard people tell me the Unity combat is easy, which is absolute ing t. Maybe Im just bad, but come on, how theis this easy?Story is also fairly weak,If you do plan to pick up Unity, get this on sale. I dont regret my purchase, but I would not pay more than 15. Thankfully, it was barely over 10 when I purchased. Assassins Creed Syndicate has a similarly weak story, but at least that has not totally ing frustrating gameplay to back it up.RATING 3/10
