Ive beaten the story as well as all the dlc and i can honestly say that ive spent about half of my game time just enjoying the cityscape. Its freaking goregous at least on the right pc. I will say the gameplay can get rather touchy and sometimes Arno just wont do what i want...but then again arent all assassins kinda y like that? All in all if you actually play the game like an assassin instead of blowing through all the content being high profile all the time and use your gadgets and stealth properly the game can be hell of fun. Paris is astonishing and i would reccomend giving it a try. 8/10
