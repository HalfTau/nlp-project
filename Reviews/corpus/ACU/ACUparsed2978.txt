As a fan of the series, this was my first foray into PC gaming for AC.  Loved the world, the detail was gorgeous and the experience was true to the formula we all know.  Was concerned reading initial reviews, but no issues really for me.  Bugs for me were most evident in multiplayer with missions bugging out as NPCs lost the plot.  Also my first time in multiplayer.. which, while enjoyable, tends to descend into a deranged sprint to objectives a little too quickly.  Would be more fun with known players who are interested in stealth.  The companion app was also useful for reading more of the material and getting more depth.
