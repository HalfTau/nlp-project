2016 win 10, nvdia and intel build. its the first game in 10 years i cannot make work, 1st that isnt pirated.....This game will not work, 3 hours wasted trying debug. Ubisoft sent a noreply mail asking for info...noreplyNo refund since i brought with ACR and it took me 18 hours 2 complete.I didnt want 2 buy bcoz of reviews, but it was on sale. So it cost me 3 a hours 2 play these 2 game.the DL is over 50go, so u can expect 2 have 2 increase ure limit.,
