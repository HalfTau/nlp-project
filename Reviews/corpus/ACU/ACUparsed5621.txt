Been an Assassins Creed fan since AC2, so am familiar with the series.The good.Beautiful cityGood love story between the Assassin Arno and Templar Elise Brings back memories of Altiar and Maria Thorpe.Customization  You can now arm Arno with a series of ranged weapons at the same time.Historical characters  just cannot believe I meet Napoleon in Versailles.Character customization  even greater abilities to customize your assassin now.The bad.Bugs, bugs everywhere.Poor optimizationCertain actions can cause you to literally fall through the map and or crash the game mostly fighting and assinations.Framerate issues in certain areas.AI characters cannot climb up onto roofs like in previous titles. Hint To get away from a fight, just go straight up and they will forget about you.Not entirely sure if this has happened to anyone else, but Ive had problems with desync in the games and had to restart a memory.Trait system  Great idea, lousy execution.Slight edit As someone stated, this game is way preAlpha and should not of been released, but seeing as this is UBI that we are talking about, I guess I should not of expected anything less.
