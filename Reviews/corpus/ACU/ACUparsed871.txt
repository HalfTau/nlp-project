Several hours into this game and I have to vote it down. Being an AC fan since AC1, this game just feels a little off. Often times the guy I am controlling is too dumb compared to the assassins from previous games. He will run to all kinds of weird angles no matter what you press. He will not climb unless the angle and position is accidentally aligned with some unknown objects. It is also very hard to do a wall eject because the game just thinks that you press the wrong button and will assume that what you want is climb jump.
