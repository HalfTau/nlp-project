Despite the initial release issues like the notorious facial animation bugs and other glitches, this is one of those games that ended up being redeemed in the end. The graphics are still gorgeous, and Id say the highlight for me was the coop gameplay, despite how linear it is. I think this game was an experiment to see how coop would go in an Assassins Creed title, and Id say it was fairly successful. I hope Ubisoft takes this idea and continues to do more interesting things with it. I actually liked it more than Syndicate too.All in all, a worthwhile purchase if its on sale.
