Awesome game with great graphics, fun, unique and exciting gameplay, loads of additional activities other than the main storyline and an overall super feel aboout it. This is the best Assassins Creed game ever made.My only issue is that no matter how low the settings the rendering distance is terrible, so if you are up high then there are clear graphical issues. With the massively updated graphics engine, however, it is hard to believe that there were so few errors upon launch and up to the present. I am sure Assassins Creed Victory will sort many of these problems and improve the graphics even further. The Assassins Creed Series is currently the pinicale of gaming graphics.On that note, nevertheless, you SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR GRAPHICS CARD DOESNT HAVE AT LEAST 3GB OF VRAM in my opinion because if you only have 2GB then you will have to play the game at the lowest settings at low to medium frame rates. I have a GTX 9704Gb/3.5fastGB and can play the game with 4x MSAA, ultra high texture quality, high enviroment quality with Bloom, HBAO and Soft Shadows all on at 2560x1080219, at a consistent 40fpsso if you playa at 1080p you should be able to reach 60fps easily with those settings.Enjoy this awesome game if you can
