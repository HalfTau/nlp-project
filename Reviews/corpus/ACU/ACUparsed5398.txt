Ok, i only played 15mins of this game....but the graphics blew me away...ran everything on ultra high...no lagging nothing....i guess u really need titan series card to run this game to the max....gameplay wise so far so good...but wont be touching it till i finish my earlier series of assassin creed sitting in my library...Get this game if you are using intel processor and having a very good graphics card....heard that a lot of people have problem running this using AMD and lagging using normal graphics card.....
