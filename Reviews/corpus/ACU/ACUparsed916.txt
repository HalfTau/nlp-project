There was a time after Black Flag where I simply got bored of the Assassins Creed and no longer cared to play any new release during that time. However, after having had the chance to play Unity I cant help but call my past self a fool.Yeah, the game has its fair share of bugs and the AI is questionable at times but they pale in comparison to the improvements that this game implemented.Freerunning is smoother than ever before youll still get stuck quite often however, letting you climb up and down with ease, you can actually go inside buildings now, whether as an escape route, for a mission, or merely in your search for one of the many chests available for looting. And to top it off, theyre usually populated in one way or another. Speaking of the chests, there are 4 different ones in this, the standard white ones, the patriot red ones, blue uPlay chests and finally the yellow ancestor chests, some of these containing iconic outfits from the previous games in the series.Combat has been vastly improved, gone are the days of merely spamming X to chain kill people, now you actually have to fight and if you cant master parrying then you can and will die... a lot. Customisation is also a thing in this and there is plenty of it, allowing you to mix and match armour sets, decide which of the many melee and ranged weapons are best for you, the colour of your attire etc.The city of Paris itself feels alive in this game, with Red Redemptionlike side stories happening at random that you can partake in for extra gear, a myriad of coop missions to do if you can still find anyone online these days, and the sheer amount of npcs walking around.Overall, Unity is a solid game and fits in well within the AC universe.
