If you got tired of the lag and the bugs associated in the console version and thought you would escape them here on pc, no dice!The game is still riddled with bugs and horrific optimization but I STILL like it. Its beautiful to look at but that might be all. The story is okay but it falls flat and the multiplayer is short lived and a bad idea. You cant get stealth to work all the time jump through windows and door ways all the time and it makes missions frustrating with internet random players.i7 4790k , 1070 gtx, 1866 mhz 16 gb of ram, sandisk ultra ssds,   it runs nicely on my setup all maxed out in 1440p resolution but the game is still hungry for more resources. If you have the rig to run this game I say go for it just to stress test your system. Its at least worth it to admire the well detailed districts of Paris.Not the best Asassins game but they had some good ideas to freshen things up a bit.Not a broken game like everyone cries but if you have a pc built for a pleb, i would pass on this.
