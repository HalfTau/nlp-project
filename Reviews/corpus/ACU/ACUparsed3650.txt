I do reccommend this game, played so far 42 hours and enjoyed most of it. I bought the game about a month or so after it came out, so this review is not based on any of the major glitches, Im sure for people who bought it on release it was a very different experience for them, but this is judging the game in the state it is currently and around when I bought it. In terms of glitches and bugs and lag, most of that has been fixed, for me and my friends at least. I have a GTX 860M graphics card, which is a good but not amazing or great, its just a good gaming graphics card, I play the game on High graphics, w/ some options on Very High, and I run the game at around 4050 fps, at this range I can rarely notice frame stutter and everything works fine. A lot of people have complained about having this not work w/ a GTX 970, prob. before there were issues w/ it but I can say at least for most people I know w/ a 970, it works great. The glitches are minimum now and dont annoy me too much, yes every now and then youll see someone walking through a wall, or dancing w/ someone invisible, but it happens not too often and its very minor. One of the things I find annoyying about the game is the popin, as it is very easy to notice. Here are the more basic Pros and Cons about the gameProsAmazing graphics, even on low or mediumOk story, AC4s was better, but this one is still fineLarge amount of content lots of missions, CoOp or SingleplayerNew additions to the climbing like being able to control descentOpen World CoOp Very fun to explore the world of Revolutionary Paris w/ a friendVery large mapGreat recreation of revolutionary paris, amazing buildingsLots of NPCs give a feeling of realism to the cityNew stealth mechanicsCompedative CoOp called Club Competition is interesting, makes you want to do more CoOp in order to unlock better armor and weaponsThere are goatsConsSome frame stutters here and thereThe stealth, although new, is somewhat brokenPopinGlitchy NPCsFor me and my friends, we had to Port Foward in order to play CoOp together, was hoping for some dedicated serversSo overall I give the game an 8.5/10, because even though parts of the game are broken, I still find that the pros greatly outweigh the cons, and I can see myself easily getting my moneys worth out of this game. People have been hating on Ubisoft a lot recently but they fail to see some of the amazing achievements theyve made, the way they recreate realworld locations is better than any other company, the life they put into cities modern or in history is amazing, whether it is Chicago in Watchdogs or late 1700s Paris in AC Unity. The greatest aspect of their city games are the cities themselves, too many gamers fail to see this.
