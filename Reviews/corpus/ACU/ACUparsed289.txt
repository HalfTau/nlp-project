Worst Assassins Creed i have ever played.Arno is a good character , too bad he is the only one in the game.The time bugs parts were cool and thrilling.The movement seems so clumsy!Combat got so much worse.The missions were so repetitive and boring.The END fight ? WTF was that...Worst story of the all Assassins Creeds.
