It takes a minute to get used to the combat styles, and controls, but the gameplay itself is great. Durring its intial release, the game had a number of bugs just like watch dogs, but they worked them out. I currently have a GTX 970 and i can run everything on max graphics. Combat is hard yes, but i like a  good challenge.
