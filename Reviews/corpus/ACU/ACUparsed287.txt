So, youve read all the articles and reviews about the bad performance? Well, under that layer of stuttering and glitches lies a really great game with fantastic gameplay!The core mechanics in this game are really fun. Combat is challenging, but not unfair. The parkour in this game is really nice. Being able to just climb up and down a buidling without just randomly jumping to your death that was a big problem in the previous games feals really nice.The main story is good enough for me, but it isnt anything special. The sidequests on the other hand are really fun. You get to meet iconic characters and you help them in really unique ways. SPOILER ALERTThe performance of the game is indeed really bad. The game stutters really bad, especially in the heavily crowded areas, and there are few fixes. If you dont have a pretty decent pc, I advice you to just skip this one. Personally I have an I5 6500, a GTX 960 and 16 GB RAM and I get around 40  60 fps at medium settings.TLDR, this game can be really fun if your pc can handle it. If you dont have a beefy pc dont buy it.
