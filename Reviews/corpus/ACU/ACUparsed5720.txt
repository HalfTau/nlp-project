I LOVE IT! The city of Paris is alive, massive, and a ton of fun to explore. The combat is better than any other Assassins Creed game I have played before. The storyline, along with its integrated cutscenes and surrealtype missions, is simply amazing.Those who call this a bad pc port with poor optimization really dont know all that much what they are talking about. By that, I am not saying that their statements regarding bad performance are false, simply that it isnt because of any poor optimization. The world is HUGE and there are things going on EVERYWHERE. To get something at this scale to run at graphics similar to that of smaller scale games e.g. Crysis, you are going to need a very powerful pc.I am playing this on a 780ti at 1440p and have everything set to ultra, aside from high shadow PCSS kills framerate, and FXAA for anti aliasing as even MSAAx2 for some reason seems to cut my fps in half.If you are experiencing performance issues in ACU, please just fiddle around with the graphics settings before giving up on it. Start from the bottom and increase step by step, and look for what affects fps the most on your GPU. For me, texture quality surprisingly enough has less of a performance impact than AA.I really wish the game would perform better, but I understand why it isnt and I am completely fine with it.Also, I strongly recommend playing this on an xbox controller if youre not already doing so. Generally, you notice low framerate through a mouse due to input lag
