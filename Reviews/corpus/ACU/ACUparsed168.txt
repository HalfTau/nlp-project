Having played pretty much all of the Assassins Creed games, I think I can say without the shadow of a doubt, this is by far ome of the best installments in the series. After being bashed on at its release due to the obnoxious amount of graphical bugs / crashes / faulty mechanics / frame rate drops, the game has seen major improvements, to the point where you can play it flawlessly at ultra, 120 FPS with no stutters or graphical glitches whatsoever.The story is engaging, ang the main character, Arno, is in my opinion much more likable than Connor / Haytham / Edward ever were, bringing the sarcasm and irreverence lost since the end of AC Brotherhood with Ezio Auditores character.After some UPlay connection issues to be honest, the biggest gripe with the game at this point is the UPlay DRM, I was able to run some Multiplayer and Coop runs with my brother, and we were both blown away by how much content there is to be done in the free roam mode, as well as the complexity of the mechanics and level design shown in the coop missions its not a complete coop campaign, but its well worth the money if you want to have a good time with a friend or relative.Also tried the Companion app that syncs with your game to give another depth to the map, and the content in both single and coop. Not my cup of tea, but worth giving a try if youre into those kind of things.All in all, a pleasant surprise to have a game that received such flak, be redeemed through updates that improved the experience, even if all of that effort seems to end up being shadowed by its former errors.A game worth your money, and a solid 9/10, not 10/10 due to the obnoxious UPlay connectivity issues.
