hey i found out that this game is perfect made. last time i was stuck on DLC. then i untick the DLC and i restart from the begining. After that i continue on my campaign. more day more cool. i didnt know why everyone is saying not recommended. but i think this is the best Assassins Creed games. ive tried Assassins Creed Syndicate, it is more like arcfade.so UNITY is the best. im looking forward to play the flashback of unity where ARNO is still young. after his father died. im really curious when his father died and how he lived with GRAND MASTER. thanks UBISOFT
