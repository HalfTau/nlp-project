Bought this more recently so i never went through the bad release ive heard about but i was still nervous. It actually runs fine for me at least. Ive had no problems and ive enjoyed it alot and now consider it one of my favorite games. The design is beautiful and it is very immersive. The controls were awkward for me at first but i got used to them. combat is still a little funky to me cuz i have to pay more attention than I used to but overall great.
