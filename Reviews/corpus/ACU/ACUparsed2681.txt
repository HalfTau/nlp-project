I really wanted to like this game, as I every every Assassins Creed game before it, but...... There is no forgiving the CONSTANT crashing. My comp can handle Black Flag with 60fps on moderate settings, but then Unity on the lowest possible setting I run maybe 5 frames and crashed over a dozen times just trying to complete the first introductory mission. There should honestly be refunds for this game, or at the very least a complete graphic overhaul and rerelease, free to those who have already bought the game, to make the game actually playable. I am highly disapointed by this trash.
