once the game is updated and you have all the right system requirements the game is alot of fun with the new parkour system that they have. the story is a little bland but still follows well with the other games in the series following on with the sages from AC 4. the costumization is great in how different peices of clothing give different stats to your character. the coop mode is good as well as the missions that are with it. all in all great gamplay machanics but not the best story line of the assassins creed universe.
