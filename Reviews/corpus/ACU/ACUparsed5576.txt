I should have listened to the other reviews, but decided to try my luck.i74700MQ8GB RamNvidia GTX 770MThe game is unplayable.I played for about 25 seconds on low and then decided it was unplayable. It was probably foolish to buy this for a laptop based on the other reviews, but Im amazed that I cant even run the game on low at 1920x1080... I just finished Mordor on high playing at 2560x1440. No trouble with Watchdogs, Call of Duty etc. This is by far the worst performing game by far in my large steam library and is the first time Ive ever considered looking into whether or not steam has a refund policy.You shouldnt need a 1500 desktop to play this game on medium. Personally Im surprised that Ubisoft released the game as is and hope that this isnt an indication of whats to come as the new generation of console games are ported to PC.
