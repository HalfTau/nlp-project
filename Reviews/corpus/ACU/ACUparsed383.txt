If you like the AC series then you will like this game.Story is kind of cheesy. Not my favorite in the series.I can not relate to Arno the same way that I could relate to Ezio, Altiar and Ratonhaketon.Combat is the most difficult in the series.Freerunning is competent.Late 18th century France is EXTREMELY Harsh, Ruthless, Unforgiving, Chaotic and Barbaric. Fair Warning.ConsEnglish accents in France??????? ?Robert de Sable and the break his legs guy from the original AC had french accents and they sounded perfectly fine.Past games used accents which made the characters feel more connected to the setting.Very annoying that they did not incorporate french accents!The protesters/crowds speak in french only no subtitles.I can tell that they are angry by the tone of their voices, but I do not know WTF is going on or why they are angry?Should have just used french accents!Overal I recommend this game.
