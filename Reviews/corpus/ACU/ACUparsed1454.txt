Unfortunately, a disappointment. The Optimization is horrible, I cant even get a stable 60FPS on the lowest settings, max. a FPS of 40 is achieved. The story may be somewhat interesting, I havent gotten far enough to rate this aspect, but the Concept of it taking place in the French Revolution is pretty neat. Gameplay is actually not that bad, climbing is a bit too fast and unpredictable Especially with low FPS. The side missions are the usual as in almost every AC game, so not that bad. Collectibles are everywhere and itd take a lot of time to collect them all. Usually I have fun with collecting these in other AC Games but with only 3540 FPS its not that enjoyable. The Idea of the CoopAspect is great. Free roaming around a huge city with your friends is a lot of fun. Although it has quite some Issues like Lags for example, the Coop was the best experience I had with this game. Microtransactions. No thanks.As much as I like the AC Series, I cant recommend this one. Id suggest buying maybe AC Black Flag. Its cheaper, still looks good, runs better and has almost every aspect you need in a AC Game done right.
