Assassins Creed Unity really is a testament to how different your experience can be compared to others! I held off on buying this game for so long because of all of the terrible things people said about it, even on other sites. SO MANY TIMES I saw that this game was the worst in the series, or, an embarrassment to the Assassins Creed franchise. But now that Ive played it, I regret not getting it sooner.Ive played most of the games in the series, and I can honestly say it is probably my favorite. Not only does it keep all of the familiar game mechanics that are seen in the other games, but it also adds a RPG feel to it, where theres a VAST amount of customization, AND, it adds an indepth storyline with a movielike plot and humorous, likeable characters.I couldnt say where the criticism is targeted! So far I havent had one complaint, and I doubt I will in the future
