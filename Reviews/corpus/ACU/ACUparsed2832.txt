Never had trouble with Ubisoft games before, but this one makes me question whether Ill buy another one again. I even waited patiently with patch after patch but it still runs awfull. It is really a shame because if this was optimized for PC even a little bit it would be a great game. Running this in SLI or Crossfire equvilant makes the game stutter horribly.
