After Ive played the game for some hours, I can say that the game is smooth af after the update, so I can totally recommend this game. I love the fact that you can do so many things in this game  as in every ac game  but ... The fighting mechanics are a lot better than the last ac games. It cant really compete with ac syndicate  just because of the DLCs , but if youre just for the game, for 30 it is totally worth it
