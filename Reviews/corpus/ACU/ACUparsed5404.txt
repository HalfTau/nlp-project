Assassins Creed Unity is breath takingRecently I have seen a lot of negative reviews and I highly understand the amount of trouble people are facing. As from my own game, I have not encountered one performance issue what so ever. Maybe slight ones but thats only been once or twice during intense parts. The game is visually amazing and the gameplay is so good it brings back good memories of the old Assasssins Creed. The new parkour system is flawless and it just makes you want to play for days. I know this might not be the same for everyone, as I have seen a lot of glitches and the performance problems but for me I am running this game smoothly and the visuals are just so perfect.I would deffinitely recommend, but just be warned of performance problems. I myself havent enocoutered it so badly that it has made me want to unstall it.
