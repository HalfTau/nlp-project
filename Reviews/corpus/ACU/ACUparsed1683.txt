Now i know i might get alot of hate for saying this, but i really liked this game. It was alot of fun and had some great missions. I think it really doesnt deserve as much hate as it is receiving. But I might just be saying this because the assassins creed franchise has been one of my all time favorites. I remember putting in many hours into the first game. But when the second one came out, thats when i got really into these games. So if you love assassins creed as much as i do then, you will probably like this game too.
