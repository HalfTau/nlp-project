I would like to say thank you to Ubisoft. For all the ideas and concepts they realized. The requirements are merciless, no doubt. But they surely did fantastic work. They chose the wrong time, maybe I really dunno which public they aimed for as  only few percent of people now own a 4.0 Ghz processor.They have created a fascinating, truly stunning world. There are changes in gameplay, which I really loved the investment in Stealth mechanic was just what I desired. The missions are nicely developed, smoothly teaching  player the typical assassins creed machanics and giving freedom to try different ways and solutions which was mentioned several times in the game reviews and certainly is a big plus.Any gamer, who never tried stealth or a novice, who never played anything before can start with this game and dont be afraid to get puzzled yes, to my mind it is very important. You can recommend it to anyone, who you think can be interested and has a modern PC.10/10
