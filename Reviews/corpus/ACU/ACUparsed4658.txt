Despite the occasional bug and frame drop I recieve this game is fantastic! Every issue I have had with past game mechanics have been improved upon or changed for the better. With the addition of the parkour down botton and a much more in depth stealth system the game comes with a lot more challenge and new tactics to do missions. The new combat system is much better than the old games and gives real consequences for being spotted as there no longer is a counter to win move and you have to be on your toes when fighting those higher level enemies. There is a new freedom in the mission types and the entire game feels less restrictive and lets me take things at my own pace instead of being forced to follow the exact path the game wants me to take when approaching a target. I love this game so far and when the new patches are released Im sure it will be just that much better.
