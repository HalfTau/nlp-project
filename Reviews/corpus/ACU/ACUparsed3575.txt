okay, yes, it had a terrible launch. okay, fine, it took a couple painful months for the patches to roll in. but do you see any other games with its innovation and setting? neither do i. Unity is a vibrant, massive, engaging open world game that is as fun singleplayer as it is running with 3 friends. wether you are just running around slicing up some guards or planning every move in a 20 step heist to get the top score, this game is fun. the armor and weapon selection is crazily in depth, almost like Dark Souls or an MMO. the differences in fighting styles lets you customize how you want to play. i personally favor the spears, sporting a very nice polish blade with a name i cant spell or pronounce. the coloring options, along with the armor, create a personalized experience that really makes you feel connected to your character. upgrading your armor and weapons feels almost like Borderlands, checking stats and trying out a new weapon before you commit to it. the story im about 3/4s through is engaging and well voiced and paced. buggy launch and patch issues which are fixed aside, i give this game a 8.5/10. its no Skyrim or Super Smash Bros 64, but its way up there. one of the better games ive played in a while.
