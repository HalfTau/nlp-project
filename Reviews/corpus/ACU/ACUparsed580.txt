Dont buy this game. If it crashes while you are in one of the bridge sequences between main missions all of the main mission markers will dissapear and you will not be able to finish the game.I contacted Ubisoft support and they basically just told me they dont have a fix and wont tell me if or when they will. They keep closing my support ticket every 4 days unless I add a comment. As far as I can tell there is no fix for this problem.
