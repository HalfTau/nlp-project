A day after release, having had some decent time with it, I can say that ACU is every bit what most were saying it was going to be unoptimized, buggy, yet a logical progression in the Assassins Creed line. The parkour system is absurdly more intuitive than it has been before about 96 of the time, but thats pretty decent considering the mechanics. The story is compelling, Arno has some decent quips that elicit a chuckle. The progression of Absertgo pushing forth to the public is at least realized from Black Flag, and the overarcing story is at least coherent.The games biggest flaws come in the highly unfinished state the publisher released it in. Kudos aside, the publisher released a buggy piece of software that has inherent flaws. I was able to run it, albeit on low settings with a mixture of medium and high settings. Granted, I have an older Radeon HD7850 and an AMD cpu running at 4 gigz at overclock to boot!. There are FPS drops, and commonly freezing. I fall through the world, resulting in desynchronization and having to restart memories. I get stuck in gargoyles, railings, and even the floor at times. The cloth and hair sim bugs and starts fidgeting, and overall the phsyics like to go wonky.Now for the pros and consPros New and improved Parkour system Customizable outfit Interesting and acceptable voice acting Stunning rendition of late 18th century FranceCons Horrid framerate issues Steep performance/qaulity ratios Buggy phsyics Unfinished feel Lack of crowd variability Lack of enemy types Immersion breaksOverall, not recommendable in this state. Maybe after bugfixes, mods, and patches this game can be recommended. Yet as of this writing, the game is definitely not worth the sixty bucks.Besides all of this, and bugs aside, its the perfect Assassins Creed game. Its what the franchise aspired, and has gotten. Yet its probably far too late for the perfect Creed game, considering how many titles the series has pushed out.
