despite the really bad optimization... ubisoft today surprised me with a XAudio27.dll file fix.now I dont have to rename this file in windows system 32 folder to play this game!!!cool!!great game to explore paris from 1700s... beautiful!!!the gameplay in black flag is so much better!!!!! hey!!! maybe black flag and blood dragoon dont crash anymore!!!but the parkour in unity is so fluid... thumbs up!!!7/10
