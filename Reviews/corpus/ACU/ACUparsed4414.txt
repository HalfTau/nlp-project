It hurts me to leave an unpleasant review since I am a fan and own everything PC has to offer.ButWell, to begin with advantages graphics... I didnt dare run it on the best quality, since I run the game on the laptop, but still the game looks more beautiful than Revelations in its best. It sometimes lags... But I could manage it.Music is rather good, especially the female composer.Now to all that makes up this review.I recommend it only to some hardcore musthave fans. Other people would get biased opinion af AC universe after playing Unity.
