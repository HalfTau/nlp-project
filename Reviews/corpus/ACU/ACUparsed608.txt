30 minutes into it and already feel like its a refund case.The story can we call it that way? goes two side, no attachement to the characters.Controls are buggy, so worst than AC1 were you had sometimes problems with directions  like oops didnt meant to do this and the graphics are very basic.I could have played longer just to add up more and more cons for this game.
