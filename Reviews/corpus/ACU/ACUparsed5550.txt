I played out the first chapter with the default settings and it run smoothly without problems. My pc specs are close to the minimum i7 960 3.2Ghz, Nvidia GTX 580 graphics card and 24GB ram. Only issue I had, is that I lost sync with Uplay store, but I guess that is normal for first day. I didnt encounter any bugs or glitches and my guess is if there are some ahead ingame they will patch it up asap.
