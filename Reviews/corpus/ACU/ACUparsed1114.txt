The original release was full of bugs. Bad move, Ubisoft.But now.... There are very few bugs!!! No more than in any other game.I really like this game.Arno is ok. The story is ok. Blahblahblah.PARIS IS AMAZING. Its the best city in any AC game, in my opinion. It is just the right size and spectacularly beautiful. Much better than Syndicates London. The only AC game world that can rival it is Black Flag. There are so many little details and amazing additions. I could go on and on... but you should just buy the game and see for yourself.The main story missions arent bad. In fact, theyre pretty good. The Paris stories are fun, interesting and varied. The detective mysteries are fun but the notifications show up over the clue info AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.But to me, the real reason to play this game is Paris. Its perfect.Note Oh, and lockpicking is fun too, in my opinion. Also, customization is great. I found myself dressing up Arno in a different crazy color scheme in every play session. There are many weapons, but I stuck with my swords.If this games on sale, you should certainly buy it. If not, maybe wait until it is. But if youre a fan of AC games, even if youve already played Syndicate, what are you waiting for?
