This game is amazing compared to the other Assassins Creed. Only thing negative I can say is that IT IiiNG CRASHES AND GLITCHES LIKE HELL! CANT IiiNG DOWHEN I GLITCH INTO SOME CHICKS ASSSHOLE! JESUS SOMEONE FIX THIS SHIIIT! Other than that quite enjoyable...WITHOUT ALL THE IIiiNG CRASHES AND GLITCHING
