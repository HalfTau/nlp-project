There seems to be a lot of criticism surrounding this game, and most of it is for good reason. Ubisoft has yet again released a fairly poor PC port packed with bugs and glitches as far as the eye can see. Though after a few hours of tweaking setting I finally ended up with a playable version. Thats not so say it wasnt without its bugs, but it is a version of the game that I can recommend. Before I go on, I will mention that this game does in fact have micro transactions. Which is greedy and unfortunate, but they arent required and used as an optional way to unlock things without playing the game.The art direction is enough to sell this game, its beautiful and the most realistic open world I have ever seen in a game. People fill up your screen as far as the eye can see which is impressive in itself, but it also adds the mechanic that we saw in the first AC trailer where Altair is picking off people in the crowd. Looks isnt all this one brings to the table though, this game is one of the most innovative ACs in terms of gameplay. This time around you arent given so many tools, but youre able to specialize in a weapon of your choice. Swinging a rifle around like a bo staff is something I dont think Ive seen in a game, and its pretty ing awesome. Aside from combat though, the free running system has been tweaked with two buttons, one to go up and down, this is such a small change but it gives you so much more freedom.All and all, technical issues aside, this game is well worth the price of admission for any AC fan in my personal opinion.Edit I suppose I should note that Im running a 690MultiGPU with one half dedicated to physx. Thats what I had to do to stop the stuttering. Textures are set to high, and AA is set to FXAA, everything else is set to very high and it runs at a fairly consistant framerate.
