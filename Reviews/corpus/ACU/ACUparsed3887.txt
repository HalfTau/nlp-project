First off, if you are looking for an Assassins Creed game with improved freerunning mechanics and a dynamic combat system, then ACU is for you.I get where the bad reviews are coming from  cut scenes are buggy, the game is broken, yadda yadda. But putting the issues aside, Unity is still a decent game. It will never measure up to Brotherhood or Black Flag, but its at least better than Revelations and AC3.The whole challenge system for 100 Synchro has also been revamped, these are now easier to complete, and every time you screw up just reload a checkpoint. Did I mention you can also visit shops midmission to restock on ammo? The only thing I found annoying was making money. Upgrading your Cafe doesnt provide much of an income, so you are forced to go looking for chests.All in all, good game to spend time playing these holidays. If all else fails, use the Season Pass Ubisoft Deal to claim a free game like The Crew
