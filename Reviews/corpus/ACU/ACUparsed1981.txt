Short VersionPros Beautiful game. Better looking than Syndicate despite being newer than Unity. Runs good as of this review. Patch 1.5.0 i believe. MSI 980Ti SeahawkCons Stealth doesnt work most of the time. Combat is annoying. Hidden blade is barely used or usable. Everyone has a gun. Enemies shoot too much and theres nothing you can really do to dodge/protect yourself form the bullet except roll like an idiot. Many of the little things that made previous games so amazing are gone like dual hidden blades, dual assassinations from approaching from the sides of the enemy, putting your hood up in restricted areas etc. did i mention extremely USELESS stealth. Hyper senstitive enemies. Will be notified by anything you do.
