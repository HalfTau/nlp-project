this game is bad there is low frame rate a new crappy combat system the equipment menus feel like its a free to play game with MICROTRANSACTIONS BOOM mic drop the way you are told to do a leap of faith is stupid i spent the better part of 20 mins trying the way you are told the online gameplay is boring the only good thing is the graphics so it is a 210
