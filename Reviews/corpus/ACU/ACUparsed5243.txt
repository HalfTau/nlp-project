I seem to be the minority here but Im running this game fine. Ive had no issues at all, no crashes no spikes in frame rate. Really weird. Reading the steam reviews say the same thing a small portion of users have a function install, with a majority of users having an unplayable experience. Ill be honest, Im enjoying the game, especially the coop mode. The graphics are stunning and combat is solid. But for people whose port isnt working its understandable that theyre unsatisfied. I guess ubisoft really needs to work on getting theirtogether, because underneath all the performance issues and technical problems is a well put together game with beautiful graphics, an ok story and solid gameplay. sigh another game wasted.Im recommending this game because I feel obligated to let people know that the game is competent and engaging if you can get it working.7.5/10.Pros beautiful graphics solid gameplay coop modeBorders storyCons potential performance issues uplay
