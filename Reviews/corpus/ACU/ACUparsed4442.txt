play our companion app to open this chestSeriously. Ubisoft. Stop this now.The game has many great things about it, but chests that require one to play their stupid companion app and their constant nagging for us to buy Helix credits to unlock other weapons and cosmetics are the reasons why I cannont recommend this game to others.
