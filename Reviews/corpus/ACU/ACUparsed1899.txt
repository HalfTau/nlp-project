Assasinss creed unity is a highly underrated game in the franchise I believe. Due to its horrific launch, it was very poorly received by the community. Now that the game has all its bugs fixed, it is a pretty decent game. A big part of this game for me was the fact that u could roam in the open world and do missions with friends. This game really does coop right. Sadly, there are almost no ppl playing coop bc of the games bad reviews. So if you want to enjoy the game to its full experince try and get some friends along with you.
