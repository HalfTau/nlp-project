DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR PC.Gameplay was wonderful for the short time I was able to play.  Unfortunately due the immense amount of bugs and slow reaction time of the developer/publisher, I would say this not a wise purchase.  Understanding that all games will have their bugs and problems, the sheer amount of absolutely GAME BREAKING issues for the PC version shows that this is an irregularly reckless and rushed distribution.  Game was not ready for release to PC.  Shame on the publishing reviewers for giving the PC version such high praise despite such game breaking faults.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR PC.
