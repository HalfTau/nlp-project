This game isnt worth 5 dollars, which is around the price I paid for it. Ive try every now and then to play thissince it stole my money. My friends and I bought it thinking we could play a ton of multiplayer and  around and what not...nope...theres literally 4 multiplayer raids and 4 other missions, you can finish all of them in 2 hours at most. Which is the perfect amount of time for you to NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A REFUND. Dont buy this game it is so ing bland and boring, the story is horrible and focuses on wrong part of the history.
