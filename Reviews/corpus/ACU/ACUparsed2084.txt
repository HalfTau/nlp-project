I dont know if Ubisoft has something against the French LouisJoseph Gaultier, but Arno is without a doubt the slowest, clumsiest, scatterbrained assassin to ever be called one.The controls are atrocious unresponsive, inaccurate, and often results in a completely different action than you plan.For example, from a stand still, aiming at a haystack actually ended up with me jumping flat out into the middle of a room full of enemies, alerting everyone and taking fall damage.This game has several good ideas that could refresh the franchise.Too bad you cant play any of them without becoming incredibly irate at how clumsy Arno feels.
