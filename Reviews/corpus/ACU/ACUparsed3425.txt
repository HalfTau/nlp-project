Dont let my time played deceive you. Ive spent more hours than I can count in this game on my Xbone. I decided to grab it on PC and see how it would run with me since I have pretty much every other AC Release in my steam library.I dont think me talking about bugs here will add anything else that has not be said ad nauseium by all the other reviews, and dont get me wrong ITS ALL WARRANTED. The fact that this game was released in the state that it was when it was released, along with the fact that this is 100 SUPPOSED TO BE A AAA TITLE!What I will say that my experience has been better than most on the PC. Short rundown of my rigGTX 780 Ti16GB RAMi74930kWindows 8.1 Pro30fps smoothly about 80 of the time with the normal drops to mid to low 20s in decent size crowds.Is it poorly optomized? Oh hell yes, anyone can see that. Ive had a much better experience than a lot of people with comparable rigs and I think it boils down to CPU almost more than GPU. Ive got 6 cores. Most people are working with quad core processors, and they are great and more than enough for pretty much anything, except Unity. This game is a CPU HOG!Technical issues aside, I like this game hence why I bought it to have another go here on PC.I implore as they keep patching and when the price drops pick it up. Paris is stunningly beautiful and Arno is a great addition to the franchise as I found his character and the whole story interesting. The changes to combat  were welcome, the microtransactions were not and the requirement to play Coop and club competitions to get every piece of gear. For collectors thats just a giant pain in theAll things considered I DO recommend this game now, Patch 4 finally made it playable for most everyone.I sincerly hope that there are enough people left that actually care to come back and give it another try, or pick it up for the first time.We can only hope that they do not botch Victorys release like they did Unity, or this series will effectively be killed.7/10
