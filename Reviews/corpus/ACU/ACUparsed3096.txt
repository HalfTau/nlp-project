Avoid buying this game. Very high possibility of getting blocker bugs even after 5 patches have been released.Ubisoft is probably hiring 1st year student to do programming jobs.In my case the game just wont save progress, it does not create any save game files or profile folders.Cloud save by UBI isnt working for a year already and they cant fix it. And even when the Clould save is disabled, the game wont save any progress at all.Ubi support is useless, they cant help you, only ask to reinstall everything on your PC, send them your dxdiag files and uninstall everything that is not UBIrelated. Which does not help anyway.
