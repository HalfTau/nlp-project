My system recommends very high for this game and i had to play on low with 2030 fps just to get through the few hours I could put in the game. Not to mention the terrible camera that is always delayed when following your character and is too low for you to counter attacks that come from behind you. And to top it all off the coop is empty so there goes one of the best ways to get skill points. It would be fun if anything worked about but its just too broken even with me getting it for a sale price. Going to play Rogue instead.
