Assassins Creed Unity was the worst game i bought in 2014 it feels like your playing Assassins creed 2 but with micro transactons and rediculis Perks you get from leveling up that in previous game you had throughout the hole game. it is one of the moast hardwhere intencive game i have and i have a 1000 computer that can berly run it on low settings. The only thing that i think was good about this game was the costimizaton. unless ubisoft makes an assasins creed with ninjas i will never buy an assasins creed ever again.
