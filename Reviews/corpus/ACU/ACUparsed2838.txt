7 Months after release and the developers still have not corrected basic errors in the coding allowing many people including myself to even run the game, this is the worst experience of customer service I have ever had. The best part is, since I bought the game through steam I do not qualify for a refund from Ubisoft. Yes my PC meets the required specs, it actually exceeds the recommended specs in every category. To sum it up, I dont know if this game is any good or not since I never have been and probably never will be able to play it due to the developer not supporting the PC port. Comcast customer service is better than Ubisofts right now. If that statements does not convince you then you might be missing portions of your brain.
