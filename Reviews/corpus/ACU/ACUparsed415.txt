First, Im not a fan of rapier swords, flintlock pistols, powdered wigs, buckled shoes, frilly shirts, pointy hoods or wrist daggers.Regardless, this games is an absolute masterpiece. If you like Assassins Creed at all and havent played this, you need to play it. It has the most polished, populated, living vibrant open world Ive ever seen in a video game. If you have to fight through the standard janky AC controls, this is the one to do it in.Also the coop.Also its hard.
