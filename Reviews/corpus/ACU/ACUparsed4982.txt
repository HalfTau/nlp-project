There are many terrible reviews kicking around, most of them having to do with graphic issues.When I first bought ACU my PC was running specs somewhere inbetween the required and recommended ones.The game was unplayable due to being choppy/laggy and glitchy, even on the lowest possible settings.After installing a new graphics card GTX970 and more ram the game now runs perfectly. No more issues at all.I think the biggest issue may have been Ubisoft understating the PC requirements to run the game well.Unfortunately requiring a 600ish graphics card seems a little excessive, there should probably more abiblity to run on lower settings to better allow people with average PCs to run the game.With a good card 7/10Without... Unplayable
