So far all I am seeing is a bunch of whiny entitled brats. Yes, the game has some performance issues but if you have a computer that has been built within the last decade then you can play the game.The gameplay is fun. The controls work great. The story thus far is great! There does seem to be a memory leak present in the game that causes the occaisional crash and the framerate will slow when there is a lot going on but thats all stuff that can be corrected.The graphics are amazing! Even with them turned down to improve performance!You CAN play this game with a 560Ti at the very least. My wife has been doing so. I run a 770 and have enjoyed every minute of this game so far!
