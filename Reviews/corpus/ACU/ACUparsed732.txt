I really dont get all the hate this game gets. Sure they messed it up on release but they patched it up quickly. It is the most beautiful Assassins Creed ever created, even Syndicate looks pale in comparison to this. Paris looks lively and lovely. The combat is pretty challenging and you cant win against stronger enemies by button mashing. Stealth is also improved and you now actually have to take stealth into consideration because youll get slammed in combat even if you have OP gear. But the main storyline is pretty bland, everything feels pretty rushed, and character development was poor. But the Dead Kings DLC made up for it. Just because it was broken upon release people lost theirand everybody boarded the hate train even after they fixed a lot of bugs. Overall its a decent game in terms of storyline but a killer in every other aspects. Recommended.
