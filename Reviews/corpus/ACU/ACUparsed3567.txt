TLDR I would recommend buying this game ONLY if you meet the minimum Requirements. This game is very enjoyable even on low settings with beautiful scenery.Anyone who says there are technical bugs, are really just butt hurt they cant play it above medium settings. I bought this game with an I3 and an AMD 7770, It ran at at least 18  20 fps and I constantly had bugs .. Then patch 4 came out! And I saw an increase in 2 fps. So they obviously did something. I ran it on low settings, and beat the campaign. Not very thrilled that I went from black flag high settings to low settings on Unity, but it didnt bother me....But then I upgraded and holy crap. I replayed this game just for the simple fact that I upgraded. I am now running an i5 overclocked at 3.4 and a GTX 770. The difference it made was phenomenal. I can now run this game at medium settings straight with 4550 fps in streets and 60 fps no problem on the roofs. On top of this, now amazing looking game, the story line was very solid. It honestly reminded me a lot of Assassins Creed 2 so I hope for a sequel with Arno.I believe this game has made advances with the mechanics, I love the way you can now control the way Arno free runs. This really drove me nuts in other games that I could control the decent. I just had to manually jump and kind of hope for the best..Well, to make a long review short Im going to keep it simple and end it here. 4/10 before patches and upgrade 9/10 after. Yes, I will agree this game is very demanding and really has no reason to be, I would counter argue with the fact that this game is massive. A 1 to 1 scale has never been done in a game before and this one captures it perfectly. Flying from roof to roof with my assassins buddies couldnt get anymore fun. I would recommend buying this game ONLY if you meet the minimum Requirements. This game is very enjoyable even on low settings with beautiful scenery.
