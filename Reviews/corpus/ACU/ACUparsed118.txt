Everyone talkedabout this game, so my expectations were pretty low. But I was pleasantly surprised, when I finaly got to play it. It has interesting story, good graphics, awesome new parkour animations and SIDE MISSIONS WITH STORY this time. I also like those really crowded crowds if it makes sense. I also experienced more bugs in AC Origins, than in this game so far. Only real problem you will possibly encounter is optimisation, if you dont own a really good PC. If youre an AC fan, give it a shot.
