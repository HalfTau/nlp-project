What a disappointment.After all those years this game is still buggy.Missing textures, random deaths.Story aint that good either. If AC3 was bad ... this is a new low.I was expecting so much from Assassins vs Templars storylines. What a disappointment again.And if you are expecting at least a small scene that would mirror a thing or two from trailers.HERES A BIG NOPE TO YOU.EDIT I will still 100 it  DLC
