Good game, played it for a while now. If you like the old Assassins Creed games, you will like this one aswell.I would like to give this game a 9 out of 10, if the controls for keyboard was better I would have given them the last point I now have a XBOXcontrol I play the game with.Had some problems running the game in the beginning, that was totaly my own fault for not updating my Nvidia drivers.
