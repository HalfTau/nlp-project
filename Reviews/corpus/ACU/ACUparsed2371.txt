Every aspect of this game is horrible but the freerunning, which is too easy. combat is an unresponsive piece of junk. the stealth is bugged to the point where an entire building will attack you when you fart in the wrong direction. the characters and story are a boring mess, most missions are generic, repetitive and unrewarding. the item and skill system is incomprehensive and worthless. Besides that the developers thought it was a good idea to make everything more expensive encouriging microtransaction in a bloody full priced game. The combat is bad to the point where if you engage 5 or more enemies you will die unless you use 5 medicine wich costs 5 times what you earn by killing 40 more.I do not recommend this game to anyone who isnt intentionally playing broken games or really wants to know everything about AC.A literal copy paste of black flag divided by 2 is a better game than this monstrosity.
