Well, this game has been a bit of a pitty.i really dont know if i should recummend it or not, but i think i will, and the reason for this isthe game overall works fine at my pc. i can play at very high with max ressolution, and it is only lagging in cut scenes which i can hear is a problem for a lot of playersprosit is a new assassins creed. it is a fun game, you can assassinate, free climb and slaughter every guard you want.the game seems fine to me, no bugs, and i think it is overall a fine game.For anfan, who wouldnt play Black flag again, this can comprehent the need of a new slaughter assassination game.consthe free running and climbing seems very nice, and the way he mooves seems nice, but sometimes he makes some wierd jump or it can be hard to land the place you want, because it keeps jumping from one wrong place  to  an other.the overall cons of this game is actually not the game in my opinion, but why ruin the game with all the lame online content!if you want the best weapon or upgrade your weapons, you have to use real money, and if you want most of the chests, you need to play a online game, i dont want to know what is.i think this is the biggest mistake ever made. i payed 80 for the game with season pass, and then they want to earn more, by selling me in game weapons. FOR A GAME I PAYED 80 FOR!This is one of the most expensive games, and it is made as a singleplayer game. why the F only give us  the weapons for 80!furthermore, you have to play online to get some abilities, which is lame for a singleplayergame.note to unisoft never force singleplayer content to use multiplayer content.the game is not as good as black flag, if you look at the gameplay not at all, and it gets even worse with the greed they have, due to the real money you can spent in the game.overall i would say the game is 56/10, due to the ok gameplay.I recomend this game to big ACC fans, who really want to play it, but if you havent played black flag, buy it instead.
