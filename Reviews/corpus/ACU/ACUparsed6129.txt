So far I will say that i enjoy the storyline much more than AC3 and AC4 in that I can find myself actually relating to the character. Arno actually has a personality unlike Conner and I find himself reminding me of young ezio from AC2. I bought this game simply because of my love for the series, well at least the AC2 line, AC4 and AC3 looked nice, but simply didnt live up to the former games in my opinion. If you are indeed looking to purchase this game i highly recommend that you make sure your rig can run it.I have an nvidia 880m, and it does infact run okay. With details and textures on ultra at 1080p i find myself hovering around the 30 fps range on average with occasional drops to around 22.So im recieving the cinematic experiance i guess /S  Oddly enough these drops have happened the most for me during cut scenes which i find quite odd. I have two monitors hooked up to this laptop and as i played i had gpuz up on one. The game managed to fill over 4gb of vram at points which is the most i have ever seen fill. Im attaching a youtube video of me horribly playing through a mission. This mission had the most fps drops ive had so far so it works well to show what others with an 880m can expect. The youtube video also has the rest of my computers specs for those interested.After playing the game for a while there is one thing that definitely popped out. The game, at least so far, appears horrible at choosing when to render buildings/far away objects in more detail. The worst example i have seen so far is the screenshot i took below.The above is just bad, especially for a game with such demanding requirements and i hope they release a patch that either improves the loading of textures at a distance or lets you adjust when they load.The only other issue i discovered was the already known town folk warping in and out. When close up i also noticed that their textures loading were a bit wonky as well.
