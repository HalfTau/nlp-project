I was hesitant about buying this since there were so many negative reviews claiming it was unplayable and buggy beyond belief but I had heard the same about the other AC games and never experienced a game breaking bug so I bought this one. Im not sure if it was the low expectations or if its a great game or a combination of the two but I am having a blast with it. Tight controls, gorgeous environments, fresh new gameplay for the series. It all really works. I have had one or two bugs that interfered with my gameplay but they were both just funny and didnt bother me. Im starting to believe that many people are actively searching for things to complain about with this game. Honestly, if youre considering this game, ignore the reviews and go watch someones Lets Play of it. That way you can see how often the bugs pop up and youre not just watching a montage of nitpicking bugs. I have noticed that some people have had serious game breaking bugs while playing so I dont think their complaints arent warranted but dont form your opinion of it based on what some random person said.
