As Black Flag will remain among games like Mass Effect on my makeshift makebelief shelf of most trusted games that wont let you down. I decided to give you the thumbs up if your worrying about a purchase.It looks brilliant on my Ps4, and just as good if not better here on STEAM, but will require a beast to run it. Im 15 through on PC, got 28 on PC so I guess this is just a reccomendation not a review.Well paced and placed in well crafted locales around Paris, this is a comletely new take on the series. Adding a whole chunk of style to the series. Play them in order. From first to last. Fromto good. From mess to bless. If you want to jump on the bandwagon, take Asassins 1 for a test drive. And then jump into Black Flag, it will help you understand the mechanics and where Ubisoft went wrong. Point taken, they didnt go wrong here. But theres always next month to hope for, as Syndacit will get through.If youre still reading this and you made it this far, you passed the Willy Wonka application form. Youre now a certified Oompa Loompa and can take my opinion and fly with it or not, but if youre a legitamate gamer and not a social thug of media arts youll love this game.Get Assassins Black Flag if you find this to be a let down at first. Or if you played at least one, wait for Syndacite, who knows what that will turn into.1. Mass Effect2. Black Flag
