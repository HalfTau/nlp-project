Ive given Ubisoft every benefit of every doubt I could muster to brush off bugs in Assassins Creed games in the past but this one is absolutely inexcusable. It wasnt playable on release and now that Im actually able to play it mostly its so god damned disappointing I could cry.Im currently writing this review waiting as I mistakenly tried to open a gold chest asssuming goldbetter and ended up staring at Please wait... with no foreseeable end to the spinning icon. To make it better, theres no way to escape out or cancel the selection so I know Ill have to forcibly end the program. I doubt Ill restart it. This isnt the first bug and I know it wont be the last.Im never buying another Assassins Creed game. The franchise is dead.
