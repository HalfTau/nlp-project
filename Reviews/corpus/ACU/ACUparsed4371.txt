I must have been one of the lucky ones  tried to play on a GTX580 when the game came out just in case but the game was unplayable. I had anticipated this, so went out and got a 970 and am enjoying the experience thoroughly on a i7 950. Its a beautiful game and well thought out too  the 1.5 gig patch last night should have sorted out most peoples gripes. I dont regret purchasing this and am feeling that I am getting my moneys worth. Helps having low release expectations I work in systems administration. Ive played the others and this has the most ambitious scope of the lot. With a new engine to boot, there are bound to be teething issues. My opinion would most likely be different if I were in a place where bandwidth was less accessible.
