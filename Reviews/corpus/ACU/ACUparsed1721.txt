The most frustrating addition to the franchise.  Ive rage quit twice now.  There wont be a 3rd.  The usual frustrating AC game mechanics of character climbingfor no reason at the worst possible instance, but somehow worse.  Lifeless story.   The worst of the worst on sandbox plot lines.  Lots of side missions and functionalities with no explanations.  I spent most of the game wondering what I was doing and WTF I was doing it, and going, Oh, I didnt know I could/couldnt do that.  But hey!  Look!  Heres a bunch of online multiplayer stuff!  Not interested in that?  Tough, here it is anyway.  Are you sure you dont want to?  ARE YOU?  HUH? HUH?   Horrible interface.  Accidentally thrown into online play in the middle of missions just because I checked my map.  My 2nd rage quit was the same as the first.  Thown into poststory DLC that you cant get out of.  Got there because, you guessed, looking at something on my map and somehow selected it.  Done and done.
