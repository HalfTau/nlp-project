I have got to be the only one that actually likes this game, finds the controls to be perfectly fine and really enjoyed the setting. It also gets a lot of hate for performance but honestly those people fail to consider just how complex this game is and put it down to bad optimization man f that, this game looks incredible of course it isnt going to run at 100fps on a 670.
