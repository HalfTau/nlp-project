When you replay a mission , the progress will not be recorded if the game crash . Especially the DLC.When you finish loading , it crash.When you are detected and have to fight a lot of enemies , it crash.And finally you are going to escape and finish the mission , Oh , F   k , it crash.F   k Uplay , I have to go over one mission again and again , facing  constantly crash and savegames Synchronization fail.Are you forcing players to replay your missions more times by this way ? Treating us like fo2l ?
