Overall meh. Very poorly optimized. Nothing new or unique. Way too many senseless things on the map, its so cluttered you cant see anything. Too many treasures and side missions that youll never do since theres too many and theyre all the same. No modern day story or gameplay. Im a big AC fan and have played almost all of them. Get it on major sale if youre looking to play them all.
