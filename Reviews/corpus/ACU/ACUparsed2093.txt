Maybe its the french language setting hiding the bad acting and limited dialogue loops but this seems leagues ahead of prior titles and the crowds around Nostre Dame.The english voiced actors seem ok but Im faintly confused as to why Parisians all sound like Northern English people. Maybe its less racist than a selection of nasal gallic accents but its a little weird. That said the actors are proficient which is enough for me!The buildings are well modelled too and the cramped architecture of Paris in this period seems to require less additional platforms, ropes and adornments to allow traversal by the player. Even compared to syndicate the city seems more real and less artificial.Character progression is gated by completing memories which can be frustrating but in fact the demands in terms of fighting skill are interesting, The game is certainly less of a cakewalk than Syndicate or Rogue but there are so many side missions alongside the main quest that it never feels overly challenging.Bugs were commonplace when this game debuted but after a year of patches this initial bad press seems to have resulted in a final product that has more polish and better performance than previous games, especially considering the huge number of models on screen in some of the crowd scenes.This is one of the only AC games after the first couple that I recommend buying at full price. Pity that you must endure UbiSofts janky game managment software but otherwise its solid.Dead Kings is a piece of subpar crap filled with lousy puzzles that I could not stand. Avoid the DLC.
