4hours of gaming... I played the game its amazing.. but after a day or two everything I launch the game.. and after Im about to go into the game, it crashes every single time.. like when I arrive in the game and starts to load up all the characters it just crashes.. this is very frustrating I even lowered down all of the settings and still it crashes..
