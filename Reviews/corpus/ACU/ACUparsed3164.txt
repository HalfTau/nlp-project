Assassins Creed Unity is a great game, to me at least. I know that this game is known for having many bugs, but really I havent seem many of them. Other than that, the game is very smooth in gameplay, the combat is challenging and keeps you on your toes, there are a lot of different diverse weapons, epicially with the new weapons added from the Dead Kings DLC. The game has a great quality graphics, everything is very detailed, espicially the historical sites of France. Also, the story of Arno Dorian is very deep, with love, tragedy, and many more, dont want to spoil it for anyone of course. Lastly there is the multipolayer of this game, though it seems to be the buggiest part of the game, and the lag that happens once in a while, but if you go pass that, the game is pretty cool, with your assassins buddies fighting along side you through going guns blazing, or coordinated stealth. Still, great game, I would totally suggest it to anyone Assassins Creed fan if they have the money to buy it, Though I would suggest buying it on sale as the price of 60 bucks is a little to high for my standards.
