i havnt got to many hours under my belt on this game but. but to lose your quest guy 3 times in a row. after trying to follow him and he just disapears. i tried to find him once with eagel vision. apperantly he had found a sneaky way of getting out of the prison through a portal that must have been only accesable to him for he was cliffhanging under the door that he needed to open for me. frame rates horrible. i am not a fan. and this needs serius work. this game is also the reason i refuse to buy farcry 4. good work Ubisoft
