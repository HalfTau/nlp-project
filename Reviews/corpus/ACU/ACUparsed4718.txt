yes, Assassins creed unity is a fabulous game. Mnay gamers regret purchasing the game only because their gamin platform does not reaches the minimum requirements of the game shown below. The game contains a 1 to 1 ratio of late 18 century France, the game gives a greate view of Paris through high view points.With a brand new skill tree as well as introducing the co op missions. The campaign so far was very interesting to play after equiping double air assasination and double assassination whch allows player to assassinate two opponents at once. This made many parts of the sequence easier to stealth through.Through the huge maps of Paris.Ubisoft created fast travel points to teleport around Paris which can save a lot of time which can be used for missions instead of entering unnessasary conflicts.The icon that shows the opponent ranks can be very helpful through the gaming experience. This simply informs the player of the difficulty to slaughter the opposing enemy as well as giving a heads up for those that wanted to stealth through the mission to skip of assassinate these NPCs.However there are some down sides of the game. the characters in game are identical to one another but this is rarely to be seen within the screen apart from a crowd. bugs did occur when climbing walls. a fog is situated around the paris to minimise the system intake so players can experienced more.
