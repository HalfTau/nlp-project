I first got this game on a decent computer, it was laggy even on the lowest settings but playable. Only problem was all the bugs that came with the initial release and it justme off. So i waited awhile cause i was getting a better com and the bugs were gonna be patched in time so sure why the hell not. And now works fine as rain not many bugs and even those bugs are rather comical so those who are saying this is unplayble are either using a rather  com or just dislike the game nothing wrong with that.
