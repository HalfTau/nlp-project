This games seems likes it has a decent story to offer beautiful visual at full 1080p. The problem is this game is extremely buggy has pop in textures even after the 5th patch and crashes chronicly. I cant get past exploring La Sainte Chappelle and keep getting constant crashes when trying to do so. Im at a mere three percent in the game. Mind you that the build in steam time recorder records the app running regardless of real gameplay time. Ive asked for a refund and have gotten no answer yet. Sucks to actually be another bad ubisoft story.
