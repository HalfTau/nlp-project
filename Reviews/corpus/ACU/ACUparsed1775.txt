I dont know what it is about this game, but the FPS literally goes down to 7 when I start playing and I havent had any other problems with some of the other AC titles or heavier games. I even turned the graphics quality low and checked all the specs. Could barely get the first chapter to run. Plus its just buggy as heck, will maybe try again later after some reconfiguration.
