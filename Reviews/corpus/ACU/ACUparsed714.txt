I really wanted to like this game, I really tried to.At its core its still an assassins creed game, ButThe story and character development is pretty sad, I couldnt relate to/or feel for any of the characters. The damn glitches man... Insane framerate drops, dead zones, every movement glitch imaginable although i found it pretty amusing that one time i floated around the street like the nun on the blues brothersI could probably drone on for hours about all the issues this game has, but that would be a waste of everyones time.Just dont do it, even if its on sale.I made that mistake, and look at this review...
