After some hours of playing in the middle of sequence 12, I just want to say that this is not a terrible game. I have heard lots of negative reviews about it especially on PC about low frame rates and terrible glitches, but I believe that this has been fixed already, since I have only encoutered about 1 or 2 glitches. The story is not terrible, either. It narrates the story of Arno and his struggles very well, and to be honest, the plot wasnt super predictable which is also good. Coop is extremely fun and I absolutely loved the idea of bringing it in in gamplays too bad they didnt keep it in Syndicate. Gears are a little bit expensive and I am not a fan of the microtransaction too bad they kept it Syndicate. But generally this is a good game.
