I finally bought it when it was on sale for  15 and this is a worthy price. I was worried about performance and glitches, but so far I have been running it in Win 10 in Win 7 compatibility mode without any problems.My laptop is a Gigabyte PW25v2 and I have been playing in ultra on 720p. My TV doesnt go higher Its been very stable and playable.The game itself, I am still a fan of the AC flavor. I know some people have tired of it, but not me. This game uses a new engine since the previous games and its a really beautiful looking game. The animations are great as well. I am amazed by the number of NPCs in the streets, even though you see the same ones repeated so often.I enjoyed the pirating in previous games, but I also love the huge city to run around in. This time around its no longer possible to kill a horde of enemies. When you are spotted, they come after you fast and hard. In enemy territory the alarm bell is sound and you better run.I am not a fan of the levelling system, as it always becomes weird where you overlevel for some areas, etc. Levelling is done with money and gear basically. But this is something that is not yet solved in open world games where you are levelling up and not exclusive to AC. I like that they are taking a new approach.
