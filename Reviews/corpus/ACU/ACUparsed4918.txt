Update scratch all of that cant get through a mission now without dropping to 5 FPSI love it. I havent enjoyed an Assassins Creed game since Revelations. The PC version is pretty crappy though, but for some reason for me 3rd gen i7  Nvidia 660 anyway, running the game at medium settings although putting the settings on low caused all kinds of problems takes care enough of the frame rate droppage where its playable. Even as a broken peice of sh!t, Im enjoying it. That could be because whenever the game does mess up, I blame it on the Animus out of habit, but thats just me. The Assassin missions are a step up stealth plays a heavier role customization has options storyline flows so far coop are fun lengthy missions. If they get it running fluidly, itll be close to a dime out of ten. I only recommend it though right now if youre okay with whats essential a beta. Id wait a few patches otherwise.
