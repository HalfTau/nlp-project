Fun, lots of improvements and great graphics.  Yes, the game is a bit buggy but that should be fixed in time.  I dont know why so many people gave this game a bad review.  It a demanding game but I dont know why people are having such issues.  I can run it on all high not very high/ultra though with minimal lag.SpecsCPU AMD FX8350 8 Core 4.0 GhzGraphics Nvidia GTX 780 TiRAM 2 X 4 GB 1866 MhzMotherboard Asus M5A99FX PRO R2.0
