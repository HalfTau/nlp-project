This is a review of game play after 40 hours.I have just complete the story missions of this game and after completing Blackflag and Rogue before this Iam disapointed.The previous two games are incredible fun and rewarding but Unity felt like a chore and hard work to me.The map is huge, maybe to large with little to no variety. The Controls are horried. trying to get in a window is hell yes i know its left triggerThe lock picking and lite rpg elements are forgetable and just plane annoying.As far as technical issues go I had no problems except for the odd floating npc. Get a smoth 60fps at 1080p on 2 gtx 770s 4gb.To summerise this game is simply not fun to play, I can not recommend it after the brilliant fun of Black flag and Rogue.
