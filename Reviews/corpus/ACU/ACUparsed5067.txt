It feels so foolish that I thought Ubisoft would fix the ing game.I played the game after the release of omega driver and patch 4, and yes at least I didnt show me shocking 20fps gameplayR9 290X CF the framerate was normally on 5570 but when I turn the camera every time it drops to 3040 fps making it very frustrating and almost unplayable.
