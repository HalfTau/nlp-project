Unity is not that bad of a game. It has everything that AC game should have, plus some extra gimmicks. But this game has incredibly unoptimised graphics. My modest exTower from 2010 could run newer titles with better graphics way better than this. Even subsequent patches to this game were unhelpful.But, lets leave the graphics behind, everyone knows that its bad. What about the story? Well.. Mediocre at best. Doesnt really stick with me, unlike other AC games. I lost interest around midgame. The story just doesnt have the good bang formula, like other games had.The CoOp is buggy and not really worth it. I had several crashes and other players tend to lag and start spazzing out midparkour.Also, it is Pay To Win. You can buy credits to quickly buy weapons, and the money gain in singleplayer is lower than in other games. Huge minus for that. Ubisoft wants to milk the money out of you.
