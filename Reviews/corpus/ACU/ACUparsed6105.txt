TechnicalUpdating my graphics driver definitely helped, but I still have to play on medium graphics with a core i7 nvidia 860 graphics card and 16gigs of ram... which is sad... definitely not a very well optomized game. Other than that there is the occasional bug  Ive fallen out of the world once, been trapped between objects unable to move, and experienced a series of crashes upon loading the game so far.GameplayCombat is really hard, much harder than in black flag and honestly a bit more exciting despite being much harder. Stealth combat seems to be the best way to kill early on in this game, as a group of guards will kill you if engaged upon.The map is pretty incredible, their are lots of people on the streets and the city feels really alive. Rooftops are much easier to navigate than in Black Flag at least so far due to the lack of guards on them, often the easiest way to lose a group of guards is to go on the roof so Ive found. The lack of haybales is slightly disheartening, but it fits with France in this time period.Im not sure how much I like the coop missions, unless you are playing with friends I havent found a good way to communicate with your partners and that makes it really confusing. That being said it seems to work pretty flawlessly from what Ive played.Now the story is interesting but so far hasnt been incredibly exciting. From what Ive found so far the storyline is a lot harder then previous Assassins Creed games due to the difficulty of the combat AI, but that could very well be because Im terrible at fighting with the new combat system.All in all I will keep this review negative until most of the bugs are patched and the game runs smoother on higher end PCs, but it does look like it will be a decent game once technical problems are sorted out.
