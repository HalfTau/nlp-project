A true next gen title by ubisoft if they were given more time and not rushing to release and optimized game this would be one of the best looking and performing Assassin creed titles to date the only bugs I have found are minor I did not play this game at launch so I didnt have any of the issues that most experienced  at 4k on a single card Titan X my fps average is 5070 fps I will come back to this game later and play it at 5k to test sli performance Unity is similar to the more traditional Assassin creed games so I recommend playing Assassins creed 2 as it has one of the best stories out of the entire series then move on to Assassins creed syndicate and unity  well worth the purchase triple A experience movie quality cutscenes and voiceovers dialogI prefer Unitys ending over Syndicate but both games are excellent and worth playing. Assassins creed unity has coop so if you like playing with friends Unity is the one for youGraphics 10Story 9Voice Dialog 10Replayability 8Sound 10Gameplay 8Coop Surprised me 9Controls Keyboard Mouse 6 can use some workSLI Support 10
