I really love the game for going back to the original assassins creed style with hours and hours of content to do and see. Also the next gen paris is one of the best open world city i have ever seen. Running on an r7 250x i get about medium settings 2025 fps which isnt a lot but is a fairly optimized game could have been better but a very fast paced campaign leaves me wanting a bit from the game as well as the stealth as it never clear if you are really hidden.
