Massive downgrade from previous games. Dialogue and characters have somehow gotten even more threadbare than beforewhy am i killing people? how am i at all invested? why do i care? who cares, just keep murdering! your friend, who helped you out, nope, hes a bad guy now, so kill him. meanwhile, kill some other people. kill the red guys but also kill the blue guys because  it. kill kill kill.And in between the killing, youll be treated to... running! run over there! run over here! follow some idiot and defend them when they get into a fight! why? because we needed to pad this game out, thats why! so we filled with interminable fetch quests and investigations but didnt actually play through thisbecause if we had, we would have realized this is dreadfully boring. and does the map or fast travel system make this easier?  no! the only fast travel locations are so few and far apart youre better off just running there yourself.these games used to have fun levels, places to explore, thoughtful riddles to decipher. it wasnt just a neverending slog of run, jump, kill, repeat. im going to replay AC 2 now, call me when ubisoft decides to stop relying on its past successes, and decides to make a real game.
