I fell into the trap and bought it on a steam sale thinking maybe it will work and not suck and if it doesnt who cares because it was cheaper!Even at a discount, this isnt worth the frustration of trying to get the game to work. Its now been many months since the initial buggy release and many patches but it is still plagued with major game breaking errors. Ive been troubleshooting the last hour on how to not to crash directly after loading my only save.The most dissapointing part of this game is not the game itself but the fact that I got suckered into throwing money at it despite all the warnings.
