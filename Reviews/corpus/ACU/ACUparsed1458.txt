Ubisoft is dying and this game was terrible! I loved the fact that you could switch your weapon loadout style. That was the only cool thing about it though and I have played and/or own almost all of the AC games.Game mechanics were complete trash they did not check to make sure that everything was done right so its pretty buggy and they know the game is bad and they dont seem to take an interest into fixing it because I believe they think it is a lost cause and I am inclined to agree with that assessment.
