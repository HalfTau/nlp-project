The game is awesome!Are running it on low graphic settings.Only glitches so far, are problems with cover. And it has frozen a couple of times, but rarely and only for a few secs.So nothing that affects the gameplay.Just read another guy, is playing on high settings, with older hardware then mine.Think il try it out, Geforce Experience choose the settings im using now.
