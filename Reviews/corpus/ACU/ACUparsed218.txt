I have not played Syndicate or Origins yet so I will be writing this review without those in mind.  As a long time Assassins Creed player I was wary about playing this as it obviously had mixed reviews and a rocky start.  And after a somewhat slow start, this game really picks up and has become one of my favorites.ProsGreat stealthBeautiful graphicsThey really nailed the historyReally fun side missions murder mysteries, puzzlesSo many different ways to play sneaky, brute, sniperAction mechanics and assassinations moves change with the weapon and are super funBrutal killsAbove average storyOne of the best as far as attention to detailChanging weatherFighting was actually harder!  Gone are the days I can counter kill 30 people in a rowNow that being said there were definitely some things that could have been improvedConsEven with all the patches, the parkour was still a little off, the animation is better and you can climb new corners and do new jumps, but the simplest things like getting off a table were a pain sometimes, but you get used to itReally miss some things you used to be able to do.  Like whistling people over, disarming people, picking up weapons, moving dead bodies, etcMost people have a british accent and it weirded me outMultiplayer was doable for one person but challenging, wish it was still workingCant get 100 completion without using their companion app and jumping through some hoopsStory was good but could have been better still no meaningful modern dayStarts slow and is a little overwhelming with all the history but very detailedAll in all, it was a great game and I think a big leap from the previous games.  It introduced a whole new feel and I think they just rushed it a little.  But the action and gameplay are amazing, you really feel like an assassin in this game.  If you like Assassins Creed in general, youll love it.  Get it on a sale and have some fun!
