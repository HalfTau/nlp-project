I liked the mythical story line in the previous AC games which is a little bit lacking in this game imho. Still they have listen to their fans and created a smooth gameplay with good graphics. I have played this game on a 70 screen and it was still awesome.I never experienced lags or glitches, maybe because I bought a new PC for this game. I have to say that bearing this in mind it is still a little disappointing. It feels to me there is so much going on over such a wide area that I find little dedication to do one thing or another.I think the average game could wait till the price drops to 30 EUR or so.
