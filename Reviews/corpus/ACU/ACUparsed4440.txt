Although the game looks nice its an unfinished product, if you pay attention you could see glitches in hearths and other furniture. Though thats not the biggest problem, when I started playing there was stuff like save file corruption, framerate problems.Of course you can fix these problems over time but then my advice to Ubisoft would be sell it as an alpha and not a finished product, thats deceiving people.Furthermore the game is still the same idea which is still unique in my opinion each scenery has its own style. The streets filled with people and patriots killing the occassional resistent citizen that you can help out.So its not all bad, but if you plan on buying it you better be prepared for the problems it brings and the amount of patches. If patch 3 has 300 fixes then certainly there is something wrong in what they produced and are trying to sell to us.Aside of this my personal opinion dont waste money on what is not finished and I hope that anyone who buys this game enjoys it.
