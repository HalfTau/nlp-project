Well I have been a HUGE fan of all the assassins creed games, I own them all and have played them all for many hours, beating them from head to toe, 100 sync. and then some. In other words I am or rather was a fanactic. As many have said its not the game but the poor bussiness choices made that have ruined this game. But its not just that. 1st off you need a high end graphics card to really enjoy the game at max settings. My 970gtx runs great and the game looks beautiful but I understand not everyone can afford a 400 card. I have had countless issues with the game, freezing , the game simply not making it past the title screen and even graphical errors. Instead of fixing these issues they blame your gear and put out a dlc to side track us from the fact that the original game is riddled with problems. I really want to like this game but between UPlay and Ubisoft I dont think that will happen.
