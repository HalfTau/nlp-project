I felt like I should write a review based on the huge amount of negative feedback that this release is receiving.I saw all the reviews before purchasing the game, was very hesitant. but decided to anyway, expecting nothing but problems, slow frame rates, falling through floors, and a generally unplayable game.However, I did experience a drop in frame rate when it first loaded as it auto detected that I wanted to run at 3840 x 2160, once I changed this to 2560 x 1440 and left all the other settings alone, it runs awesome, better than Black Flag which would stutter every so often, thats irritating when you are trying to fight.The only issue that I have really had, was about 6 hours in, I managed to get stuck between a fence and a bush, was easily solved by fast travelling to a nearby point.Now I have the app on my tablet, the map appears to update faster than Black Flag and is a nice addition, what isnt nice or expected is that there are in game purchases available, really? after paying 99 for a game you want me to shell out more to unlock things in my tablet? least as far as I can tell they are not manditory and you can play without.
