Therere some thougts Arnos probably often dealing withIm the best parkourrunner of all time... dammit a ladder my only weaknessWhy do I always jump on those fcking boxes when Im tracking down my targets? !I can fight five soldiers at once but not be able to take them as a human shield against bullets like in AC3 for some fcking reasonI can shoot those small phantom blades over about 25 m in someones head, no matter hes moving or not, but if he runs right towards in a distance of like 3 m me Im aiming like a drunkardAnd why are those things still harassing me after over one year after release of this still gorgeous looking, brilliant atmospheric but yet simply unfinished and sometimes massively annoying game?I still recommend this game to every ACfan, because its, considering atmosphere, the world/Paris and the huge amount of charactercustomizationpossibilities, just like you wished any other ACgame would have been... BUT the controls and the balancing are just fcked up not even a sufficient work Ubisoft!!!! !But well, ACplayers are used to those issues still, those have never been so serious and game destroying like in this part
