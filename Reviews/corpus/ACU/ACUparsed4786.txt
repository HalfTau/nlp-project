It seems like most people dislike this game, but I think its very good. The Assassins Creed games mean a lot to me as I started playing the first game in an important time in my life. Playing any of these games reminds me of very meaningful memories. That said, I dont only enjoy this game because it has the words Assassins Creed stuck in the title. This game is very fun. Sure there are some bugs and glitches, but that happens with plenty of popular games. This one has only been out for a week and there have been and will be fixes. Just think of Skyrim and how many weird glitches there still are in that game. I still find myself falling through the ground for no reason in that game. The city of revolutionary Paris is amazing in this game and being able to run around and climb up some of the most notable buildings is great. Its refreshing to be back in a larger city in this game and interact with so many NPCs. Ive got a 2013 iMac that I play this game on and dont have any complaints with performance. Granted, I find games to run well if they run over 30 frames per second and I know many people need to see more than 60 FPS. I dont find myself dipping below 30 FPS hardly at all. Ive crashed only once and havent seen any game breaking bugs or glitches. I honestly think this is a great game and can take a very long time to finish as long as you dont use the fast travel system. But I find it much more enjoyable to get to where I need to be while seeing all the sites around Paris. I love this game and I recommend it to anyone.
