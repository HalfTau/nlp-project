The game itself is not bad, but I as many other users experience a horrible ACU.exe stopped working issue every 1015 minutes of playing. There is a number of suggestions on what to do to fix it, which itself is a bad sign, as the fix is clearly difficult to achieve. Unfortunately none of them have worked for me, the game keeps failing.Terrible job on ubisoft part.
