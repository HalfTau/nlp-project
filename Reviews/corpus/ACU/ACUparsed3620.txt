This is a well made game.  The combat and movement are very smooth and detailed.  The story line was well developed.  The leveling and extent of character customability is amazing and well.  Although, hack points are a mostly pay to earn part of the game, players can easily play througa game without buying a single hack point.  In my opinion, it lives up to the expectations that its predecessors have layed down before it.  It was a great game.
