Poor optimisation really kills this game.  Load times are absolutely horrendous, even when loading from an SSD, and the terrible framerate during cutscenes is annoying to say the least.  All this seems unacceptable when the game seems to be so much smaller in scope than previous entries in the series.  That and the step away from many of the underlying story ideas that have tied all the Assassins Creed games together so far.  Why the new helix system?  What was wrong with just calling it the Animus still?It looks gorgeous, dont get me wrong, and the motion capture work is pretty much second to none so far, but the experience itself is held back by the negatives.  In hindsight, I should have waited to purchase until later, after some patches came around to fix it up, and maybe when cheaper on sale.  Too late now, though.
