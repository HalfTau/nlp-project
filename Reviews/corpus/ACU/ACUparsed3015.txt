I love this game and my anwser to all the bad reviews isBUY A BETTER COMPUTER GUYS !If you have the right computer then you will never have any problem regarding FPS and crashes.I owe a i7 4790 and my graphics card is a Radeon R9 280X and 16GB of RAMIve never experienced ant bugs or anything that will give me trouble while playing this game.The story is very good and very well written. The graphics are When ou play with a good PC AWESOME!!! as real as it can get to reallity lolThe multiplayer is very stable and entertaining you can play with up to 4 other players for some missionsI think most of the bad reviews given to this game are given by people who have a old generation computer and cannot run this game with good settings and then experienced problem because of that. Its their own faults, but if you do have the right pc just go for it and buy that game its so worth it !
