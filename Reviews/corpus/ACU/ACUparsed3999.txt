Honestly, this game is not worth getting. At least for full price. Maybe in 6 months when the price drops AND goes on sale for less than 20, thats when i would get it. This has to be one of the biggest letdowns from Ubisoft. The storyline is very bland and the characters are extremely boring compared to any AC game in the past. Everyone has been hyped for coop but the coop missions are as bland as the main missions are. Go here, retrieve this, go there, kill this random guy, escape. Another thing about the story that I might add is that it is literally the shortest of all AC games. I literally forced myself to play side missions, cooop missions, and complete side activites to make the game last, but it still felt very short. I continued to play after the storyline to complete missions but stopped because i was so bored. I havent played it since i beat it about 3 weeks ago. Overall, the game itself is just bland. It is also very hard to run the game on high settings because of how poorly optimized it is. There will be the die hard AC fans telling you that it is the best AC, but quite honestly it is close to being the worst. I would give it a 3/10. 4 at the most.
