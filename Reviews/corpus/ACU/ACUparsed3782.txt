I played this game when it came out and abandoned it because of the  optimization. Tried it again a month later, after a lot of patches, and the performance is even more bad than it was at the launch day. I waited for this game so long, wasted 60 euros and this is what I get a slideshow. 60 wasted, thank you ubisoft, will buy again.EDIT Alright it is March 2015 and patch 5 has been released. The framerate is still pretty bad, 2535 on my machine, but at least the game doesnt crash or freeze anymore.EDIT II  It is January of 2017 and I played the game for the hell of it with my new GTX 1060. The game finally runs ok, 60 fps but unstable. But God damn it this game was released in 2014 and new graphics cards still struggle to keep it smooth. And its not that the graphics are incredible or anything. The game does look nice with all the details but even with the draw distance maxed out, the buildings that are like 30 meters away from you look atrocious in 800x480 resolution. Perhaps this is an artistic choice, maybe Arno is shortsighted who knows?
