This was the last time I preorder a Ubisoft game. Assasins Creed Unity is not finished. The performace issues are epic and although some folks seem to be able to play the game, many, many others including myself can not.My system is in somewhere inbetween the Minimum and Recommended specs, so if I had to turn the graphics down to medium or even low, I wouldnt complain much. Sure, the system requirements seem high for the visual fidelity  that the game delivers, but thats forgivable.But Assasins Creed Unity is a mess. The game performs poorly on all graphical settings, suggesting that the problem isnt simply graphical horsepower. Many gameplay sessions end with the character stuck halfway into the floor. Crashes are frequent. Frame rates regularly range between 10 and 20 FPS, especially if theres a lot of hair or cloth on the screen. Most maddeningly, every few seconds the gameplay will hesitate for a fraction of a second. When if catches up, it assumes that your mouse must have been moving at the same rate it was when it hiccuped which usually results in a sharp spin of the camera. In ACU, that means that your character suddenly changes direction, often running off a roof, into a cart, or turning your back to an enemy. This bug in particular has rendered the game completely unplayable for me.As a long time fan of the series, I find this extremely disappointing. Many folks wonder how this could have happened and wonder if Ubisoft even has a QA Tesing department at all. To this, I would speculate that they do in fact have competent tester and that those developers opinions and warnings were ignored by Ubisoft management who just had to have the game released this quarter so that their earnings statement would be positive. Screw long term company reputation and screw the customers. Its worked for EA, so why cant it work for Ubisoft?While that last bit is all speculation, the summary of the game and its performance issues is not. Dont buy this game.
