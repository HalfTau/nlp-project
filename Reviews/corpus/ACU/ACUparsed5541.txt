This game is amazing. Not only does it look good, the facial animations and voice acting is very well done. The story is entriquing from the beginning and it runs very well for me despite all the negative reviews I have seen.I use a NVIDIA GTX770 graphics card and an intel i54440 processor, running the game on ultra with AA on x4 still has the game running smoothly for me, though if I turn the AA to x8 or use the TTXA or whatever it is called have the game dropping to 1020 fps.Props to Ubisoft for making a good game, I was not a big fan of Black Flag and this game really reminds me of 2 and Brotherhood in a good way. Though the minimum requirements are pretty high . !Also, combat is freaking tough now, so watch out x
