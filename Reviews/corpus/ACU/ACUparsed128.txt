I suppose it wasnt bad for a game I picked up for 12 bucks. There are a lot of technical issues that were simply frustrating, at times. They also got rid of some gameplay features of older titles in the series, like a lack of whistling at guards to get their attention or being able to loot bodies quickly by doing certain actions like a stealth assasin blade kill. The skill unlock features in this game seem lackluster. There was really only very few skills I had any remote interest in unlocking. My main issue with this title was the controls were aggravating. There have been multiple times I wanted Arno to do an action and he does something different. For instance, I wanted to do a ledge assassination. So I directed my camera to the guy I wanted to ledge assassinate. But sadly, the game translated that in me wanting to assassinate some random ruffian on the ground. Or even better... I wanted to jump through an open window, but Arno decides to hop around from one side of the window to the other, taking me a good 10 seconds to get his backside inside.Storywise, I suppose it was fine. Nothing suprising or new as it was the typical avenge the death of my father figure type story. Oddly, there was no conclusion to the whole point of you going through the memories of Arno to find the sages body. They might have as well thrown out the interludes of you talking to the hackerchick that was taking you through Arnos memories as it mattered none at all.Finally, they really need to ditch the collectable content. I have very little desire to find every chest or little artifact emblem, or insert collectible crap here fodder. It is tediously boring to me.
