I bought this game knowing about bugs and glitches but thought oh well patches should fix it, and I loved Black Flag. I personally didnt have any full on crashes, just framerates that topped out at about 23 fps, crowds/running dropping that to 12fps and occaisional drops to 0fps for about 10 seconds, which is great during a chase. Patch 4 made things a little smoother, but nowhere near what it should be.What gets me more upset is that there is literally no story to this game. Ubisoft took a caracter vaguely like Ezio, threw him into the Assassin group in a revenge quest...and thats it. He never actually believes anything the assassins believe in, nobody even really tells him about that in fact. They just say, Templarsbad, now go kill them.In the process of streamlining the mechanics, you can no longer whistle to attract enemies. Here is a list of everything that you have to BUY with in game points to be able to doNow some of these features used to take crafting or searching for things into it which Im fine with, but using a point system that you only have a limited number to work with unless you play tons of multiplayer is complete t.  It takes abilities that were either built into past characters from the moment they start or taught to them or given for free in the story and makes you choose which you want to spend your Sync Points on. In order to get enough of these points you MUST play the broken multiplayer that I never got to work successfully. It would load a match then disconnect immediately.All in all, a giant step backward in the series, and I have now lost hope for future installments. Well see I guess, but Ubisoft better get their act together soon.
