The game itself was ok, new customization and freeroam coop was good. They made an ok iteration of assassins creed this time around.But, that was all overshadowed by the frequent crashes, graphical glitches, and awful framerate please note that I do meet the minimum requirements shown.On top of that, after nearly 24 hours of gameplay the game itself crashed, my data was corrupted, and everything was lost.Do not buy this game unless your computer meets and exceeds the system requirements, you are ok with constantly crashing, and you dont care one way or another if all of your save data is deleted after 23.5 hours spent in game.
