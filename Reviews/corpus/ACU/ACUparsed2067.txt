If you are an Assassins Creed fan best part of this game is that you can completely skip it, as this game does not advance present time story at all.Gameplay has a lot of improvements, like sneaking finally but controlling the character is harder than ever. Arno seems to never to do want him to do  randomly climbs walls and fences, can never enter the window when I want him to and so on. It was always a problem with assassins creed, but this game is the worst.The biggest gripe is that the best suit of armor is purely a cosmetic one, that I realized after I spent a day solving riddles to get it.Side missions are boring, do not waste your time on them. Collectables are plenty as always, rewards for them just like the armor  are crap.I tried to like this game, but I cannot. Not because of performance, which was satisfactory high settings, FXAA on R9 290 with 60 fps with dips to 40 near Notre Dame and other crowded places, but because of quality of the games story, which is the most important to me. Not for a second I was interested in the plot or felt something for the characters. It was so mundane that this is the first game I regret spending time playing.Do not make the same mistake that I did and avoid this game.
