It seems Ubisoft spent more time developing the graphics engine than the actual story and gameplay. The game looks great, but thats about it.Most of the quests in the game are tedious. The Nostradamus quests are confusing and doesnt feel worth it at all. The investigation quests gets boring really fast run to x and look for clues, rinse and repeat.The multiplayer part playing with randoms is just chaos and no fun at all, and playing most of them single player is too hard. But the challenge is awesome! Yeeeah, no thanks. Id rather just jump off a building, if the controllers would let me.The animus rifts or whatever you call them were fun, but it broke the immersion of feeling that you were living the past of the main character. Did Arno experience this or is the player who is logged in the animus experience it? I dont know.. Im really confused.Its like Ubisoft is playing by the same rules as the assassins, everything is allowed because Im not sure what the hell is going on anymore, storywise.Movement feels like more of an issue than in previous games. I felt the character do something I did not intend way more often than in previous games. So many lost stealth oportunities when Arno suddenly is standing on a table in the middle of a room with 16 enemies looking at him confused.The cover ability was pretty annoying. Am I in cover now? No? Now then? No.. How about now? Moving around like a drunken man looking for his glasses on the floor. Suddenly, 16 enemies looking at him, confused again. Not to worry, smoke bomb and run. Seriously. The only tool worth investing in is smoke bombs, because thats the only game mechanic I felt was reliable. Everything else was like a shot in the dark.So I dont recommend this game because I really think they spent their entire budget on the new graphics engine. Maybe Syndicate will be better, now that thats out of the way.
