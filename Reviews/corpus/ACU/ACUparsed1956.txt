i love this game! probably because I didnt play any of the othersBut i have one BIG problem with it, why would they set the same button for climbing for running?WHY?WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?  Everytime i try to run from a group of enemies, i end up climbing up a stone or a building leaving me compleatly vunrable for them to shoot me. They could have just set the running button to shift, and the climbing button to f! Then reset the things for f to g!Also Uplay sucks.
