GTX 980, i74930K, 32GB RAMI certainly havent been experiencing the same number of performance issues as the rest of the community seems to but I am experiencing a rather uncomfortable number of showstopping performance issues. On my rig this should be maxed out at 144fps in almost every situation.Although, the moment the performance issues are fixed Id say this is a good addition to the series. They kind of abandoned the original story for the most part which is great because they were really running it dry. Theres enough new stuff to be worth it but if you were getting bored of the play style you wont want this. If you have fun with the play style still, go for it you wont be disappointed. Just wait until they make sure its running smoothly, which all indications say they are working hard to do.UPDATESo I realized today Ive lost two days of progress. Didnt notice until now because I only did coop missions to get sync points and unlock gear. Realized a couple items I bought were gone and that the coop missions showed no progress. Saw that the last saved date was two days ago despite the game saving quite frequently. Tried a workaround to disable cloud sync then played until the point of the game saving a few times just now. Quit out. Started it up. Last game save two days ago still.No response from Ubisoft as of yet. The other problems were annoyances, but this is a showstopper. Unfortunate. Hopefully I get a response soon but from reading other forums it seems unlikely. I guess Ill have to just keep testing every day until it eventually starts working again then I can play the 60 game I paid for. New method of purchasing, mentally I will consider the launch date one month after the actual launch date and buy games then. In most casesFiraxis excluded that will probably be a good strategy.
