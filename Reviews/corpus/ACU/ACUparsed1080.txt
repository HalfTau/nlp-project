First things first, I played this game when it originally came out for the PS4 and it was an absolutely abysmal experience. The game started to drop frames whenever there were large masses of NPCs, there were gamecrashing bugs all over the place, and it didnt feel like a brand new Assassins Creed game overall.Coming back to this game now after waiting for Ubisoft to fix all of the previous problems of this game was a great idea. I have been having a blast with this game. The graphics are phenomenal, the new system for moving and climbing is very intuitive and feels more realistic and responsive, and for the first time in the series you can actually have a good chance of dying in combat, which makes you plan more strategically when youre about to enter combat. Another good addition to this game, in my opinion, is letting you plan out your path for assassinating targets. It feels a lot more personalized and is more rewarding overall once the assassination is completed. Revolutionary France is an amazing setting as well and really makes you want to explore every inch of it.The story is great right up until the very ending, in my opinion, but overall this is a very solid entry in the Assassins Creed franchise, even though it had a very rocky release.My personal score 8.75/10. I would highly recommend getting this game.
