This Game is simply HorseNow I know why they call it Assassins Creed Bugity, it constantly crashes including BDOS Crashes and the rendering its everything but stable.Thoguh not mentioning THE ING BUGS, its good, not an excellent story but its interesting to follow. The graphics are amazing, even if sometimes are ing huge bugs like leather going crazy on some random npc.
