Cutscenes are done with ingame graphics and look like I played on ultra textures and witnessed the most painful hair in video game history, plus everytime the camera focuses for instance something that arno is holding in his hand, its hilariously blurry.Especially in the beginning of this game, the overall graphical standard is not very good...youll see a group of npcs 10 meters away from you, and theyll look deformed like minecraft characters, and that was on ultra textures too. Note that I do play on a powerful machine.The game has horrible controlls. There is now a new free running mode, that lets you decide if you want to go up/climb something or descend somewhere/drop. Youd think that this is a nice idea, but really all it does is making the free running less fluid and too complicated. In overall, the controlls are not good. Often Arno reacts way too late, especially when in a fight using the keyboard and mouse.Climbing itself is also a pain in the rectal area. Arno will often not understand how he should proceed and will just stop on a ledge instead of jumping over to the next building. Besides from that, hes also slow as hell. Jumping between walls quickly is impossible most of the time. Same goes for climbing around corners. Arno will just get stuck. And not just on walls, that goes for crowds, interiours and fences too.Performance is often pretty terrible, Ive heard of people with stronger machines than mine that have problems with the game. After these complains, Im convinced that my good performance was at random. A company this big releases a full price tripple a title, and it does not work forGame has not enough new features to justify the 60 euro price tag.Black Flag was a ing awesome game. This is not. If you havent owned an assassins creed for a long time, just get black flag...this game is not worth it.
