My god, this port is garbage. I just recently bought and built a new gaming rig, and having never played an Ubisoft game on a decent gaming rig bought this a bit naively. I cannot get stable 60 FPS on any settings, only 45 and only if my character is walking and there aren large crowds. The gameplay seems fun, but I am too distracted by the massive artifacting and random freezing. I can run Shadows on Ultra, so I can only assume this game is simply horribly optimized. Do not buy.
