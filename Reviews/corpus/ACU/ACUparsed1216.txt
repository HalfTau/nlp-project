TLDR worst AC I ever playedFirst AC which I ragequitted and deleted prior to playing through it. In my few playing hours I got lots of glitches and two bluescreens of death. After the second bluescreen I quitted this game for good. I thought they had fixed this game by now but unfortunatly I was wrong. I dont think they will provide any more patches, so theres no point for me in waiting for them to fix the issues.So I cant tell much of the story. I guess its good as far as I can tell.The combat system is quite challenging at the beginning because your alter ego has to master fighting first. Since I didnt make it far, it was a disaster. I was glad Arno didnt stab himself with his sword.
