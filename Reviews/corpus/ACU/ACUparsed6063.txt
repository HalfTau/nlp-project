Im not usualy one to be upset and spout about how upset I am, but I blow the recommended specs out of the water yet game runs like .Me and my gamer pal preordered months ago to enjoy an assasins creed in full coop. The ammount of disappointment is beyond belief. We arent even Graphics nuts or anything.In many ways the game just DOESNT work as intended.Either they fix this within 2 weeks, or I demand a refund. The game they advertised in thier trailors is NOT the product that was delivered. If this doesnt get fixed and fast, then its false advertisement.Even if the game gets fixed, if it takes too long to the point where the price drops, the cost at release would then simply be robbery.This isnt even a case of a bad port job, this game was announced for PC, PS4 and Xboxone. Each was developed to work on its respective system. What I am seeing looks like some half finished alpha stage quality game....At this time DO NOT give Ubisoft a single cent untill they at least deliver the product advertised in thier trailors.Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit Fixit !!!!! !
