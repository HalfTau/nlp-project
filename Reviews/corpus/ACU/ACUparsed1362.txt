Judt started the game! So far it is very interesting and one of the bestlooking games!Gtx 960 FX 8320 mix of Ultra High and High gives me 5060fps without dips! Definitely recommended! Gonna update review after I complete the game.UPDATE Finished the main story and played a lots of side stuff! The game is almost flawless! I can run it at stable 4560 FPS and hardly ever did encounter soms hiccups or problems. It never crashed for me and the story and gameplay are awesome! The open world and just goofing around are pretty fun, really love the exploration! Another big thing is awesome customisation, everyone can make their own personal character here! I really dont understand the hate for this games story or anything! I mean, get over the problems of the past people!Prosawesome story with some pretty cool characters dont know why people dont like thisamaxing graphics that are still on par if not better than most new releasesthe performance is now rock solid, I dont see the reason to get it especially if you grab it for a very low priceConsminor hiccups here and there especially when playing it after some time of inactivity pretty rare stuffsome glitches, but nothing close to the launch stateTo conclude anyone looking for a pretty good game will like this one! Its definitely one of the best Assassins Creed games! I dont think your should miss out on this one.
