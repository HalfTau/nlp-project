Waited tell Feb 22nd 2015 to play this game, Knowing they would patch most of the bugs, still.... So many dam bugs....Great game when working how its intended... but simple things that they took away, like I cant pick up my enemies weapons anymore, Combat feels, Easier, just rack up combos on the basic Guards and if you have 5  hits you auto kill the bigger guards.... seems like a week system
