just saw a NPC women walk thru 3 houses, before i decided to kill her, her body got stuck in a wall.Many NPC loses their faces or disappear and randomly appear near you,  friend or foe, Ive gotten stuck on mana roofs/slides/trees and some npc looks likes it graphics taken from Nintendo 64, im talking like triangle faces and 20 pixels.combat is worse than the others,campaign was really bad, i couldnt get it completed. since i got stuck where at a certain point napoleon should blow up a wall the game then just crashes and stop working I most redo the mission same thing happens. I wish i pirated it, onl bought it to support the Co op feature and  Spend your money on Far cry 4 instead or some good pizza
