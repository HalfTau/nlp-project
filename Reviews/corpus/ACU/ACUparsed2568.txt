Garbage. Absolute Garbage the game itsef may even be amazing but the optimization is this is a game thats so flipping broken the devs gave up on trying to fix its ten million problems because every time they fixed one a whole new mess showed up. Sloppy sloppy game design does not do justice to the events that its supposed to be taking place around. In my opinion this is the mostpoor assassins creed game ever made and to be perfectly honest it made me lose faith in ubisoft and their entire line of games Im even sketch about buying rainbow six and any other new games because I simply cannot trust their developers to optimize it properly for PC. This game was entirely made for consoles and they pretty much did a garbage port.
