This game is beyond broken, I cannot believe the one time I preorder a game this happens. This is the image of thievery by a corporation. Ubisoft is the classic snake oil salesman. Or maybe some bait and switch. I have enjoyed the AC franchise for a long time so it is amazing to see how awful this whole experience has been. I will never be buying another Ubisoft game despite the excellent looking titles coming out in the future. If I went to a restaurant and received an uncooked/unfinished mess that didnt even ressemble what I was buying, I wouldnt only want my money back, I would also see to it that everyone I knew was aware of the standards of that business as well as never give them my business again. Thats what forces businesses to be honest. We should hold the gaming industry to the same standards we do every other.
