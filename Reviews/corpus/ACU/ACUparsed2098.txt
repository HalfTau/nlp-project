This review is based on the fact that Ive only just bought this game sale price 11 and as such I missed all the crazy bugs  glitches debacle at launch.Firstly the most noticable thing about this game is the new engine used, the game is bloody stunning compared to the previous itinerations. I have a fairly modest system comprising of an i5 2500k, 16 gb ram, GTX 780 and the game runs like butter on Ultra settings with FXAA. Ive noticed very little problems in terms of any glitches so yay for now!.The game so far pretty much runs through like any other AC game, uncover the map, collect various stuff, gain money, improve / update outfit, gain new weapons, play various missions and most importantly kill stuff.Do you like the other AC games? Do you feel like its been a while since you obsessively searched every inch of a games map searching for collectables? Do you like to stab guys with your hidden blade? If you answered yes to any of the above then get it bought.
