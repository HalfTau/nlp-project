As the game is no longer game breaking buggy, this is a pretty solid game, so please ignore some of the salt people have due to its buggy launch. The gameplay is really solid, the new free running/climbing system is wonderful, and the main mission design is great. Graphics are impeccable as well. The one place for me this falls flat is the script. The story is not that good, no were near as good as the previous games, there is barley any future segments, which is pretty annoying. I didnt really care about the characters either, and all deaths were predictable, so dont come here for the story.Instead you can come for a beautiful open world revelation Paris, with a great and open mission design and good gameplay and free running.
