I may have played only a small portion of the game, but its absolutely amazing.I recommend buying the game.Now with the modern GPUs the game runs perfectly and with almost no bugs for me.Im almost at the end of the Single Player story.God, the games beautiful, few bugs here and there but overall, its amazing.A mustbuy game in my opinion.
