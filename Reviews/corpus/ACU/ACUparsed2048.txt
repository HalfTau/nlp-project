While the game is a step down after the incredible Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, it looks nice enough when the textures load properly and runs well except for when it doesnt. The story is dull, the progression way too slow and complicated too many currencies... and the open world is more of a chore than an actual feature.The three core gameplay elements of any AC game Stealth, Parkour and Combat have been upgraded... Combat feels wrong now, the return of medicine is horrible and its just not very fun. Stealth has been improved a lot, and is now almost at the point where I would call it good. Parkour feels a little nicer, the animations and jump distances are a little over the top and you STILL GET STUCK ON DAMN CORNERS, LEAP OFF A WALL INSTEAD OF JUMP WHERE YOU WANT TO BE AND RARELY END UP DOING WHAT YOU INTENDED.Its safe to assume I dont like the game... Stop making annual games that are not very good and instead make one good game every couple of years, Ubisoft!Then I found the coop element in AC Unity... And now I love the game.Its just damn fun to run around rooftops with a friend, carefully plan synchronised takedowns only to mess up horribly and if one of you has been playing the game for long enough, a low level player can be dragged through a very hard mission to recieve a lot of money... Best sword on the first day? Why not! The simple fact that with the help of friends you can get good gear right away and are able to skip some of the annoying unlocks is great...On the other hand, is it really a good thing that I am glad I can SKIP parts of a game?
