I feel strongly about this enough to chime in. I normally give games the benefit of the doubt but this game is a horrible mess. Its beautiful, but broken, like a macaw whose wings had been trod on by the King of France.I highly advise everyone to save your money, do not support this, let Ubisoft learn from these stupid decisions, and move on to better games.Hopefully Ubisoft will patch the game in the future. Unlikely, but theres always hope. Less hope here than the revolutionaries had, ironically.
