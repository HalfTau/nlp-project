Crashes way too much too really be playable right now.Wait for at least 5 to 10 patches before playing this game.Crashing is the main issues and maine reason that you should stay away from this game till it is fixed.My Minor Issues are that you have at least a few events that take you out of feeling like your really an Assassin in Old Paris and also that this game would be A LOT better if you could play the main story line CoOp with others...Borderlands Style.Summery dont buy this game for a good time, till they fix the damn crashing issues.Once they fix that it would be worth your money a lot more.
