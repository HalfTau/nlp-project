So far the game has been running pretty smoothly for me with occasional stutters here and there as well as fps drop in a few areas. There may be a few bugs and glitches that occured but nothing too game breaking and even if there is bugs and glitches, its very subtle. Unity for me so far has been way more enjoyable than Black Flag. Optimization wise its not too shabby. With my 15 4460 and R9 380 4GB, I am able to set everything too its highest settings apart from HBAO, PCSS and MSAA, all of which really hits the fps HARD. If I were to use the ultra high preset in game, my fps will be around 30ish. With the ultra high preset and turing the above mentioned settings off, my fps rose to 4560ish depending on the location and for me thats pretty good and fyi its on a 900p panel. Overall, unity really stood out to me with its beautiful graphics and enjoyable free running. Really good deal since its 50 off as well.
