I have played through all the AC games and just finished Unity. There is something I want to make clear. This game is good. HOWEVER! It is a pain to get it to play.I had to turn off all my startup programs  Turn off Uplays overlay  Turn off cloud saves  Make a new admin user on my computer  and other stuff to get it to even start Things like turning off over clocking on my GTX 980 Ti Kngpn gfx cardIs it worth buying, sure, it might work for you. lol Wait for a sale and get it. Its a fun play and I got it cheap so I dont mind. If you dont know much about computers, get the game, try to get it to start, if you hit problems just get a refund from Steam. Youll know if youre going to have problems within the first 30mins Or at least from what I know.The game plays well, and I had fun. Thats what counts. If youve played the other AC games, then get this. If you havent, there are better onces to get. Go for Black Flag before this.
