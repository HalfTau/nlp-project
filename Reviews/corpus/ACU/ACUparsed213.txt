Safe to say, I did not like the game at first. I bought it to complete my collection and tried to like it. I processed until after sequence four. The controls are hard to remember with all the new stuff when only having played the ezio trio, black flag, rogue. And when I got stuck on dead kings right after having completed sequence four since the mission starts from the beginning you fast travel to it youre stuck from the beginning till you finish that sequence first I just gave up on the game.Months went by and I got myself a controller to utilize on a few pc games. I remembered that I still had this just lying around and just decided to give it another try. I deleted my old save file and began all over again. This time, with the controller, the way of playing made a lot more sense to me and I began to actually like the game hence why I played around 50 hours the last week.The story is good, recommend it after having played rogue since you just go on from there.controls are in my opinion crap with keyboard and mouse, get yourself a controller if you want to play this optimally.
