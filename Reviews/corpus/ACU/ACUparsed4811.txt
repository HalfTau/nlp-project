Unless they do some major patches, its kind of screwed right now for the PC. Ive played it on the PS4 and its a fun game. I really like it. But, my main platform is the PC, and that is what I bought, the PC version STEAM version, but at the moment, its unplayable. Half the time it wont even get past the title screen. When it does get past the title screen it was laggy, even on low graphics. I have a GeForce GT 720M in my laptop. Not top of the line, but definitely not a CRAP GPU. Since Patch 2 was released its even worse. Also, with patch 2 my synchronized game ended up getting reset. So, I guess I need to start over. Havent played much since patch 2, as it was far to laggy and i was annoyed with my reset game. which BTW, ubisoft hasnt even replied to my help request about. Im sure they are busy, but a simple, well get back to you when we fix our SNAFU,  would have been fine.
