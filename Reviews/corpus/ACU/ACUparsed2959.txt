assassins creed Unity was to be the last title from Ubisoft Year and Game of the Year. But in my opinion and many others opinion, it did not work. Very good graphics. And the game runs smoothly and without lags at least for me. There are many people who complain that the game always gets stuck and died nice story but not the best in the series of multiplayer is excellent. The main thing that destroys the game is the bugs. There are a lot of bugs even after a lot of patches are not fixed. I do not even have to explain about the bugs you can just go to Youtube and search .assassins Creed Unity bugs and immediately you will find a lot of results that would explain what I mean. The game does not even compare to the rest of the series and it seems the creators of the game had not even played it before they took it. If you even think to buy the game make sure that you have nVidia GeForce GTX 700 series or higher.I personally do not recommend the game. Especially not for  60. And if I know how the game failed I would not buy it in the first place
