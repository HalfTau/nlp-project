Ignore all the previous comments as they are unedited , this game after the update is more polished than when it launched.I really enjoyed this game , its fun and thrilling. My favorite AC game yet .This game has a kindda ok story , hard combat so that its challenging and best of all coop mode.So just try it when it goes on sale or something, its a game that i dont regret buying but idk about u.Dont buy the dlc tho.
