For AC fans, you have to play this game. However, compared to other AC games, this is by far the weakest of the actual titles, not the minititles.The game is finally patched, allowing you to explore and collect everything without using any cell phone apps or doing any stupid 3rd party application BS. That being said, collecting everything has proven much more tedius than previous versions of the game. The combat feels more wonky than usual and unlike black flag, there are no more naval battles sadly.In general, the story is good and it keeps you immersed in the AC universe.
