Oh boy......i have really pushed through the game with the mayjor frame rait issues, and im glad to see ubisoft was trying to do something but honestly i think they have given up with pc. But when it comes to gameplay i think unity is a very fun game to play with your friends, ive been doing loads of co op and i enjoy it, but any fun i have is taken away by the 15 to 20 fps i get at the highest, and its really just a waist of a good game. If you have the hardware for this game to run at max fps, thain i say get it. But you dont make a game that reqires the player to wait for a patch or download and buy new graphic cards or whatever! you make the game playable for the person giving you 60 for it, for their enjoyment. so in the end sadly im going to say that i do not recomend this game if youre looking for what you where expecting out of it.
