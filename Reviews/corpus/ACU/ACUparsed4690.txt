The worst Assassins Creed game is in the series.Pro graphics looks truly next gen, but not for the peasants redesigned combat system Elise.Cons The story in this game is a total disaster, the writers absolutely have no idea what to write about in the ACs universe without Corey May No modern days gameplay The game is designed life F2P for which you actually paid a lot and that things demands even MORE No attempts to use the French Revolution timing for the good of the games story, its just a noise background with no sense, the people of that time almost not in use at all Bugs, a lot of bugs, the QA did absolutely nothing Uplay itself, guys, learn to code your making Uplay offlay boosting up 10fps plus no freezes redesigned parkour system requires a lot of more testing and programming, the avatar just doing what he isnt supposed to do, and the movement, this kind of the teleport jumps, oh boy, this is  idea of forcing the player to play low value products Initiates, Companion App to be able to perfect the original product.Verdict No go, never buy that thing. Only if you are big fan of the AC then only after 45 paths at some sells for 15 tops.
