EnglishFor this game, if you do  not pay too much attention on the opitmize, you will have an amzing experence. Huge and vivid city is the advantage. This game is much better than AC4 or AC3. My frends and i enjoy this game so much that we have spent  more than 4 hours a day.However, the game requires highrank computer to play it if you want enjoy the game. Form my laptop and desktop testing, an 680M or better is the min requirment and an gtx660 for destop but only for 900P.For those who does not like the game, i had to say getting a better PC is more important to complain about the game here. Ubisoft had already told you that the min requiement is 680 with core i5 2500k! it looks like someone buy the medicine for children and complian about the useless of medicine. In on world, before you buy the game, check your pc spece for not regretting paying the money.ACACNPCAI40GB680M660900P68017bugU
