Former review removed.Disclaimer Spoilers ahead. Not that it matters.After buying it on PS4, and Playing through the entire game. I feel its only right to tell you all the truth.This game is not worth the money theyre asking.Allow me to summarize the entirety of Assassins Creed Unity. Because you know what? Theres literally no reason to complain about spoilers here, not if youre a fan of the original series.Premise of the gameGo find out if this guy found a sage ancient alien dude reborn as a human so we can get to his body before the templars do.Main game12 frickton sequences of annoying endless objectives and difficult enemies.EndingOH HAHA ARNO DUMPED THE BODY IN WITH ALL THE THOUSANDS OF SKELETONS UNDER PARIS IN THE CATACOMBS. LOOK AT THAT. WE DIDNT NEED YOU AFTER ALL.Credits roll.No modern gameplay.Pointless main story.Absolutely no substantial reason as to why this game was so insanely hyped as the next big step in the Assassins Creed Story.Congratulations. We all jumped the bandwagon, and bought a  spinoff for no reason other than good combat mechanics and multiplayer coop.Oh. Look at that, we bought CoD.Mind you, Ive been a huge fan of this series since its conception,Hell, I even love Assassins Creed III. Which is widely accepted as one of the worst games in the series.But you know what? No. I ing loved Assassins Creed III. Handholding and all.But this game? . This game was the biggest waste of my time.Ive never been so disappointed by an Assassins Creed game. In my entire life.Oh, and Elise dies. Thats right. The great big lovely romance Ubisoft promised us? Barely touched upon, and when it finally starts to get rolling? She gets killed. Whoopdeefrikkindoo.
