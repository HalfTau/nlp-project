I want to like this game.  The only thing my PC lacked that did not exceed the recommended spec was my graphics card, so i bought another one.  I was hyped that I would be able to play on pretty high settings.It is clear that alot of time and detail was put into it and that it will be a great game, someday.  But I am writing this now.  The game is basicaly unplayable past a hour or so.  Yes you can play to some extent, but the game relies on precise moves to do things like get in crowds and look around doors I play mostly stealth, not bam bam, however with the frame issues you can be walking along, then all the sudden looking straight up to the sky, or walk into a wall, or the other direction.  I have tried all the suggestions in the forums, even ones that do not make sense have not disco my ethernet.  it seems to be a memory leak becuase whatever it do, it runs better after the game restarts, but gets worse and worse until it just becomes uplayable do to the lag.  restarting does not always help, either, so that may kill my memory leak theory.  coop is currently not doable.This game joins X rebirth and a few others in my will probably never finish becuase of the bad feelings catagory.story  decentmain charactor  likable sorry Connergameplay  fair sure to get better, but...graphics   awesome, while not moving, turning, thinking, blinking...oh another thing, I wish they would not make the notification that I have more skill points to spend come up constantly...i mean, i know, i am saving them for a better skill.  i can not read half the descriptions because it comes up so often
