Game was crashing every 15 minutes, regardless of whatever was happening in the game. After discussion with a Ubisoft rep, weve finally managed to find the source of the problem the XAudio27.dll file in the driveWindowsSystem32 folder was causing the crash every time. No other hardware was causing any issues.Renaming the file fixed the constant crashing. However, it now causes the Ubisoft logo sounds to stop playing but otherwise the game works fine. Sometimes the game recreates this file so I have to redo the process again.Honestly still cant recommend the game but at least I get to play it and I do like the AC worlds and story.
