Im a HUGE assassins creed fan. Like mid night launch to all of the games fan. This one I did preorder stayed up till 12 to play, yes it has a 37.7 GB install but that is what these next gen games are coming too so I wasnt mad at all about that. Get in the game start playing soild 3040 fps not 60 like on black flag but playable. started it up everything was going fine.. Or so I thought.I unlockled something in the player store and when I got to check it out my game freezes. I sigh but then remember, hey this game is only a couple hours old give it a break. So I did painly closing out of my game and the mission I was in. I go on again and try to do it again and same thing. This happen about 56 times, to the point where I had to uninstall it and reinstall it in hoping that it would fix the problem but it didnt. I would say oh this is playable but to be honest its not.Im trying to get my friends into Assassins Creed I show them this, and they laugh come on ubisoft.And people say oh when they fix the game Im going to remove my review but Im keeping this up just because they fix it doesnt mean we forget how they presented it to us. Those first impersitions make a mark. I like the game a lot better now.
