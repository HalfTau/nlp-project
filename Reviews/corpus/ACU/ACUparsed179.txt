If the Steam Awards had a category  Best recovery by the ttlle, without any recognition by the game community, I feel it would be a tossup between this game and Arkham Knight.Assassins Creed Unity has reignited my enthusiasm for the series, I was uninspired about the pirate antics in Black Flag and having heard bad things about Unity, decided to skip ahead to play some of Assassins Creed Rogue. Both titles left me with a pronounced feeling of Meh...I think Assassins Creed Unity suffered from a doubleedged sword of problems, it was genuinely rushed out, Laden with bugs, glitches and poor optimization, which to Ubisofts credit were later corrected....  however the perceptual damage was done.The other problem, which may in fact have been far worse, was the 2014 release date of this particular game, graphically gorgeous and therefore demanding High resources, the average game rig at the time just wasnt up to the challenge. This was the first AC title of the current console generation, perhaps at the time Ubisoft was too ambitious.Now in 2017 weve seen an explosion in GPU technology with affordable releases from both Nvidia and AMD that would have run in the thousand dollar range just a couple years ago. With the GTX 10xx series, Pascal processing has given hordes of users capability they did not even suspect they would have a couple years ago.So now, the game runs beautifully, at least on my computer.I have read reviews stating that the gameplay was stale and the story uninspired, in my opinion I find those statements to be inaccurate. Perhaps the reviewers view those components of the game in an unfair light due to functionality issues in the early days of the release.As of right now this game is 100 must buy, one of the lessons that I have applied to most Ubisoft titles is it season pass content is generally not all that wonderful anyway, so the absence of it with this title is no great loss.I fully intend to immerse myself in Revolutionary French life, and for the first time since perhaps Assassins Creeds Ezio golden age, I will find myself hunting down all those objectives collectibles and pouring perhaps hundreds of hours into the game.Should this be the case, who needs a damn season pass anyway?
