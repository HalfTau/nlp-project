Until I saw the Steam Winter Sales 33 discount on AC Unity, I wasnt really thinking of buying the game following the horrible reviews and the ridiculous requirements for running the game both in minimal settings and recommended.But here I am, writing this review after spending quite some time in AC Unitys Paris and honestly  Enjoying any minute of it.Assassins Creed Unity, at least after Patch 4, is a playable game, not polished till the end of its details Not graphicwise, but I can truely say, I am overwhelmed.Hope you people liked this review and helped you in decide whether you want the game or not. If not, pick it up later when bugs are fixed, but the game is a mustplay.
