This game is by far the best ac game that I have ever played... if you can get past the lag/glitch issues.At first when i started it, the game was all pixelated and unplayable, however with the help of Nvidias GeForce Experience, I simply pressed Optimize and bam it worked like a charm. No bugs/glitches or falling through the floor.The dodge and parry implementations are so wonderful.The customization and skill unlocking/level ups are essential. It makes you feel like a true apprentice assassin, on a journey to save France and become a Master Assassin.At the start you are really fragile. Any gunshot may/will one shot you and you can no longer fight 10 guards at once unlike the other games. This forces you to think instead of just running in like the Hulk and killing everyone unlike the previous games.The coop is wonderful and it works perfectly. Just seeing 3 other assassins freerunning everywhere is just so awesome. Not to mention the moments when youre one hit away from dying and then you are saved by a phantom blade shot.Overall, the game is superb and more realistic. Youll have a great time playing this game if you can get past the lag/fps issues.
