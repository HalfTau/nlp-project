To start off I would like to say that Unity could have been one of the greatest games of 2014.............. but no, framerate so low even cutscenes bob around like a Hula girl on your Comby van dashpad. Glitches and bugs that even if there were major patches put in place, you would probably find it hard to return to the game in the first place. Finally terrible gameplay mechanics, you feel like a puppeteer controlling a doll, nothing feels fluent or realistic in controlling Arno.. and his ability to hover across thin air to ledges or opposite roofs made me question my eye sight, but i digress either purchase fc4 or preorder gta 5 this is a very sad failure on ubis side my apologies.All the best everyone.
