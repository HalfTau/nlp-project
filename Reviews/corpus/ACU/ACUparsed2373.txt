Even after all the updates, bug fixes etc, it still has a few glitches here and there. I was walking down the main street, minding my business and in the corner of my eye there was a woman who jumped thorugh a solid wall. I guess it just makes the game funnier. Apart from all that I 100 agree to getting this game thats if you can run it of course.
