Ubisoft, you sly devil you.  I gave you 60 dollars and you handed me a piece of trash.Just to be constructive I will give some pros and cons.ProsBeautiful game as far as environments and architecture goes.Heavy character customization.Ubisoft finally cracked the code!  No one likes playing outside the Animus, instead they just give you some short narrated cutscenes inbetween chapters.ConsVery unlikable main character with predictable motives.Side characters are boring compared to Black Flag.Controls are extremely twitchy.  With the game being far more stealth oriented than previous games, this is a major hinderance.Certain parts of the game are only accessable online, so if you have a bad internet connection you are really missing out on a lot of content.Youd think a game with such a successful pedigree would of been more quality.4/10Im retiring my hidden blades for good this time.
