I would recommend this game, but this game does need a LOT of fixing and patching to do. Animations, combat, parkour has been improved so much and has won me over, but like always the story is still lacking a bit and its a ubisoft game so BUGS AND GLITCHES ARE IN THIS GAME and there are also frame rate problems too. All this would probably get patched soon but i would recommend you to get this game after stuffs been fixed. There is so much to do in this open world and a ton of customization and all the positives in the game have won me over from the negatives.
