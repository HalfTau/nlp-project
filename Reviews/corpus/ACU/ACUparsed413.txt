This game takes some grinding to be good. If you buy and complete Dead kings. Youll be instopible when you play the main story line. Because youll have Sugers Sword and an Axe that shoots cherry bombs. So, do i reccomend this game? Yeah, i actually do. But theres a few glitches and Parkour te. But over all, if you buy dead kings and get the weapons from completing it. The game is actually fun. If you decide to not buy Dead Kings and grind. Youll feel like uninstalling after about 4 hours of gameplay.
