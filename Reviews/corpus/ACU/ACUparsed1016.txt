A solid entry in the series, it doesnt really do anything particularly innovative or exciting but also largely avoids doing anything terrible as well.  Ultimately pretty forgettable, the plot both future and past feels like an afterthought with a lot of hanging threads left behind.  What it has going for it is a return to the giant buildings of the earlier games, and its a treat to rush around the rooftops of Paris and along its clogged streets.  The backdrop of the French Revolution is fascinating if a little underutilized, and they couldnt resist filling every single encyclopedia entry with witty comments by the endlessly annoying future techguy.  The game looks gorgeous though the hair looks dated already, and there is far too much in the way of equipment/abilities locked away behind utterly irrelevant social settings/multiplayer aspects that you can safely ignore entirely.Overall its a perfectly reasonable game to play but nothing you should go out of your way to bother with.  If you can get it cheap or as part of a package deal, sure go ahead and get it.  But if you just wanna skip to AC Syndicate youre missing absolutely nothing either gameplay or plotwise.  Its a pretty skippable if inoffensive game.
