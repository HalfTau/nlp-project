When I saw all the ads for this I was so excited. After III and Black Flage, I was hoping for and Assassins Creed game that went back to the formula, where you actualy played as an assassin. The game is gorgeous, and pretty fun, but thats about all I can say to this dissapointment. For one, it is overpacked with useless collectables that clutter up the map, and are just overwhelming. Second, the game is plagued with so many bugs that it becomes nearly unplayable. Third...wait...I cant say anything about the story or characters, because I got so fed up with restarting the game after every gamebreaking glitch that I never got more than seven hours into it. Anyway, take that for what its worth.
