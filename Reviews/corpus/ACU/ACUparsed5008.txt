The game it self is amazing i just made a video of it and with my recording program it doesnt affect the Frame rate but the game it self does! But aside that i just get thrown into the game with like you are playing a templar and you are now gotta kill a assassin okay sure but why? And i have no idea what happened in the other games my own fault but aside that the game it self looks great and i cant wait for the other sequences that i am going to play and i personally reccommend it!
