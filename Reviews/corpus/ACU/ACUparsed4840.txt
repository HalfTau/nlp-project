Absolutely unplayable. Buyer beware. Technical issues plague this game leaving it in the single digits for frames per second. Glitches galore, horibly optimized. Not to mention a crap microtransaction store which only adds insult to injury. Ubisoft recomends pulling your ethernet cable out and disconnecting from the network to play its builtfromthegroundupcenteredaroundcoop game. Ubisoft needs to wake up and get their house in order. Avoid this game and all Ubisoft games like the plague.
