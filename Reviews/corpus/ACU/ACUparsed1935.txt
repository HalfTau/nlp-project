It might not work even if your PC is able to in theory run it at max settings, because of the ing ACU.exe has stopped working error, in my case i tried every possible fix or workaround suggested and no luck, do yourselves a favor and dont buy this in PC, buy it in console if you want but i assure you even, if youre able to play, before, now and many years in the future its going to be a broken game, not even worth buying during at least a 99 sale.
