Only recommended for Assassins Creed fans, otherwise look into other games. I havent tried multiplayer, yet but thatll probably go under ProsProsBeautiful graphicsVery fluid gameplay that favors stealthCustomization optionsA lot of side missionsFinally added a stealth optionConsGameplay feels restrictiveSide missions get repetitive and pointlessElise can be pretty damn dumbArno can be pretty damn dumbStory feels underdevelopedYoure basically trapped in Paris No varied locationsOverall, good game. I liked Black Flag a lot more, though, because it felt more open.
