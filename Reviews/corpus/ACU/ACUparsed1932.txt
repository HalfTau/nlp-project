Three years ago I went to Paris and I visited Palace of Versailles. I was quite intrigued by the idea of playing an Assassin wandering aroung that Palace. Living the 1789. As a big Assassins Creed fan, I installed the game and I started to play it.During the story, I ended up stuk in wooden shelves a couple of times Arno was stuck there and I had to reload the game again in order to keep on playing.In the end, it cost me more this game than visiting the real Palace in France, but if you like the idea of being a shelf, this is the game for you.
