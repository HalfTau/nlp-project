If Ubisoft fixes the hundreds of bugs and optimizes this game properly, I might change my mind. As it stands, the six hours Ive put into this game so far have been mainly spent troubleshooting alt tabbed. The Coop is brokenMost hyped up part of the game, the game stutters even on minimum settings, and its just overall crap. I wont even bother addressing the gameplay changes they put in that I dont like. Dont waste your money on it. Wait till ubisoft patches it a few times, and then consider borrowing some game time from a friend who got suckered into buying it.Update The game has been patched three times since launch, one month ago. I still cannot get it to run smoothly. About every 23 seconds, the game will freeze for around a second. While it is frozen, any button or mouse movement you were doing at the time of freezing will be maintained, and sometimes amplified. This means that while the game is stuttering like this, controlling the camera say during an escape or combat sequence will be completely impossible I often find myself being turned around in an escape segment due to the camera flipping out, or I will suddenly be looking up at the sky while trying to counter multiple enemies. It can also result in missed counters, or missing an aimed shot necessary to maintain stealth. Thats my largest complaint at this time. They fixed the nightmare faces bug, and a few others. If they fix this stuttering crap, I will grudgingly give this a thumbs up, but until then, do not buy.Update 2 They patched it, and it still doesnt run smoothly. If anything it now runs worse.
