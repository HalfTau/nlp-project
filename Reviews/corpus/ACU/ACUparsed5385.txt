Well for me I dont see the glitches or the framerate issues on ultra High that some others do. Did they patch this piece ofI joined the game late so have no idea.The killer for me is all the steps backwward they took.The Fights are sloooooower.The graphics even on ultra high look worse than the last game  which I really enjoyed The amount of detail they put into the buildings and the amount of AI Peds is totally uncalled for and ridiculously stupid in action.The implementation of near and far characters graphics is laughable.I have a vid showing  the main character stationary and moving the camera left and right shows clearly that they dont just increase the graphics, they completly swap the model as you approach.I thouth Ac3 was bad but man this is 100 times worse and I hated ac3 but loved Black flag HINT UBICRAPNo amount of patching can fix this game.This calls for a complete rewriting of code which they will not do.Write this one off.Face it Ubi you promised something you couldnt deliver. Wait, where did I see that before?Hmmm!
