Quite possibly one of my favorite games. Assassins Creed Unity has amazing graphics, interesting game play and story line. The CoOp feature is new and something I havent played in any other game like assassins creed and its one of my favorite activities in the game. 7/10 for game play. 8/10 for graphics. I havent run into any glitches yet so other players might find the game a little different.
