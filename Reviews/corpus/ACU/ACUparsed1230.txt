TLDR Buy any other AC title, thats more worth your money and time.I cannot in good faith recommend this game.A bit of background information. Ive played every big AC title since we first ran around Jerusalem with Altair and the franchise and since come thus far that I feel its fair to start comparing the games amongst each other. I did not enjoy Assassins Creed Unity as much as I did the other games.There are many aspects of the game that other reviewers point that are fine, and I agree. The story is okay, the environment is beautiful and prerevolutionary Paris  some Helix rift missions during the Belle Epoque, WWII and medieval Paris are a wonder to explore. But the gameplay is I found myself swearing at my computer when Arno wouldnt climb up the ing building, or parkour in a completely  direction while escaping 10 enemies.Combat did not feel as smooth as in the previous games. Where you could hold off 6 men in Black Flag, here it just became a game of twister trying to dodge all the ing bullets while dodging all the swords, only to get shot down by a sniper that was on some rooftop.The stealthiness I found wasnt implemented well that I silently killed one guy of the two and the other is randomly alerted. The air/ground double kills often felt it only worked occasionally, which led to some extremely loud What the s and alerted my housemates to come walking into my room taunting me with a U mad bro?And I was mad, because I thoroughly enjoyed every single AS game I had played until this one. I enjoyed exploring Italy with Ezio. I was psyched with the introduction of the Brotherhood mechanic. I was amazed when you could upgrade Ezios house. I was visibly stunned by the huge world of AC 3 and being able to explore so much of Colonial America. I loved being able to test my captains skills and take on the sea in Black Flag.But not this time. Because I did not enjoy AC Unity as much as I did her previous installments.
