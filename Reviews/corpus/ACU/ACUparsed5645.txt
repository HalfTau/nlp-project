I love this game. Arno seems to be the literal embodiment of disbelief and makes various comments on how silly a situation seems to be. This game is a throwback to how Assassins Creed 2 felt in its scope and scale and while some are having frame problems for some reason the game never drops below 50 frames that I noticed whilst playing. Id like to add to all the people deciding whether to buy this game or not If you like Assassins Creed and dont mind dropping frames buy this. If you are unsure whether the game will work properly on your system wait until it goes on sale on the December sale. By then it will be sure to have had many patches to it and should run better.Sidenote to Ubi bashers. How many of you thumbs down positive reviews just because you hate Ubisoft?
