I am a huge Assassins Creed fan and was not dissapointed with this game. Sure, it takes a pretty good PC to run but it is an amazing game all the same. The open world Paris is stunning graphically and is very rich and alive. The streets are filled with NPCs that act in their own unique ways which allow for a different experience every time you play. The main character is charasmatic and an all around badass. The character customization is a huge improvment from the previous games and really give you the freedom to make your own assassin. With only a few drawbacks like some bugs and a couple removed features from the previous games, this game is a must buy and loads of fun.EDIT I 100 change my view on this game. As said above, I am a huge Assassins Creed fan, having played every title before this. The reason i reviewed this game positively was because I wanted to beleive this game was good. Problem is, after coming back to it, its not at all a good game. I have Black Flag for the xbox and it is 150 better than this game. Go buy that over this bug filled pile of garbage.Unity had so much promise. So much ground breaking content which could have easily made this a GOTY. Ubisoft really messed up however, by putting features in the game which require you to spend  REAL LIFE MONEY. And with all the companion app t and stupid website nonsense, it just seemed like Ubisoft was trying to rob you. The optimization for this game is really where Ubi just dissapointed everyone. Steady framerate, at any graphical setting, is none existent and with constant mesh problems it just makes the amazing openworld Paris look like trash.Trust me, as well as a lot of other people, when i say do not buy this game. Ubisoftthe bed. If your looking to get an AC game, get Black Flag. And if you dont mind games that are a few years older, AC Brotherhood and AC2 are well worth the money.
