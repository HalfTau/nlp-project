I understand that a lot of people are having issues with this game... so I guess Im one of the lucky ones. Yes, the game has several performances issues, but I havent encountered any real bugs and the game runs on my system between 5070 fps at 1440p with everything and maxed out, except for AA which is set at MSAA x 2. Here are my system specs for comparisoni7 5960x 3.5 ghz16gb DDR4GTX 780 SLIThe game is running on an SSD.The graphics are absolutely stunning... seriously. This is the first game I have played where I am still in awe of the graphics especially the lighting effects many hours I think Im at about 21 hours at this point after starting the game. I usually have a honeymoon phase with game graphics where Ill take my time at first to just enjoy the effects but then quickly ignore them and concentrate on finishing the game  not with this one! The level of detail is just insane!! Gameplaywise this is definitely the best Assassins Creed yet though I do miss the pirate ships!! The overhauled controls are much better, as is the combat system. I find the story to be great and much more entertaining than past AC games. I you are a fan of the AC series or you havent played the game since AC3, please give this one a chance!If you have the system and luck to run it, definitely give this game a shot. You probably wont regret it!
