Note this is a gameplay review not a performance reviewI have played a bit of assassins creed unity and quite frankly the gameplay is fantastic and is a great improvement from black flag dont get me wrong black flag was great and the environment was good but this game has a completely different feel to it and isnt a bad game I think its worth getting from a gameplay perspective but unfortunately the performance really does let this game down and i hope in the nearby future that ubisoft adds some patches that will help the performance of this enticing installment of the assassins creed series
