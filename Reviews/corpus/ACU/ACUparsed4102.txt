Big fan of the AC series. 4 was a great game. Never written a review before but this game was a big let down. I did not run into any glitches, but overall the story was weak, the gameplay too short, and replayability was very small/limited/not fun. It just wasnt a 60 game. If you really want to play it, wait for a Steam sale under 35. I feel like I was mislead in advirtising and in the Ubisoft promises. This is my first review and my first negative review.
