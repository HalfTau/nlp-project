I must be one of the few people who did not encounter a ton of bugs, and the ones I did come across were not game breaking. I managed to complete the game without falling through the ground, but about 5 minutes after the campaign was complete, I did.From my perspective, this game was fun and I enjoyed it. However, taking others feedback into account,I would recommend waiting to buy it on sale or at least until enough time has passed for patches to come out keep an eye out on feedback on forums to know if the patches fix certain major complaints, but I still would recommend the game especially if you are a fan of the franchise. Please make sure to keep the PC specs in mind prior to purchase.
