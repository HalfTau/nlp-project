I Thankfully have not had as many issues as others on here, but this game is VERY poorly optimized. The Recommended Hardware is ludicrous, Frames tend to drop alot during the Cutscenes, and running on MediumHigh settings i barely hit 40fps, which constantly drops. Unless your PC is already mammoth, i would not recommend spending your money on this until they fix it. It was pushed to soon for release, and at this quality it shouldnt have even thought about being Ported to PC. The Gameplay is fun, But the performance absolutely kills it. Black flag was probably my GOTY, I loved it, because it ran well and the gameplay was outstanding. This Unity does have very fun Gameplay, but the quality and optimization are abysmal, I would recommend waiting for Far Cry 4. Dont waste your money on this until they can fix it.
