If UbiSoft is guilty of anything it is their timing because they dared release AC Unity a couple of years ahead of its time without including options to make the game playable on the average PC. If you are lucky enough to have/beg or borrow the hardware necessary to play such a demanding game with everything ON, the graphics are.   God I hope that formatting renders...When the first Toy Story movie came out a decade or so ago, pundits said maybe tongue in cheek that One day, PC/Console/Virtual Reality games will have the processing power to generate graphics like that in REAL TIME!!  After playing AC Unity on an admittedly highend Intel i5, 16 GB RAM, SSD game drive and Nvidia 980 GTX last night I realized I had just witnessed theToyStorymoment. For the first time in history, real time PC gaming graphics finally match the mythical Toy Story Movie bar.To be clear, AC Unity does not look remotely like Toy Story. What AC Unity has accomplished though is to create a game with graphics that appear more amazingly real than the Toy Story movie graphics appeared amazingly realistic.  This isand even though there exist more I dont care how bad your ebola is, THE GAME SHIPS TOMORROW glitches to do Skyrim proud, the gamebe patched, it is already breathtaking just to watch, and oh yeah, its a mighty damn fun game.I would caution  attempting to play this game at resolutions greater than 1920 X 1200 unless you are running a great deal more GPU. Perhaps dual Titans, Ive no idea.If youve got the hardware, ACU is just plain Awesome awesome awesome, glitches and all. Mortage the house, the car, the kids well maybe not the kids because THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING FOLKS!!!!
