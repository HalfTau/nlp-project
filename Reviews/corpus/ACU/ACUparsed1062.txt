I would like to buy a drink for everyone in the art department.I would also like to line up the department that dealt with the controls and kick each one of them in the bs!Seriously, this game is beautiful and not other game has EVER created such a convincing city environment. Just walking through the squalor and spleandour of Paris, watching people go about their business is a real delight.But then you have Arno. Honestly, trying to get him to do anything you want is just sheer frustration. Especially when you have to move quickly otherwise you will be spotted by guards.Im playing this using an Xbox controller.Ive played most of the other Assassins Creed games and havent really had a problem but this game really makes me angry at times. Its really such a shame as I want to like it.The main quests were interesting but there is a LOT of filler in this game. Fine if you like that kind of thing but I can only take so much of finding chests, assassinating random people and tackling pickpockets.One other aspect that seemed odd to me. You can now solve murder crimes and get rewarded for locking up the culprit. Great idea but lets not lose sight of the fact that I probably killed several hundred people during my time of play. At one point, I killed maybe 20 guys just to get my watch back! A bit hypocritical to go pointing fingers when someone murders just one person.Im giving it a thumbs up because it gave me over 30 hours of gameplay which I largely enjoyed but seriously, the controls are problematic.
