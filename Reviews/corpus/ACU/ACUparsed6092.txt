Ive waited for months for this game to release and now that it has I must say Im disappointed. Like many other reviewers, Im getting terrible lag spikes. My computer was specifically bought so that I could play games like this easily and so far its been a regretable experience. Within the first five minutes of the game I dropped frames, glitched through the ground, and saw terrible graphical glitching and tearing. One the third mission where youre chasing the man down, any crowded areas dropped me to about 10 fps and usually lead to a desyncronization or dropped me through the map entirely resulting in the same thing. At some points, it will run perfectly well, but only if there are no or few other NPCs nearby. The prerendered CGI cutscenes looked good when they worked, but most of the time they didnt. Until Ubisoft corrects this, I cant recommend this game. 2/10 until they fix this, and thats probably being generous.SpecsIntel Core I74700MQ  3.3 GHz with Turbo Boost, 8 GB RAM, NVidia GeForce Gt 740m graphics
