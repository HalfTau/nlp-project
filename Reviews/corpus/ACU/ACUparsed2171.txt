I was a bit leary of this game with all of the negative reviews out about it. However I picked it up cheap on a steam sale because I am a big fan of the series. I have not gotten a single graphics glitch on it, and it runs mostly smoothly late into the game. The controls are a bit sticky, but nothing new to the series as there has always been a problem with the controls figuring out what you want your character to do lol.I have read a lot of reviews complaining that its the same gathering game and climbing tall buildings... Yes it is an Assassins Creed game they are about collecting tropheys, stealth, fighting, Assassinating people, and completing the little in game events. This is what the series is about. Call of Duty you are going to have a gun and go shoot people. That is what we enjoy about the games. Odds are if you enjoyed the other games in the series you will enjoy this one.I really like the games protaginist Arno, he is a likeable character. It has a decent storyline and once again I have fun the the period of time and the setting. I really like the visuals in this game. In short if you like Assassins Creed you will like this game.
