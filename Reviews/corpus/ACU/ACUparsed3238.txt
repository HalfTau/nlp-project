Played this game with 2 GTX 670 FTW 2GB in SLI and it was utterly unplayable. Fps was fine but the stuttering....oh the stuttering was unbearable. Upgraded to a single MSI GTX 980 and this game now runs compleley maxed out at 6080fps. Its butter. Super smooth experience with no hiccups what so ever. Long story short, the game is rather fun, the story is good, Arno is extremely likeable imo, and its one of the best looking games Ive ever playedbesides Ryse. IF you have the hardware, go for it. If you dont, wait until you do. If you have SLI and have no plans on changing that, RUN FROM THIS GAME AND NEVER STOP.EDIT Adding full system specs for reference.Gigabyte Z77XD3Hi73770K 4.3Ghz16 GB Corsair Vengeance 1866MhzMSI Gaming GTX980 4GBSamsung EVO 250GB SSDWD 1TB HDDAsus VG248QE 144Hz MonitorRunning on Windows 7
