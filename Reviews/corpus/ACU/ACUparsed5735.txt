playing with two r9290x on ultra 2560x1440p on ultra with 2x AA getting 3545 fps.. some reason vsync makes it glitch out when turned off..  plays pretty smooth but game freezes on load screen right after you get blamed for a murder and you get knocked out by the guards.. im soo madd im not redownloading 55gbs... digital copies should be discounted since we have to use our internet to download the whole game and the money we save ubi soft from makeing hard copies...
