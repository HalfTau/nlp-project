This game is the weakest chapter in the Assassins Creed Saga. Although most of the launch bugs have been fixed the game has other numerous issues. The movement of our hero in the city can be problematic to say the least there were times when he got stuck going around a fountain like an idiot or unable to climb a climbable building. However one of the biggest dissappointments, for me at least, was the side quests which are repetitive and boringrecover stuff from 34 different locations and bring them back or steal stuff from 34 guys again and again and again. As for the main story its really quite predictable anyone can forsee the surprise ending from the middle of the game.
