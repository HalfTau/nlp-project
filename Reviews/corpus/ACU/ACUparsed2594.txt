Came back and tried the game after I couldnt stand the majority of glitches when it was first released and I had played it around eighteen hours. Compared to when it was first put out alot of big improvements. But it still has alot of bugs including the main story arc. And how the character still has some major difficulty when it comes to just running across buildings has me screaming in frustration every once in a while. I would not recommend this game unless your paying five dollars for it. I like the series and enjoy the game but the way it was released and how it still has some major glitches makes me think you shouldnt waste more then five dollars on a game that is clearly not finished. At this point I dont even understand the story... is there even a story? I prefer to think not because if there was they would be failing at that too...
