I will not want this game unless my pc spec is good, this game need a high system requirement, if you dont, dont you ever think about it! After Id played several times of this games, due to several bugs, it cant sync with icloud, Ive to start all over again from the beginning of the game, this incident which is not happen only just to me, but Ive seeen others facing  the same issue as well. However, this game is  fascinating and totally awesome without these problems, I would recommend this game if you have a PS3 or PS4.
