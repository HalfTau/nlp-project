Well, as far as I can tell, this game is a 2 steps away from being a GRAND SLAM. The steps are1. While cooping with people sometimes twice so far been playing for 16 hours if i come out of hiding from certain places it freezes me and i cannot control my assassin.2. When the longe range musketeers shoot at you, sometimes they shoot through walls, If its a close call. For instance i rolled behind a wall and 1 second later he shot, killing me instantly even though the wall i rolled behind was the corner of a building.The storyline is great so far and the coop makes me feel like im really a part of an army of assassins. ALL THIS BEING SAID I SPENT 2 GRAND ON MY COMPUTER piece by piece  built it myself   LAST YEAR I see no problem with lag or FPS and the graphics are pure bliss. If your computer can handle it and you liked any of the other assassin creed games then you will definitely rate this game 9 / 10. MY RATING 9.5/10
