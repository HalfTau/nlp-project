this is actually a very nice game. one of the best after assassin creed brotherhood. but i hope the creator will not too focus on graphic. because not everybody is rich enough to buy good graphic card or pc. even if i do i will also rather spend it on going overseas and not on gaming. so if you are into making good sales. what a causal gamer or any gamer wants was a realistic story and nice game play. for graphic, just dont over do. if not will end up alot people want to play but few have enough money to play it. such a waste.
