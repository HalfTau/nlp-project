As you can see, I have not logged very many hours as some of the more helpful reviews, but from what I have played Im willing to say this1Lag and Crashes  Most of the negative reviews I feel are no longer relevant, as I nor any friends also playing on pc have encountered these game breaking crashes since the most recent patch. However,2Controls Mouse and keyboard can be extremely clunky. The game seems to respond much quicker when using controller input. It is still playable without a controller but you might want to make sure you have a decent stock of medicine as youll be missing parries and dodges more frequently than yould like.3Graphics The graphics are very well done, as is true in most AC games. Cutscenes might skip frames, but I find them still enjoyable. What is not enjoyable however is that it seems one of every three cutscenes are unskippable. Some of you might agree or disagree, but I like to have the option to skip a long boring cutscene if I want to.At the moment the ingame pause menu is a blinding white box of eyeburning brightness with the occasional flicker not sure If its just me, or if others have also experienced it that can just barely be navigated by concentrated squinting and guesswork. Im hoping that future patches will fix this.In my personal view, and from what Ive played so far, I feel the game is not as enjoyable as Black Flag. But it is a blessed step up from AC3 and I am cautiously optimistic and just a wee bit hopeful that as the developers scramble to fix what is broken, and eventually again, hopefully the game might become a shiny bit of silver in the Assassins Creed treasury.
