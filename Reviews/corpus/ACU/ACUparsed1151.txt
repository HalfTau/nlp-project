The game is good, but it seriously pisses me off how no matter how many times i try the mission where Arno and Bellec fight, i get stuck in an infinite loop of pressing E and cant progress. Its sad when you buy a game after 2 years of it being released and there are still bugs as large as this one. Not changing this review unless ubisoft decides to fix this.
