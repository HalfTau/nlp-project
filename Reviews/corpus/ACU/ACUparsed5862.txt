I cannot say whether i reccomend this game because i have not even played it yet due to it crashing right when it is about to load the game, but my computer is right on borderline of minimum requirements but with an intel 4000 instead of an NVDIA graphics card, but i think the game will become less demanding once all the bugs are patched, so for now i will say dont buy this game.
