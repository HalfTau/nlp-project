After more than a month and 4 patches later, this game is still unplayable for me every 3 seconds or so a tiny freeze of about 1/5th of a second, which causes physics to go haywire. It is really ridiculous that Ubisoft does this again and again. They clearly released an unfinished game because some people high up said that they had to meet a certain deadline. This game really looks more like an early access game and everyone is part of a beta an expensive one. DO NOT BUY THIS!
