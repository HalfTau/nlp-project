NO SPOILERLet me tell you a story about me, sitting in my chair playing Unity. I was doing a mission that involved assassinating somebody af the templar order about 2/3 of the game in a palace. I do the little side mission things so it would be easier to kill the target. Afterwards, I try to get in the place. The game says nope and Im magicaly stuck in a wall...great. Reaload last checkpoint. The game says the distration is still unlocked so I dont have to do the side thing. Awesome. Except the game lied. No distraction...great. Lets try anyway, I enter the palace/house/thing and NOPE... 10 fps, impossible to do the mission...GREAT, game breaking.Lowest settings possible.i74770k2 GTX 760SPOILER sortaTLDR that btch of Marie Lvesque had the best defence possible, 10 fps at low. The templars won.
