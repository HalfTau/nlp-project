Too much bugs. I keep on getting stuck inside the roofs and ground and cant move. There is a lot of lag. Not just that, but I keep on falling through the floor. This game is playable, but doesnt feel like fun.10/10Ubisoft screwed up big time. But I still play this game LOL.Update lag and getting stuck is still an issue, but I no longer fall through the floor. 9/10
