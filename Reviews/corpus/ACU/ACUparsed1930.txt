This game was all in all amazing great mechanics, great story, but the ending... I wont spoil but after the ending I completely lost all desire to play the game. The ending deflated all enthusiasm I had for this title.The ending was predictable, bleak, grim, depressing, and unsatisfying. Not to mention Ubisoft is getting less than subtle about shoving its atheism down my throat. Asides from that the game is playable, though glitchy... BIG emphasis on glitchy. Sound cuts out randomly when in combat leaving only backround noise. Things clip through the characters clothing, Tables, the ground, and pretty much everything. Dead bodys that cover weapons will spaz out and alert guards. I could really go on for days but im to anoyed at Ubisoft to ramble on about onther one of there trash games, and dont get me wrong I love AC and MOSTLY everything about the series, but the constant bad script writing of major plot twists that RUIN their games. I NEVER listen to plots or storylines in any games i play but even doing the quests with Elise made me fall in love with her character. I found myself getting VERY involved with the plot and wanting to do the next mission as fast as I could. Finaly to finish off I would by the hell out of any AC game that had a good ending. Bad endings make you never want to go back to that title and never think about it again. But the good endings have the best repercussions to a game maker, obviously the amount of microtransactions they have on this game is TREMENDOUSLY entisive to buy hundreds of dollers worth, but in my opinion NO microtransactions are acceptible. getting back to the point if the ending was good then I probibly would have came back and bought ingame money, but no Ubisoft can end a AAA title without the worst ending they could think of... goodbye Ubisoft
