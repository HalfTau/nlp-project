I see that there is much hate for this game right now from all the glitches, lag, and variety of other problems that are currently plaguing this game. I am a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise and throughly enjoyed most of the games in the series. That includes this one. YES there are problems like lag and glitches but those can be fixed with Ubisoft releasing an update. I know Ubisoft has already devised this update and am unsure if it has been released to all yet. So there is help on the way. I, even before the update, have had relatively good luck or something with this game as the only problems I have been facing are occasional stuttering, my game froze once and some glitches where I fell through the map. Some of my friends have it worst off then me yet they dont make the game unplayable.Now to the actual game itself. I really like some of the changes that were added to the game, like the phantom blade, and the new parkour mechanics. The game is really fun to play with your friends. I dont like how they did take stuff out though, some of these ability to pick up weapons and dead guards, ability to use hidden blades or anything other than a sword, pike, or heavy weapon, and a few other things. But all in all I really like this game and would recommend this to anyone that has the specs to run it as it is a taxing game.
