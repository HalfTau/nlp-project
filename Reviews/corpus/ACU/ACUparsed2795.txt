so, i really wished for this game since it came out, even though i knew it had lots of buugs, i also knew i could fix them, since there are many who can. bought one for my brother and after 1 day of trying we fixed the game, now he plays it 24/7. yesterday i bought one for myself, 24 hrs tries and nothing, game crashs when i click on Play button, i still believe that this can be fixed, i dont want to give up on this game since it really is awesome in terms of gameplay, graphics, story and the world itself looks amazing. i tried every single solution, reinstalling the game, reinstalling drivers, every.... single... step.... . People, if there is anyone who can provide with an additional options, i would be super happy. dont give up on game guys.
