Prereview note If youre thinking about buying this game, wait till patch 4 comes out, because it will fix some fps issues.Graphics The game itself is beautiful. From the architecture to the characters everything looks really great. The shadows on skin look fantastic as well.Story It might not be the best story in the series, but it is definitelyin my opinion at least better than the story in ACIII and ACIV BF. It has everything you would need in a good story, likeable characters, some plot twists and nice pacing.Gameplay They have redone the combat, it now resembles more combat from the Witcher 2. You cant kill streak entire armies anymore, which is great, and if there are multiple enemies 4 some of them will move back and try to shoot you, instead of waiting in line to attack you.The enemies have health bars again and vary in difficulty from district to district. They added murder mystery missions which are basically you becoming a detective and trying to find the person who commited a crime by investigating clues nearby. The parkour is a modified version of black flags parkour with the addition of being able to parkour down easily while looking stylish. Stealth is finally playing a bigger part now. All bigger assassinations have multiple aproaches, which depends on you how youre going to do it. You can either try to Rambo your way to the target, try to sneak through buildings and rooms until you get to your target, or you can make your own way. Also they reduced the amount of tailing missions.Coop The coop is very fun. There are a limited amount of missions/heists, but they dont get boring easily so you will end up gladly playing the same mission multiple times. This is like the enhanced wolfpack mode from ACIII, except now you have full missions and are actually entertaining. Even when not doing any missions, running around Paris with friends is fun.Performance I personally have experienced close to none bugs and glitches, but other people seem to have an abundance of them. But with the recent 3 patches most of them have been fixed i believe. The games biggest problem are its fps. The game is badly optimized, it is one probably worse than watch dogs. But in the next patch coming out they said that there is going to be fps improvement.Overall If you like the AC series, then youre definitely going to enjoy this game. The gameplay is great, the story good, and there is a LOT to do in it. The only issues is the performance, but hopefully it will get fixed. I definitely recommend it.ProsNew combatCoopSide missionsCharacter customizationStoryCharactersStealthGraphicsParkour down abilityConsPerformance
