There are many reviews about this game that make it seem like it is not even worth the time, let alone the money.  The thing is that I am a die hard fan of the series, so I bought it and am still currently playing it.  Yes, there are bugs, lags, and some other small issues with this game if you do not own a top of the line computer to play it.  I have a computer in the low range spectrum and it will lag every once in awhile and that is after turning all the graphic settings to the lowest points.  But the game is still beautifully detailed and balanced on those settings, and look way better than any other AC game to date cant say anything about Rouge yet.  Multiplayer, for what Ive been able to figure out about it, is a new and enjoyable experience for all.  So many different styles of assassins to team up with and complete missions and have fun with.  Yes, only four at a time may play coop but trust me when I say that is more than enough to do all that is needed to be done.  If you are a gamer that truly loves games like the Assassins Creed style then this is a must buy and play over and over and over.  DO NOT let others determine what is considered a good game for you as you must figure that out yourself.
