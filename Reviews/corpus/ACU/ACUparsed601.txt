Title Assassins Creed UnityGame Type Open world, parkour, rpg, action, adventure, coopGame ScoresRating Out of 10Graphics 9Music7.5Cinematics6Story5.5Pvp0Content6Controls7Replay Value8GameScore Overall7.5/10Good Things to Note So many weapons to choose from, each with its own class style. Challanging Ai the way it should be, makes you think twice before getting in a fight.Bad Things to Note Story lacks and feels forced, and if your pc is not up to spec lag can be a problem at max graphics causing some missions that require timing impossible to beat.My advice Get it, not for the story but for the Ai and weapons galore.
