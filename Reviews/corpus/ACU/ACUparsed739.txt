Fun! I enjoy having coop features. Its hard to find a decent coop game. ACU is defintly more than decent. It follows the Assassins Creed lore well, and has lots of useless killing! Many different options for different playstyles. You cant move bodies which is a bummer, but oddly the enemys really dont care that much about the dead bodies all over. I recommend buying this game.
