First to make things clear i know that this game has a lot of negative things like Lag, glitches, crashes. I played AC3 with the same problems, it had less features and the same problems. Then i worked out what has the AC History been. AC1 first game was not best because it was just a try and the first games. AC2 Best game in AC for a long time until AC4. ACBH AND ACR were like AC2 copies thats why i dont count them but for me ACBH was long and boring, ACR was quite good for me because of the bombs and the story was more interesting for me. Then comes AC3 when they upgraded they engine and they took a big step thats why they failed. AC4Black Flag was great because they had mastered and fixed all the bugs that were in AC3. Now why is ACU a big let down for some people? Because again it was a big step like AC3 and they made quite a big project. Thats why it has a lot of bugs of course with a bigger project you can get more bugs.I enjoy ACU because it has a deep story, good assassination missions black box, the gameplay is buggy but the idea is good and i think they will fix this game because it had such a long development and they tried to extend the release date from 28 Oct. to 1114 Nov.For the people that havent played any AC games i will not suggest it because you cant understand the story, but for all AC Fans i will recommend this game because the story is quite good.
