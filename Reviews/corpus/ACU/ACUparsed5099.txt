For gameplay, Unity is a pretty enjoyable game. New climbing mechanics and traversion controls  albeit a little unpolished  allow for more of the climbyjumpyrunnystabby gameplay of the Assassins Creed franchise. The world feels more alive too you can properly go inside buildings, and this adds a whole new level of depth. As for stealth, its alright, same as the other games really. Cover and hiding and escaping work just fine, except the Press E for takedown is very unresponsive, at least for me. Combat is a little more fluid yet more basic, back to ACB stlye. Plot is what youd expect from an AC game an era of history altered and dramatised with Assassins and Templars woven into it to create a need for badhoods and robes. One thing that breaks the plot a bit is that EVERYONE has an English accent. Everyone. This game is made in Canada, yet they couldnt find anyone with a French accent? But gameplay itself really is pretty good.Such a shame you cant play it. Overall, the game is pretty good. Its fun, its got depth, and its got a steady set of new mechanics and CoOp is an interesting new feature when it works. Still, Not recommended . Ubisoft has fed people around too long, and now theyve pulled some crap about a new game next year being announced. Oh, so this game is broken? Let us work on a new one while we neglect to fix the old one.  Dkheads. As for the game itself, its really not too bad, when it works. But I just cant encourage people to shovel out money to greedy, selfish developers. Stay well away from Unity until all issues are fixed maybe then it will be worth whatever sale price its on. I reccomend you play the game, but not buy it I hope you get what I mean. I wouldnt give your money to these guys.
