Bugged and low framerates. Other than that your standard Assassin game with slightly updated mechanics and a new story. Personally I feel like the combat mechanics are actually worse. I felt like they were the best in AC Black Flag and Revelation. Amazing graphics if your rig can handle it. Coop looks like fun if I could play it without stuttering. Story looks interesting so far. I have not finished it because the issues just got too much. I will be waiting for patch 3. I preordered the game so I am kind of stuck with the issues. In hindsight I would have waited until it is fixed and running smoothly before buying it. So if you like the AC series, this is a good game, however, I do not recommend it at this time. Just wait with the purchase until it is fixed. I learned my lesson Dont preorder games!! !UpdatePatch 3 is here and for me it did improve the game, although some people are saying it did not do anything or made it worse. So it really depends on your rig. Mine is not high end but I can run the game fine now. This is a true next gen game. You will need high end hardware to run it on ultra. But, is not that what pc gamers have asked for!? Also, it seems that Ubisoft is really trying to fix the issues and like I said they fixed it mostly for me. The coop is a lot of fun if you can play it with a mic. I am replaying missions and just having a great time with a friend. In addition, I am getting a free game...so YAY. So if you have a good pc and you want to check out a next gen game go with AC Unity.
