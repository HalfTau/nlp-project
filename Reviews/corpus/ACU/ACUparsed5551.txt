Contrary to all the other reviews i actually really like the game, bugs are there but all releases have them, only crashed once in a multiplayer game but thats to be expected on the first day of release. Enjoyable gameplay and satisfying progression, I do wish that you didnt have to have the app in order to unlock some things but oh well whatever works for ya.
