Even if your computer exactly meets the space requirement, Id say it might be risky that you might not be able to play it. Using a more OP PC spec would be recommended. From the previous reviews, most of them are about the game require a very high PC spec and bits and bobs about I CANT PLAY THIS WITH A PC UP TO THE MINIMUM SPECS REQUIREMENT WHAT THE HECK. So I think that this game is underated interms of rating the quality of the gameplay and the scenery that the creator deserves. I think Ubisoft is probably trying to reach for more audiences, so they made the games with lower specs like Assassins Creed China and the ones with higher specs like Unity.Overall game play is amazing, and the maps are stunning. I can tell that the creators put heck of an effort to make everything looks as real and spotless as possible. If you are the kind of person who want not only a good game play like classic Assassin Creed style but with multi player, and really love to immense in an amazing scenery of Paris during the French revolution, I would say that  you probably going to love this game.Once when I left my laptop on Sleep mode for too long not recommend you guys to do this, its bad for your PCs health, I experienced ultimate framerate drop and so during the game play, Arnos hair flipped back and forth, and the ladies dresses were spinning as if they were walking in a hurricane.Now I cant wait for Syndicate, thumbs up for game creators efforts in making everything looking spotless for us gamers, I really really appreciate it.Overall100/10 will hair flip again
