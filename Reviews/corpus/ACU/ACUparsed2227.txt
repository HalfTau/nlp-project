After 15.4 hours past I still exploring the city. Theres many things you can do in this game and both multiplayer and single player are very fun. I know at first this game has  many glitches ,but now its smooth and beautiful. Im not quite a fan of this game but this game is really addicted and fun. I think I will even play more and more. 10/10
