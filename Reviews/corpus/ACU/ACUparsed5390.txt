Well done game!Magnificent plot of the game. Quality is excellent animated graphics characters in the game.Amazing huge game world.The game is so fond of, that you forget about the small flaws in the form of bugs and small camera freezes in the game, of course I hope it will be fixed, it is not very critical and does not spoil the overall picture of the game.The only gripe in my opinion, it is a system of fighting with swords, I was not very impressed, too boring.The more you play, the more you realize that the game is fantastically beautiful! It is simply a masterpiece!!!Best game of the year, definitely! !  .       .   .  ,                            .            .          !   !!!  !
