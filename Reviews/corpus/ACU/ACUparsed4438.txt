Everyone is distracted with the bugs with this game that no one is talking about the story.Played through it and it isnt worth it. Opening is weak, Arno is lame, there are some good supporting characters and the ending is lame. Nothing really dramatic ever happens, it doesnt add anything great to the AC universe. The story in this game could have been so much better! Big let down...If you like exploring,  questing and the idea of playing AC in co op then you will get some enjoyment out of it.Other than that it isnt worth the 60 dollars. It is a very pretty game though...
