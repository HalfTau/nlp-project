Despite all of the negative reviews I acctually really liked the game. I was never hit with any game breaking glitches I played on day 1 apart from a few performance bugs that were patched later I really liked it. As for the story it isnt the best but most definatly not the worst overall story is a 7/10 gameplay 8/10 overall polish 6/10 only because of problems it had in the begining esspecially for those you got the no face glitch. Microtransactions I thought were a bit stupid but unlike most games with microtransactions I never felt the need to pay and I havent. Overall I give this a 8/10 but didnt live up to the hype.
