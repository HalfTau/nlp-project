This is one of my first review I ever write.I actually think this game is worth buying... Just not jet, why?The game itself is a beauty. The graphical aspect is amazing, every detail from the Palais floor to the roofs is well crafted and actually gives you the French vibe, this game is truly a NextGen title. The movements of the character are well done and amazingly smooth, its a pleasure to move around the city, whether its walking or parkouring. From the controlled dropouts to the way he climbs, its quite impressive the improvements made from other AC titles. The crowds and sounds mix well together to actually make you believe youre in Revolutionary France.The bad about the game is that it is incomplete. There are at least a dozen bugs, altough Patch 2 fixed some of them. You will also need a HighEnd Pc to actually run this at max, and you will probably get 40 fraps at most. But hey! It looks freaking amazing.I rate this game positive because of the huge improvement from previous titles and how beutiful not only the graphics look, but also the smooth and addictively entertaining 10/10 would buy... after some more patches.
