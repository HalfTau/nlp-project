This game is terrible!!! DO NOT BUY!!! I saw the video and thought it looked amazing but it is unplayable. First you have to register a ubisoft account which is very difficut as it barely works and then have to register and link the game to that account which again barely works. When its finally linked which it cant do 100 then the game will sometimes work but most often doesnt as it tries to sync which never works and causes the game to crash. When the game finally does work, its  extremely laggy even though my BRAND NEW laptop more than meets the specifications required to play. I cant even get a refund from steam because it took me so long to figure out these problems. Seriously dont waste your time or money.
