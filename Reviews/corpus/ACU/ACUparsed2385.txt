Despite all the bugs in the begining i Truly loved this game! My favorite of the Assassins games which made it difficult to play all the other creed games because of the playability. The graphics are stunning and the side quests fun. Though the multiplayer ones were a problem until i found someone here at home to play with. All in all I only got stuck once and i just teleported. I have gotten stuck on the others many more times than here so I have found that they fixed all the bugs and it is a beautiful game to play! I have found no stock to any of the complaints and I have beat the game and the side quests. I definitely reccomend this game!!!
