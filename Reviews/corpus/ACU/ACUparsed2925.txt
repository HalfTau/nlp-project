I recommend to not buy Ubisoft games on PC. I would give Ubisoft a chance if they fix their games and remove UPLAY!So here is the thing. I buy a Ubisoft game from Steam i want it to launch on Steam like most of the new games on SteamI see that there is not so many that play games from ubisoft on pc anymore becuse you cant trust them buy a console if you want to play Ubisoft games with not crashes or frame drops or uplay launcher !
