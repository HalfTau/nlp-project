Good game, still some bugs, most with ai, they are not smart as in other ac, like when seeing dead body doing nothing after few sec. Still end of the story was really dissapointing for me. But i enjoyed whole game. Lots of changes from previous ac, game is a challange even if you are really well geared. Good game worth playing.
