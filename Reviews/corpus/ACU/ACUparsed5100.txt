So I know what will come from me writing this review, but I feel I need to write it. My computer isnt amazing, and honestly it doesnt even meet the minimum requirements. I have an i7 3630QM 2.4GHz, 8gb ram, Nvidia GTX 670mx.If you need the game on Ultra, High Resolution, and 60 fps be prepared to have an expensive computer, and know your PC work arounds. The game isnt perfect as I have found 2 bugs so far, but no where near the totally broken on release reviews Ive ready prior to this. If you have any concerns, you can always wait until the next steam sale.
