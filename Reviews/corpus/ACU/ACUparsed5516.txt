Is this what Ubisoft is up to these days? Just taking our money and running? Not worried about the impending doom of FPS drops, lag, stuttering, and falling through the roof of a building into complete darkness. A BUGGY MESS? Why should we even support these people if all they are going to do is leave us with this uh.. this uh... ABOMINATION! I have a top notch computer, that can easily run on ULTRA HIGH settings. What I get is that the game cannot be played without me moving 1 inch at 1 FPS. So to help I had to bring it down to LOW on a top notch computer. DA FUQ?! I was really hoping youd learn after WATCHDOGS but apparently not, in fact it turned out worse. As I go back to the question.... WHY are we giving these people money to make another abomination and giving them money again? I dont know.. HYPE! It was so hyped, so beautiful, so smooth, so graphical impressive, lush and suprising.... LIKE ITS BAD TEXTURED FRUIT! I WAS NOT EVEN WORRIED ABOUT FRAME RATE, THE GAMEPLAY IS IMPRESSIVE BUT UNPLAYABLE! I really dont understand. I dont even trust them anymore... THEY DIDNT EVEN PATCH WATCHDOGS after the release and to THIS DAY its not patched. You know what, I was all like whatever, its a first day launch but then I was like  ITS UBISOFT WHO MADE THIS GAME meaning that Ubisoft takes our money, turns their back on Unity and whatever other game, scoops up our money likeand makes another ABOMINATION and the cycle keeps going. I cant trust them. Have fun endorsing NVIDIDA and getting money from XBOX. PC should be your TOP PRIORITY. Maybe you actually care about FarCry 4.. But oh yeah its Ubisoft. As we speak they are putting FarCry 4 aside i bet because  THE COMMUNITY   MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY and are working on FarCry 5 to brainwash us. And to think you even MADE Assassins Creed 2. I even marvel at how Ubisoft made that. Fix it... I want my money to be worth it. But alas, now I am about 1 out of the Millions of people begging on the street with tattered clothes, while we solemmy protest, and Ubisoft guards their golden gates yelling LET THEM GIVE US MONEY! while we cry for a better game. VIVA TO THE GAMERS! DONT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL PATCHED. Oh wait.. Its Ubisoft.
