Too long dont want to read Game is crap, many bugs such as floaty things and getting stuck in scenes.Cant say I approve of this being released. Someone in the comment section claimed they fixed 98 of the glitches. Yet after just a few hours I had experienced enough bugs to make me question reality. What annoyed me even further is that I left the game on when I went to a BBQ, when I came back I had accumilated enough hours to not get a refund. So Im stuck with a game that does not work. I explained to Steam that the game is broken close to impossible to play, that they sold me a broken thing but still would not accept that I returned it.
