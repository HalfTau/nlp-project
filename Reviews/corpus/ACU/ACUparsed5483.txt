My specsi7 4510U  2.8GHz per core8GB DDR3 RAMAMD Radeon R9 290M 2GB DDR3 VRAMAt first I thought the low FPS was my issue. I was not fully convinced however simply because I can run both Tomb Raider and Titanfall on ultra settings minus TressFX on Tomb Raider and get 5060 FPS. As I was extremely dissapointed with my poor judgement on purchasing a game my rig simply could not run I decided to Google  Assassins Creed Unity compatibility and slowly began to understand the massive issue this game is having. After watching many videos and reading a few articles Ive adjusted my settings as such all textures are low and lighting filters are off, my resolution is at 1280x720 in windowed mode and I get 3050 FPS. Besides the obvious optimization issues this game has the storyline has no relevance to the last game, it sounds like Sean is still in this game but he has some sort of codename, Im not exactly sure. From what Ive gathered Abstergo has created an Animus type console that allows you to play memories that they have preloaded, the Assasssins hack your server and upload the memories of Arno to play. I feel as though its just bulland is clearly a cash cow. Ive thuroughly enjoyed every Assassns Creed game up until this point and I think this will be my last purchase of the series. Regardless of how  the storyline and optimization are, the gameplay and climbing system is incredibly more fluid and I do have fun jumping roof to roof in a quick and easy way, theres not as many hangups climbing that Ive experienced in the previous which is a plus. Basically if youre a huge fan of the series and have not purchased this game, I dont think its worth it, if you want to give it a shot cause you think it looks fun, wait until they have fixed this game from the peice ofthat it currently is then proceed to have fun at your discretion. Just dont buy the game now.
