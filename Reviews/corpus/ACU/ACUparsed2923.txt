A pretty decent game. Yes, the story might be a tad short and the starting bugs were just horrid. Nope, scratch that, they were horrific. But the new Parkour and BattleSystems are magnificent. Being able to get of a roof without either taking the time to take the long but safe path down or looking for a bloody Pigoens/Crows or their droppings to take a leap of faith. Also, the BattleSystem of AC Unity needs you more alert than ever, removing the quite annoying Streak kills you could use in AC Brotherhood up to AC Black Flag, which ended whenever yuo tried to take down a Brute. Also the enemy AI now have the option to kill you with just one precise strikewhenever you fail to balance defence and offense. This makes you reconsider battles even more opposed to going on killing streaks, which Im sure we all did in all the other AC games. To help strengthen this point even more, we now have an astonishing new feature, Stealth Mode. Im now able to avoid a bulk of enemies and go on my merry Way through Paris.Last but not least, being able to lob Bombs away from you is an impressive new feature. Now I can throw a Smoke Bomb at a group of NPCs and not have to walk into the middle of the group triggering a fight and then have a slim chance but its still there of being killed.
