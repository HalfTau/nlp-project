Got it as an early christmas gift. I just wish I could be refunded for it. My PC didnt even scratch the first 10fps, on the lowest lowest low settings thats low. Completely unplayable. Yeah... so NO, I wouldnt recommend this game unless you own a highend gaming pc, and NO, I wouldnt recommend a game by a developer that doesnt care about the medium range consumers.
