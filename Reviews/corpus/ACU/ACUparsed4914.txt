You play as the incredible Jaden Smith from the Karate Kid movies running around this place called Paris doing your kung fu fighting everywhere. But since youre not a real kung fu master all you do is stab people which is okay for a begginer. Traversing around the world is pretty fun, plays exactly like Dota, having you get from point A to B then back again to A. The main objective in the game is to stab as many people as you can and score with hot bimbos on the street while people are trying to steal your pantees.I give this game a 0/10 because you cant bang Elise.P.S. The game is more enjoyable if you eat noodlesI cant believe I spent 60 on a less than 5 hour campaign...
