This game this game has put me threw so much torment ever sence I bought it. I loved it the story was genaric but no complants the thing this game did to me was delete my save progress. I didnt do it once but four times it deleted all my saves. The first three times I played it I was half way threw the game. But the last time it did it I was almost finished with the story. I loved assassins creed but know I have no problem never playing this game or any others that come out in the future.
