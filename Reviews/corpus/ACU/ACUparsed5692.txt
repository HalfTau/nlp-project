This game would be fun and great if a patch comes that enhances performance. Playing while thinking about when Ill randomly crash next, dealing with FPS drops or Arno falling through the terrain to his death is not leaving a good first impression at all. This has ruined preordering any future game for me and I hope a patch comes soon.The gameplay is fun and would be better if the framerate did not drop during combat, cutscenes or in NPCcrowded areas. However, the performance is not up to par despite Day One patches. I do not recommend buying this game until a fix comes our way.Update Three patches have come that fixed SOME problems, but still not FPS drops or random crashes outlined as being fixed in patch 3. Still would not recommend this game, or even buying it during a sale as of 1 December.
