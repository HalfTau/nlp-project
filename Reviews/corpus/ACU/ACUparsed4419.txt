Assassins Creed Unity, another addition to the franchise. By god, it scares me and has scarred me. This game follows the story of Arno during the French Revolution and might as well be renamed Ezio. The difference between parkour is holding shift and space to run up and shift and e to run down. Combat has become much more of a challenge, seeing as how I have serious trouble fighting up to 3 men who all magically pull a guy out of their but has a large appeal towards stealth. With a couple of changes to my settings, I managed to cause the game to run smoothly on the lowest settings, but I still cant jump over a box or off a roof into a window.Ive had moments when Arno was literally trapped in a closet, to AI being buggy and this game with its overall completion is terribly disappointing. I have owned, beaten, and loved every Assassins Creed until this point. Now theyre just running through timelines with a new template. The story is at least interesting and its tieins with Rogue are well enough to almost make me fan girl.Overall, this game has a lot of work. Staring at the sky has caused me to gain better framerates and the only notable difference between parkour is that now you can run up and sideways at the same time.GG. NO RE  6/10 Would patch againSPOILER ALERTThe third Templar you hunt for is the grand master who just dies without any hassle. Congrats Unity, youve made your strongest villian the most disappointingEND SPOILER
