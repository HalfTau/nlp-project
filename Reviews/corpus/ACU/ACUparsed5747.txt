Now there a lot of people complaining about the performance of their game and I am not sure I can agree except in the cut scenes. I have experinced a few bugs collision but beyond that I am having no issue. My system is a i7 4900mq2.8ghz    24gb DDR3 1866 RAM     nvidia gtx780m   120gb ssd    2x 750gb seagate 7200rpm hdd. I am playing on my university laptop at everything set to ultra except shadows, lighting and AA are a level below max. The only place I am experiencing any issues with framerate are during cutscenes were it drops dramtically and stutters. Otherwise it seems to run perfectly fine on my LAPTOP system and it should be noted that mobile versions of CPU and GPUs are typically less powerful than desktops counterparts.For actualy gameply its fun. I am on sequence 4 or 5 and I have enjoyed the game so far. The assassinations are interesting and there is a plethora of side activities to do. The new parkour system is a bit unusual, take a bit to get used to but it works. The stealth system is very useful and character customization is great. The story so far has been decent but my motivation is more generally driven by the upgrade system. Combat is markedly more difficult and that makes it more compelling. Paris is gorgeous and massive and the Nostradamus riddles are challenging and fun. I havent tried the coop yet but I plan to.I would reccomend this game to you if you are a fan of the series or are interested in the concepts and have the system to handle it. I enjoy it as the next iteration of the AC series and it definitely better than AC3 which I did not enjoy. It is difficult to compare it to IV as Black Flag was generally naval and this is a landlocked game but I am enjoying it as much as I did Black Flag. Customizing Arno is like customizing the ship.
