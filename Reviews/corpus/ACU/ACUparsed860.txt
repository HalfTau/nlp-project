Thumbs up ! Amazing game , Amazing graphics ! This game is fully fuctional without bugs and is totally enjoyable speciallly if youve been playing it from the starting Assassins creed 1 , Negative reviews might be because their System is not able to support it  but hey they shouldve seen the minimum requirements before buying , so dont follow the negative reviews and go with the positive ones i review this game fter 6 hours of gameplay and i find it perfect with no issues so a YES from my side
