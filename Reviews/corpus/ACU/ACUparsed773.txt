It definitely was a garbage game when it hit the release date back in the day, but it now runs very well. The game itself is predictable  its an assassins creed, so you have a fun yet incredibly misadapted movement system when it comes to infiltration. Its still a pretty great rendering of Paris all in all. If youre looking for a nice game to buy, you should head over to AC Syndicate, which I hear is better in every aspect. If you want this game specifically, well its far from a bad game now. Classic AC, have fun.
