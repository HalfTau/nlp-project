This game is so buggy and full of glitches that its kind of impossible to actually enjoy the gameplay itself. So far I have got stuck on rooftop up to my knees three times  fallen through the ground a few times. There have been other issues as well such as next phase of the memory not starting properly etc. The game is also really lagy overall even with lower graphic settings. The controls arent really intuitive either, which makes it playing even more annoying since half of the time you fail simply because the poor controls  lag.I have enjoyed the assasins creed series so far, but this game seems so unready... I cant even say anything about the plot since all the techincal issues have already ruined the experience for me.
