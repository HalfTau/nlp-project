This game is wonderfull to play alone emotional and interesting story the soundtrack is astonishing, and the multyplayer well no more of that crap deathmatch from the other assassins creed, this multyplayer includes the coop mode its off the hook! Its even more fun when you join a freind or two!.Now the serious part lots of years I readed that people would say quotgame, full of bugs, constant crashes etc...Well played it for 52 hours no such thing. Not a single crash of even a bug, optimization could be better yeah but still a beatifull game and fun.Worth buying, for real!
