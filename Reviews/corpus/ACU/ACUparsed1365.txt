The game is fun, two maps Three, if you have Dead kings DLC, the first map is pretty big actually. And now that most glitches are patched, its very good. And now, its easier to be stealthy, theres a bigger way to change looks, coop missions, and amazing graphics. Sadly, as many newer games, it takes a lot for the PC to handle. But its still an amazing game!
