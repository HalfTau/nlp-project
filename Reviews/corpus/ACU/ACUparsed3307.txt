Ive been a longtime fan of Assassins Creed, but unfortunately, I cant recommend this game. While the main story is good, the rest of the game is stuffed to the brim with uneccessary padding, repetitive sidequests lacking in any personality, and a ridiculous amount of crap that can only be unlocked by using the games inane and bugridden companion app. Making matters worse, even after 4 patches, Im still unable to use unlocked weapons or earn achievements due to bugs.The game might be beautiful, and they picked a hell of a time in history to take the franchise, but unfortunately its just not any good. This game could have been a lot better if theyd taken the time to iron out the bugs, and stripped out all the uneccessary crap. As it stands, its about 90 hours long, but theres only about 30 hours of decent gameplay. Give this one a miss.
