What happens when a game franchise takes itself so seriously? You get mess like AC Unity. Clunky controls, time lag between button press and action, whiny duckfooted protagonist, etc. One of the worst addition to the AC series. The story is good though one of the main reasons I played it. Worth buying while it is on sale.
