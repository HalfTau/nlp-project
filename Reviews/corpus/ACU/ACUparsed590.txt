Its pretty good but there are some glichtes here and there im not the biggest fan of the combat mechanics ive played a lot of black flag i really liked that i wish Unity had the same combat mechanics there is also a glicht where you cant complete the game its a long time since i played it because of the glitch but im re installing it hoping its fixed pretty fun but a bit too many glitches sometimesWorth it? Only on sale would never buy it for the full price at least 50
