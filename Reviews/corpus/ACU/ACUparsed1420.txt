didnt play much i have a gtx 960 4gb and could barely run it on low at 40 fps. the game is without a doubt the prettiest videogame i have played but i dont recoomend the performance of the game is too difficult to muster with fast pace combat and sneakiness, it does hoever have a good amount of customization and weapons. get it for 10 and under at ur locol  1dollar store
