Hello, this is my review of Assassins Creed Unity. Ive logged in 25.9 hours into this game. As of 11/19/2014There are more cons than pros.Pros Missions are fun, the parkour is very smooth, the new customization is super cool, the coop is super fun, the combat is a TAD bit harder than the other games and lastly Paris is a very cool world to explore...Cons The framerate is SUPER bad on my GTX 770 I had to run this game on all low with a res of 1600x900 My max being 1980X1080 and I could barely get passed 30 FPS. My play together section in the pause screen This is to play coop was not working the first time I tried to use it, once the second patch was released It started to work. I heard that SLI does not work in this game. Money is super hard to get at first, until you buy the max lockpicking skill. Most of the money is in the chests. Sometimes enemies dont even see you after you walk right by them. The AI is super stupid. Arno sometimes falls right through the roof of the building and falls under the map.I will RECOMMEND this game once they fix most of these issues. Especially the FPSHere is a great video review my TotalBiscut
