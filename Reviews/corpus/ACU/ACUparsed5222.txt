So I have been a big fan of assassins creed since the AC2. AC1 was, in my opinion, fun but awful at the same time. AC2 was 30x better and all the following the same, exellent story and gameplay. That is until now, its seems they fell between the cracks of AC1  AC2, making it only 15x better then AC1 if you will. The story, which is usually pretty creative and interesting, falls short and is very dull. On top of that they removed alot of features i enjoined. For example, combat with your hands, fighting with a variety of weapons sword to heavy/long weapon the pistols, fight with the wrist blades, which now can only be used when undetected. On top of that, your choice of weapons are, Sword  pistol or Heavy sword/Ax  pistol or Spear/Pike  Pistol or, last but not least, rifle ONLY. Im not going to touch on the variety of annoying gliches as they can/will be fixed. The COOP is a bit dull if you ask me. But to some it up, if your dead set on getting this game to, WAIT TILL IT GOES ON SALE ITS NOT WORTH 60
