Assassins Creed UnityKnown as the worst game in the series....turns out its not so bad after all.Despite all the bugs in the game, I found Unity better than Syndicate Sorry Syndicates fans.Pros Better story cough than Syndicate imo The combat is really challenging Paris....Oh..just wow.. Amazing graphics Got the feeling of being an Assassin Lots of weapon and side mission Love the character customization The coop is not ded The Dead Kings DLC is kinda great Ill explain it later The parkour is not that bad, I really like the parkourCons UBeSoft Microtransaction Still poorly optimized for PC Bugs? The sidemissions are a bit repetitive It requires Uplay The Dead Kings is really buggy, for example, the loss of 5 gold diamonds rank on the top of your name, etc. WHY UBI??? WHY?? Personal score 8/10Again, Im very sorry Syndicates fans EDIT Btw, I do recommend both games! Unity and Syndicate
