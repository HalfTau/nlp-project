This is a terrible game.I am a HUGE fan of the AC series, I love the concept of dual story lines intertwined between the centuries, the gameplay, all of it. But since Ezio this series has taken a turn for the worse, with Black Flag only bearable for having the ship mechanic going on. In theory, the setting and gameplay of Unity is an improvement for me and a return to what made the earlier games better in my opinion. But in reality the gameplay is horrible. Combat is clunky and overly difficult, the controls are as inprecise as ever, and it rarely gets above 40fps on a i5 4690k and GTX 970. I regret buying it 100 even though it was on a good sale. Would not recommend this game to anyone but a masochist.
