This game is a total let down. Ive been a fan of the AC series and have supported the games by purchasing it in the past through console play now on PC. I must say I never had any problems with any console version of the game now I cant play the game! it crashes it stuttersFPS seems strange. I moved to PC for gaming because of the visual quality being so superior to console gaming. I have been very pleased with evrything Ive played. I just wish Ubisoft had not dropped to ball on this one. Im sure some people will be fired as they should. Treat your consumers better in the future!
