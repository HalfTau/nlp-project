Im glad to be playing this game in a smooth 60fps at all times. I remember playing this game two years ago when this was first released on the Xbox One and man I remember the constant frame drops in big crowds. Now, I see that Ubisoft attempted to make it run better compared this was first released on PC. Now, Im satisfied and I do not mind running this game back again.To be honest, this Assassins Creed game is the most innovative out of the bunch. Especially, the stealth mechanics are amazing and the combat took a turn back to the Brotherhood/Revelations days, which I love. Oh, and put this game in the French language its pretty good!Great redemption so far. I loved Unity two years ago and I still love it now!
