buying it in 2016, I feel like this is a good AC game.I like the gameplay experience a lot and the story, though basic is different from the other games. I like the customization and open world and the skill system is a new way of pacing progression.I dont understand the point of coop with complete strangers because we each have a separate idea of how to do things so  it feels out of place in stealth missions.Now that the bugs are fixed and that the dlc is bundled in, I think its a pretty good buy.
