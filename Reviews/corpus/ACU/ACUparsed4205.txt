Finally a story with a considerable amount of romance but sadly this dynamic is barely explored. Instead, the writers decided to concentrate on the revenge part of the story thus making it blaringly similar to Ezios story. Except that it doesnt even come close to the Italian Assassins gut wrenching emotional rollercoaster.The removal of the killstreak in combat is a step backwards from Black Flag. The absence of humanshields is just confounding. Why the hell they decided to remove it is beyond me.The massive number of NPCs adds to the whole feel of the game but they shouldve optimised it better before releasing the game to the public.The one saving grace of this game is the graphics...OMG!! Ubisot really have outdone themselves in this area.You cant have more than a single save game...again another step back for the series.The unlocking of various outfits from the previous games is way too time consuming. It should not be so.Overall Id say get the game on sale. 60 on it at release time was blah. Im luckily one of the few that didnt have too many issues with the game but thts not something that should have to be said in the first place.Rating 5/10Im an AC series fan since the beginning. Giving an AC game a 5/10 is a big deal for me /
