I have completed Unity  on consoles a couple of years  ago. AC unity was a good AC game to me  but when it got release it was in such a poor state that people were angry at  the game giving it poor score and  with good reason. But nowadays the game has been patched a lot and its more than playable. The story is really good the graphics still hold up the gameplay is alright. If you are an AC fan i suggest you try it and if you like the french revolution like i did you should give it a shot for around 30 its a great game.
