The game would probaby be great if it were not for all the glitches, I cant lay for more than 20 minutes without the game either crashing or the character getting stuck in soe object. Its really annoying. Ive never had this problem with any other f their games. Ive read a lot a reviews that see to agree with my opinion of this game as well. Not a great at all. I just hope that their next game does not have this many problems.
