Probably one of the worst in terms of story.Everytime you kill a boss the game reveals a new boss to kill. They do this until you reach the grandmaster.its like the game telling you OHH YOU KILLED THE PERSON, LETS REVEAL THIS NEW CHARACTER FOR YOU TO KILL! until you reach the grandmaster.Big SpoilerThe modern Assassins are trying to find a Sage from the French revolution era, because for some strange reason the current templays want to find the body and do some science thing with it. So the assassins want you to find where the sage died and was buried so they can find it and hide/destroy the body. BIG Reveal The Sages skeleton is in some weird catacombs with thousands of other dead skeletons. So all of theyou did is useless because no one would be able to find the body.
