Wow. Its like I am trying to play a game on my 8 year old laptop instead of my top of the line runs everything else on ultra settings desktop. I dont know who decided to completely jack this game up, but thanks, you wasted my money. With its completely choppy gameplay and stuttering performance, not to mention the popin textures and awful frame rate, this game is absolutely terrible. Please for the love of all that is good, do not waste your money on this garbage. Well I guess I got to watch some Templars burn at the stake before I got tired of it. So 2/10 would not watch templars burn again.
