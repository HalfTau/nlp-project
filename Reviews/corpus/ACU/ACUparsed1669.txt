When I have to describe this game, I have to say I like Black Flag more. Unity has a nice story, which is an example of one of the conversations Desmond and his father had.  It will keep you entertained but I missed the sea action from Black Flag.  Besides from that I didnt like the side missions that much, to be more specifically the higher rank side missions. These missions are way hard, but the thing that bothered me the most was the fact that you always needed to take out the soldiers out on the roof before making your way to the ground. Once or twice I can understand it, but to have to do it in every side mission wasnt something I was enjoying. Combat was also something I needed to get used to in comparison to the previous games, its more challenging, especially when there are soldiers shooting at you. Finally be able to climb down automatically is something I enjoyed. But I didnt like the fact that sometimes the game would make Arno climb up a chair and do nothing. Apart from that the DLC was good and I enjoyed the story.
