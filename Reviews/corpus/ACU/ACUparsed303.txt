Everybody that follows the series knows about the issues Unity had in the beginning, but that is no longer an issue, all of them have been fixed. There are sometimes weird ragdoll shakes when enemies die, occasionally some civilian npc weirdness and, but that is about it. The environment is beautiful with amazing attension to detail. The story kept me playing till the end. I had some fun in online coop missions with strangers, there were some lag issues but noting that made it unplayable which is more the internet speed and distance between me and the other player that caused the lag, note that this is a 2 year old game. I dont understand why some many hate on this game, I like it a lot and would recommend to anyone.
