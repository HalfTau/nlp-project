this game is totally ace meat... if you wanna spend 35 hours on trying to get the game to run on medium settings and still have to deal with the buggy EVERYTHING be my guest. i just dont understand when it became okay for companies to come out with products that dont work, thsis getting on my last nerve, ubisoft is dead to me, i want a refund of time and money.
