Orginally heard that the game was still trash even after all the updates it had been through.Got is as part of a sale pack that included Rogue, 4, Syndicate, and Unity..Decided to give the game a try and to my suprise it has been a fun experience so far.Pros Much nicer movement system than previous games, which makes you feel like rooftop travel is actually fasterCombat feels balancedCustomizable armor like never beforemultiple ways to play for multiple play styles Stealth, Combat, Ranged, etcGreat assassination missions that actually make it feel like youre planning it yourself. Which, in a way you are.Multiplayer! With a catchConsThe game is older, now. As with all older games on Steam/PC, the multiplayer market is waning, and you will sometimes spend 10 to 20 minutes searching for a lobby.Theyve made it so you have to play with other people to get full syncMultiplayer search timers limit your ability to access your map and do singleplayer stuff while you wait for a matchAs with all AC games, the main story feels quite limited in means of total play time, while fluffing the game up with worthless collectables, etc.As for actual storyline and game content, I will leave that to the buyers discretion. If youve made it this far in the series, you know you can beat the campaign itself within a few hours  half a day, just like all the AC games before it.Overall I was greatly suprised with how nice the game has finally become after so long of avoiding it because of fatal crashes.
