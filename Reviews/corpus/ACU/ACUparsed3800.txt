This game has been out for more than a month and still is unplayable on pc. I bought this game for the full price of 60 and cant ing play it. By the time it is playable steam will put it on sale for 20 probably. I actually like the story but cant play the game for more than 20 minutes without wanting to shove a sovel up myhole,  you ubisoft.
