Okay, so heres my review. I really like this game, but unfortuately, I have to write a bad review. This game would actually be great and possibly better than AC2 if the game ACTUALLY WORKED. If you get this on a platform other than PC, Im sure its great. But coming from a person who runs advanced warfare on 60 frames on all high settings, this game does not work. I have to run it on all of the super low functions and it gives me 20 frames. So, in short, if you have a super computer, this is a game for you. But if you dont, please consider getting it on a different platform because of the glitchyness. I personally will keep playing because I like the game, but not the bugs. Hopefully something will be done about them. Thank you.Edit So, ubisoft says they will fix it when they can, but the reason my review is now positive is because I recieved an email about season pass holders being eligible for a free game, which means I will get Far Cry 4 for free. Thanks Ubisoft!
