A game so bad it gave me Progeria. Beside that it is terribly optimized and the controls are worse than they were before. Arno doesnt give any s, as he just walks the opposite direction into insert any given object. On top of that he walks around stiffer than a damn robot like he has something where the sun doesnt shine, typical.
