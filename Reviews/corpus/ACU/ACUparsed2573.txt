This game reminds me a lot of AC2. It seems that Ubisoft has tried to take the series back to the elements that people loved in the earlier games, and so far I have really enjoyed Unity. It is a shame that it was released in such a technical mess, and I really wish game companies like Ubisoft would get theirtogether and stop releasing broken products to paying fans of a reputable series.However, as of now the game does not seem to have any gamebreaking glitches. I can run it at 4060 fps on my system and I havent noticed any stuttering or graphics errors using a GTX 970 4GB VRAM and an Intel i54690. I bought it for half price during the summer sale and I have absolutely no complaints.Im only a couple of hours into the game so far, but the storyline and gameplay are very entertaining. When this game was released I probably wouldnt have recommended it, but now I believe it is worth the time and money.
