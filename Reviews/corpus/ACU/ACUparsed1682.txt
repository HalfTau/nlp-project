Honestly, I wish there was a sorta option for this game. Because I sorta like it, but I also sorta dislike it.ProsGraphics are phenomenalElise is the waifu of waifusCoop is fun, when it worksParkour is fluid and fun, when glitches arent weighing you downThe outfit customization is on pointI like the time period its set inI appreciate what they were trying to do.ConsGlitches, glitches errywhereYou remember those coolconfession scenes once you killed a target? Where you get an insight into the character youve killed and their motivations? yeah those are gone.Combat is unnecessarily intricate. ACBrotherhood was the best its been, in the games Ive played.You dont feel like an assaassin.Arno isnt as likeable as Altair, Ezio, or even Connor. YES, even Connor.Arno shows no remorse for killing his first hostile. Not even an ounce.
