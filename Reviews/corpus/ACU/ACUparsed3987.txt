I love this game, I have yet to get a single one of the errors listed in the tons of other dissatisfied reviews.I will recomend one thing because i suspect this has lead to some of the problems people have been having, MAKE SURE UR SPECS ARE UP TO THE TASK AND YOUR DRIVERS ARE UPDATED. its such a sad thing but people often try and force their machines to run games that they just really arnt ment to be able to play. and if they do have the nice specs they dont bother keeping their drivers updated and things go to Ive ran this game for 10 hours straight going full blast through story and doing coop and its really been nothing but a blast. No crashing at all, almost no frame loss.the one complaint i have about this game is that there are liek 4 difference currencies and the intergration of phone app nonsense, that kinda sucks and I wish they hadnt chosen that route despite the reasoning behind it being sound. aside from that its a great game and i would not take tons of negative reviews at face value. look into it yourself before you choose to buy it.
