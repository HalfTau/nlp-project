The game is beautiful and reminds me a lot of the old Ezio games. Im only a few hours in, but Im having fun and thats why I game anyway.I see a lot of complaints about performance and I guess Im lucky? My computer specs Core i7 4770k  4.2, 16GB DDR3 2133, 500 GB Samsung 840 Evo, R9 290 factory overclocked card with latest beta driver and Win 8.1 64.I run the game at 1080p Ultra with SSAO and 2xmsaa and the game averages 4060 frames a second with vsync and drops no lower than 35 in huge crowds. Sure Id love if the frame rate never budged, but  the game is still playable.I admit the game could use a few patches for performance and bug fixing... Ive seen a few npcs fall through the ground and the texture pop on npc clothing is a bit odd.The cutscenes drop to around 27 fps and I get some random frame dropping for no reason, but this is a huge game with nice graphics and a large numbers of npcs everywhere. Id expect it to be fairly demanding.TLDR version Game needs a good computer, a patch or two , but it is fun. So buy it.
