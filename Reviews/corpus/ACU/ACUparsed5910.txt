After a 6.6 hour gaming session, Im going to review it, I see many biased reviews crying about only getting 3040 frames, This game is meant for next gen consoles, if your PC cannot keep up with that, that is your own fault, I DO NOT have an amazing computer, and I dont have any issues, I get 3540 FPS on low, as the high graphics are a little extreme for my computer, even at low the graphics are incredibly nice, and still beat most games. I only am having a handful of issues though, It has happened 3 times in 6 hours where I have noclipped and had to restart my mission, 2 times, on the assassination mission of the man in the church, I fell through the map, and one time running roof to roof assassinating snipers I fell through the map and died. Only once have I had to manually restart the mission because I was running from guards and my guy climbed into the wall, and got me stuck. It did JUST release, so expect a couple bugs, but allround, this game has a decent story, seems like it is going to be incredibly long The Into took me an hour but unlike many other games, the intro doesnt suck.. It was worth 60 I think, dont let all the people withcomputers, or inability to change there graphics deter you.
