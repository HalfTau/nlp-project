This game has the potential to be a really good game. It fixes a lot of things that the past titles struggled on. The parkour is much better, smoother really. The fighting is more challenging, cant take on armies by yourself anymore. A lot of people say that this game went in a poor direction, I disagree, I think this game is more of an Assassins Creed game than the last 2. You arent some crazy guy with daddy issues and a anger problem that wins the revolutionary war with a hachet and you arent some pirate that spends 80 of his time on boat in a game that is famous for running/climbing on buildings. You a french verison of Ezio, origin story and all. Some people dont like that, but after the last 2 disappointments, it is nice to be back to what I enjoyed.Those are the ProsThe Cons.PAY 2 WIN.....WTF Ubisoft? You can literally start the game with some of the best equipment in the game by paying real money for it....Dont you make enough money Ubisoft? Why sell a game for 60 and then add P2W? Leave that for free2play MMO games.4patches and it is still broken. My computer is brand new and perfectly capable of playing any game out today.....except for this one apparently. Meet all the recommended requirements except my graphics card which is a Nvidia Gtx 680. In game when I look straight up 30fps when I look straight down 30fps when i looked in front of me to run....15fps...only when NPCs are around. The textures and shadows of NPCs are broken. You will have the exact same frame rate when your graphics and resulotion are set to Ultra High as you will when they are set to Low. Theres something wrong with that. You cant access certain chest without downloading the companion app.....also broken. Crashes over and over again, and I still cant get access to those stupid blue chests.I cannot recommend it at this time, maybe I will change my review when Ubisoft finshes the game.
