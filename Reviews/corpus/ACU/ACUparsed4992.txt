Ok, so i want to start with that I can run this game at 2560x1440p during gameplay i get anywhere from 4565 fps at all times. Since update 2 I get 60 fps during the cutscenes. I currently have 2 gtx 780s in sli with a I73820 processor. My computer seems to handle this game just fine. The gameplay is awesome and there is lots to do in this open world game.If you run sli the game may stutter from time to time which I absolutely hate. So i run my one gtx 780 now and get smooth gameplay with all settings on high I get anywhere from 3045 fps stutter free and lag free.Dont sync to their cloud my saved data became corrupt somehow and had to start over.
