I think i purchased this during the last summer sale it was  in a bundle with rogue. I saw a few reviews saying that the game always crashes after a bit but I figured that it was just for certain systems. I brought a fair few other games and never play ed this one for a long while. When I got round to actually playing it Im pretty sure it was running well for the first bit of the game. Somewhere along the line the game suddenly crashed. I booted it up again thinking that it was just a one time thing. It wasnt after about three crashes I was pretty angry. At this point I shouldve asked for a refund but I guess I just have a real problem with refunds and stuff like that I had refunded another game just a few days before as well. made the mistake of waiting a while for a patch or something to come. As far as I can tell there is no patch and there isnt going to be one. A few days ago I asked for a refund and guess what? I got an automated message telling me that I exceeded the 2 hour limit By 22 minutes for fcks sake and I had kept the game for too long. Im not very fond of rogue so there goes 50 something dollars.TLDR It crashes a lot dont buyIf anyone can tell me if there is a way to get a refund for this that I missed Id be grateful.
