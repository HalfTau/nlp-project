Terrible game. Good job ruining assassins creed. Who ever the  thought removing unarmed combat and the ability to die accidently from jumping off the wrong point and putting in a pay to win system deserves to be shot....I cant emphasize how much hate i have for your company. you guys and  your inability to tailor to your customers.....
