i have the hardware to run this game because i bought a 970 just for this game....it dose not excuse ubisoft for the bad optomisation for !ALL! platforms.but gegarding the gameplay i love the story alot . assassins creed is my favoret franchise aside from halo and elder scrolls.the combat is good but is a little overwelming.the amount of npcs on screen is amasing and can account for alot of the low frame rate but not all.i enjoyed this game alot but i wish it ran better so more people could enjoy it to.ps ubisoft spend more time optomising your games befor you loose your fan base... there should be no game braking bugs like this if you pushed your relees date forwerd.
