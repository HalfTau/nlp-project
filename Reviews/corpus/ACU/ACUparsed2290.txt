Ive decided to alter the review after I got my new rig.This game runs smoothly at 4060 FPS as of 2016, finally after two years this game can run decently. Atleast you DID fix it unlike what EA did to BF4 and Hardline.This game takes place in 1789, during the height of the French revolution. This game is beautiful as hell and looks stunning on PC.The story tells about Arno, a young assassin who decides to follow his fathers footsteps, along the way he realizes that avenging his father is not the only thing in mind but rather the fate of the humanity during its darkest hour in the late 18th century.This game offers so many things you can do for 40 bucks. The storyline takes some doing to be finished. It took me about 2025 hours to finish. Then youve got Paris stories, collectibles, stuff, coop missions and so on to do. Its so freaking awesome!Ignore the stupid transactions, you can still have lots of money without it! Just do side missions and open chests and lockpick locked chests to become a jew.By no means this game isnt boring, ignore the negative reviews but I must warn you. YOU NEED A REALLY GOOD PC RIG TO RUN THIS! This game is great but it requires alot from your CPU and GPU.I have I7 and GTX 970, and boy it runs like a dream.
