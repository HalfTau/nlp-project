okay, so my graphics card can handle this game just fine. beautiful graphics by the way. but when it comes to the CPU usage for this game. it just lags to hell and isnt even playable, does anyone know how to reduce the CPU usage for the game. ive tried reducing the resolution and graphics to the min. no change whatesoever.Updateafter looking into just the reviews on the steam page, not to mention all the online forums and benchmarks. nobody can get this to run at a steady 60 ing FPS. ridiculous. total regret for buying this game.  you ubisoft, youve completely screwed all PC players out of buying another AC game. this game was meant for the ing console apparently. guess i wont be getting my money back over this complete waste.
