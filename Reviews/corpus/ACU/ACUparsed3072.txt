heres my rigCPU i7 4790kGPU Radeon R9 290RAM 16 GB DDR3I love Assassins Creed Unity,.. despite the complains ive read about what issues people are having..luckily i dont have that issue.. and the game runs quite smoothly ULTRA HIGH SETTINGS on 1080p..the graphics are just AWESOME... perhaps the best graphics ive played..in my personal opinion the graphic and lighting is better than Ryse son of Rome..i give it 9/10
