Bugs and complaints aside, Im enjoying this game. The combat has been made more difficult which requires planning before entering missions head first. No more taking on twenty men on your own at least at the time of this recommendation. If you are or were a fan of AC 2, you will enjoy this game. I do recommend waiting for a patch because this game requires some serious hardware.
