Why everyone is bashing on this game, Ive got no idea, but so far Ive noticed nothing that anyone else has been complaining about. No crashes, no lag, no glitches. Aside for their hair bouncing like freakin crazy at the first cinematic, but that was it. This game has been great and continues to impress me. I love it.
