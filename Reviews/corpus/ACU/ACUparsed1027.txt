Oh my god, do I hate this gamePROS The graphics are nice The parkour feels a lot smootherCONS Uplay Awful controls The combat sucks. Upping the difficulty by making the counter button work only half the time is just not the way to go. Guns are OP. The sword of eden is garbage The cover system is terrible The game runs likeeven on low settings. The fps issues and stuttering are so bad that the game is borderline unplayableAll in all, this game is a mere 2/10. Do not buy this horror show unless youre a DIEHARD AC fan. This game is the absolute worst piece ofthe franchise has to offer. Get any of the older games instead of this trash
