Despite the fact my machine meets above minimum requirements, I still must lower the resolution to make the game even remotely playable, having said that, a highly detailed environment does not take well to pixelation, and now i can barely make out letters on the screen. Hopefully a future patch will fix this, but until then it is unplayable.
