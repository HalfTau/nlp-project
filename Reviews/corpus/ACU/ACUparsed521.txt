Ive been a fan of the AC series for a while and I think this one actually does a good job of getting back to the originally concept of being an assassin and taking down high profile targets.  Graphically I think this game is stunning on max settings and I absolutely love the look of revolution era France.   The parkour down mechanic as well the sneaking and cover mechanics are all very welcome changes that make stealth far more viable in this entry compared to pervious games which is good since your charaters combat ability has been reduced a good bit with the removal of the counter kill, a change I personally also like since it feels a bit more balanced. While I know this game was a mess on launch, personally Ive not had any of the technical issues so it seems to me most of the major problems have been patched.
