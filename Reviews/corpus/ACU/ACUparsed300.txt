I know it says I have 50 hours on the game, but a fair ammount of those were just leaving the game on while I tried to fix a bug, giving up, then forgeting to close it. This game has so many bugs its insane. I legitimatly thought at first they were trying to  go for a your animus has glitches so thats what these things around your screen are thing, but no, there was just a glitch where there were a tonne of missing pixels at the sides of the screen. I had to restart the entire game half way through because of a glitch where the boss who I wont spoil in case you care just wouldnt go to the next phase.The story isnt good either, mostly because Arno is extremly boring most of the time. I feel like they were trying to remake Ezio because everyone loved him.I did really like some of the new climbing mechanics though. A lot of the time Id go to the collectibles just because I wanted to parkour from one side of the map to the otherIf you want a good AC game, then go for the Ezio trilogy, Black Flag, and probably Origins.
