Surprisingly I quiet enjoy this game yes I do have frame rate trouble shitcomputer but it isnt that bad I mean I do run into glitches from time to time but I really dont see why people hate this game SO MUCH I mean YES the controls are very awkward especially after playing Rogue or Black Flag but apart from that this doesnt feel that bad BUT PLZ have a  good internet connection before you play this game because it is like seeing people teleporting if you have ainternet.
