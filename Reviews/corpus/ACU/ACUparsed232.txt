Alright game, personally I am a big fan of the Assassins Creed series but compared to other Assassins Creed games, its not as many people thought It would be, like whistling and hiding in bushes is gone, you now hide in crowds which is kindof impossible because in mission areas there arent crowds inside buildings or anything, everything else is fine but theres a lot of features from previous Assassins Creed games that are removed from this game.
