This game was awesome. the controlls werent that good but at least they are simple they work good enough. the game has a great plot, great weopons, great skills and combos and I would deffinitly recomend it five stars if I could rate it with stars. Not only is the game so good but it dosnt leave you with an empty feeling in your stomache when you beat the game, you can play minimisions when you are done or even better play the dead kings adon. The charachtars are realy relatable. I would say this game is totaly worth it
