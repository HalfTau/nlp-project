The first ever game I preordered was Assassins Creed 2. The latest game I preordered was Assassins Creed Unity. The game that first convinced me to preorder a game also belongs to the same series that ended any faith I had in the preordering system. And Ubisoft as well.This game doesnt even run. At. All. Not even on Console. Good luck getting above 60 FPS even on Medium settings.
