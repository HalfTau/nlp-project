This game came out back in November and its still hosed. Its now 2015 and I havent seen a patch for this game in some time, so I guess this is the best it will ever perform. Its basically unplayable due to frame rate drops and stuttering. Ive never seen a game that bounces between 90 FPS and single digits constantly. You have to drop the quality settings well below what you would normally have to in order to acheive playable framerates, just to overcome the FPS drops and stuttering. Its really a shame as its obvious the developers went to great lengths to make a game that is visually stunning its just a shame the frame rates jump around like a syphilitic pole cat...
