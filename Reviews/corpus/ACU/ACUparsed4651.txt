I am a fan of Assassins Creed Franchise but this is the worst Assassins Creed game I ever play. Do not buy the game until Ubisoft have optimize it completely or you will be sorry for wasting your money.Pros  Graphic New Style of gameplay EliseCons Worst key respond Low Framerate/Spike/Stutter Is like playing Beta release Parkour? Not as fluent as theyve said Ingame Currency The game is not 100 fully AC Unity, you have to add Helix if you want to play 100 ACU Being cheated by Ubisoft Crash and bug
