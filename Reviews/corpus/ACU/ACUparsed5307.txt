Gorgeous game, the requirements are way over the top though. I can run the game fine on Ultra high with my outdated pc.Waaaaaaaaaaaay too many bugs though. At this point its just not enjoyable. I keep falling through the world. Id wait until they fix all this, but lets be honest. Its Ubisoft. They arent gonna fixso might as well try to have fun.Also the frame rate is horrible.
