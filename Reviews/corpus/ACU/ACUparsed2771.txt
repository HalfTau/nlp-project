I feel this game is much better than people gave it. I do feel the story, I main part of the game, is WAY TOO rushed along. In general, each sequence is only TWO missions and one of them is the assassination. The game offers a huge amount of extra content, but the assassins contracts, the blue symbol, are all the exact same thing. Go here kill this extremist, or go here and steal this from a Templars. The Paris stories, the grey symbol, are good, none are the same, and most are voice acted. Possibly my favorite thing from this game are the murder mysteries, and they are all REALLY fun, you have got to play them. Ill give this game a 7/10 a rock solid game, but not amazing, and yes there are a handfull of glitches.
