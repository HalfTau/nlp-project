Coop is pretty good, single player is great, the customization has so much stuff in it! Gameplay is also better with the companion app such as more chests and able to set markers without opening the map Also I have no lag at all. So I would Recommend this 100. Also, combat is harder, meaning that you have to plan instead of rushing. Stealth is also upgraded, crouching and a cover system
