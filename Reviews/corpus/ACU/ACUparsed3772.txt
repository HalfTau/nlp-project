Except from the best visuals in the series, this latest iteration of Assasins Creed falls short to the rest of the series.The story will tire you with multiple names of characters who have little to no impact on the story itself. There is no new catchy jaw dropping sequences or info on the First Civilization, no Abstergo modern world gameplay except from 2 or 3 cutscenes. The entire campaing is really short and its ending dissapointing. Youll stare at the screen wondering... thats it????????????Regarding performance, unless you have a GeForce 970 dont bother with this game.Gameplay wise... some fight mechanics are absent such as fistfighting your opponents and disarming them if you with to. Fights are much more difficult now since opponents will not wait untill the fight animation of your caracter finishes before the start stabbing. They stab whenever they feel like it, make it much more difficult to face multiple opponents.Climbing is made simpler, and alot smoother, but there are alot of hickups. Lets say you scale a wall and you wish to jump to another wall behing you... well thats not possible anymore and its annoying.If you want an AC game with good visuals and a staggerings campaign, go for AC Black Flag.If you are an AC fan, having played all the other AC games... well cant keep you from buying this one, cant say I didnt warn you though....
