I played all AC games. i must say this was the most boring one i ever played. The side mission we bad, every activity outside of the main story wasnt worth it.I have a pc that should max it out yet i am getting lags at times. The game even after patching isnt optmized.I am close to finish the game and i must say its a fail on all levels.Nice graphics but 0/10 for everything else.Dont buy it unless it goes on sell. this is the reason  i bought it . it was on big sell.
