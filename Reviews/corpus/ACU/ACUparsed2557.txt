I felt like Ubisoft took their opportunity of presenting Assassins Creed in the new gen to make the series more accessible to new players by making it easy. I felt that the missions were too easy to get through and my mistakes were too easy to recover from unlike the previous instalments that required missions to be restarted if you tried to walk off the beaten path or simply kill everyone in the mission.The new game engine does look great and the play moves very smoothly, but I didnt feel like I warmed to this new assassin like many of the others, and the campaign didnt teach me much of the French Revolution like each of the previous instalments taught me about their own eras. Fun enough, just nothing great.
