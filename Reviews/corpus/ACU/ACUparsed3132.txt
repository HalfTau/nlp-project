In all honesty, Ubisoft has been going downhill with the AC franchise. Its only been getting worse and worse, and thats with the gliches. The games since Brotherhood are being rushed and you can tell with all of the gliches. This game is so bad about that, that I cant even play it. Things move that arent supposed to and the game ends up looking like some three year old  monkey made it in Garrys Mod in less than thirty minutes. The story is still good, but this game is in DIRE need of an upgrade. It needs to go back to the developers so they can fix the  performance issues.
