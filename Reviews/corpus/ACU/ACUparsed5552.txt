Great game  only just played a little, but so far so good. Its rough and not all smooth, but without a doubt playable. Lowered the settings to Minimal and it helped quite a bit. It doesnt look nearly as beautiful as it should, but its still great and better than a laggy experience.The story seems fun, and the controls are easy. Some what easier than Black Flag in my opinion but also different.I wont write a whole lot about it  just making a review that the game isnt as bad as everyone is saying. Of course it needs to be patched and worked on further, no doubt. And it got some glitches too. But thats okay for now.My computer specsWindows 7 64 bitGraphics card AMD Radeon HD 6800 series with a broken fan no lessProcessor IntelR CoreTM i7 CPU 920  2.67GHzRAM 12GB
