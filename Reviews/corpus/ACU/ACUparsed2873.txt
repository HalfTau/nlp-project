While many did not like this game I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Arno was not an unfeeling boy like Connor and I liked his character well enough. However, my main reason for liking this game was the environment. The city was amazing and I liked this city the most out of all the past AC environments. That being said, I can see why some people gave it bad reviews. I ran across a couple bugs, and even gave up on playing the game for a couple months since it kept crashing on me. Even through that, I can say that I certainly recommend the game, definitely now that the bugs are worked out. Now to finish AC Rogue.
