The scenery is so perfectToobad the gameplay sucks so hard. With the random laggs and the assasin not listening to your commands just waiting 20 seconds to get killed slowly by a gunman...It would have been a 9 / 10 if the game worked. But now I just dont recommend it. Only if it was free I should. Just to hang around in Paris for some hours.
