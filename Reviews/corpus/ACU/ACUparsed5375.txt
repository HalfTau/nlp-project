I personally like the game, but its QUITE buggy. I have about 6 hours of gameplay, and Ive fallen through the floor about 5 times now and gotten stuck in midair twice. also, its combat isnt as fluent as it should be and some the police are way OP, and stupid. plus you cant get out of the way of gunshots cuz everyone is a sharpshooter who can hit you even if youre running 100 meters away. Also, the fps in this game is terrible unless you have like a 10k computer and even on low settings, it still has random fps drops and it crashes all the time in the beginning. Id wait till its patched up a bit more before buying
