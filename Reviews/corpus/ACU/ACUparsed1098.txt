I enjoyed this game.This game isntNice graphicsCool parkourMore character customizationCoop missionsA nice selection of weaponsI liked the finisher animationsThe story was boring at some points, ends in a boring clicheA few movement bugsFor me the bugs only appear on coopDefinetly worth buying from a sale4/5
