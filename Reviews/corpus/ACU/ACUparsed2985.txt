Amazing graphics, voice acting and cool background story, some things to keep that seemed interesting were the online coop features, thought it was very unstable in the beginning. Also the new detective mini games were fun and interesting addition. But as interesting unique mini games, a lot of the activities, as usual, become very repetitive and boring after a while, leaving a lot left undone since it doesnt bring anything new to the game, but just a couple of costumes.Thought it took them a lot of time to make it 100 playable and having problems to maintaint a connection to the server to access all features, this functions become a little annoying after a while. The story is not the best from the franchise, but very enjoyable.7.6/10
