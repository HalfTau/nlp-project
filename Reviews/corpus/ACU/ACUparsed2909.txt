Literally no story progression, Glitches galore, wasted not only money but 142 hours just holding on to false hope it would be better, The main thing about the game the coop is not only a disaster there is hardly any coop missions, and so on and so forth. I could write a entire book on this hunk of crap about its flaws and barely can make a sentence with its pros. In other words STAY AWAY save money get rogue.
