A beautiful game. I personally love the Assassins Creeds franchise but at launch this game had alot of problems, including optimization probems. After everything getting fixed, its a joy to play it.I recommend people to get it only if your computer can run it at recommended settings or near there. Dont get this game for the story mode, get it for the visual and gameplay.
