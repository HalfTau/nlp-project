Okey...Im not going to talk any This game has great thoughts about everything. But there are some annoyng stuffs. Im playing on PC, Ive heard that this game is not PC friendly but is so easy to make it so, such as sprinting, it is the same button to make you climping and such as. It should be an optoin to change every button for every kind of playing styles, as fighting, climping and just running around, like in The Witcher 3. When Im running around he starts to try to climp on anything he cans, which is very annoyng. Also when he is climping it is very small chance he is going to do what you whant to. In that case it would be better to play in 1p. like I want in almost every game I play, like I want it in The Witcher. Then there is another thing. When I sneaking around in some place, going to assassinate someone in a mission and I fale in the middle of that, they put me foreward not backwards, so Ive got in a place I havent woked for to go on. I want to try again and do better that time. This thing is realy annoyng. And then it is the combat sistem. It is very vell done but at some place it realy bugs me. Like when parring, or doing some knockout stuff. Some times it happens way to late or doesent happent anyway. That is realy annoyng.There are some bugs. The game once glitched and it froze I had to restart it. The sound when in fights drop off in few secs. from the sword and such as.Okey, Ive made my point. I dont recommend this game if those things would bother you.Sorry for bad english.
