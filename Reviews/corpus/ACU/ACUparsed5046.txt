Dont buy this game now, Id probably hold out until it eventually goes on sale or had have all its performance issues fixed.This game right now is unplayable for me, with its low framerates  buggy gameplay.Even as loyal Assassins Creed fan since the very first game, I cant defend it at all.This rating will be changed once I can actually play this game. Until then, it is rotting in my library.
