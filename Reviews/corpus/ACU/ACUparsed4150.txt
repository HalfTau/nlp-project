All you people are just hating on the game because your computers arent strong enough to run it.if you have spent what i would call a decent amount of money on your computer or you consider it a gaming computer, then running the game shouldnt be a problem.And the game it self is fun.Mostly i just wanted to get the point across. if you have a strong computer. But the game!
