Unlike other AC games this ones different, the combat is not that good, they took away many things like having different weapons with you and also they removed the goddamn whistle mechanic for stealth I dont reccomend this game if this is your first or second AC game, but if youre an assassins creed fan sure this is still fun to play and the story is ok, the parkour for me is somewhat better than before in different aspects.
