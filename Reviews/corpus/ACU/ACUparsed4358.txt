I love this game. Its a lot of fun and so much to do. I found my sword of choice, the katana. It has some wicked moves. The world in the game Paris is amazing, so many unique buildings and people. I cant believe they could have so many people in the game. There are so many things going on in the city, its fun just to walk around and see all the little things they added. Ive played coop and thats been fun too. Working out ways with your friends to have mission success is quite rewarding. The single player story is getting really heated up. I cant wait to do more missions. Its like being in a movie, so cool.Some of the people have had problems with the game, so Im sure thats a turn off. Ive only had one crash and I was in the menu at the time. Everything else is great. This is my first AC game. Not sure if this will help, but my pc specs are Windows 8.1 64bit, cpu 4770k, gpu 970, 16 gigs of ram. Hopefully the new update help out most. Im sure it wouldnt help all, but almost every computer is different. Hope this help out.
