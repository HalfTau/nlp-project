The best Assassins Creed game yet, and a welcome return to the series core.For the first time since AC1, the gameplay is actually focused on stealth. A crouch and cover system has been added, and crowds are finally large enough to truly disappear in. The new openended mission structure allows for much more freedom in play and feels more fitting of an openworld game. The missions are actually fun to play and focus on assassinations something strangely absent of late from a series with the word Assassin in its title, not just a distraction from the openworld playground. The economy has been balanced so that there is progression to attaining new gear and various upgrades and with all the gear affecting player stats, the customization finally serves a purpose. The movement and traversal system has been improved and, though still not perfect, is a big step forward.Unitys story isnt great, but at least makes more sense momenttomoment than previous entries. Some features have been cut such as sending the brotherhood on missions, but most of it felt like game mechanic fluff, tacked on to avoid refining the core mechanics in place, which is what Unity has done. I do, however, miss the assassin contract missions.Yes, the required system specs are high, but the game looks amazing and renders tons of NPCs. Also yes, there are some techincal issues, but Ive experienced nothing truly game breaking so far, and hopefully it will be patched. Finally, the microtansactions no paywalls and companion app stuff are there, and are annoying, but ignorable.Overall, this is easily the best game in the series. The game just does so much right, despite its technical issues. If your rig can handle it, and you like stealth games, I definitely recommend picking this up.
