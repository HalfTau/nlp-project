When I think about Assassins Creed Unity I cant help but wonder why it doesnt have a beta tag on it. To be fair most if not all of the Assassins Creed games on pc are pretty well optimized when compaired to ACU. Now since november many people have been having issues with ACU due to its incredably poor optimization from glitches like falling through the world to errors where you lose all of your save data I am a victim to both. My pc is below the minimum system specs for this game and can still run it with some massive frame drops, but some people with reccomended specs or well above that cant even play the game. I love the Assassins Creed game series and this one would probably had been the best yet if it didnt have the issues it does. Over all the game is fun but dont bother buying it on pc until its issues have been fully patched dont expect a patch.
