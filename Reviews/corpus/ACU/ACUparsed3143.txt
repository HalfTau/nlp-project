After the sensational Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, I did not anticipate that a successor could be any better. But the show must go on, so Assassins Creed Unity hit stores.First of all Black Flag was designed on the old console generation PS3  XBoX360 and exceeded the Assassins Creed 1 tale by far sailing and swashbuckling pirates are not very stealthy. Now, with the new instalment, the makers could have preceded with sea fights and stuff and completely alienate their franchise OR do something completely different. And so they did, by erasing all ships and going back to solid land. Paris sets a wonderful and big stage to explore. Though its not as big as the Caribbean Sea it certainly has more than enough to explore to make both games even. However, the new console generations demanded new graphics and therefore a lot more all from scratch programming. The game, its DLC Dead Kings as well as the App and Assassins Creed Initiateswere buggy to the point of being unplayable. Most of the issues are fixed by now, but it is a disappointment to by a AAAtitle and get crapware.However, Unity does a lot of things right by going some steps backwards. Everything that made the franchise memorable has been redone parkouring, inventory, people, fighting and multiplayer are all brand new and though not perfect gives a solid feeling. That promises more and even better instalments in the future.My creed Its pure Assassins Creed and bugs free. Dont expect another Black Flag but enjoy the revolutionary Paris. And for those who like the franchise its a mustplay anyway.
