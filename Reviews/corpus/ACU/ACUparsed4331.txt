If you are a fan of the Assassins Creed series then you will absolutely enjoy this game as much as i did! This game has a great story and overall was an amazing game. I will admit that there were numerous problems within the first couple of days upon release but with each patch jthat Ubisoft provides it just gets better! This was a great game that i certainly reccomend!
