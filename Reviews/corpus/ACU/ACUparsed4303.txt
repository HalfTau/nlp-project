I have been a long time supporter of the franchise, but I cannot in good conscious recommend a game as seriously flawed as this. Here is a rundown of the serious faults I found with this game.1. Bug ridden release I would occasionally fall through the map, notre dame, barrels that would desychronize the game. Invisible enemies or NPCs character loaded headless.2. Poorly Optimized There are times when the game would stutter due to frame rate issues or lock up due to poor coding. My computer doesnt run quad SLI but its no slouch either.3. Poor Integration across different platforms Companion App and AC Initiates would not register completion of quests or events inside of games. Besides that, why would you even release a product before its accessory components arent even complete.4. Story In the past ubisoft sucess as been their storytelling by tying in their story within significant historical moments in time. To that effect being thrown into revolutionary France and tie in such an underwhelming plot is a genuine injustice to past games that had always put importance of how assassins and templars shaped history. The new main lead Arno suffers from the same problem of previous games being poorly fleshed out with no real personality of their own. That is assuming Ubisoft wasnt going for boring character does x.5. Micro Transactions/Season Pass I am not against microtransactions as a whole. In fact I loved it in Mass Effect 3. However, at an already steep price point given that most peoplelike myself pay for the season pass is pretty dissapointing.
