Pretty Paris! Awesome game, awesome graphics. What do you mean glitches? The game runs fine on my sub par hardware i7, Geforce 850m, 8 GB RAM.. I mean, sure I dont expect 60 fps on such hardware, but I do get a manageable 2030 FPS, that runs great, with high graphic detail. So stop whining, and check your computers, the game is well designed.La liberte ou la mort!!
