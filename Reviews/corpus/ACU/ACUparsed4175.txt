Even in the lowest settings, the game has such a low frame rate, that its just unplayeable. Ive seen games with better graphics that are light to my PC, in comparison with this game. For a long time Ice been waiting for an Assassins Creed in the french revolution. But now Im fustrated. If Ubisoft doesnt add new patches, so I can play the game, even in the lowest settings, I will want my money back.
