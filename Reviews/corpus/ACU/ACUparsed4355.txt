To be honest, I dont know what everyone are having trouble with. Ive had three crashes, and that was because i had forgot to update my graphic card. The game itself runs at about 50 frames on max settings i usually play at medium. The story is good. The coop is amazing. Yes, there are frame drops when a big crowd spawns, but it only lasts for a few seconds. I did find a couple glitches here and there, like when you assassinate someone and their corpse gets stuck in the wall, but overall the game is totally worth it, expecially if you are planning to play coop with a couple of friends.I recommend that you check if your pc is good enough before buying it since it is a next gen game9/10 will play again.
