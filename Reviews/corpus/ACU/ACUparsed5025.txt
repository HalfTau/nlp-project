I just want to begin by saying I am basing this off my personal experience and understand that plenty of people are having technical issues however I am not 1 of them.This game lacks some of the story depth of previous assassins creeds titles but makes up for it in my opinion by the sheer scope of the game world, Paris is huge and full of collectables and side missions that can keep you occupied for quite some time.  The games new combat system seems well received by what Ive seen however I personally do miss the instant death counters of previous games, but not having god mode does make you approach missions with a more stealth frame of mind then the old run and stab approach atleast until you get better gear.  The game does lack the fun and quirky side characters of previous games however i do enjoy how smooth the main character is.  The new parkour system works a treat after you get use to it with less moments of getting stuck on a wall then previous titles.Pros Massive and beutiful city Lots of side quests and collectables Plenty of item customization including being able to spec for different play styles. Fun multiplayer coop missions Beutiful graphics Improved parkourCons Reported issues with frame rates personally i dont have this issue No instant kill counters personal preference however a lot of people like this change Story doesnt have the depth of previous games still pretty fun though No quirky side characters as in Leonardo from 2 or blackbeard etc from BF Some clipping issues etc pretty sure they have been fxed in a patchConclusionIf your one of the people who really enjoyed going around ac2 collecting every little thing and doing side quests I strongly recommend this game, the game does have its flaws however the sheer scope they aimed for is magneficent.  Even the story while worse then some previous titles is decent and i much prefer the game as a whole to say AC3 haha.7/10
