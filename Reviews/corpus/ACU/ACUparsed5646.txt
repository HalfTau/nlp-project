This game is running great on a system below min specs and it is packed with content. It is by far the most innovative Assassins Creed game yet, it adds player progression including custom outfits and loadouts. The characters are likeable and the main character, Arno Victor Dorian is funny and has a interesting personality. Unity has a few bugs but nothing is gamebreaking at all, and will likely be patched. Please note I am not senselessly defending this game, I am trying to act as though I never played a Assassins Creed game, please know that most of the bad reviews are biased against the game.I hope you consider picking this up I am enjoying it so far.
