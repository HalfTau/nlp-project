Tried so hard to be invested in the story and this french revolution but after playing rouge this was a let down even though i bought it on sale i find myself wishing for a refund, arno is such a clumsy assassin in my opinion instead of the powerful strong assassin i was looking for with a strong story line the visually stunning atmosphere couldnt make up for the fact that Arno is not as insteresting as other assassins i deeply enjoyed rouge and i find myself disgusted by this sadly enough this part of the assassins storyline just let me down really hard
