This is partly my fault for having a  computer, but I turned everything down on the graphics anf I get about 5 frames, Im gonna get some new parts tomorrow to help out all my games and hopefully I can see if that improved ACU, I still have hope for this game as we all should if we are all ttrue fans, plus this game only just came out so let them put in a few patches and see if it gets any better.
