It seems the performance issues have been resolved.  I bought the game after I read the improvements of Patch 5 and I am very pleased with the framerates and gameplay.  I have a system that barely meets the minimum requirements but Ive not had any of the performance issues that were apparently plaguing the game at launch.  I am enjoying the game and would recommend it to anyone that liked the others in this series.
