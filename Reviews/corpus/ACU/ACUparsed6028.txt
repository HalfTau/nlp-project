Cant recommend this game based on how nearly unplayable it is right now. Only played the first few missions but more than the problems with the FPS frames per second being lower than acceptable is the lack of consistantsy. The extreme frame dropping makes understanding whats going on near to impossible and actually controling ur character actually impossiibleP.S.and the low end system requirements are pure bs to pump up sales for nvidea, Im playing on a GTX 660 they say it wont run on anything less than a 680 which is a 500 card and it looks great it just doesnt play great. That usually means u lack for processing power or the game is poorly optimized. I have an AMD FX6300 6 core so my money is on crap optimization which would be par for the corse considering were talking about Ubisoft.Buy and enjoy this game if you have a PS4 or an xbox. For PC? dont bother no matter how beefy your system is
