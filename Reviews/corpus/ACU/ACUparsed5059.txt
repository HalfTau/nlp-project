I never thought I would do this for an Assassins Creed game. I love this series but do not like this game.Why?Because I cant play it. BY THE WAY, I GOT AN ALIENWARE WHICH COST ME 3K!There is so many technical issues that I physically cannot play the game. My review will remain negative until I can actually get my moneys worth and play the damn thing.
