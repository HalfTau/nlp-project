Had this game over a month now preordered and wish I hadnt.  4 updates from Ubisoft now and the game is still mostly unplayable on my PC.  I have SLI GTX970 graphics cards for crying out loud.  With one of those Graphics cards I got Far Cry 4 for free, and that game runs absolutely beautifully!!  Perhaps the AC team should take a few notes from the FC team.At this point Im only 30 through the game and refuse to play it until they get the graphics working better.
