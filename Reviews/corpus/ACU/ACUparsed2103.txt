Id love to review ACU but to do that the game would actually have to run. One would think that over a year after release most show stopping would have been worked out. Nope the only thing I get are sorry we got your money you can go suck a fat one. See you next year for another installment of assassins creed ourstill doesnt work. I get better support from the pirates. Id post a review for ACR but I cant even get that run longer than steam requires to let me able to  about another  ubi product.
