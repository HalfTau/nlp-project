I cant play the game for some reason when I want to play ACU with Uplay it always say that the server is unveliable what does it mean? Does that mean that Uplay is doing something? Or like some game problems or patch,not sure about the patch, also I heard people saying that patch 6 is coming I dont know when but hope it let me play the game?
