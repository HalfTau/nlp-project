This game was the game of great ideas and broken dreams.1. A new parkour system that lets you ascend or descend your surroundings as the push of a button... but it turns out that the game only guesses right 2/3 times which object youre going towards.2. A new graphics engine that allows HUNDREDS of people on screen at once... but those hundreds of people are look like faceless manikins colored in with pastels.3. A new fighting system makes enemies harder to fight, bringing about an air of realism to the game and keeping you from easily staying on the defensive... but the constant shift in camera angles and close quarters make it impossible to fight if youre not in the open.This game is massively under optomized, full of bugs, full of faceles characters and IMO I woudnt buy it for more than 20.
