Everyone just keeps ranting about how bad this game is, how bad it is optimized and how evil ubisoft is.And yet, there is you, the reader, who still doesnt trust all the negative reviews and desperately searching for a good positive review. Ill try to give you one.So, what isand why should you buy it?As I am a guy who played all of the AC games id say this is second best in my personal list after AC 1. Now ill explain why Back in 2007, Assassins Creed became famous thanks to its historical setting, gameplay mixed with fighting, freerunning and stealth and, of course, the storyline.Now its 2014, and canimpress fans and new players with same, but improved things that AC1 had?Yes, it sure can. If you close your eyes at bad optimization, microtanscations and bugs, you get a great game.The story is enjoyable, the visuals are pretty and gameplay is fun.Storyline  As you might have heard before, this game centers mostly around Arno Dorian, and his story. I am not going to spoil you anything. Ill just say that the story is enjoyable. Coop in this game is explained as teaming up with other initiates to do assassin stuff.Gameplay  What ubisoft did right about Unity is that now you can craft your own assassin to adapt to your playstyle. Want to charge in and slash everyone you meet in the way? Check. Want to be stealthy? Check. Stealth in this game finally makes you feel like youre a damn assassin and the big missions where you have to assassinate important target now has many ways how you can kill him. If you play stealthy, game feels much more enjoyable than just slashing everyone. Oh, about slashing The combat system in this game has improved and now it offers a stiff challenge. One wrong move and youre dead.Overall, ubisoft created a great game than you can dive in for weeks. Unlock all the unlockables, do all the side missions, play coop and you can waste 100 hours in this., a great experience.
