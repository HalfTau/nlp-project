 YOU ASSASSINS CREED UNITY AND  YOU UBISOFT! Sorry its just that I have had a blind love for this serise and this is unacceptable. Dayz has better fps than this, let that sink in... DAYZ IS IN ALPHA! I have a GTX 970 and will admit to having acpu but if I can run Shadows of Mordor and Ultra 1080p with a 60 fps and sometimes more that is absoluteTO YOUR FACE INSULTING! Like is said the Assassins Creed games have been some of my favorties starting with the first and getting better each time excluding Brotherhood and Revolations while good come on they were DLC at best. Now I have a huge issue to bring up, Ubisoft hates PC users made clear here as it is the worst PC port since Dark Souls. For me I am left with playing on the lowest settings and still have a crash every cutsence... WHY!? This is just down right lazy and I refuse to buy any more Ubisoft games ever and this is coming as the Farcry franchise deal is happing and I loved Far Cry 3 but cant bring myself to buy is and support the company that is being called worse than EA. I cant recomend this game to anyone and I was one of the first to jump on the hype train and say it will be the best game of 2014. I WAS WRONG. Save your money nothing to see here its Assassins Creed 2 with fashyish new graphics.Update The game was fixed but guess what its ing boring go figure 1/100 go  your cash grab ubisoft tred lightly with the next one there are refunds you scum. Also I upgraded my cpu to an i5 and it still looks like atook aso yeah  this game and if this is how they all are going to be then have fun Assassins Creed join theshow that is quickly becoming the AAA games market.
