Umm.... ye... well, the city is nice. The stor is told quite well BUT theres very little assassin/templar/eden/First stuff going on. I suppose for a newbie it would be good but for those of us that play AC for the story... well...Graphics is by far the best yet gameplay is on par or in some cases even worse than AC III, luckily Arno is a bit better than Connor, albeit by a fraction.Dont get me wrong, its a decent game, it just doesnt live up to AC standard. If you like AC then buy it... when its on sale. I made the mistake of pulling 80 for it and the season pass... not worth that much by a long shot
