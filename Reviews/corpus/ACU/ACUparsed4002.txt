You guys screwed up on this one. This thing has more bugs than an early access game and thats saying something. Its just constantly crashing all the time. Cant get through one hour and a half without crashing.puts some patches up guys. ive already waited a LONG time to get it and its still all freakishly buggy, dude runs weird Chests wont open, Swords killing slashing air and killing dudes from 5 feet away, same with the should shove. its like 3 feet away and the dude compressed so much air it threw the opponent off. CMON! that sucks!I freaking LOVE this franchise and you guyrs are absolutely killing my experience man.Other than that it looks nice.
