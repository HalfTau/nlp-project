I cant say if the game sucks or not due to the bug and lagging issues, but other than that the graphics werent terrible. I would just reccomend waiting till mid to late Feburary to see if they have fixed most of thier problems. In my opinion these bugs and lags are completely expected since Ubisoft is trying to go above and beyond with this Assassins Creed. As of right now i consider this game completly unplayable.
