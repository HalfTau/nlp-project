This game was good, but could have been better. Story was fine IMO, but gameplay got a lot of improvements, efforts, and I think its worth to mention. People think its full of bugs, but honestly, I played this game for long, and I didnt have much bugs. The only ones I had were big ones that would prevent me from finishing a mission, but once again, they were rare.OverallStealth and parkour are better. Need improvements here and there, but its better already.Multiplayer is good. Even though it could be better, but the idea is here.Graphics are better. Be sure to have a good PC before buying it though.Atmosphere is good. Places are nice to parkour/sneak in. No day/night cycle !Replayability. You can replay some missions in multiplayer, or do them alone.Optimization. Again, be sure to have a good PC, unless you enjoy slideshows. 1fps coughBugs. Again, I did not have a lot of them, but it was bothering at times when I had them.IA is bad.  IA is exploitable is every stealth game, but here, its still bad.Load times. A lot of them, and theyre long.Uplay.Give it a try, its not as bad as people want you to believe.
