OH BOY ASSASSINS CREED. IVE NEVER PLAYED ONE OF THESE BEFORE. This game is unique and totally isnt part of an entire franchise built around the same thing! Well. Okay. Maybe it is. But I like the RPG elements. You know. Maybe they should open up a game where you start off as acovered little street punk that uses RPG elements to advance into the ranks of a full fledged killer. And make it multiplayer. . Why am I not making these games.Its okay if it doesnt crash, but its more of the same Get a friend to play it with you. Good/10
