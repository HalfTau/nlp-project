This game is a total disaster.The frames dropped next to nothing even in window mode.The game saves glitched out and kept forcing me to go to the DLC undead kings So I had to delete my progress and start all over again, from scratch.The Controls didnt respond whenever I tried to tell my character to climb up down or whatever other angle you could think of. It just didnt work and when it did want to work. It clung to practically everysingle texture I could never want to be clung to, sometimes even being stuck INSIDE the textures.Same consumption was low, the entiretime I never seen it spike over 3.5 gigs of ram consumption.and GPU rendering never broke a sweat. IT just lagged out, and crashed.I checked over their lists to see if my hardware met the system requirements and it does.Ubisoft needs to slow down on these releases coming out so fast. Its starting to show now, and a company should do much better testing before releasing a game in this state. Its junk status, and could even be labled one of the worst releases ive ever gotten from Ubisoft of all time.I love the game series and im trying hard to ride it out. However if Rouge Is this bad, Ill never purchase a game from this franchise again. And I really mean this.Bottom line. Unless youre a hardcore fan already hooked on the story line.DONT get this game.WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAN BASE? WHY DID YOU LEAVE US HANGING LIKE THIS?At least give us a patch to fix these terrible bugs.
