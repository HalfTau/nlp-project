it is the exact same as every other assass creed game, I know I shouldnt have gotten my hopes up after the series peaked with black flag pirates, your own ship, your own freaking island, dont even try to argue that black flag isnt the best one.I cannot express how angry this game made me, they give you this phantom blade t so you can silently kill people from a distance and it literally doesnt work, I cannot remember how many times I have shot someone with it, only to have them go ah, there is a blade sticking out of my temple, better alert everyone in 5 kilometeres and go on a manhunt for this one guythere are collectables every five feet because after making black flag they wanted to somehow put as much random stuff into about 1/20th the areaAssass creed is dead in the water after black flag and I would like to be proved wrong but really I am just dredging through these games so I can have story and stab peeps
