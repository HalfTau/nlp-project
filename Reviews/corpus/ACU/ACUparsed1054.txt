There are things this game does incredible well the customization is amazing. You make your character look unique and badass and you just love it. Also the online game play missions are fun to do, I sometimes would solo a ranked 5 4man mission to get the cool looking gear that I wanted. The story line is decent, but incredibly predictable. Which leads to its downfall. While playing the game and grinding the outfits and doing the missions I had fun. But when the ending came around and was what I had predicted at the first 30 min of the game, and then the game ends... it just drains everything out of the game. You dont want to continue doing missions your just like ... ok... Honestly Arno never really was that interesting of a character. More downsides are the game is laggy and buggy as hell, but still fun. This is the primary issue with multiplayer. Sometimes you lag while fighting and die like a useless noob and it just feels bad.
