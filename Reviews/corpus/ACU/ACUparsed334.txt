This game at release was a HUGE letdown. They have since updated it and have done great things for it, optimizing the graphics, bugs and many other things. The saddest part about this was if Ubisoft took their time with it the first time around, it would have been much more well recieved. I feel like this has been judged the most out of all of the games for the developers mistakes. Unity needed time. Now that it has had it, it is one of the most underrated Assassins games in the series so far
