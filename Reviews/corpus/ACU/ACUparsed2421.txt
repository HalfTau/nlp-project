As a great fan of the series I really have to say that Unity did disapoint me. The story of Arno Dorian is sadly, the weakest of the whole series. Game performance however is now stable and the game ran great on my PC.Specs I53570K, 16GB RAM, GTX970Lots of cool stuff from older parts, I really missed in this part. No whistling in haystacks anymore, no tranquilizer darts, no horseback riding, no fellow assassins to assign to missions or call to help in dire situations. No fighting with wrist blades anymore, no disarming of enemies, no cool bombs, no turf wars, well the list is long .So what is cool about the game? Well besides of the great graphics and love for detail, Versailles nearly looked like the original even recognized some artwork ingame I saw there, when I visited Versailles in 2009 the CooP Missions are much fun to play. Playing it together in a group with three other Assassins is worth trying. Besides that, it is the usual, openning chests, doing some assassination jobs, solving some murders, climbing some watch towers and so on.All in all I have to say, it is the weakest game of the whole saga. Not a good job by Ubisoft to make their nextgen launch title so poorly. I hope they will do better with AC Syndicate.For a real fan of the series I can recommend it, for all others who are new to the series, play AC Rogue its way better and has a breath taking story D
