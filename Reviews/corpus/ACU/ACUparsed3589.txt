Sorry to burst your bubbles Radeon Users. Unity hardly supports it. You will get Frame Skipping. I find it weird how Ubisoft didnt allow this. I understand this due to increase business  and agreements, however, they could of at least put it on the lowest for Nvida users so at least some Radeon users could Play it.Purposely got this desktop for this game. Doesnt run very well. Huge Frame skips, and everything is on low.Desktop specs AMD 9590 4.8ghz EIGHTCORERadeon RTX 280 I didnt get 285 or 290 due to the fact of loud sounds. Id have to get an upgraded fan with silence.Ubisoft, help us Radeon users! Yes, i understand money, but even the small amounts help! Try lowering the Nvida so us Radeons can play.Thanks for understanding.
