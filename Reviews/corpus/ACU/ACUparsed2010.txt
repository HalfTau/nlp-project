Well to put it simply this game is good, yeah very good yet... so buggy. yes buggy as hell, even after its fifth patch just dont know which part of this game ubi team had fix with. FYI my system set up  intel core i5 6600, zotac gtx 980 amp, patriot viper4 ddr4 8GB 2400mhz kit, msi z170a gaming 3, samsung ssd 850 evo. NP buy it if theres  sale really not worth the money if buy with the regular price.
