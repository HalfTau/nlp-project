With 18 hours of gameplay, and somewhat of a smooth ride through the game on a Core i3, and a GTX 860M 2GB graphics card, I was somewhat surprised I was even able to run it on high settings, in 720p of course. But when ing Ubisoft gave away the Dead Kings DLC for free, I was like, Oh cool, free stuff because of the horrible launch! Buthit the fan and went all  over my ceiling. The game after updating the free DLC suddenly crashes every 9/10 attempts, as soon as the AC Unity logo pops up, and it goes right onto desktop. My computer freezes up and  itself, so I have to do a forceful shutdown. I checked my drivers, and OS version, everything was uptodate.  you EA, I want my money back because I completely uninstalled your giant turd of a game from my lovely computer. Im done ranting.  9000/10
