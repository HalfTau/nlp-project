I really enjoyed this game. I was always a fan of the series but that didnt affect my playthrough as this title was different than the other ones.Pros  Amazing graphics Experienced very rare bugs Nice Customization of character Combat feels great Climbing up and down is much more fluid than in other gamesCons  Very short campaign Map is overcumbered with things to do and loot No developpement on the battle between abstergo and the assassins outisde the animus.All in all, I had much fun with this game. Campaign was too short for me to fully experience the game. Theres some area I only visited once and never had the need to go there again. I had very few bugs and it didnt break the immersion. The combat is better than in previous game in my opinion. What I remember most about the game is not the story but how gorgeous it looked. For 30 bucks, I felt like it was worth my time and money.
