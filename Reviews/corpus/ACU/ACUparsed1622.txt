This game was terrible but now its ok. I really love Ubisofts games because they often have coop mode. Im a big fan of AC so this game is not enough good but its fun and better than AC Syndicate. I have no proble with Uplay, the coop mode are really good.Graphics Good too much NPC and i cant interact with themStory Normal  Nothing special but they make the ending so badMusic Bad It could be good but the previous ACs  soundtrack are extremely goodMy score 6.5 it could be 7 if they repect PC players
