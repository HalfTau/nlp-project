The reviews are about 50/50 for the game at this point. After playing about 15 hours of the game, I can honestly say this game hadtons of potential. I say HAD, because Ubisoft deleted my game save on my account, and the game isnt so enjoyable as to replay it up to that point. I have a pretty nice rig, and there is just too much frigging lag to enjoy the game. Sorry, but Ubisoft, you have upset an avid AC fan for years.
