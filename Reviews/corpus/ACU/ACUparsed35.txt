Game runs fine, looks good, as soon as i try to Synchronise the first paris viewpoint, and uplay tries to make a note of it the game crashes. Tried turning off both my antivirus and firewall, still crashes, tried updating uplay still crashes. The annoying part of it is that the game runs just fine! its Ubisofts ing surveillance system poorly disguised as a gamelauncher that crashes it!
