Drastically faulty, to the extent where I could not play the game on my Nvidia laptop. Reported problems on PS4 also. Will be asking for a return, but Steam/Valve support is slow and disorganised when issues arrive they only want to take your money. Ubisoft is no better, being unable to detect the problems prior to release
