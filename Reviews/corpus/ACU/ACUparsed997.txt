This is one of worst games ever. You cant fly jets or helicopters, and you cant drive tanks or jeeps. WTF! This game is soooo boring, all you do are climb on buildings, bunnyhop rooftop to rooftop, and stab people. WOOOOW! That tooootally does NOT get repetitive and boring at all! I thought this was going to be a shooter game. So disappointed.This game does not even have destructible environment or 64 player per server.Forget this stupid game. Im going to go back playing Battlefield.At least DICE knows how to make innovative games. Ubisoft releases the same game every year and idiots keep on buying it LOL.
