Warning The controls in this game are the most frustrating yet in the AC series. Freerunning is overall better, but gets completely ruined when your character refuses to do what you tell it to. Whether its go through a window or jump off a ledge instead of running along it.The fight mechanics are much more difficult in this iteration as well you have to earn and spend skill points to unlock abilities like double assassinations or air assassinations. I dont know if thats necessarily bad, but is generally much more frustrating. I do like the new uniform/armor unlocking system. The graphics are definitely a step up, as is the quality of the map and density of NPCs. I do think the guards are a little overly aggressive though.Overall, I think that all the mildly annoying elements from past AC games get amplified in this one, and GREATLY take away from the improvements. Final note do not go to Francia until you are ready to start the Dead Kings DLC. Once you go there you can not exit until you complete the 1st memory sequence, and this can be pretty difficult and frustrating if you head over to try exploring as soon as it is unlocked. I cannot recommend this game, they were just too effective in taking the fun out of it.
