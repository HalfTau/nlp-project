Game runs like a fat kid looking for broccoli. I have an R9 270X and it wont stop lagging even with everything turned all the way down. Complete unoptimized garbage, hopefully they patch it soon.UPDATE I upgraded to an R9 290 something I was planning on doing anyway with 4GB of VRAM and the game still runs like crap. I have to turn it down to 900p and most of the settings down or off and it STILL lags during fights, not full on pausing like before but the frame rate drops to single digits. Unaccpetable. Its a fun game, but dont buy it until the technical issues are fixed.
