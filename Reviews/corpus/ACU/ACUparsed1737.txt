AC Unity is a much better game than the reviews would indicate.  Theres loads of things to do and the various stealth challenges keep it interesting.  With a fast PC and reasonable graphic settings, the game is very playable.  In fact, I havent experienced any of the crushing bugs that kept me cautious prior to purchase.  Howevr, I did wait for a decent sale before giving it a shot because of the reviews.  Hellava lot of fun with a customized Steam Controller.  Not a fanboy, just my honest take.
