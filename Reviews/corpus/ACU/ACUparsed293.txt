The game suggested I try out the DLC mid way through my playthrough so I did. Upon loading up the DLC I found that it was horribly buggy. My computer would full on freeze during the first few seconds of the DLC loading... and I dont have a  machine. There is no way to abandon this DLC, you have to finish it in order to continue. I have no way of getting a new start and no way to continue. So almost near the end of the main game Ill never know how it ends because it is literally imposible for me to continue. game. Close this studio.
