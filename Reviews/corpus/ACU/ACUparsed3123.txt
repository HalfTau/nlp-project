most ppl dont get that u have to enjoy the game because of its straight up beauty. i have a mediocre cpu n good gpu n never had ant any issues, maybe cause I run all my games  720p. This is a paris love story not the traditional ac hate story, which is y i think ppl dont like it. Which is funny cause its similiar 2 acbf in that respect but ppl still hate it. I wish it wasnt so predictable of an ending, saw it coming 1/2 way thru the game. the best part of the game is the graphical display, what all games should be striving for, worst part is as other stated the lack of ability to have stealth. the only way to bestealthy is never to be detected, unlike others where u pick off upc. 8/10
