Im a fan of this series, I liked most of the games people say they didnt. This one just didnt hook me in like the others have. It started slow, picked up in the middle a little and fizzled out in the end.There are some definite highlights but Id say this game is an easy skip for all but die hard assassins.Actual play time was more like 50 hours, not 78. Somehow it was still running after I closed it.
