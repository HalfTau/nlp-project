Reading through all of the negative reviews and not knowing anything about Assassins Creed, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy this game. The graphics are amazing and fantastic yet alone the combat was marvellous. Its definitely recommended.UpdateAfter playing a bit more of this game, I still have to say that Unity is an amazing game and is definitely worth the money. After being introduced to the character customization, Im please to say that the amount of detail on each individual clothing is awesome! Its great to see such a variety of different sets of unique clothing and attire. As well, going through France, and parkouring my way up to the building to see the marvellous view was by far satisfying and eye catching.
