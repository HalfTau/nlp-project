Well I bought it before I saw the recommended min. requirements idiot so all I have to use this game is an i7 2670QM and the GTX 570m. Its playable, sometimes for nearly an hour, low settings of course, before the  stutters hit so bad I just quit. Its FULL of glitches, bad fps as well. I chocked that up to the GPU Im running. Anyway Im kinda glad Im not alone, maybe with the patches that are sure to come Ill get a better expierence.
