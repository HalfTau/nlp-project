So far it plays like every other assasins creed but with french flavour! Cons I found were Uplay, seems silly to need another account to run your game through steam, only other issue was a Resolution one, being way to enlarged on first launch. But I restarted my pc and everything ran great.Have to say Unity is another great addition to the franchise with alot of missions to complete and some with friends aswell. Also this is my first PC copy of AC and is alot easier played with keyboard than controller.I give it a 7 outta 10, found the battle mechanics to be cluncky and feels very much like a Warner brothers game, but is a great game in general, and a great buy if you get it on sale!Also last quick note, there are ahcievments to this game, but are on Uplay only. Uplay seems like a decent platform but just setting up your account is fustrating enough!
