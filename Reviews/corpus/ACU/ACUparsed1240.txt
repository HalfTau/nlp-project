If I have to deal with one more bloody crash Ill make it my personal vendetta to find the team responsible for porting this brokengame to PC and hunt them down with the relentlessness and precision of a Brotherhood Assassin. If only I can play the game long enough without it crashing to learn the skills I need to do so.
