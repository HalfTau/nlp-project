Ive been hearing a lot of complaints about this game, both gameplay and optimization wise.For me its working wonders though, runs nice and fluid maybe also thanks to the new nvidia driver.Gameplay is...SO MUCH BETTER at least for meThe new stealth system allows for greater control and cinematic effect in the previous game the character would continue walking normally even when sneaking, in Unity you can crouch to make less noise, and take cover behind objects.The combat is finally fun. Enemies are smarter, stronger, and wont hesitate to shoot you if you leave them the chance. The added difficulty unlocks whole new levels of satisfaction after winning a tough battle. Medicines, smoke bombs, and all the other fancy gadgets actually serve a purpose now. I also love the addition of enemy kill moves, instead of ragdolling to the floor, Arno will get stabbed by swooshy kill moves. Nice.To all of you that prefer slaughtering helpless enemies, worry not, the city is divided in different sections, easy and hard, so if you want to massacre weak enemies, go to the easier sections.The addition of a climb button gets rid of all those annoying unwanted climbs when you are trying to run, and viceversa.Story so far is good, and Arno is a cool character I think.Paris is awesome and full of life.Character customization is cool, there are plenty of outfits and colors to choose from.So far, the best assassins creed game by far, in my opinion.I hope future games will follow this games mechanics instead of going back to the messy, precisionless, immersionkilling, waay too easy formula of the previous games.
