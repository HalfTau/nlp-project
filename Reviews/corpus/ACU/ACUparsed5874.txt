This is an absolute mess. I am astounded, shocked, and quite frankly offended that Ubisoft screwed me out of 60 dollars. It took upward of twenty minutes just to get the game to launch, start, and arrive at the first cutscene, only for the framerate to instantly take a nosedive to about TWO FRAMES PER MINUTE. It finally started to pick up but was no where near 30 fps by the time of the first gameplay segment. The mouse was laggy, the frame rate horrid, and everything clearly unoptimized. THIS IS A BROKEN RELEASE. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I CANT EVEN PLAY IT BECAUSE THE FRAME RATE IS SO BAD AND THE RESPONSE SO LAGGY. Save your money for something better.
