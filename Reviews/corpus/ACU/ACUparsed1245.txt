3 years later and Ubisoft still cant get itstogether. I only bought this game after 3 years expecting it to work but nope, guess thats too much to ask of Ubisoft. I nevertheless contacted Ubisoft support to no avail. The only things thats right now made up for it is WatchDogs2. I have since gotten a refund for this product. I highly recommend doing your research and ready to be disappointed if youre planning on buying this game.
