Pretty good, falls a little short to some assassins creed games in my opinion. The next gen graphics are amazing, if you can get them to work. Multiple times Ive had to change the aspect ratio in my video settings because lowering the quality did very little. Having said this I have a six core processor, ten GBs of RAM and a 2 GB graphics card. Other than that an okay story and fun multiplayer.
