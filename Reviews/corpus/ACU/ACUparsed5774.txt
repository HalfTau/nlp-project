I seriously dont understand where you are all getting that this game gives low FPS. You have to understand that it is a graphically intense game and just because you are running a Beast of a system doesnt mean you are going to get 100 fps. Also understand the game just released and Nvidia and AMD have to release drivers for better stability.I also havent noticed any glitches yet but I am very early in the game. I use a wired xbox 360 controller for playing this game.I am running everything on Ultra and AAFxAA  25601080 and getting an average of 4550 fpsSpecsAmd 9370  stock speedsASROCk extreme9 990fx mobo8gb of Kingston Fury ramEvga Gtx 970 4gb OC version non blower fan I cant remeber the exact name850w psuH80i Water cooler
