Im honestly very surprised with the exceedingly poor quality of this release.  My machine SSD, 8GB, i7  3770k, 2 x 560Tis in SLI and the stuttering and lagging in this game is crazy.  With graphics set to high, and running around I see my CPU at roughly 50, the GPUs both hovering around 70, but the game stuttering... turning down the settings doesnt seem to make any difference on my setup at all... the worst though is the cutscenes... One took roughly 4 minutes to load, sound falling out of sync with video... the game is seriously bricked right now.Im waiting for an update before I even attempt to play, as of right now its crap.Blackflag was great, but this... very disappointing.  Last time I preorder an ubisoft game.
