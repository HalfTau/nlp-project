Great game. This episode has taken a good step forward from the previous one. Looks like the creators have brought back the original style from the Assassins Creed I and II, but added great quality and much more for the player to love about it.The only minus so far has been the sound. It doesnt work quite well sometimes. But when it does, the game is great.
