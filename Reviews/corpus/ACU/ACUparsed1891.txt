Its rare for me to find a game that I really dont enjoy, and this game is no exception. As I played this game, I loved all of the changes since the previous games and what new options were opening up. Although, its very hard to get past the constant bugs and performance issues. Its been a considerably long time since this came out, and its disappointing to see a game with the potential of this to be completely abandoned without anything made to change it. If youre willing to get past constant bugs and have a strong computer, this game could be enjoyable. For me however, it was impossible to get around.
