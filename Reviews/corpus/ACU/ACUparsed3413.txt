Everyone knows about the bugs so not going to talk about it.This is the Assassins Creed I was expecting way back when they announced the first one, especially the combat. Put in real stealth, added disguises as an ability you need to unlock and even improved the parcour. Now if I die from off a building I know its only my fault. Arno is imho the new Ezio. He can never replace my favorite but I like the character.Get past the bugs and try this game. I love it!
