.. that is my thought of the game. not only does it not download correctly until u do it 3 times the pc specs are way too high 0o and there is always the problem that IT FREEZES WHENEVER PEOPLE TRY TO OPEN IT...none of the steam officials care to help and no one else knows how to so it has potential to be good and probably is BUT YOU CANT GET INTO THE GAME!!! THATS A PROBLEM
