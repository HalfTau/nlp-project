This is the first game in the series that gives me the actual feeling the creators tried to fix some of the games biggest flaws. The addition of a pretty decent skilltree and equipment system allows for tons of customisation and lets you adjust your assassin to your own playstyle. Random events, sidemissions and storyline missions have a much better design than the games predecessors, never feeling repetitive or lineair, but instead granting you an incredible degree of freedom to achieve your goal the way you see fit Which is pretty much what we all wanted missions to look like since the first Assassins Creed. Difficulty has been upped its not quite there, but its heading in the right direction by making enemies stronger and more aggressive and by having missions require more thinking and planning. Powerful skills, such as bombs, disguise or double assassination, need to be unlocked first, which is actually a pretty nice touch.Honestly, I dont think ACU gets all the credit it deserves because its technical issues overshadow the gameplay changes.
