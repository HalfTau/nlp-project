The fact that this was priced at 60 dollars at release is an obvious middle finger from Ubisoft. It is riddled with bugs, crashes to desktop every 5 minutes and the controls are janky and completly ruined when compared to the original freerunning in Assassins Creed. They tease you with the ability to counter but there are no kill moves, you only can whale on opponents until their silly life bar goes to zero where they look as if they are about to faint. Only then are you able to perform the kill move. The counter is completly useless half the time resulting in only parrying the blow, and when everyone and their brother carries a pistol, if you engage more than two people, you will die in no time at all due to one of them stepping back and taking a shot at you. If it is not obvious from my tone in this review I will state it outright Do NOT buy this game.
