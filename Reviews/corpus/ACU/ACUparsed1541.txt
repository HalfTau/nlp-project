Overall good game.Graphic quality is exemplar and you will have a hard time finding a game that has such detailed environments, both city and interiors, the atmosphere is amazing.Story wise, I think its average. The beggining of the game is really exciting but its difficult to understand Arnos motivations, and, when the story finally reveals it I just found it too uninteresting and not strong enough.This said dont expect to immerse yourself too much in the story. There are primary missions and secondary missions.The ones that you do to progress in the story are sandbox driven and they will be mostly infiltration missions in which it will culminate on an assassination of a target of importance. Each mission offers different approaches and you can even look for opportunities that can help you get the upper hand on completing you objectives.Unity has clunky controls especially during combat where animations seem unnatural and unsynced, which is frustrating since you spend a lot of time fighting or terminating targets. Additionally you will get the occasional bug.
