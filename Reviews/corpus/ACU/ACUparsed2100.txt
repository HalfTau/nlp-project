I liked the story, even if it was predictalbe except for the unexplainable piece of weaponry the last boss has. What the hell is that about?. It also feels like with every game the assassins inexplicably get more superpowers.The folks that made this game have delivered the best inengine cinematics I have ever seen. Wonderful, wonderful facial animation. I actually wanted to keep playing just because for the production value of the cinematics.The gameplay is fine. Nothing that exciting. Pretty standard AC. Which means the controls are still bothersome. Which means that at least twenty times youll be spotted by guards trying to do something really simple. But its getting better.It runs fine. Gameworks shadows hit fps hard, but dont really look nicer. So no big loss there.I look forward to thinking Syndicate is fun but mediocre just like this one!
