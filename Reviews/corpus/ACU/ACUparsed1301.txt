I Originally played through this game on PS4 on launch day and it was terrible. I thought I would never come back to it but here I am going through it a second time. I can honestly say I am enjoying it a lot more the second time around now that alot the bugs are fixed and I can get some good fps, it feels a lot better.It has a ton of things to do and the small amount of customization to your character is also pretty good. The coop missions are a lot of fun with friends as well. Story is decent but Arno is kinda dull. All in all its a good game. 9/10
