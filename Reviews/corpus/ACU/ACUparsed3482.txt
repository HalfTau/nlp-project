Hmmmed and haaaeed over buying it due to the reviews, but I gave it a go because I thought it might be fixed.  Not the case.Glitchy.  Cut scenes dont even play smooth, even on the lowest of low graphics.I played Far Cry 4 through on Ultra, but I cant even play this on 1360x768.Id stay away.edit After I passed sequence 2 things smoothed out a bit.  I upped the graphics to med/high, and things are OK. Still some nonsense, but not as bad as before.  Seems pretty cool, and the graphics are sweet when they work.  Pretty fun.
