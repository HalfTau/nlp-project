Didnt understand all the hate this game got. Its not a BAD game, it just isnt as good as Black Flag. Too little freedom in the game, and lots of minor bonuses dangled in front of your nose for their broken social experiment. No real benefit to those things, but frustrating to see chests that couldnt be opened until they go their app working. Took them too long to unlock those even though they knew opening day that their experiment failed.
