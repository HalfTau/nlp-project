It getting better after patch 3, keep up the good work Ubisoft. I really enjoy every single scene and momemnt inside this game, this game deserve to list as a true next gen title. I do enjoy the story as well, Arno live his life by prioriting Elise in the first place, the love story is beautiful but I think you guys are able to expand it more. AC2 was a big success not because of the gameplay but the story you guys created, its amazing. Keep it up!
