The comabt and free running system is crap.The most  gameplay ever.Arno wont do anything even if i hit space while standing on the ledge.You cant have a human shield to protect from ranged attacks.You have to hit100 times to just knock down your enemy.Free running is crap. The character wont go where you want him to go.Overall gameplay very poor. While talking to characters without cutscenes is poor, it seems as if you are talking to a dummy.You cannot take out your sword at your will. Wait for combat to start.No centralised button to cycle through combat items. s dedicated a bunch for no. For it.Assassinations are poor and very slow...while running if you want to assassinate he will pull off a stunt and then it will assassinate.Even after using smoke bombs you need to attact 10 times to kill enemy.Worst sequence ever.  you ubisoft
