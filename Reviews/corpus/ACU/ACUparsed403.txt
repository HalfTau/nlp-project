Ive played every Assassins Creed prior to this game and i must say i am really impressed !The main story line is somewhat the same in some aspects but different in so many others. I found the relationship between Arno and Elise very compelling and a breath of fresh air from previous repetative story lines. Having played this game over 3 years from its original release date all the bugs and glitches people reported when the game initially came out have all been fixed. The map of Paris is huge and incredibly detailed. The DLC was ok, small map and i completed the story line in a few hours however it was a neccessary story, ending the main unity story.  DONT PLAY THE DLC UNTILL YOU FINISHED UNITY AS YOULL RUIN THE GAMEWould definatly recommend however shop about abit to buy this game as steam is always fluxuating the price due to origins coming out !
