Basically, its a very good game thats plagued by some framerate issues. Ive had no gamebreaking bugs but Ive fallen through the floor a few times prepatch but it seems to be fixed now. The normally overpowered Assassins Creed killcounterinstakillrepeat combat has been changed that it now feels like you, as only a single man, are now at a disadvantage agains the massive hordes of Frenchmen. There are 5 categories of weapons, OneHanded, Heavy, Long, Rifles, and Guillotine Guns. They each have their own advantages and disadvantages, but can all be compensated for very well. Coop mode is fun, but players can leave the mission at anytime and they are quite difficult, but possible, to do on your own. The signature freerunning of AC has been improved so that you can choose whether you want to go up, down, or flat with a button press. The story as far as Ive played it is decent, and a little predictable. The world has an amazing atmosphere depending on which district you waltz into and the graphics are state of the art. Money is a little hard to come by but for good reason, the highest level of items are massively overpowered. People complaining about microtransactions have no reason to, everything in the game can be bought with ingame currency. Overall, Assassins Creed Unity is a very good game, an improvement over the regular AC title, but plagued by a lagging framerate.
