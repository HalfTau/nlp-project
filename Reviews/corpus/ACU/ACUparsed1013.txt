My first AC game I bought XDIts gameplay really cool, i dont really know why many people really hate this series so badWell, i still found some gameplay glitches but for me that still harmless, its multiplayer feature doesnt really bad either.For the storyline, for me, itnt as good as AC Rogue, and even the older AC series.But Napoleon looks cool here XDI enjoyed this one so far
