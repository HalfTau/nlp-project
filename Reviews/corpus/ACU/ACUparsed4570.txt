I rarely write a review, but ACU definitively deserves one.As many people I was very disapointed with the quality of the game control of the characters, camera angle, fight ... you name it, but I think some of these issues can be fixed with patches.What cant be fixed is the story line. And I dont mean the French history.No spoiler here, but the story is really bad, like properly bad and boring. I mean even if the game is not technically good, I was hoping it will compensate with an interesting development of the story.But no, with ACU you get nothing  No fun playing and no fun finishing the game.The only fun you have at the end is that you get 38Go free on your computer.
