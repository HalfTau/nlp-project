Soo... Bad!Ok lets start with good thingsGraphics Nice textures, envoirment love itStory cant spoil, but it is interestingCOOP missions fun to play with friends, or random players .And Now Bad stufftons of glitches example I was climbing up to wall, suddenly I fly up in skys, and then I fell in hay wagon other side of citty. Or I want to loot chest who was on street right front of me, but camera fast fly away from me, and back to me. what happened? guess i looted another chest in city located on catedral.Script bugs In side quest missions. example You take mission, and you need to follow to  one guy, but he dont move                   he stands all the time. trolloololo.Jumping fails, if you at other assassins creed game games you easly can control where to jump. Then in Unity you need a lot A LOT of skills to jump where you want to. Sometimes to climb trought window takes 10 rageful minutes.Skill Unlocking t! You need to unlock skill to sit on bench to hide. RLY UBISOFT RLY!Equipment unlocking  In first game chapter you can unlock best weapon in game lol who is max parry, max health max dmg. all you need 20K gold easy get few chests and done. and same to armor you can get best armor in begining of game.. whats the point of that!Game logic Dumbest guards in all ac history. you can hide behind this HHHHHHH type fence and he cant see you. Or the guard in restricted area is standing in rooom. I press ctrl sneaking And walk right front of him. Nothing. He dont see me lol. FKing Meta. And the world event thiefs is not even trying to get away with loot. They run bit faster than walking lol, and not climbing up to walls... so lame. I remember how i chase thiefs with Eczio, well they was fast and clewer. was fun to catch. But unity wtf!Combat sucks In all other assassin creed games was grabbing, disarming kisking even taunting to make enemy angry. But this you can dodge by rolling or parry with right click...OH YEAH! You can lear to kick ability by spending 4 skillpoints so fking lame . Idk is it for me, maybe I not yet learned but i cant pick up any weapon what enemy drops. Like Conor. Kill few bad guys then pick up Musket from one dead guard, and then run/stab another guard.Game worth 1015eurMy Rating Right Now Is 5,5/10 starsp.s.Right now Im still playing story line rating can change.
