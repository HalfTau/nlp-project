Bought it when i had a 2core A4 4000 processor, a GTX 650 and Windows 10, slow as fak. Bought an A8 7600 4core processor, played it with Windows 7, it didnt worked fast either, and then i went with Windows 10 once again... and the game is locked in 30 FPS, which is... AMAZING!And oh holy goodness when you play cooperative missions! Sure, it takes a while to find a match for two or four, but when youre in a 4player match, its more than a match, its a good reason to roleplay with and imagine yourself as one of four assassin, and better if youre playing with friends! Besides the capability of customizing your character and make it look unique rather than the classic Arno dark blue attire, being on a group of four assassins who wear different attires is immensely fatisfying! 30 buck that are totally wotrh it!The only bad thing is its graphic optimization, i have been told that with my PC, i couldnt play it, good thing ive proved them wrong
