as a fan of previous assassins creed games i was looking forward to this one , well that it seems was my mistake well done ubisoft for screwing me out of my cash , this game if you can get it to work looks like fun . however getting it to work is another thing , the so called recomended specs should be listed as the min specs needed to play as theres so much that is unpolished and glitchy that it hurts your eyes and not to mention the bugs and crashs , this is a poor poor release from ubisoft and is in massive need of a overhaul to fix and address the issues .sorry ubisoft . i will never buy another product from you guys ever againthis link basicly says and shows it all .
