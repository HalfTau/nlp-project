They were doing so well with the updates fixing problems, but update 4 broke more than it helped. Update 3 had actually made it fairly stable for me I wasnt falling through things, the random spikes of lag when I try to turn the camera or fight or anything not a menu, the physics glitch during cutscenes that resembles anything hanging clothlike randomly being pulled upward. All of those had been fairly minimal in update 3.Update 4 meanwhile has crashed on me half a dozen times, brought the random spikes of lag back to almost all the time as opposed to some of the time, and worst of all Sometimes often when jumping over a small object such a big deal theyve made it an objective multiple times, Arno finds himself up to his knees stuck in the floor, unable to move.I honestly think at this point, Ive had more fun with the game on the companion app I use on my tablet.
