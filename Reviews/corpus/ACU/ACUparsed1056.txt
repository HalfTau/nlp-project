Once upon a time, Assaassins Creed was all about telling a story. A nice story about somebody. Altair, Desmond Miles or Ezio Auditore  all of them were at least interesting characters, with a personality.But these times are long gone. And while Edward Kenway is saved by rum, beatifull Carribean and his black flag, Arno from Unity  can do nothing but run from one point on map to another, totally bored, without any real challenges infront, killing anything that moves etc, etc.And though the Unity was released long ago, do expect bugs, glitches and other minor annoyances...
