I just finished the game after playing for almost 77 hours and its safe to say that this game is good. This game is not at all like the one I have been hearing since its disastarous launch. But there are pros and cons to this, so lets list them.Pros Great Parkour mechanics with some good animations make it a bit fluid at times. Combat has been improved in the challenge aspect so dont think of playing god like in previous AC games. Great graphics makes the city of paris beautiful to look at both externally and internally. Great missions on both story and side activities. They offer a bit replay value. Assassinations missions are great as in they provide more oppurtunities. Stealth mechanics are great as well but challenging and there is no desync should you be detected. No desync even for Tailing missions. Loads of side activites and most of them are fun. Especially love the paris stories.Cons Bugs are present but nothing game breaking Some annoyances with the AI. Coop missions are frustrating if played alone. Hate the british voice acting for french people which really irked me because of loss of authenticity.I would also like to add that the story is a mixed bag for me because it is mostly good but vexed me because of some unlikeable characters within the assassin order. Changed how the assasin order is represented dont like the cult thing and the initiation that they have going along, no confession scenes and also fing british voice acting which doesnt belong in a french era. Heres to hoping that everyone doesnt sound british in a egyptian, japanese and indian setting in their next game.Anyway, I would rate this an 8/10 because I enjoyed playing this game and I liked playing it from start to finish.
