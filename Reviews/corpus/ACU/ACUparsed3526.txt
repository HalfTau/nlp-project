game is all around bad. ive enjoyed almost all of the assassins creed games and this is by far the worst in the series so far.  the game is full of bugs and problems but even without the bugs, the game play style has dropped significantly from black flag. the developpers seemed to have tried to go back to the style of the previous games but have found a way to make it even worse. if you want to play a game of this style, just get black flag or any other game, not this one
