The short and sweet sentence Not the worst game in the series, but certainly not the best. Totally skip it.The long and boring essayIve played all the games and loved them all up until now. At this point, the story of the game seems kind of... irrelevant. But I guess since were not doing things with Desmond anymore, there isnt a reason to tread on that anymore.If youre the type of person that likes doing the same thing over and over, then theres a TON of things to do in this game. In fact theres so much to do that looking at the game map and seeing it filled with icons is actually overwhelming.Something that bothered me is that it feels like your assassin this time around is a lot weaker than the ones in previous games. I say that in the sense that he doesnt have as many weapons at his disposal like in Black Flag or AC2. Its kind of a bummer really. Also, being forced to use your main weapon instead of your dagger/hidden blades is a real bummer.
