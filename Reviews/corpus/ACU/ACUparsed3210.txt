This game is quite hard to say good or bad. I rarley had glitches, the new combat mechanics make stealth a better option, and I love the down parkour system. Though when I did run into glitches I would get stuck in a barrel for 15 minutes before reloading the game. Also I really dislike the customization, at first it seems great then you see that the best looking armor is the default and it has the worst stats. I loved the coop, it was great doing missions with friends or throwing smoke bombs off a roof to help a fellow assassin get away from guards. The main charcter Arno starts off a really cool charcter and they slowly leave his story in the dust which I didnt like as I thought he could be a really cool charcter. The missions started to feel stale, but I did love the assassination missions where the game goes Heres your target, here are some optional things, have fun.Though its not by any means a perfect game it is still enjoyable and free DLC is cool to.7/10 Wish I could have multiple save files to play again.
