Game is pretty fun once you unlock the Coop missions, people dont really use mics so it can get annoying with bad players just going around killing randomly. Game can be pretty buggy with the new Parkour system not knowing what it truly wants to do at times, it has gotten me killed a couple times even after clicking and moving the way you want but it would pick another even when you can go the way. The App for Android works for my HTC One M8, it does get pretty hot after a bit of use but it has had no issues using it and works well as a mini map.People been complaining about the graphics engine not running well for them but I have had no real issues as of yet and I play maxed out just fine. Only buggy engine I have seen is sometimes Npcs will bounce into the air and then reset if the game has not fully loaded which is pretty funny.PC Specs are not  great and yet I dont have issues game runs fine for me at 1920x1080.Nvidia 770 SC 2gigs8gigs of Ram120 gig ssd game runs onCore i5 3570k normal clocked at 3.4GHz
