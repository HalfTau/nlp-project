Maybe Im the only one that think this game isnt too bad after all? A few thoughts on the game though You definitely need high specs to run this game and really enjoy it. Im rocking a dual crossfire 290x OC system and an i7 at 3.8ghz and Im running all of the graphics on ultra high. Things seem to be quite smooth for me and I havent come across lag so far. I still need to look into the game some more and put more hours in for sure. The story is interesting and I am impressed by the choice of time era this time around. Really digging the French revolution. Helps that I know French as well as I can understand most of the citizens. The citizens are really lively. You dont see the same face too often and each one is unique and doing their own thing. The render times for each map impress me based on how many building textures and clothing textures it has to render for the whole city. Im not too impressed with the hair mechanism, dont get me wrong, the textures are amazing in this game and hair is difficult, but it just keeps bugging me as I play more and more. The new physics are very creative and help to put a more realistic full to the game. Although Ive already ran into 2 glitch where ill be free running down a building and I jump off to the street and seem to fall through into an endless abyss. I think it more funny than annoying. This game has some of the most impressive ingame graphics that Ive encountered throughout my gaming venture. Keeping the cut scenes close if not the same as the ingame graphics helps out as well. Sound seems to cut out at times and can be a little annoying, but doesnt happen so often as to annoy me too much. Not too sure how well the multiplayer mechanism is going to work, ill have to test it out in the near future. Looking forward to play this game some more and considering all sides, Id have to say that I recommend this game. Hoping there will be some updates to the game soon though.
