I was one of the main defenderes of this game. But yesterday I started the dlc. I just wanted to check out the city. The city is boring, so I decided Ill just return to paris its okay. there is no way out of paris.  So I uninstalled the dlc went to play in paris and the game restarted. lost all my progress purmenently. I would like to report that ubisoft is oficialy  if the only way to get back to paris is to restart ur entire save.
