finally the game is working a few bugs and glitches in there but nothing game breaking unless you are planning to play       coop......But overall the game is greatmy rating would be 9 out of 10 if not for the glitches i would be 9.5would i recommend it? .......Yes..... but you need a strong PC to run the game smoothly for me i can run it on medium with no stuttering..... and for my friend she runs it on low but still she gets a  little bit of stuttering every once in a whileto sum it all up1you have a strong PC go for it. the game is fixed now at least for me and my friend2expect a lot of glitches3the game is working tested with two different pcs Both runing windows 8
