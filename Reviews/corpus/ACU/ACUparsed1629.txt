Given the problems that turned me off the game when it first came out, I was pleasantly surprised when I came back a year later and was able to play it with no problems. Enjoyed Arno as a character, although you really need the Dead Kings DLC to feel like his character arc has been completed. I would actually love a sequel with him as the main character. Graphics are beautiful and I really got into wandering around Paris because it felt so realistic. NPCs were nuanced too  I never felt like historic figures were being shoved in my face for the sake of being there, which is a problem Syndicate suffered from. Overall, Id give this a positive review.
