I just bought the game yesterday  Feb 27. And I did that on purpose in order to give Ubisoft time to fix the game. So I didnt have my first experiences with thee game tainted by the disgust of a poorly optimized game. I love this game. I really think its the best AC yet. The graphics aree really incredible, eeven compared to preevious assassins creeed gamees.They also really upped the eexploration intrique. Theere are so many diffrent types of missions you can do...many hidden passages to explore. The eenvironment is really well done. And I love the the smooth descent feature theyve added...now getting down from high places is just as easy as climbing them. AND LASTLY, I love how you have to earn your abilities with skill points. You dont just start off as an assassin that can just do anything. That makes me appreciate each aspect a lot more.
