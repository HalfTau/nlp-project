I am running Windows 10, AlienWare X51 R2, I7 4770K, 16GB Ram.This game does not work for me, I get a weird glitchy screen. The first time I ran the game it allowed me to play for about 5 or so minutes. The second time was around 30 seconds, Each time it messed my computer up so bad I had to restart it. It took forever to reboot. If your specs are near mine please save your money and dont buy the game. I love Assassins Creed Unity, I had it for another PC on another Steam account, I was Running Windows 8.1 So those people should be safe.I am NOT giving Assassins Creed Unity a bad reputation, Nor a bad review. These are just my problems, I only hope to save your money, And time getting your refund.
