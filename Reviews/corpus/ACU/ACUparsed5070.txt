So ive played roughly 9 hours of the game, the first 2 hours I didnt fiddle enough with the setting and look for fixes. BUT We shouldnt have to do that, I only got a 660 but I can get out 50 fps average while playing the game now that I fiddled with the settings and such. Most of the people whining about the game dont have the recommended gear. But ive seen many that have 970 and 980 having frame rate issues.The game itself is AMAZING the story is good so far havent tried the co op yet. But the Freerunning and parkour is so smooth and the combat is amazing so far. I really hope Ubisoft fixes these problems because theyre just getting bad rep right now for no good reason IMO. I love the AC series and ive played all the games from beginning to end I even played AC 3 with lag just to finish the damn thing. Its sad that they let this happen because theyre a good company and make great games. I just hope they see this game and watchdogs and look back not saying they will because so many people bought the two games because of hype. But many of the people complaining can just eat shit. Wait for reviews before you buy a game if youre worried dont go trash talking UBISOFT if you cant play the game you bought it before waiting for people to see if the game works and such. So my final rating so far would be 8/10.
