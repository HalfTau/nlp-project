By far the best Assassins to date. Yes Ubisoft screwed up the launch, but they did deliver an excellent experience. New game controls are amazing. Controlled decent is an excellent addition, as well as the addition of cover and stealth. The redesigned why missions are played are a breath of fresh air.The story so far is perfect. I am engrossed and very satisfied with what Ive experienced thus far. To all of the haters out there, grow up! Yes the launch was not perfect, but the game is awesome, and you know it! I do not regret preordering it, and I will most likely preorder the next one!
