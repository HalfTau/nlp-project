This the second AC game i have wasted money on and i wonder how i could be so stupid. Ubisoft is a disgrace to game companies because they are too incompetent to design something that can ACTUALLY RUN. upon running the game, i was faced with a problem where the resolution jammed at 320, took a long time to sort this out. as the screen was completely stuck and barely anything was visible. I know im not the only one with this problem because when i was googling for a solution many others had similar resolution problems. As if the issues with revelations werent enough......well done ubisoft at churning out yet another sloppy defective game
