85 hours and Im done. 100 all Achievements, Badges and Weapons. about 5 hours were really fun, great missions, original ideas about 70 hours were ok, repetitive sidemissions, repeating missions to get 100 about 5 hours were annoying, waiting for coopmissions to start, looking for the last missing syncpoints and artifacts about 5 hours were really terrible, looking at glitches and errors, restarting the game because I got stuck or the mission didnt complete...Its not a bad game, but some things are really annoying. I really do hope the next AC is better!
