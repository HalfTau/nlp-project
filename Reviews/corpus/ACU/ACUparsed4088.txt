I was super excited about this game and payed my 60 within days after release, like I have with all the previous games. I get ten seconds into the first cut scene before the game crashes, and I have been unable to play it. I am very disappointed in this game and Ubisoft for the very poor game quality, or lack of anything closely resembling quality. I simply cannot recomend this game to anyone in its current state.
