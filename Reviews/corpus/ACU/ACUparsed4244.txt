Hey guys to all of the AC fans  i know u guys were expecting a MONSTER game after watching the trailer for assassins creed unity, well i bought the game after 2 weeks it got out on steam it took me a while to download it in that time i was watching videos on youtube about the game , well most of the people were sating that the game was full of bugs and yah thats true and i was kinda disappointed because i already bought the game , there were many bugs like lagg freeze , random people flying, BIG fps drop even if you have a GTX TITAN ect ...... well we can say that Ubisoft kinda ed us up but after that they patched the game and now it works fine for me i did not get any fps drop or lagg or anything the only thing i had to do is update my GPU drives, anyways i cant give you a full recommendation about the game but so far its going well.PS Guys dont blame Ubisoft if u have a shity GPU, you have to update it and need a good pc now the game is patched and is doing well so no need to cry about it
