I was able to run it thankfully, but it requires a beefy computer to run with 1080p. Thanks to a few recent updates I was able to play. I use a Nvidia GTX 970 and a intel 3.4 ghz quad processor with 16gb of ram. THIS GAME UNFORTANETLY REQUIRES A BEFFY COMPUTER TO RUN A 1080p. After recent updates, I found the game was fun.
