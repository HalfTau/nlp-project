Currently this is my second playthough of AC Unity.  owned on Uplay and then got the game in a package with Rouge on steamLets get the obvious out of the way and say Ubisoft have no forgivness or excuse for how this game was released... doneLets look at the game as if you are buying it now and have never played it.I run this game Maxed out with a GTX 970, 8 gigs of ram and a Fx8350 prossesor.This game brings a lot of new things to the table one of them being Co Op. While the Co Op is fun it fails to keep you wanting to do co op missions as there is a limited amount and after you have beat them it dont really pull you into play more.Onto the good things, The story is great its nice to see more of a story with the assassins leaders and have to go back to make reports just like AC1.  The Character Arno is really fun and has a good story to follow and his skills as an assassin and as a free runner are incredible a really under rated assassin..The gameplay is great, brilliant new combat system making fights a little harder and the free running system with better ways to traverse the map have really improved in Unity.Its a Solid AC game and should not be over looked.
