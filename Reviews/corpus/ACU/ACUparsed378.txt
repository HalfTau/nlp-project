Reasonably enjoyable for people who like the Assassins Creed series, or the Ubisoft explore/collect dynamic in general. Story was OK, cheesy at parts, but with the real people and events woven in at parts, made for an enjoyable campaign. Hate how Coop is mandatory for 100 completion. Microtransactions available but not invasive.
