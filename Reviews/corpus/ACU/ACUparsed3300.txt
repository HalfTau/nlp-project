3/103/10Micro Transactions and Glithches The Game. Stale gameplay, stale plot. The character is as unresponsive as ever. You would think that after this many games, that they would release a AC game where the character didnt fight you for control.Want a AC style game without the t? Middleearth Shadow of Mordor. Go buy it instead of this piece of trash.
