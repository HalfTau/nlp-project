alot of fps lags and bugs you cant walk 5sec without crashing into a wall or falling down from the mapUbisoft published an undone game they let us play it before they finished itas an assassins creed game series fan i dont recomend this game after the ac bf succes i though it might be even betterthan black flag waiting to see how rogue will be running on pc but im done paying for assassins creed game after that
