Disgustingly low frame rate. I cant even play the first twenty munutes of the game because it hurts my eyes to watch the computer screen. The game just chunks around with 5 fps at best. Also very buggy and I fall through the floor every time I pull out my sword to fight somebody. Game crashed while still in the opening cutscene. Great job Ubisoft! Great performance on this masterpiece. It sucks.
