I cant give this game a positive review.ProsGreat story lineFree runningCustomizationConsGame crashesGame is poorly optimizedI didnt list a lot for pros or cons but I feel like these what makes and breaks the game. But the cons dont make the game fun at all. You could be in the middle of a mission and the game just freezes on you. That is really annoying. The optimization for this game is terrible because for the game to even look likes its running smooth I have to keep the camera facing the ground.I have been a long time assassins creed fan but after this game I dont know if I want to buy anymore for how poorly this game was executed. If you really want to play this game, I would recommend not playing this game on PC.
