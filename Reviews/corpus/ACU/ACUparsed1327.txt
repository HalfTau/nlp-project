While the performance was fine for me, this game still mainly consists of bugs and glitches. Theres nothing worse than trying to be immersed in this world built around the French Revolution and being abruptly disturbed by NPCs flying through your screen.Literally during the intro where you play as young Arno, 10 minutes into the game, there were incredible glitches that should never ever be able to pass quality assurance and be shipped in a released and patched product respectively. Those glitches are not just some minor stuff you could choose to condone. I could not help but laugh at the cut scene in which I was forced to watch the back of my characters head for 30 seconds because someone at Ubisoft apparently managed to  up the camera angle in the dialogue. It would be hilarious if it werent so freaking sad.Long story short, I refunded ACUnity. Simply because the immersive open world youre walking through is severely disturbed by so much glitching and reloading. Maybe youll have fun with the game if you can get a deal for 5 or maybe 10 euros. But it really isnt worth anything more than that.
