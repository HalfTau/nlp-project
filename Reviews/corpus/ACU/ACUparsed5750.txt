I am in love with the AC franchise however I cannot continue to play this until I shell out 500 to Nvidia for a new graphics card, which I dont intend on. I have the Nvidia GForce GTX 550TI which is just below the minimum requirements, AMD 8 core processor and 8 gigs of RAM. I thought I could get by with some lower resolution gameplay, however it runs too choppy. I doubt even the 660 would run welly at the minimum! Even the menu lags and thats shouldnt take any graphics at all! I feel like I have wasted my money on what was going to be my favorite game as of yet. Makes you wonder if Nvidia and Ubisoft did it on purpose?
