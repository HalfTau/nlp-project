NoctuaVenVK  Reviews Assassins Creed Unity!Resolution 3440x1440!Settings Custom! High Shadows, AA offFramerate Soild 60 Frames Per Second!Main Review PieceIf youre worried about bugs, let me tell you, on older accounts, on 2014 hardware, AC Unity turned out to be my faucking game of the year  got me into PC Gaming on the whole, now let me blow a hole in the walls and break yall out, truly speaking, I never had missing textures of any kind nor did I crash, I played Unity pretty much bugless, in 1620p in 2014, With my 980 SLI, naturally with SLI, Issues did come my way in Patch 1.4.0, without rain being applied, AC Unity in 1.4.0 would flicker like heaven on fire, LMAO! However I let support know and quickly with Patch 1.5.0, I once again had no issues, and now, were in 2017, I am no longer using my 1080 SLI, and on a single 1080 Ti, what you see above applies, no bugs, good res, good settings, good fps, that simple .Now I knew AC Unity would be my 2014 GOTY, due to how I have a hopeless neverending, always active taste, for romance against earth storylines and the idea of an pretty interesting Assassin and a quite HAWT Templar, mixed in with what I feel will forever be one of my top moments in history, The French Revolution, Additionally, on my new account, I am working towards every achievement, and Im pretty much just go to do my time on everything, so my question? If I ran through the game twice now, on two fully different setups, how come youre listening instead of taking a chance? Worsttoworst, if you still notice bugs, refund your copy, however dont do that on the first sighting in like 10 hours of gameplay, be wise and be chill Id say, just enjoy Unity, for despite whom had issues, Unity is a pretty good game, better than ACS, that is for sure... LOL!Now as far as content goes, oh  lmao, if you dont own Skyrim, AC Unity is your next best bet for content and an open world right now, there is hella much to do, so if content is what you like as a hardcore gamer, I believe AC Unity is your new game to play, if you havent done so already, so righto, all in all, the game is great, bugs pretty much dont exist anymore, I myself have noticed none in my current run which is a full overall AC Unity 100 sync this time, not just the single player missions.I have achieved 100 Sync Full Game Overall in AC Unity and in Dead Kings .Ending Piece Ayy lmao, Unity calls out to you Assassin, do you answer her call?Dont Dislike W/O Reading my review, or any other selfish matter.
