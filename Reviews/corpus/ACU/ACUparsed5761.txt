Only No For now, i have a top of the line gaming deasktop and it runs horribly, i am very soon getting a Razer Blade Pro. When i get this new computer i will try to play it, if it runs or doesnt run good, i will post here again.Other than the FPS with Crowds and fighting, i love these games, i just made the mistake of getting it for PC.
