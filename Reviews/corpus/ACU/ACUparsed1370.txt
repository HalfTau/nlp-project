The game itself is okay, the story is pretty good and you get to see a lot of interesting places. But I absolutely hate the controls. I got killed all the time because the character wasnt fast enough with a parry or dodge, and the little tip boxes constantly obscure vital information while solving a case etc. All in all, the game was more frustrating than nice.
