I purchased this game because i needed something new to play something fresh i was looking for a stealthy game but with equal amounts of action and a decent story, well this game has filled the slot,  a great hooking story takes you on a journey through history and post revolution france i loved it the amounts of things to do in the game you didnt have to just follow a main objective or follow the story bit by bit you can do it your way wether ambushing from above snatching from the shadows or just going in guns blazing its your choice there is tones to do when your not in the story missions and random freeroam events. The combat system is satisfying and not too easy so you still feel like youve acomplished something with the kill rather than just instant killing. The parkour is amazing easy to grasp and you can do it on almost anything, i would recommend this to anyone and if your looking for a new game to fill the slot why not try this one you will really enjoy it
