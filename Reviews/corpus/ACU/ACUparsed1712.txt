Where to start?...50 GB of space is way too much, especially for a game that can barely run itself. It displays some of the worst framerate I ever saw, and enough glichs and bugs to make me restart the first mission from scratch 4 times, because I was just getting stuck in walls and stairs, or the quest itself would bug. Took me over 30 min for what would take 5 in normal circonstances. Its close to unplayable, and its certainly not just the PCs fault. Even for a game in its alpha testing phase it would be bad. Compared to it, most games known to be plagued with bugs feel quite finished.
