Game seems to be fun but the FPS really kills it for me and I have rather strong rig to boot. FPS average 3040 indoors and 20 FPS outdoors in a crowd. Im rendering at 2560 x 1600 with textures at Ultra, HBAO, 4x MSAA. I cant recommend this game until Ubisoft fixes the pretty obvious bugs with this game.System SpecsCore i7 3930K  3.8GHz16GB 2133MHz RAM256GB EVO PRO SSD2 GTX 780 in SLI water cooled OC to 1200MHz1500w PSUGeForce 344.65 drivers installed
