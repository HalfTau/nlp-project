I have slogged through this to 100 completion and it was not a fun experience. Most of the game felt like work. Some of the most enjoyable parts of this game were things that triggered memories of Black Flag and some of the earlier games that I enjoyed. The shame of if is that I could see things that MIGHT have been fun. Some of the coop missions look like they could have been fun if I had a group to play with, but no one I know will touch this game. And if Unity wasnt the glitchy, buggy slow running game it is. I dont want premium currencies nor do I want companion app games, I just want to be able to get 100 out of a game I paid full price for without feeling like Im missing out. I purchaced Unity on preorder and, after this mess and Colonial Marines, Ill never preorder a AAA game again.
