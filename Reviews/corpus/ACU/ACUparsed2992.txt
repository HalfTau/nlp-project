First off I havent had a single gameplay or graphics glitch/issue I got it after the patches. I run a single OCed HD7770 1GB well below the minimum it runs about 40 fps at 19201080 and will sometimes drop when loading large areas and stuff. The graphics settings are Environment Med, Texture High, Shadow Low, Ambient Occulsion SSAO, Bloom On, AA Off, VSync On. You may think some of these settings sound bad, but in game play you really dont see it and considering the crappiness of my GPU it looks very nice. In cutscenes the lower quality is visible, but it doesnt really matter it doesnt effect the storytelling. The gameplay is highly replayable and very fun, the assassinations all feel different, even the multiple chasing parts of the game manage not to feel repetitive. Being 28.1 Hrs in I have completed the main quests, but not done much else. I feel the game will least 50  75 hours considering I have only been to about 1/3 of the map and havent done the Dead Kings DLC. My only problem with the gameplay is on some of the later harder assassinations if you die you go back to the start and need to do everything again. I was about 10 metres from escaping the area and a enemy shot me with a rifle  and I had to redo about 20  30 minutes of gameplay again.Even if you have to play at the lower/lowest I have tried the lowest settings quality graphics buy it for the fantastic gameplay.Also the environmental/background audio for this game is awesome, it really helps give the world the feeling that it is alive.Also the download is 45GB and my other important specs are i5 3570k 4.5Ghz 8GB 1600Hz 128GB SSD HyperX 3k GAZ77D3H rev 1.0 Motherboard
