ATTENTION EVERYONE WHO HAD PROBLEMS WITH UNITY! This game had a patch not to long ago and it runs smoothly now. I havent come across any glitches or bugs yet. So talking about the game now. Yes the story is about the same as any AC story. Kill the Templars. Cool thing about the missions is you choose how the missions go. Such as sneaking, or running right in blunt force, or maybe follow and attack! Up to you. Combat is different and more aimed like AC 2 and Brotherhood. It takes a little skill instead of counter and killing immedietly. So for me I love the combat skill. I know when I can and cant fight, more realism to it. Stealth is amazing and sneaking around is very well balanced and fluent. Free running and parkour is just like Syndicate, hold a button to climb down fast and cool moves happen as you run around the map. I have to say the graphics take the cake for the game. Cutscenes and even during gameplay it feels so real, like Im watching a movie! And my last favorite thing was the suite cumstomization, you could basically choose what you want to wear for your head, chest, waiste, feet, hands, and pants. Blew me away! Plus they all have perks like extra health or more stealth. Definetely a good game now for sure thanks to the glitches and bugs being fixed. I would pick it up during the Christmas sale. Well worth it!
