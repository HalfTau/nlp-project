A beautiful, beautiful game that has had it share of bugs. Playing this pirated is nearly impossible as Ive tried many times, Ive possibly used more time on fixing this than playing it, and that says how much I love this game. The beautiful Paris setting during the revolution and around the Bastille, Madame Tussaud and so forth.  Environment, voice acting, cinematics and everything is great. I know many talk sht about this game, and it is understandable with the bugs, but this time around I have had none yet. Very recommended.
