Having played most of the Assassins Creed products I have to say this was quite a let down. If you loved AC2 and ACBF then this game will be a complete disappointment to you.LikedDidnt have odd flash forwards to present, instead incorporated more of a link to how you were tactically using hacked serversMoney seemed much thinner and felt like you had to be very resource cautious when levelingDislikedSkill Unlock system seemed unneeded. I would have rather had an attribute system that made up for the health/damage buff to allow you to specialize your character more for combat/stealthSome mission checkpoints required skills you might not have unlockedHatedCombat system revamp, probobaly one of the most frustrating things about this AC compared to the almost perfectperhaps a bit easy combat system of the others. I understand the need to make it slightly more difficult, however I think they made to strong of an adjustment.Enemies can be off screenand often are and can charge and execute fully powered attacksEnemies often use pistols in combatwhich adds realism for sure, but the seem to not have friendly fire. They can and    will often shoot through crowds, comrades without issue to hit you.There is no story based explanation to how to dodge bullets or unparryable attacks.You seem woefully underpowered with the lack of abilities to break parriesAKA Sand attackStory was utterly boring. Period. I mean how can you be in the most crazy, brilliant, excellent era for an AC game and it ended being utterly disappointed. Our character seemed to basically float alongside the events rather than be a part of them, having no utter impact on the world/timeline around him.Overall, its seems like a very bland AC game...like a box of cereral thats Cereal Brand and Cereal flavor.Get it on sale if you want to play it.
