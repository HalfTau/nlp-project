1. If you dont have good gaming computer from 2014 its not gonna run smooth.2. They should fix the bugs, the lagg and make it run better with bit older computers.3. I wouldnt recommend to buy this game. I dont have the newest PC and its just so tacky and feels realy laggy and probably is.FIGURED SOMETHING OUT THAT MIGHT HELP!If your game is laggy and doesnt run well TRY THESE to make it better! Play around with your Graphics  Aspect ratio and Resolution. If you change your Aspect r. it will make it graphically better or worst. If it seems graphically good and youre not laggy stick with that, but for those one who cant run itwith good graphis change it that it seems worst. When it seems worst use that. After your done with that play around with your Resolution. When you find resolution that is good enough does not lag so much, but you can still see quite well       use that Resolution.EXAMPLE Im playing with laptop and I set my Aspect ratio to 43, it seems bad when you havent changed your resolution yet!Next I changed my Resolution to 1024x768 and now I can see all quite well still bit pixelated, but its worth it that you can play the game atleast.I went to game and played few mission and my computer doesnt lagg that much that I used to and DOES NOT HEAT UP THAT MUCH EITHER!I hope these steps helped to run this game better, that still is not quite there where it should be..Still dont recommend this game because of all the bugs and too high performance needed to run this.
