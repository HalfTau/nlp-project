Nice game, good story, decent graphics but it only runs in 1280x1024 so,, be careful with higher resolutions, it wont work, took me a couple of hours to make it run because my screen is bigger... Guess what ubisoft said when I told them that the game crashes before the starts? Your processor and graphic card maybe dont support the game v
