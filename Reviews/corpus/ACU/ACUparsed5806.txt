You know i have a subpar rig GTX 770 sc i5 750 2.67 ghz and 4gb ram and im rinning it okay on high, and it is actually SO MUCH FUN, im grateful i dont have these bugs because the game is an ambitious step up for the AC series and when this game gets a normal patch it should have more positive reviews
