Because of the sale, and the time that has passed since its release, I figured now would be an okay time to pickup ACU, assuming much of the technical problems the game was facing would be solved. I was wrong. I was able to run the game at 4570 FPS a mix of high/ultra settings for most of my play time, but the popin, dear christ the popin is so horrendous. You cant walk 10 feet without seeing an NPC suddenly popin from nowhere right in front of you, or their level of detail suddenly change drastically inches from you. The building level of detail changes are quite harsh too, a building 100 feet away looks like something out of a Playstation One game, and after tinkering with the video settings for some time, and searching for a while on a number of websites and forums, I was unable to find a solution to either of these things.Id say pass on this game, unless you find it for like 1015 from somewhere, or go pickup Black Flag or Rogue. I dont see Ubisoft ever being able to fully fix this title.
