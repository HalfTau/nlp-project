Definitely some improvements but it would be nice if I could play it for more than 20 minutes without it crashing on any of my computers. Ubisoft bombed hard on this one and I dont think they seem very interested in polishing as much as they have in their previous games. These AC games are getting rushed out now like its made in an assembly line.
