The game looks beautiful, that is, until you try to do anything.  Odd screen lag and hiccups abound, even the menu is not safe from the slow down.  Im not sure how my computer was able to go from max settings in AC 4 with no slowdown no matter the venue to being completely unable to function when fighting two guards in ACU on the lowest settings but Ubisoft made it happen.In its current form I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  Save your money and your time, dont waste it here.
