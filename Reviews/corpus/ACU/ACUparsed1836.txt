All I ever heard about this game was negative, and I believed it. I was right to believe it, it looked like a broken mess that took flying across the rooftops a bit too literally. Then, more than a year later, it gets gifted to me for my birthday, I download it, and find what this game was meant to be. It no longer runs like a slug with poor motivation, but like an eagle, gracefully gliding cross the welllight streets of revolutionary Paris till that is shattered when you play coop and get murdered by a fish barrel. But the glitches that still exist in considerable quantities in the multiplayer arent gamebraking, mostly they just make me laugh. I once had to get all these npcs out of a small tunnel, but some stood right in the dooway and wouldnt budge, halting the mission. I solved this by getting everyone to shoot one uncooperative citizen each so the rest of the crowd could continue. When I just want to play the game however, the singleplayer provides more than enough to keep me busy, and though I may get heavily scolded for this, at points I get more sidetracked than in Fallout 4. THERE I SAID IT.It is a faithful return to the ACII days of the series, and is well worth the 14 extra gigabytes of patches.THUMBS UP UBISOFT
