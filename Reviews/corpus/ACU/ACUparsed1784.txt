This series is great if u want to play with your friends since only this AC supports coop BUT there are alot of flaws in this game1 The movement of the character is kinda weird? it does not respond smoothly and properly while parkouring and climbing stuff.2 The story is kinda meh i only found the love between Arno and Elise to be actually more intresting than the revolution xPJust a personal opinion might be immersive for others3 Combat wise is abit buggy too at times while trying to attack enemies i would just spin my weapon infront of them! And the quick shot is just horrible while its nice having all those cherry/stun/poison bombs i dont see how cherry is better than whistling feature in Black Flag, stun is great but i cant assasinate them or quick kill enemies with it soo whats the point if its like smoke which is nerfed.
