First of all I want to say that this game is awesome! Maybe my favourite Assassins Creed game there is.I had some problems when I first started but I fixed by installing the Nvidia updates that I ignored for a whileatleast I think that is what fixed itThe combat in the game is harder at first but once you get used to it, and once you get more weapons it gets easier. That brings me to customisation...IT is really great. You have a lot of variation in weapons and armor allthough once you get the best equipment that  you can, the first ones that might have looked cooler become obsolete.Multiplayer works fine so far. I havent had any major problems with it allthough once I couldnt finish a multiplayer mission because the woman I was supposed to follow wasnt moving at all but once I tried it again, it worked fine.Lets talk a bit about the main character Arno Dorian.He is really likable in my opinion. Maybe not as likable as Ezio but he is easily in the top 2 or 3 Assassins in my list.He has the ability to climb down fast which is really great and smooth allthough sometimes going the way you want may be a bit tricky. I havent noticed any big performance problems. Runs pretty smoothly so far. Sometimes it might be a bit slow and I had a small crashing problem at one point but that was fixed all of a sudden.Conclusion. It is a great game but if you are not sure if your computer can run it, you should probably wait for the game to be on sale or otherwise cheaper. I am lucky that it has worked with no major problems.
