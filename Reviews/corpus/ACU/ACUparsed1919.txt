This game is, without a doubt, the worst game in the series.  The gameplay changes are so terrible they actually make me not want to play any other Assassins Creed game.  And Ive tried so hard to get through this game.  No matter what everyone else said, I was going to get through this.I cant run away from enemies, I cant fight the enemies, I cant shoot the enemies because the game moves me once Ive lined up a target and fired.  WTF Ubisoft?  I hope important people got fired for the horrible POS you spent years working on.  Take a lesson from Rocksteady Games  dont change the damn gameplay, just tweak it and make it smoother.  Black Flag and Rogue were perfect games, but after Unity, Im deleting my entire AC lineup from my computer, and I wish there were a burn to ashes option in Steam, because I will never again touch anything associated with Ubisoft.
