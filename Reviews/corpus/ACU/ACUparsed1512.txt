Game is awesome, honestly. But im not gonna give it a good review because like many other PC games AAA titles that plaque us PC gamers,  have lazy devs. BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS and didnt i mention? BUGS... Very dissappointed. For me this game crashes consistently and other issues. Do devs even care about us anymore? Ubisoft, you suck big floppy donkey Halfcompany. Uber limpis more like it. Pro tip,  your garbage app. Let steam handle everything.
