it is an unfinished poop game that is not worth any money at all they have failed to fix the issues with the game and it is not possible to enjoy i have been a fan since the first game and played that on my xbox all the time along with all the other games i really tried to like it and see past the glitches and look at the gameplay but even that was dull and the story seems like it was recycled from one of their other games with maybe just one interesting twist to SPOILER his girlfriend being templar but in ac 3 conners dad SPOILER was a templar soo not too surprising to me at least
