this game is horribly optimised.... even after 2 patches the game STILL ing crashes when i literally just came back from where i started right after the very first cutscene where the templars were betrayed its still unplayable for me and it pisses me off SO ING BAD!! that i want either a full refund back or they pay me 50 euros back because this game is a total worth of 10 euros to me not 60 euros it saddens me that games these days are just thrown at you while they are just not bug free its always about the ing money not enjoying what you do... its like hey heres a broken game have fun you tard!! i keep hoping that some company takes you over ubidickcheese and i hope they will do a better job than you ever did before
