Great game, I had heard it was buggy and choppy gameplay, with framerate issues, but I feel these problems must have been fixed because I have experienced none of these.  I highly recommend the game, especially if your an AC fan.  The gameplay is excellent, I like the gearing system, huge enviroment to roam in, and best of all FINALLY full on Coop.  Not only multiplayer missions 24 people random queue available, but you can also invite your friends directly into your game.
