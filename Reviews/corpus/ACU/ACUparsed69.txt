Wow. The absolute low point of the series so far. Its far better than when it came out, no weird faces and gamebreaking bugs, but still plenty of clipping errors, and I had a few crashes as well. The city is nice, but the trillion little icons on your map offer no meaningful gameplay, just meaningless collectibles and repetitive side quests. Arno is the most forgettable protagonist, but the murder mysteries were nice.
