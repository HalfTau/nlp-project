This game runs well on my laptop. The menus are laggy but that isnt a concern of mine. gameplay feels unique and exciting compared to previous assassins creed games. They nailed the parkour aspect of this game with the parkour up and down options and the new stealth mode allows for many new tactics. For those of you who complain about poor performance on your high end systems, did you check that your pc is built for a game more intesive than assassins creed brotherhood?
