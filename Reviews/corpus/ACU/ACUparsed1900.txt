Gorgeous graphics, refined parkour and a more difficult combat system defines Unity. I played this right after Rogue and Syndicate. The graphics are smooth as butter, as expected with the onslaught of patches this games was subjected to. The narrative of the game while interesting because of the French Revolution backdrop is the weakest of all the Assassins Creed games. Well, maybe a little more compelling than the token narrative found in Syndicate. But Syndicate had fun missions. The Assassinations were the only entertaining parts and they were plenty of them. Paris, Versailles and Francaide are included in this game, and provides a lot of space for urban combat with the annoying patriots and scanvenging hunt. The main story plus the additional DLC that is free for all takes around 10 hours to complete. No kidding. Is a brief game, but it feels very, very long. Still, it wasnt a torture like Assassins Creed III with his unseffurable protagonist. This time Arno is kind of a nice guy. Its a forgettable entry in the series, but provides plenty of doing for impulsive collectors and scavengers. Lots of collectables, and tons of rather boring side missions which I didnt enjoy at all. Recommended, but only at sale price. Playing with subs with french VO is a must if you want to enjoy the game and the atmosphere of the time.
