It had so much potential... But yet again Ubisoft has to  it up just so they can cash in at the bank. And this is coming from someone who has bought all of the assassins creed games. This game is full of technical, gameplay, mechanical, and ESPECIALLY PREFORMANCE bugs/issues. I wish this game could have been a huge success but no. Thanks ubisoft...
