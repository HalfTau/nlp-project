Awesome game!Im a big fan of the franchise and this game great! The only thing i wouldve wanted was if i couldve had better framerate, but its tolerable.There are minor bugs, but nothing too big.One of the things that are bugging me the most about this game is the inability to have multiple saves, because i usually playthrough my AC games atleast two times, but it seems that you only get one save, which you cant even start over C. But otherwise its a good game. A bit overpriced, but still good.
