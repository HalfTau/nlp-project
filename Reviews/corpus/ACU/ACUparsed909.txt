Okay guys,As you can tell Ive sunk my teeth into this game over the last 8 months or so. I was a patient gamer and waited for the game to get patched, which in this case was a GREAT idea. Playing on a GTX 960 2GB I mustve fiddled a good dozen hours to play between the recommended 30fps and ratcheted down the graphics to get about 60fps, so I got a flavour of both. This game is by far the most complete, gorgeous open sandbox Ive ever played. The progression of the AC series saw its best with the next gen Anvil engine, which was also used for AC syndicate but I have not played yet. Is is as significant a bump in scope and quality from its predecessor as AC II was from the first. Bravo Ubisoft!Now about the meat and bones of the game, Anvil being the remarkable bones. This game attemps to be an action game, a sleuthing game, a cooperative game and finally and maybe its most weakest aspect with respect to the others, a puzzle game. My biggest gripe is always the AI, though quicker there were a few overlaps in windows which seemed unplanned, but could be turned off if you wish so. Gameplaywise, the fluidity with which Arno climbs over and under obstacles is the most fluid Ive seen. Combat, though slightly confusing at first, is medium difficulty and medium fun.The thing about this game is the scope and the way Ubisoft meshes its own althistory I Know, I know with the epoch in which you play. I heard they wont lean as much on the historic aspects for Empire, which would disappoint me greatly. Chances are though I wont be around.Enjoy this game! Thank Ubisoft for always extending their scope and giving us quality games like weve never seen before. Rock the casbah!!! Just not my casbah motherfers! !
