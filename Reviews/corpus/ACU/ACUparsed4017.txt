Welp...I had to be a hard head and buy this game.  All the bad reviews are correct.  I was hoping they were all going to end up being exaggerations, but no there are all correct.  Its only 40, I thought to myself.  12g Ram Nividia G Fource 870 4th gen i7 intel processor and this game is unplayable.  I was really getting into the story too.  These two guys stole my watch, and I gave chase, but my computer ended up loosing the race.  What am I doing wrong here?
