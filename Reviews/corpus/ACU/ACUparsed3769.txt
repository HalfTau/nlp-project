I have completed this game 100 through the story. I have a single Nvidia 980 GTX GPU. This game plays splendidly on my machine. It does have its bugs, though I experienced very little of them. I thought a lot of the changes, although still fun, did not exceed the previous AC games. I feel a lot of the point of a sequel is to excel in everyway or at least stay on par with. Unity barely stays on par. In regards to some aspects of the game I wanna say it dropped off a bit.Overall I do recommend this game. If your computer can handle it, then I say give it a try. I do hope they change a lot of things for next years game. I do not find myself wanting to go back through this game for 100 completion, contrary to my wanting to do that for every other game in the seriesexcluding AC IIs feathers. Those things are a waste of time.
