I hate to admit it, but I love this game and it runs great on my rig however my rig is rather hefty i5 4670k, 2 x R9290X crossfirex. I run this game at 1440p with Ultra settings and 2xMSAA. I get a steady 4045fps which is just fine with me. The attention to detail in the graphics is gorgeous. The changes to gameplay are also really great combat, customisation, freerunning. However, I must say that I do feel sorry for most players my rig is ridiculously expensive, and Im sure that at the moment this game runs terribly on older/lesser PCs. Before I updated to the catalyst 14.11.1 beta I had terrible performance, so I would recommend that. In summary, awesome graphics, awesome game, requires expensive PC to run.
