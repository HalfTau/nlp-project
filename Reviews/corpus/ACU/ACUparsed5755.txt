This game is fun...when it works. Which is like 10 of the time. First of all, unless your computer is optimus prime in disguise, this game will drop frames like a mother. I have a GTX 750ti with 2GB RAM and it runs around 2530fps on low settings, SMH.Honeslty most of the issues with this game I feel can be fixed with updates, but until then, i wouldnt reccomend this game. Ive played all of the Assassins Creed games, and this game by far is the least optimized and has the most bugs.I love this game, and want it to work so bad!As for coop, its fun, but same problems, bugs, sometimes game breaking bugs.The games difficulty spike is tremendous, which i like, encouraging people not to simply run in rambo style, but sometimes seems harder than it needs to be. I typically die in one hit from a great axe, or two shots in the back from running away by an AI with perfect accuracy.The story isnt bad, but its nothing groundbreaking, I was honestly not really paying attention, I was too distracted by the weirdhair physics and inconsistent textures.Overall the game honestly feels rushed. I wouldve rather played Rogue this year and waited for AC Unity next year working optimally. It would have been well worth it. But the way it is now, if a patch isnt good enough to fix it, this is a waste of a title. I love Assassins Creed. And I really want to love this game. Im trying my hardest. But I cant lie when i say this game is broken, almost to the point of unplayable, and unless your a hardcore AC fan, you WILL NOT tolerate this game. You should be fine if you have a supercomputer, but that wont eliminate the bugs...Yeah, in my utmost honesty, being the dedicated AC fan that  I am, as much as I hate to say it Fck this game, buy Shadow of Mordor instead. Its basically the same game, except it works.
