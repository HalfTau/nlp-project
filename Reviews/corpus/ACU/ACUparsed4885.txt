systemMs Windows 8.1 64bitIntel Core i53350P  3.1 GHz8.0 GB RamNVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 2 GBI finished the game. Great graphics, even on low settings Good to handle for me on lowest setting, no mouse lag. Customizing your gear to make you even more deadly. Enemies are more challenging. They reintroduced the chest, so you can invest money to gain it later on. Storyline lacks depth, sometimes really easy to predict. Coop doesnt work for me, and a great ammount of other players. Invisable walls that just appear at times, so you really move. I got stuck in walls.In conclusionI truly like this game, but its most likely impossable to get into if you never played AC before. Also, people complained about the glitches. just 1 in 1000 npc glitches, from a cape moving when an npc stood still to a npc that just flew up/down. Point is, the game isnt finished to me. I cant play coop, nor get online. There arent any tricks to change that, until they patch it. BUT WHY RELEASE AN UNFINISHED GAME EVEN AFTER YOU MOVED THE PUBLICING DATE?Dont get me wrong, I truly enjoyed the game, but yeah, its just that its not finished for me. Unseptium16/11/14 1500 UTC 1
