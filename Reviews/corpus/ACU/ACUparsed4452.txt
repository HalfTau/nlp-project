I just beat Unity so I feel like I should write a review. I feel like this had potential to be an amazing game. However, even with a very good PC 3.6ghz i7, GTX 780, 16 GB RAM I experienced occasional frame drops. Unlike most people, I didnt see any bugs in my entire time playing 18 hours. I never fell through the map. Your experience may vary. The overall consensus of the community is that you should skip this game, and I agree to an extent.If you love the French revolution setting, have an amazing PC, and are willing to suffer from time to time, pick this up. If you want virtually the same graphics and love pirate ships, buy Black Flag, its more stable and cheaper. Enjoy!
