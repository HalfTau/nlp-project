UNBLEEDINGPLAYABLEim sure the game is amazing when it works, but the menu screen graphics are just a mess of white where you can just about see the play, options ect buttonsthen when you click play you get a lovely video where you can see graphics for all of around 6 seconds before it crashes completely ... yay
