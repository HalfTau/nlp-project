Ok this will be hard because the game is actually good but it still has some bugs and some huge bugs that cause Blue Screen Of Death, yes i had 17BSOD in the 90h that i playedno its not my pc any other game or app works no prob and running 4790k with 980ti so its well over the spec. One more huge bs it has is microtransactions so huge no no for me.DecisionWell no mather what the game is or how good it is, its given me 17BSOD so its not even a decision i wont be recomending this game because of that
