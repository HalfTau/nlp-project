A game that was highly critcised, said to be extremely glitchy and with a very dull storyline.So, starting with the gameplay, I found it to be very fun. Nothing really stands out, the parkour seems much easier than previous installments of the franchise and it is interesting to leap through one window then out another but there can be, like every AC game, fidgety movements these include things like making impossible leaps or going to places that you werent aiming for. However, it felt like this happened more in the coop but that could just be immersion into singleplayer.Arno, the protagonist. Ive read a lot about Arno, some calling him an Ezio rip off and others saying hes bland. They miss out a lot of opportunities with Arno, a key example of this would be having him confront his fathers killer , but I did enjoy seeing Arno sticking to his virtues constantly by questioning the council and believing in Elise. Overall, a protagonist whos story feels quite rushed especially near the end but that could be due to the fact they didnt consider making a second game with him.They had a lot of gear but not as much customization as youd hope, most assassins either looking the same as they go for the best gear or most assassins with different colours/outfits of old protagonists.The coop, something new and extremely interesting for a concept, was something I enjoyed because it added something outrageous and new to the franchise while also fitting into the game quite well it had moments where it felt slow and it can be a tad frustrating when playing with random people.Something Id love to see in the future installments as they did with WatchDogs 2 since the franchise has been quite focused on the Creed being a brotherhood.In conclusion, not the most detailed review but it was a game Id recommend if you want some good Assassins Creed gameplay while also seeing France which looks fantastic in all its glory, the only main con I can think of currently is the Animus sections which can be forced down your throat and they only seem to be used because they cant think of a transition or they want to gloat?Overall, a good game and a fine addition to the Assassins Creed franchise.
