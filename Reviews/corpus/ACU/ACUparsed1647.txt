So Ive been playing this game for about two weeks now Im 34 through it and I actually really like it. A lot of the game seems fluid and the story isnt bad either. The one glitch that I experienced was funny and didnt affect gameplay whatsoever. The only thing is that when I launched the game today, I chose my save file and it started to load. Then, right as the world faded into view, ACU.exe has stopped working. I couldnt launch it through Uplay either, so Im not sure what the issue is. All of my other games run fine and my specs are as followsi74790KGTX 9708GB RAM
