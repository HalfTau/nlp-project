Game is garbage compared to past assassin creed games, glitchy as hell, and overall unpleasent. Spend hours getting to a certain point, then crash and be unable to sync your cloud save to the pc. This game is garbage and I request a refund, I would have rather would have donated this money to a random hobo than to waste it on this game. You want a good 60 next gen game, I would even suggest cod rather than this
