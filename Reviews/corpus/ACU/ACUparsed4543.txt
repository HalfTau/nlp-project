Dont buy it. They have fixed most of the bugs now, but its not worth 60 euros. There are no riots, just people screaming and shouting. When you attack a guard, people dont help you and attack other guards like in one of the gameplay trailers, they run away... Dont buy this game becouse the trailer looks so good.Paris is really nice, and those minimissions are nice too. But the story is boring and short. Its not worth 60.5/10
