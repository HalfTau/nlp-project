Games Great dont get me wrong but the optimization is absolutly disgusting, when the game works, more like if the game works its fun to play and worth playing but how often it works is anytime there isnt anything on the sceen so yeah the loading screens work G ing G. I wont be playing this game anymore until its fixed and thats not to say I dont want to its just that I cant because Im stuck on a mission that requires you to stealth through a populated building and eliminate a target, normal AC fair, but its rendered impossible due to the fact that whenever your IN the building the framerate drops to single digits. I tried lowering my quality from Ultra high to low in an attempt to help with the frame loss but had the exact same amount of it, and before anyone goes and says, you need to restart your game to make all the different texture changes go through. I did still single digit frame rate. I the game is stabilized then I can see it being another great AC game but till then its unplayable.
