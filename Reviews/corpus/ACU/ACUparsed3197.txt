This game wasnt anything special, it is good, if you look past all the issues it has. It had a lot of potential. It wasnt this awful terrible thing that deserves a 1/10, but it could had been much better, WHERES THAT BLACK FLAG MAGIC????!!?? This game was more disappointing than anything, mostly because of the success of Black Flag. I do however think you should play it, not for 60 but for like 35, It is worth 35. This game is a game you should play because the story is decent, and its Assassins Creed, all the fun climbing, and assassinating is still there.
