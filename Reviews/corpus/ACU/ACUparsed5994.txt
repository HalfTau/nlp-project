I want to just make things short and sweet right now. I bought a new graphics card in order to play my games at the best possible quality. I am an nvidia user off the bat, so I will be comparing everything for nvidia stats. From the start, the recommended card for the game is the  Geforce GTX 780. I have the Super Clocked GTX 970 and have slightly overclocked the card myself with MSI afterburner. The following are the optomized settings for gameplay with this really powerful GPU.Ambient Occlusion OffAntialiasing OffDisplay Mode Full ScreenEnvironment Quality LowResolution 1360x768Shadow Quality LowTexture Quality LowNVIDIA Multiframe sampled antialiasing OffThese are the current optimized settings for the game with this card. This is not an opinion but simple facts which I feel will help a lot more people understand rather than how I previously explained that I was getting frame drops, lag, etc. I hope this helps and wards off people who cannot handle the game on their system. Im sure if I had a few Titans with SLI that I would enjoy the graphics and the story, however I dont. If the game had been coded better for PC than maybe we wouldnt have this issue, but thats what happens when they rush the port for pc from console. Oh well. Best of luck to you my friends!
