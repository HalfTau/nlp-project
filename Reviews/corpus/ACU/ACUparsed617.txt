Despite all the negative reviews, I really enjoyed the story and gameplay of this game. I began to understand and connect with characters Elise and Arno. It was my first Assassin Creed game and after it I am for sure going to play the rest of the series. I would advise playing the game in French with English subs as the voice acting is appalling and it also helps with the characterisation.
