Having a blast playing Unity. I have a GTX680 and I play in medium settings without problems. About the story... its not the best but its better than Twilight. The combat system have more variation, including one hand  long range spears mostly and heavy weapons yes, you can chop those s. I havent tried the multiplayer but at the time, everything is good for the 30 I paid.
