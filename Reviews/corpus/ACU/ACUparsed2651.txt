I just bought the game saying to myself that i would use steam refunds if the game ran like crap. FOR ME, the game runs decent, but I have a 4790k OC and a GTX 980 OC. My game settings were between ultra and high with AA off and my framerate was right around 60fps with drops into the 50s and rare drops in the 40s. I also had peaks in the 100fps.Enough with the performance, how is the story? Its decent. Its another assassins creed. My favourite AC was and still is blackflag but I have to say that the combat in unity is harder and that is a good thing because I have done a second playthrough of blackflag using only my fists. The way it worked, if you parried an attack from an opponent and replied instantly, it was a one hit kill whatever the weapon. In Unity, you can still parry but its not a one hit kill you cant use fists anymore    .
