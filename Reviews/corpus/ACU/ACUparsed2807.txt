I really would love it if there was another Assassins Creed game that was actually finished. Ubisoft, stop making deadlines you cannot meet. Take your time, finish the game until its on par with AC2 or ACB. We will understand if Synacate isnt finished by November. We want a winner this time Ubisoft. A real damn good winner. Something to talk about to other friends and to say that I am proud of it. Instead of increadibly disappointed with the overall gameplay and story. Make it something to remember, for the love of GabeN, make it something extraordinary!
