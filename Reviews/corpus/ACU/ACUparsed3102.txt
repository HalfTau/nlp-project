This game got a lot of bad press, but at this point as of Patch 5, I can finally recommend it. Patch 5 finally fixed the remaining issues I had SLI issues with water flickering and a few crash bugs. Game is running fine for me at this point, and, overall, its a fun addition to the franchise.ProsThe new movement system is much smoother than in previous editions, once you get used to it you can scale buildings, up, down, sideways, and diagonal, and make some impressive leaps, very fluidlyGraphis are pretty impressiveThe main story mission is of a decent length, and draws you inPlayer equipment customization armor is back to affecting stats, plus you can wear an outfit over the topReasonably interesting final boss fight, but you can cheese itAdditional game modes are interestingProgress in companion app is finally not required to access chests some chests would have taken forever to getThe too few cities are interesting and well mappedTheres only one property you can buy and improveConsThe ending to the main story sucks and is a letdown on so many levels, the Dead Kings DLC helps with that somewhat, but, avoiding spoilers, the biggest thing that made the ending suck doesnt change and cant change as its pretty final what happensNo ships, hunting, crafting ?!?!Most of the armors, and the pants, look pretty cheesy, even if themed according to the period prowler armor is decent thoughNo recruiting and training up Assassins ingame, its all handled through the companion app which means you cant access them ingame to help with missionsFeels like a much smaller world than previous titlesAll in all its a good addition, if there would have been naval combat, assassins ingame, crafting, and more opportunity to explore and no bugs at launch, and to own property, it would have been one of the best, as it is, I put it somewhere around Assassins Creed 2. Black Flag is still the best game in the series to me, but I havent played Rogue yet.
