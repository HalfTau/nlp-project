Despite all the negative reviews and people telling me not to buy it, I got this game anyway since Im a huge AC fan. Well, I ed up. Ive played all the ACs up until Rogue and loved them to death, however, this game is mostly crap.Pros Graphics are pretty cool. The new combat system it doesnt let you kill a whole army spamming random keys. You are much more vulnerable. The new stealth system the enemies are not as nearly as dumb before. They can see you even if youre above ground and there is CROUCHING! it took so longNeutral0 The coop isnt a must but its okay I guess. I dont hate it nor love it.0 Picklocking system its not creative at all but why not just have it?Cons The plot is just crap. Its just a much worse version of Ezios vengeance themed story. Nothing interesting ever goes on. The characters are pretty uninteresting. The bugs. They are still aton of bugs. Arno never really does what you want him to do exactly. The civilians can be seen wandering in peculiar places doing peculiar things. The devs were absolutely careless. In addition to the bugs, there is only one store not exactly a store, just a guy selling which you buy everything from. It also really annoyed me that when you loot somewhere, you dont actually get the item the game tells you got. You just receive the attached money value. Would adding some details require too much work? Absolutely awful sidequests I wouldnt even call them sidequests. The game is pretty much empty other than the main quests. There arent many creative and unique sidequests. All you pretty much do is assassinate some random citizen, tackle a thief etc. No insight whatsoever. No decent present day plot best part of the series was the combination of present day and the past. They destroyed that completely.Overall, I wouldnt recommend this game. For me, its just pretty. Youd enjoy looking at the screenshots more than playing the game itself and experiencing true horror.
