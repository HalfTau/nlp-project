Well, me being a fan of the Assassins Creed franchise and Ubisoft, I was really looking forward to this game and was hyped for it. When I got it on its release date preordered for bonuses which is stupid in my opinion, the game ran horrible. Im sure everyone already knows this. I got at least 2030 fps. Now its stable from 4060 fps. Its great that Ubisoft listened to all the feedback. So, now about the game. The story to me was.. okay. It wasnt as captivating and got me into it to the point where I almost cried like other AC games. Thats my take on the story thats all I have to say about it. The combat was greatly improved in my opinion, you have to actually be good and time your attacks in this game unlike their previous games which were justThe stealth was also greatly improved. Im a stealthy kind of guy when it comes to choosing my own playstyle, so Ive experienced the stealth a bit more. You have to ACTUALLY be stealthy. Unlike previous AC games when you could just run around guards and not get noticed. The AI is improved and are smarter. The voice acting was fantastic for most characters. Some were not as good as some main characters, but thats ok since you only have to hear them like once or twice. The coop multiplayer is a lot of fun, jumping around rooftops with your friends is one of the most fun things in this game. I absolutely HATE the companion app, the startup is slow, the puzzles are annoying, but the only reason I was playing it was to get Altairs outfit, but now theyve updated it and heard the peoples voices that the companion app sucks. In overall, this game is fun. 7/10
