I would definitely NOT recommend this game at its current state. Theres been 3 patches at this moment, non of them fixed anything, just added a DLC which for gods sake is a stupid move to do. even at recommended specs you cant run this.They have microtransactions which is ANOTHER friggin thing theyve done horribly wrong, not to mention the companion app chests you find pretty much everywhere.No, do NOT buy this game. If you did I feel sorry for you.
