1/13/2015  Changed my recommendation to a thumbs up. While minor bugs and even huge gamebreaking bugs still exist, its definitely playable, and playable to a satisfactory level 60fps consistent with the occasional small drop to the midlow 50s. We are aware that the graphics performance of Assassins Creed Unity on PC may be adversely affected by certain AMD CPU and GPU configurations, Ubisoft wrote. Wait, what? Intel Core i75960X at 4.5Ghz, dual GTX 780 Ti SCs, and 16GB of 2400Mhz DDR4, yet I still struggle to break 40fps on low settings? Missed the mark by a mile.The story, so far, has been great. So my thumbs down is strictly on behalf of the poor performance that keeps the game from living up to what it COULD have been. I really, really hope that a patch is released very soon.I really wanted to enjoy this game! But in its current state, I cant help but to be annoyed every time that I boot it up.
