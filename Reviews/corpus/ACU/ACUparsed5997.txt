Rating 6/ 10This game is beautiful with amazing buildings and animations been playing it almost for 4 hours, but most importantly the controls suck, probably one of the worst with this one. Another problem are the combat controls they are very painful and burdensome. The game frame rate drops so low 40 fps from ultra revolution. Its super constant, about 90 of the time. These problems make the game unplayable and horrible. I love assassins creed but this was a huge disappointment.
