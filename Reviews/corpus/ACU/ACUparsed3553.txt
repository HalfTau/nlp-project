After Black Flag, it was going to be hard to beat the wide open freedom of AC4.  In more ways than one, this game, AC5, falls flat.  It felt very short, disjointed and there was a real lack of atmosphere during the entire game.  The added RPG, element, of weapon and accessories upgrades, didnt really add enough to make this game a stand out.  My personal view is that this is tied for the worst of the series. I would put AC4 first and AC2 a close second.  There isnt much here to warranty the cost.  Maybe wait till its about 10
