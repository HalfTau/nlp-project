this might be the worst ac in the whole series, the know the intuitiveness where the character heades the direction you meant for them to go, whell they threw everything theyve built on ont the window, you will climb every ledge you didnt mean to whilst getting away from noone. the combat is boring now, arno is easily the weakest least useful assassian ever portrayed, oh and skill points?! you dont get those unless you can convince your friend its not that  of a game, because they only come from coop missions QUITE FRANKLY THE WORST ASSASSIANS CREED TO DATE
