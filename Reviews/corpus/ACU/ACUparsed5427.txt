Dont believe the haters. This game delivers. The details are overwhelming, the amount of content is beyond anything Ive ever seen. The story is great, the characters really begin to develop, and the missions are varied and a lot of fun. Ive already spent 8 hours doing nothing more than a few missions and exploring the NotreDame Cathedral, lol.I highly recommend this. Im running with most settings maxed check Nvidias graphics guide if you have an Nvidia card and it is as smooth as can be.Trust me, if youre a fan of open world games and seamless coop, this game is for you.
