Preordered this game, collectors edition, because I believed from what I played from Black Flag, this was going to be a decent game. Game came out, got slapped in the face so hard, I almost just tried to look for a refund. However, I told to myself, this is open release, it tends to have bugs so wait for a patch. The game stutters so hard that I was like playing a low end, low frame rate, trash game. This should not be the case.FOUR PATCHES LATER. In my personal opinion, NOTHING WAS FIXED. Oh great, my FPS went from 10 to 12. So I looked around and tried to find ways to fix this issue. One thing I found was to disable your SLI on your graphics card to play this game on 1020 frames per second. Another was to set everything to low for 30 frames which is what the consoles play with.I tried to playing this game on all low and I just cant stand it. This game is NOT made to play on paint splatters and ugly textures on PC might as well buy the console version and play it on console as its optimatized for them.And another way to fix this is to get a GTX 980 just to fix the stuttering alone. JUST the stuttering. This is ridiculous, what have the developers in Ubisoft been doing? Obviously all stoned while working.I tried playing this game, gave it a few hours and I just cant continue anymore. I just cant, its just so bad that I cant bring myself to see what this game can offer me and I will definitely push for a refund for this because quite honestly, this is just atrocious. The few hours Ive played was fun and interesting if anything.
