Ive been a huge fan of this series from the very first game. After extreme satisfaction from Black Flag, I couldnt wait to get my hands on this game, especially since its set during the French Revolution. However, I am extremely disappointed in this game. I dont even think this was optimized, as I am well above the recommended specs but I cannot play on normal graphics settings without my fps dipping well below 30 FPS.Melee combat has been nerfed on an extrodinary scale. This can be a good thing or bad thing depending how you liked the melee in the past games. I for one am not a fan of dying to 4 enemies. Oh, they also got rid of using people as a body shield when enemies are about to fire, lovely isnt it?Im not a fan of how coop was forced upon us. You are forced to play coop missions in order to get 5 star armor. Most people playing coop have absolutely no care for stealth and will just run into the mission guns ablazing. I could expect this, but coop should not be forced on us.The parkour in this series has always frustrated me, no matter what. I thought they were getting better with it in Black Flag, but this game has taken 2 steps backwards. It seems like theyve tried to get too cute with the parkour and now its no longer flowing. Theres countless times where Arno will just stay hanging from a ledge because I do not press the free run up button. Entering through windows is extremely buggy. Most of the time Arno will climb around the open window instead of actually climbing in it.On top of all this, Ubisoft has decided to add microtransactions in game. This utterly disgusts me, and the fact that there are 3 different currencies in this game is just plain ridiculous.Overall, this game feels like an Alpha release, and I cannot recommend this game whatsoever.
