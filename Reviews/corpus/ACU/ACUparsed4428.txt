One of the most laughably rushed games in recent memory. The game at launch had a slew of problems on all platforms rendering the game almost unplayable. I would fall through the map about every 1020 minutes of gameplay simply by, ya know... playing the game.The lack of polish, even during cutscenes, is startling. Characters just pop in and out of existence because the developers were too lazy to animate them any further.This is the first game in a long time that I completely regret purchasing on day one or at all. Just an embarrassment for Ubisoft. After Black Flag made me an AC fan, ACUnity has done the complete opposite and I will be wary of purchasing anymore AC games or Ubisoft games for that matter.
