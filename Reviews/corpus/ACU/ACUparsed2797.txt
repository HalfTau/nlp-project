If this is what next gen can give us then i prefer to stay old gen seriouly this is unexceptable for a next gen game released a couple of months ago.. first off the game runs horrible on my GTX 960 on low setting with a 30 fps cap , secondly did the dev even bother to patch the performance on certain cutsenes which lags your game , i can see a crap tone of glitches on which i saw after release which is still not fixed .Glitches and Bugs Getting stuck in a corner when ai refuses to move Ai civilians glitching in and out of the map Blurry texture when zoomed into an object Teleporting ai The rag boll effects when there is a big crowed is horrible. Cover system glitchs arno into the object or wall Awkard Ai following glitchesOverall i got this game june 2015 and i thought well might give it a try but i was wrong ..What is good about the game Different combat system to other AC Setting during the french revolution New gadgets and weapons Interaction with the interiors of buildings A proper designed steath crouching system Interesting storyline Coop for friendly players Rich environment with lots of AI civilians Huge city with banks and historical sites Free season passWhats Bad about the game Horrible graphics performance on high end graphic cards Still unfixed bugs and glitches Uplay and their pointless DLC pack Apps to unlock chests No naval combat or change of settings Annoying english voiceing Huge game of 50GB loot system is broken Badly designed Coop missions Laggy main menu Club competition is rigged and broken No way to dodge or block bullets , die from 2 shots Over priced even at 50 off Online mode crashes the game Pressing Shift and Space at the same time , seriouslyThis should have been a great game but the development and marketing for the game just totally ruined it , it was suppose to be a big hype with all the cool features but it seems the developers needs a memo on how to patch a soild game and create something which doesnt kill consoles and pc. If you are a AC fan like me ill just push myself through the game but others for just experience go with something else like rouge as a better choice .
