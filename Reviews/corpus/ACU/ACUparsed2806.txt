Saw all the bad reviewsWaited till i saw reviews saying things like App removed Bugs fixedBought on salePlayed.Loved it, it is my favorite assassins creed to date by far. MAKE SURE YOUR RIG CAN RUN IT!Yes, you can buy it now, its fun and not a pain in thenow. Shame the rating will probably never improve since people review at the start then never change it when the game is repaired.GoodCustomisation is by far the best of any assassins creedArno isnt a boring By the books lets do the job and be proffessional assassin characterNo more modern day with whatshisname Desmond? i never like those but many doNOTE The new Modern Day segments mostly seem to showcase the devs talents for level design, as if they said Hmm... Arno cant climb the eiffel tower since it hasnt been built yet... but we could throw a level in where he can and call it modern day! The segments were fun to me and a good way to break up the story which was mostly assassination missions around paris Alot of them, and they all have multiple ways to get to the target and allow a decent amount of freedomSo many weapons and toys to use, poison bombs, massive swords, massive swordstaves, maces, morningstars, pistols, pepperboxes, rifles Yes, rifles, finallyCan free run DOWN instead of just jumping and hoping you dont dieBadThe new free running system takes getting used to.Romace, ewwwCannot carry a rifle and a melee weapon of any kind, i guess arno isnt as strong as adewale, and the rifles themselves cant make a 60 meter shotFact is, alot of the continued hate on unity is unwarranted and is just how some gamers act. Theyll   about anything, and ive heard it all before and playing it now, none of the things said were nearly as awful I cant speak for the app or bugs because they are gone The animations look splendid, the sounds are crisp and wonderful.Not much else to say about her! have a specific question you cannot find elsewhere? ask in the comments!EDIT While i still content the game is fine, i have had to reinstall the uplay game launcher 3 TIMES NOW because it DIES everytime the game crashes. I used to be with the crowd that said Uplay aint so bad But now im BEGGING someone at ubisoft to take a sledgehammer and BEAT IT UNTIL IT STOPS TWITCHING!
