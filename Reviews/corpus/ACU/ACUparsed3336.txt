I cannot recommend this game to any of my friends.There are a lot of great elements to this game, but the bugs and lack of support suck much of the joy out of the game.If you must purchase this game, wait for it to come on sale late 2015.  Perhaps by then all of the issues will be resolved.After the initial issues with the game, Ubisoft offered to give a game for free as an apology to those purchasing the gold addition before a certain date.  When they finally announced the redemption site, it would not load due to redirect errors.After a few weeks of trying the site launches but doesn not work for me.   I put in a request for help on the support site weeks ago, but there have been no updates or progress.Today, all of my game progress has been reset.  I very much want to like this game, but I cant.   I dont think I will buy any Ubisoft titles in the future.
