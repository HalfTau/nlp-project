Unity is a lot more laggier and has more bugs compared to previous titles which have worked fine on my PC under the same specs/setup, even when Ive tried turning all the game options available down/off to reduce the lag and the apparent yet unnecessary high sensitivity of my mouse. From my perspecitive, I shouldnt have to go through my actual computer settings to turn down settings purely for this one game, as recommended on various forums. Also, Im assuming there was some combat updates in the game because that combined with lag makes it pretty difficult to complete combat missions, even those from the start.Despite that, Im still going to complete the main story at least due to my interest in the franchise and hope that I dont have to put up with this in future titles.That being said, the detailed character customisation, multiplayer element and additional skills are interesting addons.
