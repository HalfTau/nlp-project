If Steam had a Maybe option, thats what I would pick for this game. While the game itself is fun, besides the occasional bug most of them have been patched the performance issues make it borderline unplayable unless you have a 1080 or something, I have a GTX 960 and the game still suffers 2060 frames, now, maybe its just my processor but still. The game is fun though, and blending in with the crowd and stabbing dudes without anyone even noticing is fun and makes you feel badass, and the parkour is great, if not clunky at times. The combat is fun, but could definitely be improved. The coop is pretty fun, but it doesnt always work and might just give you an error that wont let your friends join you, and vice versa. Otherwise, great game.Also enable French voices with English subs for your own ears.
