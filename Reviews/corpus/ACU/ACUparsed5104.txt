21 hours of playtime here, no problems at all except for Uplay issues, but thats a tale for another time. Guess Im among the lucky ones.ACU is brilliant youre finally an assassin, part of the brotherhood, not pirate or some american native. The story, at last, revolves around assassins vs templars confrontation, with some really good voice acting. You have a lot of gadgets, customization options  completely new parkour system which feels very natural and requires some skill and time to master. And I wont even start about Paris and how astonishingly detailed and beautiful it is recreated. Also, they added coop  a feature that everybody wanted since AC1. It is quite diverse and will satisfy both groups of casual players that want to have some fun running around, killing everything together, and hardcore roleplaying fans, which will traverse through missions with thought and skill, moving like shadows and completing tasks without ever triggering an alarm.Basicly, they listened to their fans and made a game for them. If you enjoyed previous AC titles or you simply like vast openworld games with a lot of things to do  this game is for you.
