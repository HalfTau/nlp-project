I must say I love this game because it is a big step up. But they are some times where I have had enough of this game..Terrible AI, Terrible PC port, Terrible Storyline, Terrible Missions.I found where if I am running toward something, Arno will go to the object beside him. Plus I lag a bunch, sometimes, but sometimes it not bad, but personally I say this to everyone. Dont buy this game. Buy it on Xbox One or PS4. The PC port is worst first PC port I have ever played, and personally I hope other PC ports dont follow this  mess.4/10Great game but terrible problems with it. Next Generation AC BULLSHT!Thanks for reading..
