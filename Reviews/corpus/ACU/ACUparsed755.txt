I tried to give this a chance just so I could learn the Story base from it as im a huge fan of the franchise.as far as sequance 8 and now ive frankly lost my sht with this game..Parkour is completely fked when trying to do timed missions making it impossible..when trying to leap from one edge on a belcony then through the door.. nope you leap from the roof onto said belcony and then on the edge of the balcony and onto said buildings roof missing the door altogether!In timed missions fk ups like that cost you, and with the games so called parkour fluidity is fking with you and shty control system really doesnt work well..Im a patient man and its rare for me to loose my rag with a game.. but this really has pushed my limits..I just hope that later editions of the games dont suffer with all these flaws..
