The game runs horribly and has tons of weird bugs with characters teleporting around. The minimum recommended hardware for this game is rediculous, and I struggle to get 45ish fps on the lowest possible settings with an overclocked gtx 760. I love the assassins creed series but this game is just a waste of money.
