NOT INCLUDING PERFORMANCE ISSUES...This game is great in my opinion. The coop is so much fun even if it is not with your friends and you have to kind of lone wolf it. Story isnt anything special but is way better than Black Flag. Customization is amazing for this game and you can upgrade every item to give it that little bit extra.I would recomend this game to all my friends. And once Ubisoft sort out frame rate problems etc, this will be even better
