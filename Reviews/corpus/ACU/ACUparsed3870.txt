Assassins Creed Unity is one of the best game in the franchise. AC2 was my favorite because of the gameplay but the story line of Unity is just beast. The combat system in Unity is different from the other AC games because in Unity, you cant parry 2 enemies attacks at once unlike in AC4 Black Flag. I was able to finish the story in 18 hours. Here are the Pros and Cons.ProsYou feel the characters feelingsCombat system is differentGraphics are great if you set them on High or anything aboveMain Storylise de la Serre Everyone loves her shes a red headed girl!Voice ActingNew freestyle running moves / parkour movesMany more ConsStill needs some patchingOccasional Glitches French revolutionaries sitting in a treeRandom Framedrops Rare for me but I did recieve some FPS dropsI think thats allOverviewI think that this game is fantastic even though it has some bugs and glitches. The Coop is very interesting but not as fun as the main story/missions.  I thought it was worth 60. Ill update this when there is another patch.
