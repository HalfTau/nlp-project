there are always ups and downs ... and the downs that unfotunately happened with the starting due to the big number of  bugs and glitches does not imply sth bad as it may appear for the first glance ...there are sort of tradeoff in this game. as i have my own gameplay, the game is worthy ... and as long as i have fun and taste of suspense and that ... it is such a pretty   excellent gameit may be not as expected, i know .but not that bad as media and grading implied ...I strongly recommend to taste this newgen experience .
