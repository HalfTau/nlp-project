After all I cannot recommend this game. Its not just the high system requirement or bugs. There is something fundementally wrong about ACU. The graphics doesnt even look good at ultra high, The control of the character is a pain in the You will NEVER be able to make quick turn or quick jump. Everytime your character will jump to some random place or turn to random direction, making the hardest parkour challenge literally unplayable. To have precise control you must stop every sigle step, otherwise your character will not do according to your input. Correcting the characters movement all the time ruins game experience. The stupid companion is totally a waste of time so you will never get to 100 without downloading that BS app. The story is fine but very short. Its a 6/10 game.After patch 4 I have no complaint anymore.
