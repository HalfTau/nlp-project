I would love to like this game, however I cant bring myself to even finish the game. The renaissance setting is getting pretty tired, the controls are clunky. Although the setting and character looks pretty, the graphical performance is rather poor. If you have an itch to play yet another AC game, skip this one and play Syndicate.
