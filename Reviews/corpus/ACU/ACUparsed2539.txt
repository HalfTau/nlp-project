The only problem with this new engine is that it is horribly optimized and doesnt really play the game on most PCs unless they are higher end. I belive that Unity had wonderful things in it but they need to stop worring so much about graphics and more about playability. My friend payed for the gold edition and he could even get past the first cutscene because the game was so poorly optimized. The coop was fun when it worked and yes the game did look nice when the frames did not inexplicably drop from 45 to 1 in a second. the microtransactions were probably the dumbest ideas for this game. I never expected to have to see a pay to win assassins creed game.
