I want to start out this saying that I am not playing on a powerhouse pc. I wasnt even sure how well this game would run on this machine. This short review is of a currently uncompleted game on high settings, with bloom off.Despite all the glitches and issues people are experiencing, the game is solid. Totally worth it more, if you have friends to play with in CoOp or you can just hop into missions with random people
