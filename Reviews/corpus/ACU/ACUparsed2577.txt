Loved this AC. Its much better than AC4 Black Flag for many reasons. The travel time between places is significantly shorter. The coop missions are quite fun with others but I would suggest bringing friends over skype or some form of teamspeak to make it easier. The combat system is a little different from any other one in the past so it takes some getting used to but it is more involved. Some bugs that might annoy you is free running is a little buggy. But otherwise a blast.
