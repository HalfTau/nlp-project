Right now the game is not worth 60 even less 90.Even with a1080 High resolution, not even the maximum the framerates are unstable,just by moving the camera around your head. it is especially annoying when moving on the roofs, it will most certainly block when you will turn or about to jump, making you go far away from where you planned. thats killing it.the graphics looks good for sure, but you cant appreciate it with this frameblock every 1520 sec.They already realeased patch2, I dont even want to imagine how it was before.you dont need to think at all, run over the roofs, over the walls, there is no way you can fail. If you jump to a place a bit to far away, you will literally fly to reach it, no worries. The previous assassins creeds were more technical, I liked it. Now it is so easy that the map feels flat.I miss the times where games were realeased at once. No updates, No patches. Just a good, well tested game at once.It feels like BF4 so not tested, so laggy that it kills the gameplay. Ubisoft is not better than EA with this game, they do the same
