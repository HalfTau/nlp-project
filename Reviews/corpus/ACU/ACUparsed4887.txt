beautiful and interesting game storythe game looks amazing very beautiful graphic.The coop misions and the multi is very nice the optioin to just run in free world with your friend is amazing.i run this game on very high and and ultra on 16801050 resolutionand i didnt see any problemsyes you need to wait like 1 minute to load the gameand yes i did have once the bag that your under the groundand yes my game stuck for like half a minuta it hapend me only 3 times in like 5 hours of playing.All these problems are nonsense compared to what you get in the game.the combat is much harder and in my opinion much worth then in the last series but you will get use to it.so yes i recommend you to buy this game because it is amazing and this game is much betther then the last serios of assassins creed.this game worh every dolar out of my 60 and even more.my computar3,20 gigahertz Intel Core i54570NVIDIA GeForce GTX 6608 GB ram
