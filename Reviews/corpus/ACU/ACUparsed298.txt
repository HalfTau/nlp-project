I enjoyed this game. The storyline was weak, mostly disappointing and anticlimactic. I did enjoy the time travel aspects in the story but the present day storyline was almost nonexistent and clearly rushed. Nevertheless, the graphics in this game are arguably the best in the series including AC Origins. This makes map exploration extremely fun and rewarding.Just to note I played this game well after the bug fixes and patches. I understand there were many bugs when the game was released but I can only judge what I have experienced.
