Seems to be patched enough where its okay to play now,The story didnt seem to grab my attention much compared to other AC gamesCould be the long break i took from it because it was crap at launch.New fighting style requires you to slash and slash more and becomes more difficult when you group up lots of enemies which made me feel like less of a hero and kinda weaker compared to the other games.Lots of new customization gear wise, Different sets of armors give differnent bonusesStealth/Ranged/Combat etcNo Whistle, Frustrating that theres no good way of luring guards away from packs to stealth kill them around corners or in hiding spots.Parkour seems a bit of a downgrade when trying to direct your character different directions
