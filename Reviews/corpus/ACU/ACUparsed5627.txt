Get this game if you enjoy single digit frame rates and stuttering with pcs better than required specs running on low graphic settings and randomly falling into the world desyncing and failing the mission.They obviously either did no QA or outsourced all their QA to a team of mentally challenged walruses because the framerate drop and stuttering is constant and ever present on pcs with higher specs than the recommended specs  even on low preset settings and destroys any and all fun that can be had with the game or its story.Even the menu lags, which is ridiculous and absurd.  This is one of the worst launches Ive seen in a large franchise in a very long time.  Even Rome 2 TW and BF4 arguably had better launches than this.FYI.  This is even with the updated Nvidia drivers specifically for AC Unity.
