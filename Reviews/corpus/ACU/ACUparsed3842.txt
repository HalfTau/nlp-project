It was a little buggy at first but they have fixed many of the bugs. I still find myself falling through the map every once in a while but the game just sends you back to the last autosave. It lags a bit when moving through large crowds in multiplayer. Overall i think the game is great but i would suggest buying when it is on sale or for a reduced price. If these bugs and lag annoy you then wait for the next patch but it is playable, i just wish i did not have to use uplay.
