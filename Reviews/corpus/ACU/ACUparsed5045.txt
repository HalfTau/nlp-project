Game story is pretty awsome. nice dynamic flow and the missions dont feel too liniar , whitch is an attraction to me ! I must also comment and say that the attention to detail is quite amazing, The facial graphics  are verry nice and the attention that they put into the city is verry nice ! from a historical point of view its verry accurate and  overall a verry pretty game to play !There is still some stuff that needs a patch, but give it a week and it will be fixed.but over all i like it
