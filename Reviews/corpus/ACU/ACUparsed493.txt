After years since release its still full of bugs and not optimized. Gameplay is boring. Fights are easy, you can make lot of mistake but you still dont die. Controls is weird, confused and nonintuitive.Mission are repetitive  follow this guy, follow that guy. Kill this guy and  escape. Same mission since AC1. Like come on ubisoft, you can do something better, not recyclate same  again and again.
