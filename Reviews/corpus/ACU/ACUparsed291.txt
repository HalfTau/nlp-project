Boring main character that looks like a brainless Jean Dujardin expy with no charisma and that feels like trying to do parkour with a main battle tank.The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare...or more realistically, this version of Ubisofts lamest and most shameless cash cow that SHOULD have finished at the third episode.This version of Paris feels full yet empty, they could easily have replaced the crowd with wooden sticks with no major change in the atmosphere, if youre a French speaker, this isebola for the ears, the accents are wrong, the diction is all messed up...French people dont speak like that!Recommending this game to anyone is so much bad karma that Id rather tell people to play russian roulette with a shotgun, run with scissors or even share needles.This game was definitely made by a company that either treats their customers like cattle, or just plain hates people.
