15/100 Even after optimised drivers this game still runs horrible and makes combat pretty terrible for parrying or dodging, everything looks fantastic in game but the sheer terrible character control with the new cover system and bad performance kills the game, still possibly a recommended buy but wait a few months until they patch and drop the price, not worth 60, maybe not even 40.
