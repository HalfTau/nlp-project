Fantastic game! Only frustrating thing is that performance is shoddy. But I have confidence that Ubisoft will fix that  hopefully sooner than later. 2014Update 2017. Performance still shoddy and incredibly frustrating. I recently came back to it earlier this week, and began playing again. Ive since uninstalled. Looking forward to, and hoping for a better Assassins Creed game with the next one.
