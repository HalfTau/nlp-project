A lot of new stuff comparing to older games in series, but sadly some little things like whistling while being in bush/haystack or taking dead bodies were removed and I really missed that.If I remember correctly, this game got a lot of hate when it was first released, dont know if they fixed all those mistakes or Im just die hard series fan and cant see them.And lastly, for some reason Arno reminds me of Ezio and its one of the reasons I love this game  D
