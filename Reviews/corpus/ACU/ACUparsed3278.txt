Ill make it short.NOTETaking into account i have played this game after all the patches and i never experienced the massive slowdown most of the players experienced.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD READ AT YOUR OWN RISKGameplayThe free run mode makes it more fluid both for climbing or for going down a building.Combat was ok, they made it more challenging with the red yellow bar, but in my opinion it felt kind of weird, i liked Shadow of Mordor combat style more but it was still an improvement of Black Flag kinda simple sword combat fighting nevertheless Black Flag did have naval combat wich in my opinion being a naval fan was one of the best ones i have ever seen. This game lacked that sort of mini game naval combat on ACBF you had the free run mode and collectables but it all felt kinda streamlined.GraphicsBeatiful, one of the most beatiful landscapes and buildings very detailed to how they are in reality, the gameplay was really fluid too with no hiccups at all after patch 4 at least, didnt play beforeStoryWell written story with a few twists we all like a love story but i liked ACBF more, it had more life in it, this even with all the characters and developments it lacked a bit more in my opinion just a bit more.SupportUbisoft tried really hard and as fast as they could to fix all the problems most of the players were experiencing they even gave a free dlc as an apology this was a nice gesture in my personal opinion and most game companies wouldnt even had bother. Im looking forward to ubisoft next game, i have hopes they will keep improving themselves and keep making good games.
