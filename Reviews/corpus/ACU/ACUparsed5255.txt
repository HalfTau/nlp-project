Im not having any of the technical problems people are complaining about. Then again, my PC meets not only the minimum, but the recommended specs. I dont push it, either I dont expect to run the game at full graphical detail. It looks good, runs fine, and I have no complaints.Regarding the game itself, its Assassins Creed, for nextgen. Other than some UI improvements, Im not noticing anything more than an evolutionary step past the last one. What more can you expect? If you love Assassins Creed games, and you have a powerful PC, go for it. If you just kinda like AC games, wait for a sale. Thatll give you time to upgrade!
