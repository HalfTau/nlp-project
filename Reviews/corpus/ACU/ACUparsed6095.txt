Jumping off a building in mid air getting Stuck , and getting Stuck in the ground cant move , watching a soldier standing on his heels sliding as if he has wheels on his boot heels and hes being pushed on a dolly cart , crazy leg dancing of dead soldiers .   How in the hell did they creat this game and while tey were still doing changes during development stages , did they not even notice the glitches and bad lagging ?  I have a Great computer , high end , lots of ram ,12 to be eact , .......Often it feels like a Frame drop , Noticablly Frame dropping . as if you are watching stop motion animation
