In short, I feel Assassins Creed Unity as a games feel like wasted potental. The graphics are amazing, and the city stunning, but the main story, side stories, and the characters are very boring.What was WrongArnos introduction  and back story felt rushed, and cliche. I felt nothing from it. His father who we only see for 5 seconds is murdered and Bruce Wayn Oh, I mean Ezi  Oh wait,  Arno has a taste for revenge. This could work, but the way it was done, combined with how fast Arno seems to forget about all of it really makes me lose all intrest.The same can go for Elise, her introduction felt less like an introduction and more like the reading of a short bio entry game manuals used to have, this along with the lack of other traits make her feel like shes in the game to be the generic Fem Fatale/Love intrest for Arno, rather then a character in her own right.I will say though that Bellec seemed pretty badass, along with the Assassin in black robes/Thomas guy, but the story as a whole feels spoonfed and entirly lacking, and the empasis on how the Assassins and templars are so similar has been done to death, and farther ruins the story.What I likedThe city is amazing. The level of detail put into it is stunning, and I spend most of my time doing missions mostly to explore. There are many monumants, and the atmosphere is great, but its ashame that mostly nothing intresting happens inside it, especially considering Im a history nerd and a big fan of Bonaparte.Other notesI played this on a higher end PC and the bugs I ran into where rather minimal, I did fall threw a floor, have npcs walk weird and in place, but nothing game breaking, it was rather comical, but this depends less on the game and more your PC.OverallI respect what ubisoft was trying to do, they where trying to reinvent the series and go back to its roots, but the way they did it feels like they entirly wrong. they wanted it to be less linear and more open like the first game, the first game, they wanted to showcase how Assassins spend a ton of time investigating their target and playing spy/detective like they did in the first game, but it seems that here they did it by weakening the central story rather then actually opening it up.Assassins creed opened it up by giving the player sidemissions some required and some not, that pertain to the your main mission, it feels like you are really investigating your target like a true Assassin, but unity has you perform optional missions during a main mission to do this, which feels lazy, rush, and less like an actual assassin.This could of been a real great game if ubisoft was able was able to recapture the core of that made AC 1 so revolutionary and great, but it seems thay have failed doing it here, and I feel very disapponted.Unless it goes on sale for 20 or something, Id recommend avoiding it.
