I find this game is quite lack luster. The start of the game is nice and it Feels new but after a while it feels like they just ed on you beacuse the amount of change is terrible. The only things they changed was the way you parkour and the engine you may say the world is beutiful and it is but it dosent change the fact that the game has barley any quest, I bought the game for the new multiplayer and it allows you to play with your freinds. But they only have like 6 of those. I ran through those like they where nothing beacuse they where. I dont recomend you buy the game if you can just get a torent then just get one Beacuse its just not worth it
