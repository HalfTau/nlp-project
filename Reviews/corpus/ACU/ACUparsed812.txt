Assassins Creed Unity sets during the French Revolution in Paris, tells the story of Arno Dorian and is a direct sequel from Assassins Creed Rogue. The story of Arno and his adoptive sister/lover Elise De la Serre was very touching with the aspect of joined forces between the Assassins and Templars which makes it refreshing. Ive heard that when this game first launched in 2014, there have been constant bugs and glitches which made the game almost unplayable. Fortunately, Ubisoft have fixed most of its problem although there are some minor bugs and a little optimization problem, it is much improved from its launch state.On the contrary to what people say about Arno being a bland, boring character, I thought his journey from an innocent child to a Master Assassin was fairly interesting. The romance between him and Elise shared intimate moments and the atmosphere of Paris makes it very suitable. However, I do believe that Ubisoft could have done a much better job with the overall execution of the game.Pros Stunning Graphics Wonderful Storyline Dead Kings DLC was absolutely worth playingCons Bad optimization, fps drops from time to time Unforunately one of the best characters in the game dies Doesnt exactly explain the history of the Sword of EdenOverall, despite the optimization problem, this game and the main DLC that includes extra storyline content is worth playing. Keep in mind that Unity is a direct sequel from Rogue, so I recommend playing Rogue before this.I give AC Unity a 6.5/10.
