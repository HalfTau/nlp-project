Sequence 7 Memory 3 is bugged and I am enraged at the repetetive foolery of lockpicking and pressing the E Key in a way that wins first but endlessly fails the second time at Sequence 7 Memory 3 not to mention how absurd this process serves in destroying a perfectly good keyboard.This is the issue and Ubisoft needs to fix this glitch and I am not the only one having it.  Nobody should buy this game until they fix of change the fight mechanics of this mission.  It is maddeningly outrageous in addition to the hoard of glitches and bugs within the game!This is not my video but this is the exact issue.You be the judge, is this game worth 89 when you cant even complete the storyline at the very least?
