This review was written as of patch 5.Pros You can finally crouch Fantastic graphics even on lower settings Missions are well designed and offer several ways of completion You get the Dead Kings DLC for free as compensation for launch issues regardless if you got the game at launch Online coop mode runs remarkably smooth and is a nice change of pace from the campaign.Cons Apparently French people have British accents not really a game breaker but should be noted The story is decent but the ending was underwhelming A.I. has perfect shooting accuracy and can shoot through crowds but will only hit you Mouse lag use a controller instead if you want to avoid this The controls can be unresponsive leading to frustrating moments when using stealth Some NPC glitchesNoteI played the game with medium settings at 900p. The game ran at about 4045fps with occasional drops to 30fps. Considering my rig doesnt meet the minimum requirements, I felt the game ran better than expected.My specsIntel Core i54440  3.1GHzGeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB VRAM8GB RAM
