Worst Assassins Creed game yet, every next Assassins Creed game is worse but this... its garbage. Waste of time and nerves. I got it just for story and the game is so bad that I may just ignore thiscompletely. Oh and it hurts your eyes with Saints Row IV type screen effects.. but worse. Im not kidding, I had to ALTF4 to not get epilepsy seizure or some and I am healthy!ProsGraphics But wait, screen ing flashes like crazy, so no, graphics sucks tooConsCombatMechanicsEverything else that comes to mindAVOID THIS
