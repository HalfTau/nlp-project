90 dollars wasted on this game because most things are locked or require third party programs, and you will be facing lots of save game issues, i finished the storyline and somehow my save file went corrupt, i am not going to play the single player again after all that wasted time,As for coop, if you manage to get over the connection issues then you will be playing coop missions only where you cant even communicate with other players and if someone gets into one of the many bugs the game has to offer then your only hope is to exit the mission and replay it again hoping not to get stuck againDont even bother paying 20 dollars for this game, this is my last time i will buy from this company
