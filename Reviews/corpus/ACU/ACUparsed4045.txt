First Assassins Creed game ive ever played, and overall ive had a lot of fun with it.Large, open map and free roamGreat detail in buildings and structuresComplex and interesting storyFun parkour controls that arent difficult to get the hang ofFun muliplayer missions and free roamSomewhat short storyNeed a mid to highend gaming PC to even run this game on low settingsCertain parts of the game can only be unlocked by using apps/other accounts outside the gameNeeds Uplay and Steam to playStory can be somewhat hard to follow/need to play the mission twice to fully understand how the story progressed in that missionLost my save data once, but luckily I was only a few hours in when it happened and i was able to prevent it from happening again by simply disable sync with Uplays cloud storage. Despite what everyone else has said, i have only experienced minor bugs about 23 times that were fixed by simply restarting the mission.As for the framerate issues, I have a midend gaming PC that does not meet the minimum system requirements for this game and before patch 4 i was averaging about 2030 FPS on low settings and lag spikes consistently about every 30 seconds. After patch 4, the game runs MUCH smoother and im getting about 3045 FPS with a full 60 FPS in certain parts of the map.Before patch 4, i probably would have not recommended this game. After patch 4, every problem that i have personally experienced with the game has been resolved and at its core this is a very fun game.System SpecsAMD FX4170Nvidia GTX 7608GB of 1600MHz RAM128GB SSD and 1TB HDD Where Unity is installedWindows 7 64Bit
