So, This game in the way other see are This game is bad or I cant play because this game so lag.But the way I see is its a good game but not very good because this game is just a game that test new engine from Nvidia, So if this game has problem it so common. I like the skill build system,COOP,New Parkour system.This game has many FACTOR that cause this game not work probally such as AI that has more than 200 in that small map, New engine from Nvidia that effect Assassins Creed IV Black Flag too.Assassins Creed Unity has developed since Assassins Creed Brotherhod2010.So, I think that the time between 2010 to 2014. This game has been change developer or engine over and over again.So, the problem can cause to this game.The good thing about this game Good story,Good system,Very ridicurious graphicThe bad thing about this game BugUsually fell out of the map,Less detail in cutscene,Stupid AIAnd finally,I have notice that I can adjust the Graphic to highexcept texture detail that I adjust to Ultra without any FPS drop! !My PCCore i3, 8 GB of RAM, Nvidia Geforce GTX 650 GC
