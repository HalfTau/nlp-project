Assassins Creed Unity is Ubisofts first game in AC franchise designed as nextgen. Set in Revolutionary Paris, France, it follows the story of young Arno. There are parallels with AC II in regards to revenge theme to the plot  both protagonists are primarily fuelled by executing justice on those who wronged them.The city of Paris is the most detailed yet in the franchise, with new verticality and buildings with righ interior to be explored. The parkour system is vastly improved, flows well with the environment and is highly effective. Never before was traversing the obstacles so solid and enjoyable.I got to experience this game almost 2 years after launch, so I cant really say much about bugs and glitches, though I believe the criticism and backlash was mostly valid. However, in its current state its pretty much ironed out and fixed. Yes, there may be some issues with crowdpopins, AI may do some of the dumbest actions from time to time, but hey  nothing gamebreaking. The graphics are simply gorgeous, the lighting is spoton, facial animations one of the best in the industry, so is the voice acting.Gameplay is improved, ability to crouch is finally added, aswell as better cover system. Takedowns are intuitive and fast, brutal. Im not sure that I like the new combat system  it seems rather dull. I preferred the old one  based on counterattacks. It made for much more fun and varied approach on how to deal with your adversaries.Overall, I recommend AC Unity. It manages to do a lot of stuff right, sometimes taking one step back in regards to other things like combat, unlocking basic abilities like throwing money  WTF?!. There is a LOT of quests to be done, most of them rather interesting, story is fine, voiceacting engaging and stealth is on a whole nother level.
