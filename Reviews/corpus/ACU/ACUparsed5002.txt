The Bugs are horrible and the low frams are not fun, but over all with playing the game its fun. Its cool what Ubisoft did witht he new climbing moves, I do enjoy it when my frams are and fine and dont run into a bug, but to me the game is not worht  60 on where it stands at the moment. I do recomend it only for the gameplay without any bugs or low frams.
