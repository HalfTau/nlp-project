The game is at times, beautiful, and the assassination missions are the best the series has had. Paris feels alive and is a joy to run across. However, it feels like they spent so much time building the game world, they forgot to make sure it works to meet the deadline. Its like if a movie spent too much time filming, and they slopped together a poor edit. Buggy mess, and visual glitches detract too much to look past. Unless they fix these issues, Id pass completely.
