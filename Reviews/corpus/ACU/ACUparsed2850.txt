If you are still on the fence about buying this game and you are a fan of previous Assassins Creed games, chances are you will like this one too.The city of Paris is huge and there are plenty of things to do there.You play with your own style in mind, if you prefer a long range weapon like a staff you can use a staff at all times. If you prefer a heavy blunt weapon same applies. The choice is yours.The game runs well now after all of the patches  I am currently using a geforce PALIT 770 and cooperative multiplayer is a blast to play with friends or random people for that matter.Story wise, Arno and Elise are enjoyable and play well off one another. I wont go into spoilers about them.The game itself takes place Straight after Assassins Creed Rogue so if you have that game finish it first then play Unity.
