Dont let those poorly constructed peoples reviews trick you, if you got the recommended rig, the game works just fine, yes, there are some minor flaws, even with the right recommended specs, there are some random minor fps drops every now and then, no biggie, Ubisoft has already made an announcement saying they are working to fix these minor flaws affecting the game right now, so its all matter of waiting, meanwhile, im enjoying my game in Very High settings with random fps drop every now and then. The cutscenes are choppy, they will be fixed as well, overall, the game is playable and enjoyable, just make sure you have a good GTX 780 4GB to play this in ultra.The game crashed on me 2 times in the first hour, but after tweaking my settings, it never crashed again.The reason why im enjoying the game in very high settings is because my GPU is only a GTX 765 2GB, its kind of a bummer i cant get to enjoy its maximum potential but i knew i wouldnt be able to max it out since the moment i bought it, my GPU is under the recommended specs, but even like that, im still enjoying the game with the minor flaws mentioned above but which will be soon fixed. PS. Im getting a steady 4050 fps.Leaving the specs / minor problems behind, the gameplay is just amazing, ive been playing AC ever since 2007 when it was released for ps3, ever since then, ive always bought all AC games i could find, and i gotta tell you mate, gameplay has improved so much in this game, mobility  assassination has never been so natural and practical. Paris is just amazing, the map is huge, the amount of things you can do is just right to keep you entertained, coop mode has never been as fun until i played it in this game, population acts so natural, so realistic. Graphicwise, even though im only playing the game on Very High settings, they are just amazing, i cant say they are nextgen worthy but they are a different thing from the past ACs.In conclusion Buy the game if your have the recommended specs or else youre going to have a bad time, if you almost meet the reqs and youre a true assassin fan, then sacrifice some graphic details and enjoy the game as it should be enjoyed, the minor flaws will be soon gone as Ubisoft made an official announcement saying they are working on all these flaws, even though the release was a bit glitchy, the game has amazing potential.Regards.
