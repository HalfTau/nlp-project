This game has recieved a great deal of negative paper in the time it has been available, but please do not take everything you read on the internet as an absolute fact including this review .I found Unity to be the perfect introduction into the AC franchise. As someone who has avoided the prior versions based purely on the intimidating task of delving into the volumes of AC lore that has developed over the years, I greatly enjoyed this entry and look forward to playing prior versions of the series.Diehard AC fans may have a bit of trouble because the storyline is a bit different from previous editions  Unity is in itself a fun and engaging game that has nothing to appologize for. Desmond is gone. This is a new AC era, and dont let the legions of AC fanboys scare you away from what could be a very enjoyable experience traversing the streets of Paris and taking out enemies in creative and unique ways.I had ZERO problems with bugs, crashes and freezes. The patches that have been released have fixed the VAST majority of those issues and they only occur on a case by case basis now. Dont let people parroting what they read on reddit  but have yet to experience  tell you otherwise.Beautiful scenery, challenging combat and a deep and emmersive story are reason enough for this game to recieve my recommendation.TLDRIf you have avoided this game because of bad reviews, give it a chance to speak for itself. I believe very strongly that you will be pleasantly surprised.
