The game was crashing for me just like for many people, i tried everything but it still didnt work, so i tried one last thing and i updated my driver, i launched the game and it instantly worked.Now to the game, graphics are awesome, i set it to high and it is astonishingGameplay such as combat is very goodI dont see any glitches in the game, if there were glitches it wouldnt really hurt the game from any sideMissions are fun and the story is very well made,I do not regret the money i spent on this and i totally recommend it!
