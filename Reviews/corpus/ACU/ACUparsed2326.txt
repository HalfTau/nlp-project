I dont remember where I heard it, but it captures the game pretty well. In its fixed state.It feels like youre yelling your instructions to your character from a very long distance.Ive never really had this problem with other AC titles, but in this game it feels like you have very little control over your character.Optimization problems have been patched so framerates are playable, at the cost of severely crippled graphics compared to, say, Black Flag.Its a shame, because the story is actually interesting. Not interesting enough to put up with the awful mechanics, though.
