You cannot rate a game ENTIRELY based off of the publishers opening night publication of said game sadly 100 of the negative reviews are based on this! Yes The game is laggy, stuttering and generally low FPS. What did you expect? If you expected it to be perfect, you are expecting to never play the game, because no game is perfect I still glitch out in Skyrim, which has been out for over 3 years!. All the stuttering, lag, low FPS, etc. WILL BE FIXED within the next month, guarenteed.The reason I love this game has been said many many times before Good Story, Awsome fighting actually requires skill, Better parkour experience, LOVE the massive crowds and best of all, I am running a GTX 660 two teirs below the minimum requirement! and have experienced no crashes, no lag and no stuttering after I installed the NVidia Unity Driver.I recommend this game! If you are worried about the launch day issues, then wait a month, I guarentee you will be pleased with it whether you buy it now or wait a month.
