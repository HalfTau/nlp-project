With this much practice youd think the AC games would keep getting better, but they always manage to screw something up. Initial performance issues have been fixed, but a new slew of new game play issues have appeared. Paris looks great, its immersive, theres a little more control over parkour movement, and the historical aspect is interesting. Thats the good stuff. On the bad side combat has become clunky, theyve removed whistling ruining stealth, removed the ability to hide bodies and use human shields, then added gear levels, basic skill unlocks and micro transactions. Shameful.It really feels like theyre all over the place on this one. I knew it was going to be a downhill ride after seeing theyd added two new currencies to the game, and one of them is for real money. You can now buy all your new gear from the menu, gear now has levels, and indicates the power of your character. You can also buy a new currency for real money to hack unlock gear, and gear can be upgraded which you upgrade by paying in a currency that you earn over time, or with real money. Half of the gear can only be attained by playing in coop.On top of that, theyve made combat a lot clunkier. I wouldnt mind this if it were to deter getting in to combat, but at the same time theyve also removed the ability to whistle, and the ability to hide bodies. The only way to get guards to investigate something now is to deliberately get seen then run away, or by using a cherry bomb another consumable, except that guards almost never investigate the spot youre cherry bombing  they just look over and go Hey I wonder whats happening over there! and then go back to standing where they were without even getting close enough to kill from cover.Its still worth playing if you like the AC games, but I feel bad giving money to Ubisoft for this microtransaction crap.
