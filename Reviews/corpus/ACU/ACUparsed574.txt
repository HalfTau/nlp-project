I bought this game mainly for its open world concept in Paris. The graphics are excellent and it indulges you in a near realworld experience of being in France.However, my gripe with this game would be the game movement mechanics. They are really tough to get used to, especially when the character makes the most annoying movements are the wrong timings. Frequently, my character would hang onto a ledge and refuse to jump, and even if it works, there is a time delay of about a second, which affects the gameplay.I didnt experience as many bugs as the players mentioned perhaps because the updates mostly patched them up.
