As of 702pm  EST,  ACU  is SUPPER buggy and the fps problems are very apparent.  Hopefully, Ubisoft will realize that their PC gamers are having a lot of problems and will fix it soon.The game itself tho, is SUPER fun!  loads of custimization. Beautiful world even tho atm i have to play on medium settings due to the fps problems.Sadly, As of this moment, I cant recomend anyone buy this game until the problems are fixed.  Will update when or if the problems are resolved.
