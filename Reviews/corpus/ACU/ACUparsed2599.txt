Im a huge fan of the Assassins Creed series, but this is hands down the worst experience I have ever had from both an Assassins Creed and Ubisoft title. The game has more bugs than I care to mention, frequently crashes, and the multiplayer is a laggy hunk of crap enemies and players teleporting, with no rhyme or reason. Multiplayer objectives are also very poorly structured.Also, why are all the French people speaking with various English accents?
