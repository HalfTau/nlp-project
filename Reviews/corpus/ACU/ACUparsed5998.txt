Every time I play this game, the review I post gets better. It is very smooth at high settings on a single gtx 970, the graphics are beautiful, and if you experience a game crash, that should fix itself once you veritfy the integrity of your local files. Still some minor bugs in the graphical region, as well as people jumping 4 feet in order to clear the base of a lamppost, but mostly, the game is good and I can finally say without hesitation that I would recommend it.P.S You dont need a GTX 680 to run this game. It can run on pretty much any laptop with discrete graphics at a playable not beautifuly smooth  framerate, as long as the settings are reduced. It wont be 1080p, but I got playable framerate at 720p with an AMD 8770m GPU.
