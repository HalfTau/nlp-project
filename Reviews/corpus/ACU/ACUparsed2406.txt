This was 2014 in a nutshell for me. I was so eager to play this game, I preordered it on PC even though I had a  PC. The game ran likebut I didnt care. Despite the glitches and lag, It was pretty fun to play. This game also kinda ruined my life, I spent a lot of money on this game. I paid for a video card that my computer couldnt handle so I had to wait a couple of months to buy the necessary parts to fix my PC. During those times I really missed my PC, I missed playing Unity and at the same time I was blaming it. When I finally fixed my PC, I just played Unity nonstop, my save got wiped and I had to redo everything but It was fine. I finally played it the way I wanted to. I have 200 hours in this game.To sum it all up, This game was great, its very nolstagic to me. The people who say otherwise are probably idiots who havent even played the game are just hopping on the UbiShit bandwagon. And to the people who actually have played the game, they dont get to judge either, they probably only played for 3 hours and didnt even finish the story mode or get to the side activities or even the coop, you dont get to judge, when you reach my level of hours then you get to.Keep this is mind, theres a lot of people who play unity, theres even someone who hasnearly 800 hours on this game
