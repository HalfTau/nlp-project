The game has awesome fights and an interesting plot. I havent felt like Im doing the same things over and over like in some of the previous Assassins Creeds more specifically AC 1 wth Altair. On the down side you can only have one saved game. I had to delete the save file from my computer and make Ubisoft stop saving in their cloud to replay the game. Other than that I have absolutely loved the game.
