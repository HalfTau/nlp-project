A huge step back from AC IV Black Flag, and another victim of highly aggresive marketing hype. Almost nothing new is discovered about Abstergo, the historical tragic love story that takes place during the French Revolution between Arno and Elise is predictable and disappointing. Unexplored layers lead to one dimensional characterization. If youre a hardcore fan, wait until its on sale. Not worth the 60.
