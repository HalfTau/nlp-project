Alright after playing just 30 minutes of this. All I can say is... amazing. The graphics are beautiful aka everyone and paris. I personally find the parkour has improved and so has the combat. I love swooping around and under things and hiding more than ever than the older AC games. Youre an assassin and not a hack and slash brawler.To be honest, this game is graphically intense. Youre gonna need a significantly good rig to play it. For the people that are claiming they have a really good rig and is still having problems. Try uninstalling the game or finding other types of solutions from people. That should make it work. The bugs are over exggerated and storyline really isnt that bad. Arno sounds really witty from the first few minutes of his grown up life.My rig i53570 NOT K versionAsus Strix gtx 970256 GB ADATA SSD1TB WD HDDMSI B75MAP45500 GB WD HDDCorsair 750 Watt power supplyI barely have any problems in the game besides the randomly quick sudden freeze from some scenes.  Highly recommend it if you have possibly a gtx 780 or an r9 290x. EDIT I REPEAT THIS GAME IS NOT MEANT FOR GAMES THAT HAVE MEDIUM TIER GRAPHIC CARDS. Yes that is probably why you cant play it. Ubisoft went overboard and released this game for the beefy gaming rigs as I am able to play it with a literal solid 60 fps and no lag. On ultra. Like, stop disliking this review, just being honest.
