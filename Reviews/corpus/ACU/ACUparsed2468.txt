I have bought this game long time after release expecting technical issues to be solved so I could enjoy a good Assassins Creed game which was a regular feature of this serie. I am very disappointed with the game though, interacting with NPCs is terrible some NPCs talk but do not move their mouth, others doing something but not moving at all for example fortune teller is drawing cards and describing them but in fact she sits on a chair with no cards around at all!! and other NPCs aint even talking when approached returning keys to the priest in Notre Dame mission. When I compare this game to Black Flag or any previous games with almost perfect NPC interactions, this looks like a joke. I also dislike feature of coopmissions and a must to replay each 3 or more times to unlock equipment, I am playing them alone no one ever responded to my call and it is not fun  trust me. While in fight with allyNPC, you cannot even block incoming attacks Arno performs swirl of the weapon while being attack only because attack bar of enemy does not pop up. All in all, I am very disappointed with this game despite being quite tolerant player and loving the AC series...
