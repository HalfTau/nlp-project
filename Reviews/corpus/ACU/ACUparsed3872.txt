after all the t this game puts you through if you push through it it is a good game. they added alot of things and fixed alot of old problems all the while adding in new ones.but the custom assassins and multiplayer make it worth it.i do belive they couldve  done better. way better.but what can i say. 2014 was the year of relased unfinished games.from me.  this game gets a 6.and a half.out of 10.
