My favorite ac out of all!  I played it after launch and even then the game was great, but after all the patches it got, the game is so much better! Yes the combat is quite buggy at times and quite cringy, but its a lot better than previous titles.The graphics are stunning and France is gorgeous.The abbility of customizing your assassin is my favorite mechanic of the game, you can select from dozens of different armor pieces for your head, chest, forearm, waist, legs and also change the colors, and it really gives you a sense of accomplishment after finishing the story and even side missions, earning money is now more important and a lot more rewarding and it really makes you want to finish the game to get the legendary armor pieces and weapons, unlike the other ac games where all you could get was different colors for your armor or some better weapons.Overall this game is awesome and you should totally buy it, if its on sale even better, but full price suits it perfectly well!
