Runs relatively well on my GTX 660ti without vsync enabled, on High and 1080p !! card not even on the min. spec Ubisoft has crafted an amazing game environment, love getting lost in Paris circa 1800s !! Love the new focus on stealth !! Hopefully they can patch the problems some users are reporting real soon, but all is good on my end
