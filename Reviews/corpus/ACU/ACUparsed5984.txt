Alright, well first of all here are my PC specsMSI GT72 Dominator Pro Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i7 4710HQ 2.50GHz 32GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 880M 8 GB GDDR5Im running on a top of the line gaming laptop so Im not running into what seems to be the 99 of problems others are having. Also, Im not a big Assassins Creed fan, I havent played any of the previous games aside from the first Assassins Creed, so Im going into this game completely unbiased and not expecting anything except to be entertained.That being said, Im having a lot of fun with this game so far, the story is interesting and I really enjoy the flow from the cut scenes into the gameplay. It really immerses you into the world, and I love when games focus on story telling done like this.The gameplay is a bit awkward for me at first using the keyboard, Im not familiar with the AC games so it feels a bit clunky. Once I plugged a USB xbox controller in though it immediately felt more fluid. So definitely use a gamepad if you can. Sometimes though, it is a bit frustrating when the character does not climb or jump to where I intended, and sometimes he will get stuck in a corner or on a ledge and wont do what I want him to do, but these kinds of issues will work themselves out once I get more practice with game mechanics.The graphics are amazing, it seamlessly transitions from story cutscenes into gameplay. I run it on ultra settings but keep the anti aliasing down. I do run into minor skips and hops which kind of pull me out the atmosphere of the story, but these are only a minor nuisance.My first impressions on this game are positive. Im going to continue exploring this game and trying out to the different features. For me it was well worth the price and I recommend anyone who has the rig for it to pick this one up, you wont be dissatisfied.
