Was a war z level fail, however with recent updates the game is playable. I also did appreciate the public apology from ubisoft through my email. There are still bugs but still there are bound to be. This game is massive. It mustve taken them a lot of work. Anyway I now enjoy this game, albeit some glitches still occur
