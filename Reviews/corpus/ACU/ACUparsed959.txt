i enjoy it better than 3 and 4 since its much closer to its roots than those two as it focuses again on city gameplay. the other 2 were nice and unique but thats not assassins creed for me. this is great though a bit buggy at times and im not the biggest fan of the changes tot he combat system but thats mostly because i dont understand it entirely
