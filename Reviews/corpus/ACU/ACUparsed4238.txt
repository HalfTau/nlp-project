I only played 9 MINUTES of this game before I gave up on it and decided never to play it again.Why you ask? Because its buggy as hell!The first time my characters legs sank INTO a rocky ground and then he couldnt move or do anything while everyone was fighting around him. The only thing I could move was the camera. I was praying that someone would at least kill him so I can restart the scene but its like he was a ghost, and the enemies all walked passed him or faught around him.I quit the game then I restarted the same scene again, avoiding the same area where the first glitch happened. I thought I was successful in continuing the game until the second glitch occured. MY CHARACTER WAS UNABLE TO OPEN ANY DOORS!Im so disappointed with this game and it breaks my heart to see it come to this shameful result. I have been a fan since the first Assassins Creed release. And I was very excited with this series being in France. But all these bugs and glitches would not even let me advance in the game.ONLY 9 MINUTES OF GAMEPLAY! I feel so robbed ....
