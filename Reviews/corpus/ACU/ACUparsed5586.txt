Just my two cents regarding the framegate.Im actually playing it on day one with a i54330 3Ghz, 16Go Ram and a GTX 780 at 19201280.Everything is maxed out in game for testing purpose, Vsync is driver forced and the game run smoothly even with large crowds.I havent seen any bugs at the moment.Concerning the game itself, the new free move is nice when you get used to it and combats seems to be more difficult than before.I am not disapointed by the new AC and will enjoy playing it.
