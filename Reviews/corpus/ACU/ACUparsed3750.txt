Its a next gen game... of course youre going to need a high end PC to run it.Best combat since AC2. Best open world since AC2 for those that didnt enjoy sailing anyway.Some nice customisation touches.A little dissappointed that my Helix purchases have failed? Lets hope UBISOFT reimburse me at some point!! !Check your spec before installing, but an excellent addition to the franchise. 8/10
