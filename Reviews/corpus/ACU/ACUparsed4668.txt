I think they should add a few thousand more background NPCs and make the game even more unplayable..... Ive played every assassins creed with no problem, wish this one would play. Im pretty bummed that I cant play it. Game play seems cool along with the free running and decending but the overblown backgrounds that no one looks at just makes it unplayable.
