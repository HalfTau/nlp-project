If you have an nvidia card with a driver released after 2015, avoid this game at all costs. Somewhere along the line they broke the shaders and as a result the glitch sequences the missions where you travel forward in time cause eyesearing graphical corruptions. There are fixes, such as downgrading your drivers or ramping up your MSAA, but both make a poorly performing game run worse. Unless you have a beast of a rig that could endure either of those solutions this is game isnt worth picking up on PC, Im afraid.Its a shame really, since a lot of the time this game is absolutely beautiful to look at even 3 years after its disaster of a launch.
