I think the game has come a long way in just the one short week that it has been out. I have an i5 with 16 GB memory and a GTX 760n viedo card. I have no issues any longer playing the game. I really think it is a good addition to the AC world. If you have a computer that meets the min specs then I highly recommend AC Unity.
