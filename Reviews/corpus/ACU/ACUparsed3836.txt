I bought the game in pre order, and I was as dissapointed with all the bugs as the next man.But now, after patch 4, it is finally working, I can say, its the best AC I ever played. And I played them all.Full of new stuff, CO OP and CO OP free roam its a must do. Heist its not that good, can be improved.
