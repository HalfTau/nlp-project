This game is still buggy after 3 years. Im really sad that ubisoft abandoned this game because I really enjoyed unity a lot. In my opinion, it couldve been the best in the series but the story was underwhelming. It wasnt too bad but a lot of important things were unexplored/unexplained. And the ending really disappoints me.But on the positive side, Theres a lot of content coop missions, lots of sidequests and collectibles, and a free expansion dlc and the game looks very beautiful. Thats why I recommend picking up this gameIts one of my favorite AC game.
