I saw this game on sale and I got really excited. I played theout of Black FLag and I thought it was one of the best games I have ever played. This game cant even hold Black Flags jock.It is super laggy. I have a very good gaming rig and no game has ever been skippy, jumpy, and laggy like this one. Clearly they rushed the production of this game in order to release it in November. They need to spend another few months fine tuning this game and updating it. Then I will give it another chance, but for now...I will not be wasting any more of my time playing it.My advice is do not buy this game, at least for the time being.
