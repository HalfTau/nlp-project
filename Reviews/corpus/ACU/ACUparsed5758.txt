First and foremost, you need a BEAST rig to run this game. If you dont have that, pack yourup and go home. Im sorry, Im sorry, its just a fact. Ive got a 780 Ti, 16gb or 1866 RAM, and an i7 4770k and I barely get a steady 50fps. I do run the game on 1440p though.That being said, this is an excellent ing game. I absolutely love it. Ive hardly completed any of the campaign because there is just so much stuff to do. I strongly recommend this game to anybody with a beast rig who like assassins creed games, I was hoping itd be a bit more like Black Flag, but its not, and thats okay, Things have changed, but its still an EXCELLENT game. Hell yes I recommend it if youve got the specs 9/10. Will play again, and buy season pass.
