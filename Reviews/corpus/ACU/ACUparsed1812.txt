The current state of the game is pretty much playable Ive encountered bugs and glitches but not gamebreaking so I wont be talking about that. This is pretty much a good game not excellent. It has mediocre writing and confusing storyline which I dont think most people will care about. I got this game with pretty sweet deal so get it on sale and you wont be disappointed. So............ AC Unity is a game for you if you......... Hardcore AC fans You can tolerate boring missions Youre okay with mediocre storyline You love stunning visuals You hate Black Flags naval combat You like France/Paris You like Paris filled with Englishaccent speaking peopleI played every AC games except Syndicate which Im playing and Rogue. Id say this is not the worst AC Ive played but also not the best. This has a potential to be an amazing game bit it was let down by the writing and a lazy mission design.  7.5/10
