The number of noticeable bugs still in this game is appalling, but I honestly think that people got so caught up in the game being broken they missed that underneath that, Assassins Creed Unity is a pretty great game, and it still holds up visually for the most part. Im not sure if Id want every AC game to have imitation Dark Souls combat, but it works well here and engaged me more than Ive really gotten from combat in other Assassins Creed games even Syndicate, whose combat is smooth and flashy but shallow. They definitely could have cut down on the random Paris Stories missions that are all incredibly basic time wasters and its annoying how the game blocks upgrading your lockpick behind story progress, but I still quite like Assassins Creed Unity. The spectacle of it is worth the price of admission.
