6/23/15  I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale so I missed the horrible launch this game had. As of now its enjoyable, no crashes, decent frame rate on a GTX760. As for the gameplay its on par with AC II which I feel is the best in the series. Customization equipment with stats help make the game feels more personal. The set piece  of Paris is what really sold me on the game. Its beautiful, huge, and I just it kept going all the way up to the hill side north to the windmills of Montmartre. Story is soso, Ive pretty much given up on an original Templar/Assassins story line and the over arching story has now just become silly.So Id say pick this game up. Its worth it if you have a 760 or above. If I could nit pick something it would be the fighting seems clunky. They could really take a page from the Akrham series.
