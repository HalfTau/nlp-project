Im in the middle of the single player campaign. I did some side missions. Still have to play the DLC and never played coop.My list of Pros and Cons so farPros Upgraded parkour system. Improved stealth system with ability to crouch. Optional objetives now called Challenges are much more simple and less infuriating than in previous AC. Finally optimized and polished. Im playing at 60FPS 55 in large crouds with a GTX780 not ti and an i73770 with 8GB of RAM Im using FXAA. With other AA modes it drops to 30 FPS. The graphics, especially the attention to detail in the city and interiors. Its awesome. Character faces are very expresive. Ability to play coop mission alone. Voice acting is great. The city feels alive. It has a great atmosphere. Less tail missions. A lot of content and side missions. Ubi finally listened to fans and all chests are now available. I love the 3D map. Its much easier to find collectables this way.Cons Althought much more polished, there are still some graphic glitches here and there. Many NPC in awkward situations, like doing gestures in front of a wall. Once you are upgraded, it can become too easy. Just drop a smoke bomb and kill everyone. Not innovative at all. No posts to liberate. No whistling when in cover. I used that feature a lot in Black Flag. I miss it. Microtransactions although used just to save time, I dont like the introduction of IAP in a game that cost 60.Neutral No modern times missions. I personally liked the Abstergo offices missions in Black Flag, though. I dont like this trend of Ubisoft to merge single player and multiplayer. At least you can 100 the game playing solo unlike Watch dogs. Skills. In a way, it helps the feeling of progression but sometimes it can be a chore when you cant do basic AC stuff because you dont have the skill yet.
