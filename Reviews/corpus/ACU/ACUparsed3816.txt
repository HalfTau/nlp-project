I wanna like this game, I really do. I was a big fan of Assassins Creed Black Flag. Though I got it on the PS3 and there was no possible way I could afford PS4 and ACU, when I could barely afford ACU. So I got this game on steam and one of my biggest mistakes of buying something on steam.Its got too many glitches and it crashes a lot and its way too laggy, though some of that is because of my computer. But thats besides the point. My computer is really great, it works really well with other games. There is also the lighting problems that drives me insane and makes my computer freak out. Though the way the characters hair freaks out is pretty humorous its also annoying. One of the major glitches I find, is that my character gets stuck and cannot move at all. I cant do anything, and I have to restart and its SO annoying.In conclusion I want to like this game but I dont. I dont like it but I dont hate it. I have to say that I do not recommend this game. If they release a bunch of patches, lower the purchuse price, and steam gives a refund to all the people who have bought this game which whill most likely NOT happen, then I will edit this review to a positive comment looking for all the good to say about this game, but I did not say I will stop playing this game. I will continue to play this game and in the mean time look through good things about this game.PS That small miniature Notre Dame looking building BETTER not be Notre Dame.
