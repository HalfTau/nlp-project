I cant play the game because of all the graphics issues. They need to be fixed ASAP. At this time I would not recommend buying this game.Keeping in mind that I do have the graphics issues, I cant judge the rest of the game because of extreme lag and just recently my character falling into nothingness when he was standing on solid ground the moment before.And yes, all my settings were on low.
