Disclaimer I dont have the greatest PC, but I was able to run AC Rogue on high with no problem if that really says anything about my machine.My thoughts I have never been so disappointed in a purchase I have made.  As I said, I was able to run AC Rogue not a game known for its graphcis on high with no problem.  So, I thought playing on low for this game would be just fine. WRONG.  After changing the in game graphics to the lowest of the low, I still couldnt play without wanting to puke.  The first characters hair and clothes were flying everywhere, the main menu would flash the normal colors before going to white.  I searched for graphical fixes for hours, only to get a tiny bit better.  I was able to play for maybe 10 more minutes before my game crashed an wouldnt start again.Needless to say, Im done trying to fix the game.  Ive been a fan of the series since Brotherhood, so Im really disappointed.
