I paid 59.99 to look at my desktop wallpaper couldnt even launch the game. Might as well have done it for free. The amount of bugs for a AAA title release is absolutely unacceptable. This is a new low for Ubisoft, and they have a lost a customer who has followed them from the first Assassins Creed games. Such a  pity that increasing their bottom line is more important to them the people who spend their hardearned money to play their game.EDIT Im at the latest update, and I STILL cant play the game. After reading all the other eviews, not even gonna bother asking for a refund, probably never going to preorder another AC ever again.
