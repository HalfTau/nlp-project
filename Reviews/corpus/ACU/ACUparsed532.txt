The recreation of Revolutionary Paris was phenominal. Admiring the attention to every minute put into every nook and crevice of Notre Dame or the Louvre overshadowed the actual gameplay, which felt clunky and unweildy at times. Unitys flaws are well documented, but unlike Syndicate, the synopsis felt more in sync with the turmoil of the period, as opposed to an excuse for a sightseeing tour. Yay.
