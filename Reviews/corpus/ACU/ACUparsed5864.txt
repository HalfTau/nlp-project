I think this game is fun. Some glitches...so what, what game doesnt have glitches. I have not found a game breaking one yet. I have not had one crash and Coop is a blast with my son...not sure what everyones complaining about.I like the animations, parkour can be challenging but the nice additions of choosing up or down is good,  and the new fighting is challenging. I like the fact that a person cant just counter and kill  takes more timing, very hard to just run and gun and survive a 5v1 fight. I am enjoying the story and the facial expressions are great on the characters.Overall, I enjoy it. Not the best game Ive ever played but Id say 8/10 so far.
