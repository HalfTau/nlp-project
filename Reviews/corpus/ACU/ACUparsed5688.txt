PERFORMANCE review, not a gameplay review. I cant appreciate the new features because of the overwhelming issues with performance on high end cards.HORRIBLE! Do not buy this game! Constantly getting fps drops and stuttering. Ive had every single problem listed on here. Falling through the world and having to restart everything because it couldnt synch with uplay properly was where i was done with this game! !My SpecsGTX 770 Overclocked16gigs of rami7 4770K OC 4.3ghzWhen i ran at the recommended settings I couldnt even move ingame. I had to put everything on the lowest possible settings just to get it playable, but even then I still stutter randomnly. Not optimized at all for PC. I would say a bad port but it only gets 20fps on the new consoles as well!! Garbage effort from ubisoft
