Assassins Creed Unity is like someone trying to shove a hidden blade into a rock.Theyve discarded too much of older series.I have no idea how the story is proceeding which is different from previous seris nor do I know how the control is working.You cannot use hidden blade to fight. Its only for assassination.You cannot pierece someone with your sword while running.You cannot quick change your weapons. You have to go throughbreaking experience of pressing ESC and Character Customization. And whats with all these Skills? Do you honestly believe someone can become an assassin without knowing how to break your fall by forward rolling? The game is slugish and camera angle is all too weird. Unless you are a big fan of Assassins Creed like me and just wants to know what the story is like, dont buy this. If you are the kind of person who never played Assassins Creed, dont start with Unity. Start from the very first.
