Since i got a new graphics card, i was able to play this game with no lag at all. The story is OK, the combat is difficult for once and I just LOVE the idea of coop missions, too bad no one is playing this game to play with. The graphics are fairly good, and the stealth mechanics are improved. But on the darker side of this game, there is major animation and ragdoll glitches, and the PC requirments for this game are ridiculus. I rate it a 8/10     I recommend buying this if you have the RECOMMENDED PC requirments at least.My PC setupIntel i5 3350pMSI GTX 970 4GB COWindows 8
