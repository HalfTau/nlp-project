UbiSoft has betrayed its user base and turned their backs on its community just to make an extra dollar. This game should of never of been released in the state that it is in. It has turned my most beloved IP  and my faith in its company from one of Love to complete disdain. The worse part is I convinced 3 others to buy this game with me and now we can not get a refund. The amount of bugs and performance issues from just the first 1.5 hours of play are enough to make me turn it off and never want to pick it up again. I will no longer be purchasing UbiSoft games from here on out.
