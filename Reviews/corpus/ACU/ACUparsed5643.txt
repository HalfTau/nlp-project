EDIT 1 So now that the patch is out. the framerate drops during cutscenes have subsided. I havent seen any more citizens on rooftops. As for the low framerate, thats still there. For those who are absolute die hard fans, Id say go for it. Its still enjoyable despite the bugs. Otherwise, wait on this one until they release a few more patches hopefully.Are there problems currently? Yes. For example the framerate drops a ridiculous amount during cutscenes sometimes. I havent had any crashes yet though. Is it a bad game? No, I think its actually pretty fun once you get past the framerate issues which honestly arent that bad. Im getting a solid 40  50 frames on high settings on borderless window mode. As for a recommendation, I would say yes, it is quite fun and the story has been good so far but if things like occasional framerate drops and some bugs like citizens on roof tops bothers you, then Id say wait until they patch it.
