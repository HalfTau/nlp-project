If you are a fan of the previous AC games ESPECIALLY Black Flag please do not play this game. The story, the gameplay, the skills the mechanics ALL SUCK, they halfthis game, took something that wasnt broke story and idea wise and ruined it, you cant pick up weapons, fight with your fists, carry more than 1gun and alot more they took out. The story is pathetic and predictable. The cover system is a complete joke and this game is just all around bad. I am ashamed I actually payed for this. Please do yourself a favor and do not give Ubisoft money for this crap. I beat the entire game about 12 hours and STRUGGLED through, trying to find motivation to finish it is very difficult. such crap, many money waste. wow
