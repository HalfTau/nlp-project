Gave it a negative review on account of having game breaking bugs still lingering years after its release. Decided to change my review because its actually quite an enjoyable game and its got a ton of content, mind a heavy lack of RPG elements. The bugs do have solutions in the end, and I only encountered one that messed up things. It only happened once though.So, the good Astonishing environments. The game hasnt aged a bit in this regard. And actually, in any regard. Charismatic protagonist. Havent seen one since Ezio. Lots of customizing options for the character. Lots of content, more diverse and better built than in previous franchise installments. Interesting enough story. More personal, therefore more immersive. It was refreshing seeing the protagonist not giving much of a crap about the assassins vs templars mumbojumbo, being passed by an ancient artifact on the fly and not knowing or caring much what a sage was. Also, there are very little present day interruptions. Always found them annoying. Great dlc. Its atmosphere is even more immersive that the main games, and its also got a lot of content.The not so good Heavy lack of RPG elements. As in cutscenes that wouldve brought us much closer to the protagonist and wouldve made the experience much more immersive. The story is better than in the previous latest installments, but you end up not caring much about it. Its still there just to justify the sandbox. Movement bugs. While the parkour is more realistic and spectacular, the characters response to commands its awkward and he gets stuck in many places. Not really a fan of the new combat system. Its still good enough though. Still spectacular.The really bad The corrupt save bug is still there.
