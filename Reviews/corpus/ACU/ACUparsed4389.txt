This game is one of the biggest disappoints of the year. After hearing about this game I had only the highest expectations from Ubisoft. When I loaded it up  I was met with one of the most unfinished games I have ever had the chore of experiencing. I run a rig that should be able to demolish ever single polygon the gaming industry can throw at it, but even I had a hard time keeping at the very least 2030 fps ON MEDIUM. The popin is just ludacris and something youd expect from a independent alpha. The combat system is broken to the point where guards standing only a few feet above you WILL NOT hear a GUNSHOT. I am so disappointed in this game, and would not recommend this game to anyone. DO NOT BUY THIS until ubisoft gets theirtogether. It is a shame that Ubisoft has allowed such a great series to go down in the . Ubisoft fix this lemon of a game. What a crying shame.
