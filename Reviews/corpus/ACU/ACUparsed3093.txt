Even with 8gb high speed ram, Overclocked quad core w/ ATI twin frozer iii series AND patch 5 it is still very buggy. Definitely not worth the price tag. Pick it up for 20 or less. Uplay is still a terrible platform. Voice chat in coop is either nonexistent or insanely quiet. Lagging and stuttering is still heavy in coop also. Single player on Low gfx seems to be the optimal setting for this game. Bad ubisoft.Whilst running around, doing missions and killing criminals it becomes evident the game really wants you to use microtransactions to purchase equipment by highlighting, specifically, the currency which is slow to gain but easy to buy and it upgrades your gear to tier 2.The most frustrating element to the game are time chasedowns, but not because of the designed and perceived difficulty but because the one button does all mechanic combined with the optimisation issues  you glitch and dance around and do complete uturns when you were just Blining for a door in front of you.
