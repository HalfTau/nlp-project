Guys, this is how we should do it...wait for 12 weeks for patches hopefully..then do reviews instead of countless complain reviews about the performance. We have enough of those already, and any more isnt going to help.Terrible performance btw...EDIT After tweaking with the graphic settings, i managed to run the game at 3040fps on high settings at 900p...playable but not what i wanted If you ignore the  optimization which will be fixed hopefully  and some minor bugs, the game is really fun and after trying the coop missions with some random people, I think its safe to say that this is a great game, only to be brought down by framerate issues and bugs. Overall i would recommend it after some patches.EDIT Have no problems after patch 4 and am enjoying this fkin game to the fullest DFURTHER EDIT Upgrade to windows 10 brought rapid crashes
