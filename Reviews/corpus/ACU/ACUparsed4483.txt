DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.If youre one of the unforunate people, like me, who bought this game sight unseen... Im sorry. We must suffer together. Everyone else? Skip it. Do not buy it. Dont wait for it to go on sale. Dont pirate it. Dont play it. Ubisoft is incapable of learning and this game isnt broken, its shattered.First, constantly corrupted saves. This has happened to me half a dozen times already. With a bit of work I could bring it back but on two occasions, once early on and just now when I was past sequence 7, I lost all progress. If you go into your Uplay saves you can rename the .old file and sometimes that will do it. If youre lucky.Second, the game itself is buggy and glitchy. Be it people acting weird, broken textures, broken AI, or the constant and pervasive crashes... This thing has locked up my entire system several times. Its not a driver issue, no other game does this and Im fully up to date.Third, performance. Ive got a GTX 980, an Core i7 4790K and 16 GB of RAM all running on a 1 TB SSD. Im so far over their system specs that I should be able to run laps around a base 60 FPS. Too bad I constantly dip well below 40 FPS...Dont buy this game. Buy just about anything else. You know, something with a good story.
