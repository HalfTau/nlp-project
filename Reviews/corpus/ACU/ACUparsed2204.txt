I promised myself I wasnt going to buy this because of all the problems and all the milking. I was sick of assassins creed games every year and I didnt think ubisoft deserved my money. after 2 years without a new AC and after upgrading my gpu I bought it for cheaper and well, I love it. the city feels like Acre from AC1 and when you wear the Altair costume which, btw, can be a  to get, its amazing and it has similarities to AC2. I enjoyed the story until about sequence 7 and after that I got lost so Im not going to comment on it. The paris stories and murder mysteries are pretty unique  instead of just the typical kill this man side missions from previous ACs. The free DLC so far Im enjoying as well. If youre unsure whether or not you should buy this, ask your friends who own the game to install it and test it in your pc or whatever. if it runs well, buy it. looks a lot better than syndicate which is just a brawler game. this is the realest AC game since revelations ac3 was just pure crap and ac4 even though its much better than this game, you were a pirate.
