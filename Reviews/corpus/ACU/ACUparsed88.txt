Game is fixed and playable, some glitches and bugs may still occur, but the game is stable and well optimized, also works in 219. Paris during the French Revolution is the best historical setting in the series so far and the game is a major improvement over previous installments in almost every aspect of the game. There are few things worth nothing though youll waste a lot of time trying to finish 100 synch too many collectibles, and snipers will get you annoyed. Also, Dead Kings is the best DLC so far, different city smaller in size, new story and new stuff makes it worth playing, but it should also be noted not to start it before you finish the story for whatever reason, its possible..., because its the continuation of Arnos story.TLDR it works and it delivers.
