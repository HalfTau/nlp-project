First off Ive lost my saved game in this game at 1st I got really mad a place a bad review saying bad words. So my bad review about this game is about the bugs, Ive lost my saved game sequence 7 with a tones of side quest done and Coop missions etc all gone and I cant retrieve it. Secondly the game is full of bugs sometimes some pedestrian are walking in mid air lol. Game has a lot of frame skip if you place yourself in front of a wall with 57fps and do a 360 degre back to the wall the fps wont be the same ... Anyway if Ubi had taken the time to correct all of this with their game testers insted of release the game at 70 and making US the buyers doing the job of a game tester telling them all the problems it should of been less expensive.
