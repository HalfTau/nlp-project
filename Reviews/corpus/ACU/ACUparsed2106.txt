The game is a pretty one, it looks good yes. However, in comparison to the other assassin creeds they have went the wrong way. Combat is awful now, there are no fun counters to attacks. Instead you get locked in drawn out parrying combat with groups of guards and thugs, in my opinion taking away the fun of it all. Skills you have to unlock?off I want to play a bloody assassin. The game is just not on par with the others.
