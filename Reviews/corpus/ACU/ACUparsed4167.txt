All this negative reviews from publishers and gamers alike are totally out of proportion.  I admit i never saw any adds or got mislead by anything.  But this is my favorite assasins creed game.  Its beutiful and hits all the same points that many games before it hit.  Its great!  Im a little frustrated by the characters timing like perching on a curb in the middle of a getaway or parrying recovery.  Batman always got that better.  Regardless its an awesome game that had the exact same amount of bugs skyrim and far cry 4 had on there release.  What is the deal.I think what screwed them is having this AAA work of art accomplished by thousands of masters who studied a historical france taking pics of church walls and stuff to get it perfect, mixed with some dumb money type in the company decided to tag on a freemium model on top.  Its so easy to see some ing guy with a marketing degree and knows nothing of games and gamers said lets tap on like a super sword that costs 20.  Which with this caliber of game is super tacky.  Dammit people yall complain way to much.
