The game is fine, the only problem is that its virtually UNPLAYABLE. The framerate sucks, there are bugs around every corner, its an unstable mess. People, dont pay your money yet. Wait until the game is patched because all I have is a 60 piece of junk. Oh Ubisoft, this game couldve been so good if it wasnt done so poorly. Not gonna play this until a patch is released so Ill be waiting TT
