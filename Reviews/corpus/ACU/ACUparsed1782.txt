Didnt buy this at launch, so cant really attest to the problems it might have had. As for now, Assassins Creed Unity runs, looks and feels awesome. The movement is much smoother than in the previous titles, the combat has been reworked and the graphics are just breathtakingly beautiful. Performance seems solid aswell, 60fps maxed out  1080p easily, only cutscenes have some fps issues.
