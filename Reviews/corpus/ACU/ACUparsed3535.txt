The game itself may have glitches that occur occasionally. But that does not mean its a bad game. Remember that ubisoft removed and rewrote all the code for fighting and parkour, plus added in the controlled descent. The game is excellent and loads of fun to play. The new fighting brings a new challenge to Assassins creed than in past games.
