The game itself isnt that bad, but in the end it comes down the substandard optimisation and the overall bug ridden Paris that the game is based in. The Gameplay is decent animations are smooth and the amount of NPCs is great but it seems as if its either the lighting or the large clusters of NPCs that are causing severe frame rate drops as low as 1520FPS in most cases. Even when running at low settings literally scraping the bottom of the barrel are there a boost in frame rate. So in the end it comes down to the technical problems with the game not the game itself. If we could get this without the severe lack of optimisation it would be a great game
