This is just unacceptable. Game is stuttering constantly, I walk through walls and ground, clothes are going crazy during every cutscene, combat is impossible with all these FPS drops.Game has microtransactions !!! and not one, but two services to log into  app and Initiates.It was advertsied on store page that the game will have all the languages  but no. For me French and Russian are the only accesible languages, and subtitles and interface can be in Russian ONLY. When I bought the game, there was no plaque about game only available in russian. ALL languages were promised to be accesible.This is the last straw. This is trully a failed release. Game is near unplayable.This should cost Ubi their money and reputation.
