bought ilst summer after i finished AC rogue, started playing it couple of weeks ago. well after coming from AC3, black flag and rougewhich just seems to be an expansion of black flag, initially i was put down, i realy liked black flag alot, i wanted the same mechanics to pass over in the new game, anyway instead of doing the main story missions i started doing the side quests and after a week i finaaly felt comfortable, one more thing i would like to add ther there is no option to start a new game after you started the game, which was a let down.Buy it if available on discount atleast 50
