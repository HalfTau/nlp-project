So this game has beautiful graphics, and a massive customization mechanism.Thats pretty much all the good stuff.Theres crashes, game breaking bugs, and texture failures here and there. I know some people run the game fine with the required rig, but the majority of the people some with more powerful rigs cant even have the game to load.Until the game patches once again, I classify this game as unplayable. I tried to tolerate everything, for I have stayed up the whole night before the day of launch because of the hype.And I get this. UBISOFT WHAT HAPPENED.
