Ok, I played and finished this game.  Overall I LOVE IT!!!  however I have 3ghz i7, gtx980, 18 gig ram.Wonderful game, super great!  Gameplay is awesome, although with patches it seems less awesome.  I had gtx680 for a bit with this game and it ran great!  with GTX980 I run at full max max max at 1080p.  smooth and fun.Game is great, story wise, I did not relate to Arno, did better with AC3 and AC4 as far as emotional relating to characters. Just saying, but game is great despite the lack of emotional envolvement.Great game, stop blurring it down Ubisoft!  Some of us have great systems!  let us enjoy, make option to dull it down for those who wont get ubersystem!  but let those of us that do enjoy!GREAT GAME. fully recommend
