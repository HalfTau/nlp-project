Probably the most visually stunning game ever made. It is really breathtaking just to walk down some streets in this game. 100 god tier atmosphere. Mechanically it got a little slower and simpler from Black Flag, but on the plus side, you can customize yourself to a much greater degree in this game and the coop is fun. Turn the HUD completely off and the graphical settings at the highest your computer can support and the game is still one hell of an experience.
