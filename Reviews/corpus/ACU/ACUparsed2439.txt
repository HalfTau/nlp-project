This is a great game, no doubt about it. Tremendous details made this an AAA game, Has a few cons, but please, this is one of the best in the series. Never they looked so beautiful, more so if you get some sweetfx presets I do recommend that cause the bluish ambient, and the parkour thing is great when it works maybe to harsh on that from the reviewers in fact for me the it only has a con when u try do enter a window from a balconyThere are no glitches know, since 1.5 version, and the Free DLC sets plenty more hours of play, different tone, same pleasure, loved it.I bought it right after the first major update and the DLC launch, and know in a second play thru, with a better rig im really loving it. Hard to play multiplayer, but u can do most of the mission solo with ease.PM me if u want same help with SFX.
