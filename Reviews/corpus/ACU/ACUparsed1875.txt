After 50 hours of game i really think this game is a good one, the beautifull of the city is hilarious even without the max settings, the ambientation is spectacular, all the people in the streets make the game an inmersive experience, i know this Assassins Creed is full bugged, but the patches really helped, and now is playable if you can carry some fps drops, but if you know what to touch you can really play with 4560 fps. The secondary missions are really good, better than the other games of the saga, the nostradamus enigmas mission are really funny to play, some are hard to complete, but this is on of the reasons because i like the games, the murder mysteries are insane, is a really good idea and i want to see this in the next Egypt game DThe history is okay for an Assassins game XD. There is no present history .And the last one thing i want to say is for the people that hate it for the performance and all the bugs should let him another chance and play more time . I really want to see the 2017 game, i think they will make something cool with Egypt and i want more historyyyyyy!!
