Although this game isnt the best AC game. It does have the best gameplay mechanics. I love the crouching ability and the disguise ability. they add a different way to approach a stealth mission. The story was pretty  tbh. but the co op missions were the This game also introduced a new combat system, which i hated i prefer the  ac3 to rogue combat systems there is also syndicate with its  combat. So, if you combine unitys gameplay and co op missions with syndicates story and carriages and classic ac combat into a game, that game would be great.
