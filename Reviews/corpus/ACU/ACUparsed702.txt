I kinda like this game, the story is OK, but Im not following it like the older AC games. The main character Arno, I like him but hes ato people sometimes. The game still experiences tons of glitches and I mean a lot but the game is still playable. The coop is pretty fun and I like the movements and the city. In this game you get to change your outfits, and I love when games do that. You can customise your outfit in tons of different ways or just select a full outfit. Ezios outfit is da best.
