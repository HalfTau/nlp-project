The reason I give this game a recomendation is because of the great gameplay.  A lot of gamers have big issues with Ubisoft in general, which shapes their opinions about their games.  There are, no doubt some issues with framerate and bugs.  These can be fixed what can not be fixed is flawed gameplay and horrible game mechanics.  I very much enjoy some of the new combat and free running the storty is engaging and flows nicely.  Ubisoft is an entertainment company, believe it or not, they do not benefit from releasing games with problems.  I am confident that the framerate issues and crashes will be fixed in due time.  Until then, keep watching the forums and reviews.
