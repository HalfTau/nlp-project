Buggy gameplay, bad story plot, many technical issues, lots of stuttering on 1080p on highend hardware and the updates which take several months to release fix nothing.At least it doesnt crash for me, but still. Horrible!I honestly thought this was going to be as good as AC2, but Ive never been so wrong in my life.
