Dispite all the hype and everyone wanting to play the PC Unity because they didnt own a NextGen Console to play it normally I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT GETTTING THE PC VERSION!  THERE IS QUITE THE PROBLEM WITH PC LAUNCHES AND UNITY HAS THE WORST OF IT. Youre better off getting that extra money to buy an Xbox One/Ps4 and getting Unity for those consoles than PC Unitys state as it is. WAIT for some update for the PC version until trying to getting it, because its a sht storm right now to even playMost are based on my experiences while the rest is other peoples experiences1. Bad, uneven frame rate2. Texture Glitches3. Hair/cloth Phyics all over the damn place4. Menu Lag5. Falling into the ground/glitching into walls and floors6. NPCs spawning out of the air/just randomly spawning/despawning7. CrashingAgain, youre better off just getting the Xbox One/Ps4 version.
