I want to give it a great review, but I cant.ACU has great graphics and A MASSIVE Potential, but for now this is a game that will just annoy and frustrate its owners. The FPS is just awful for me, but I run it on a i53317U core, Windows 8.1, I really want to hope that that is the problem but I just cant do that either. I mean come on, isnt it rule 1 not to ship a broken game? Once Ubisoft gets some type of patch to address the bugs and FPS, then I can write a review that gives ACU a chance at Game of the Year even, but for now just save your time and money, who knows maybe theyll cut the price during the holidays.Sincerly, a disapointed gamer...UpdatedWell after months of sitting in my library, I finally was able to play this installment to the series. Ive got to say, it actually wasnt that bad. Take in mind that yes, you do need next gen. graphics, BUT I was able to play it on a EVGA GTX 750 Ti, paired with a pretty crummy A6 5400k. Now this game only gave 1225 FPS, but hey it was actually fun when you finally get to play it. One thing I will complain about is the lack of a weapon wheel, I mean seriously? The hidden blade was the SIGNATURE of Assassins Creed, but I never really got to use it. Further, some of the infiltrate, and assassinate missions do get redundent. Also why did the gear COST so much, and yet story quest gave so LITTLE? However, this story does an alright job, but didnt have much to do with the French Revolution. So while it may be poorely optimized for some, it turned out to be a decent and atleast intertaining Assassins game. Dont worry if you want puzzle solving, the Dead Kings DLC, which was made free for all, gives you that, and is a GREAT place to earn some much needed franks. BUT in total, I wouldnt interely recomend this, its kinda just meh, once you can actually play.
