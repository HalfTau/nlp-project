Running with i7 4970k 4.0Ghz, EVGA GTX 970 SC 4GB, 16GB Vengence RAM playing off an SSD. game runs perfectly fine with no complaints. would maintain 60 FPS Easy on high, 50 on ultra. Brought the game see what all the fuss is about. There was none. Recommended game runs fine dont know what others are talking about. Maybe have a PC upgrade before trying to run this game on max with  laptops or pc.
