a solid 9 out of 10a must buy worth the moneythis game is one of the best assassins creed games ive ever played it has coop for heisting and assassination missions all outfit and armor pieces are customizable and paintable many weapons to choose from all of which can be modified for the way you actually play plus extra outfits that you can wear over you actual armor that doesnt remove stats only downsides are some of the bugs but those are almost all gone because of the patches thats why it doesnt make a 10buy it
