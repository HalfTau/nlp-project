This is a great game. The customization options are over the top amazing and well done the story is good has intresting characters but it is a very short I finished the game in 6 hours wich is very short for an assassins creed game. People are always saying its a bad game but its not I do think its worse than ac4, ac2, and acbrotherhood but thats it only three games out of the eight they have in the series. The game performance can be a little laggy some times but not that much and the only reason why a lot people complain about this game being slow is because there pc has performance issues with the game and after patch 5 everything has been great. The thing is money is really easy to get in this game because of the heists. I definitely recommend this game to anyone. I give this game a rating 8.3/10 only because the game is a little laggy and no one plays on coop missions  Single Player is very short and money is to easy to get but it is a good thing at the same time.
