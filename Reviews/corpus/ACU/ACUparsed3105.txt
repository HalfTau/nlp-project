I loved the Assassin Creed series. This guy is the uttermost junk. I think i smashed at least a dozen keyboards against the wall and my kid has become the most wellversed cursing machine known to man just by watching me attempt to play. The parlour is good, according to some reviewers. Well, it is junk I say! It is utter demoralizing to run up the windows instead of through. Sure I might need practice, but if you are just testing the mechanic and standing right in the middle and trying to go through, and you still cant. Well I say take your game and shove it so far up to where the sun never shines that you get an acid reflux from too much unity!I played several hours to see if I could get past it. But nope, Im done.
