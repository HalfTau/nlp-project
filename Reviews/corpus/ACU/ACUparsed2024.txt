Played AC 1 and 2 and am quite disappointed with how npc pathways, control input/response and texture renderings have NOT evolved even the slithest from previous games. Feels half made in gameplay as combat, interactions and movement can be more optimized. Tried changing antianializing and am now stuck with a windshieldeffect scrolling across my screen, VERY BAD graphics optimization. Storytelling is the only good thing aswell as face expressions.I am sad to say that I will not, desipte my huge interest in this perticular AC series, continue and finish this game.UBISOFT, stop ruining games.
