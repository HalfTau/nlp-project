WARNING Performance heavy. probably due to the sheer amount of NPCs in one spot, which is Massively a lot more compared to prev games like AC3. ive already ramped the performance low and still get worse performance than playing DOOM, which is known to be graphicintensive too...also, read the reviews for the DLCs before you buy them, to avoid unnecessary rage. one pack is a jumpstarting kit with mediumlevel stuff better than stock, worse than endgame gear, the other basically the Preorder bonus pack made available to purchase
