This game is amazing from what I have played I thoroughly enjoy it. Some poeple are saying the graphics are crap. No they are not, the colors and crispness of the graphics are superb. They are 10 times better then Watch Dogs graphics. There are still bugs in the game, but what game on the first day of release does not have bugs? I have dropped frames but it was only here and there though that was before I turned off antialiasing, since then I have not dropped frames at all. So far the story is great, whole lot better the AC 3s slow and boring story. So all in all it is a great game, I cannot force you what to spend your money on but this is definitely worth it.
