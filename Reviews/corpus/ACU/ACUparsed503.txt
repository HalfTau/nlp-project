As a fan of all AC games up to Rogue, I will only say this shame on you, Ubisoft. This game is glitched to the point of unplayable. They did a good story and left it halfdone. Ive seen freetoplay beta versions better than this. Im pretty sure I wont be playing the next ones, its a waste of time and money.
