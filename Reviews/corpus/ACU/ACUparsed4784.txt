The engine is worse then crysis, what that means is the engine IS BROKEN. Ether that or they have a contact with NVidia to sell graphics cards. I say both cause thats what this game is its only here to sell graphics cards. We have GTA 5 around the corner and Dragon age will be out within a week both of which are showing graphics on par with ACU or better. Yet here is the thing they dont need a graphics card that was released A MONTH AGO. Im not joking the recommended for GTA 5 and Dragon age is a 2 year old graphics card but no ACU recommends a month old graphics card.It gets worse heres the thing my gtx 660 can actually run the game. On max settings it crashes in 30 minutes, on the lowest about 5 minutes not kidding. It gets better the graphics look worse then AC Black flag played that on max on the lowest settings actually it looks worse then AC 1 but its still crashing my card.So I cant play the game and there is no reason to spend over 300 dollars on a new card, and since it will be at least another 2 years before the 660 becomes obsolete it looks like I wont be playing this game till then. Good Job Ubisoft.Update after over a year I finaly got it to work. . . . this game is a BORE HOLE. so boring. played throught it maxed everything out. so BORING, the coop is fun with friends though.
