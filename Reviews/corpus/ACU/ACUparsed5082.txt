I have only 3 issues with the game1 Random screen freezes on random times always in crowded places orwhere the game has to load some things2 Laggy cutscenes These seem to have fixed by updating my drivers and overclocking my GTX 7603 Happened only 2 times or so but i fell trough the map, took a screenshot of it, it occcured while fighting next to a wallBesides that, I actualy like the game, has some story, action an variety. Very nice that you can customise Arno.
