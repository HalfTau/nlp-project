The framrate is a pretty big problem. Ubisoft has said they are hard at work at fixing the game. But, lets be honest, if the framerate wasnt a problem, clean up some bugs, and this game would be great.Now, I wont reccomend the game until it fixes some major bugs. Like crashing, and to be honest, the fps is a legit problem toabout. Dont get the game until maybe Christmas. By then most major problems should be fixed, hopefully. Ubisoft, you better back he up here, or elsell seem like a ing idiot
