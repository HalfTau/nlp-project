well, after hearing all the horror stories about the bugs in this game, I can report that, although there are still some funny bugs, the game runs very well on a GTX 1070 and nvidia surround. The game setting is very interesting and the story line very well done. The downfall, it felt a bit short compared to other assassins creed games. The side quests are interesting for the most part except the rift missions which are basically some parcour exercise so not exciting. The side investigation missions are pretty good and really enjoyed the riddles for nostradamus. Now, one thing I do not understand is why they did not integrate the companion into the game like black flag where you would build your fleet and complete side missions. The companion is not very usefull and does not seem to connect properly with the account. I would have enjoyed that better if it was built into the game. Anyway, overall, great game and would recommend it.
