Dont listen to all those other people they just arent patient enough to wait for the patches.This is by far one of the best games I have ever played and I have played a lot of games.The fps drops every once and a while but I dont  really care the game is amazing regardless.You can go with all the nay sayers and not by this game, but you would be missing out big time.If your computers good and you have nvidia geforce, you got to get this game.You can kill people with more weapons than you can imagine.The story is amazing! people say this game was bad, I cant imagine why.I pre ordered this 3 hours before it came out and it was worth every penny.If there was a time to buy this game it would be now, because now they fixed a lot of the glitches and problems. Multiplayer works amazingly and I never get bored.Buy this game, you will not regret it!
