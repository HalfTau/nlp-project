Well ...ACUnity wasnt a bad game!Arno and Elise are very likable, the city Paris is a wonderful setting!And while the main story feels short compared to AC2/Black Flag it is actually fine for me.Short Its a fine game!no  i dont point at logic problems within the story, weird things in general... its still a game not a movie I like the open missions and harder fights and improved at time buggy stealth! I like the heist / murder mysteries quests. I love the setting and i cant stress this enough. I like also that AI doesnt seem to have a hivemind FarCry3/4 I like Arno that wouldnt be important when we wouldnt had AC3  i personally hated ConnerTechnicals....The game is technical impressive  when it runs that is! that being said I could play ACUnity on the late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro 2.3ghz Core i7 QuadCore / 16GB Ram / 2GB GDDR5 Geforce 750 GT, running Windows 8.1 update 1  and the latest nVidia driverwith mixed setting from low to medium to high in 720p.high detail but low detail shadows and sadly no AO or AntiAliasingAnd thats the first game where i would like to have AO and AntiAliasing!The game runs mostly with 30 fps.There was a point where i made 40 fps v1.3 or 1.4 due the broken GI. which i think was interesting  technically.honestly..Since my computer is mainly a working machine i dont care.I see also the game isnt the best optimised one like AC3 back the daysDoing game engine development / games my self, i really can overlook this issue in the end.Crossplatform development in general is a dauting and complicated task.I guess even with extra months of development we wouldnt have a perfect game.See update 1.5. Anvil Next might be ready for primetime with Assassins Creed Victory a year later.
