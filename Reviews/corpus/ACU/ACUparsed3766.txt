As someone with a highend GPU, I can recommend this game to anyone with the hardware to run it smoothly. The patches made the game way smoother than it was originally, and there are way less bugs and crashes now.The game has a nice story with good character development, and Coop is great when you have good allies.The graphics are beautiful and are definitely impressive. Combat system is pretty much exactly the same as the other games, apart from the addition of finishers, new skills and equipement.Parkour definitely isnt perfect, but the animations are refined to look more appealing. Still, my blood boils when Im in a chase or timed mission and I get stuck to random objects along the way, making me fail.However, even with all its flaws and rough start, this game was. and still is worth the money I payed for it, because damn it, I love Assassins Creed and this game is absolutely amazing.
