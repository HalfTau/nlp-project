Good Game, runs on ultra 4050 FPS, had to turn it down for Coop though. Minor problems for me, just slight bugs and frame drops every now, and then but nothing serious. Coop is loads of fun. its good to watching your friends parkour through paris.Id reccommend this game to anyone looking for a new game to play, but id wait a little while untill the major bugs people are having have been resolved.If you want to get a head start on the game id buy it now since the problems arent that noticable.
