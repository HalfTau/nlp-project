Potential to be an amazing game. Seems really cool, great ideas, and awesome advancements. Unfortunately, Ive preordered this game about a month or two before it came out, and I still cannot even run the tutorial 1st mission. Its a bit saddening and I know some other people have been able to start up the game and play a bit, so if anyone thiinks they can help me please let me know. Every time entering the mission it crashes and reboots my whole system. Yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled it.
