Really good, one of the best Assassins Creed games Ive played so far story wise. The game looks beautiful, but the game does suffer  from bugs here and there, but they  are all mostly just really just small, little things like people floating or dead bodies getting stuck in the floor, which are pretty hilarious. Id say its the third or fourth best game up to this point not including Syndicate and Origins.7.8/10  Would recommend lowering the settings
