Its difficult to explain why the Assasins creed team managed to screw this game up so badly  but it is one of the most unplayable games out there.  the character control is utterly awful  and that can almost be forgiven but for the number of levels where you desperately need your character to move well.  Couple that with the inordinate amount of time it takes you to get anywhere in the game, or to get new items, or to level up, or to  well  pretty much anything  and you are just left with a very shallow game that is more frustrating than it is playable...poorly constructed, poorly developed, poorly handled  very poor quality game over all.
