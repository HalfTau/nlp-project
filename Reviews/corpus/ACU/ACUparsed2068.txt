Assassins Creed Unitys 18th Century Paris is spectacular and a joy to traverse.  The main storyline is tepid, but the multitude of sandbox activities are varied and interesting.  Refined combat and parkour mechanics make this Assassins Creed control better than ever, and new character progression helps keep it engaging.  A great entry point into the series.
