Played a few hours so far, I have to say I havent seen anywhere near as many bugs ingame as other people have and Im sure my rig doesnt stack up to some of the people Ive seen with major issues. I can run the game on high with some frame dropping and on medium the framerate is pretty consistent, usually around 3545. Pretty disappointing release, dont buy it yet, wait till they fix it.System SpecsFX6300R9 270x 2gb of vram8gb RAM1TB HDD
