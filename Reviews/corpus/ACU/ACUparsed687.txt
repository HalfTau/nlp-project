Before I begin Yes, the game is mostly fixed but sadly still has poor optimization.Assassins Creed Unity is, for the most part, a normal Assassins Creed game with a Ubisoft Open World. However, the game offers more difficult and interesting combat, better parkour, gorgeous graphics and incredible customization alongisde a decent Shakespherean drama starring Flynn Rider from Disneys Tangled and Merideth from Brave. Not to mention Paris feels very, VERY alive. Its breathtaking honestly.While the optimization might not be great, I can run the game at 4k 40fps on High settings Theres not much visual difference between High, Very High, and Ultra High to begin with, but they do require a lot more power to run smoothly. Additionally, I havent experienced any stability issues. Certainly no crashes, and surprisingly, no bugs.Overall its probably the best Assassins Creed game Ive ever played. With everything it has to offer, its a shame the game was plagued by a rocky launch and resulting poor reviews. Id say that if your system is above the recommended settings yes, above not just at, then you should be able to run the game fine and is definitely worth picking up while on sale.NOTE Performance based on GTX 1070, i7 6700k processor and 16GB RAM. Performance across different setups may vary, batteries not included.
