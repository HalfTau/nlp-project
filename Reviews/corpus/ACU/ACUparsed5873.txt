I am a huge fan of the Assassins Creed series. Initially I was very excited about Unity. When I started the game up, the lag was absolutely horrific. Additionally, I cant even load the first level without the game crashing. My comp stats are at or at least very close to the recommended settings that Uplay requires. To make matters worse, I put the graphic settings to its lowest setting and still no cigar...I hear there is already a patch to fix the major issues, but for all the fans out there you may have to wait a while before playing.
