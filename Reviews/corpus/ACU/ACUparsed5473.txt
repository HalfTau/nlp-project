Ive read alot of reviews about performance issues and the game crashing and that got me worried. I opened the game no problem, and Ie played the game with no problems, not one. FPS wise the game hovers arounf 5060 depending on the environment. Literally havent had one problem.My PCi7 3770k16gb Kingston HyperX RamGigabyte gtx 7802TB HDDWindows 7
