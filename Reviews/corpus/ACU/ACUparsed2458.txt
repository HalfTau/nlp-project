Ok, Ive had to update this review alot! So here is the finished product. Many people say this game is unfinished and buggy.... but theyre wrong. The game is fun, but its not the best. The games port is horrible though. You really need a nvidia gtx 980 to play this. Sooooooo if you have that, its a great game. Unfortunately I only have an amd hd 8850m so I get around 18fps so it can get quite unjoyable at times. I really love the parkour and customization. 6/9. Oh yeah also it crashes on the default graphics.... but doesnt when I up the graphics.... WTF. Ok yeah there are a few bugs like that. I lied
