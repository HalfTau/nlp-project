Compared to previous games, Assassins Creed Unity has definately made some improvements, but still lacks in several areas.Pros The addition of a way down in the parkour system The visuals are quite impressive especially for the size of the world. No loading screens when you step inside a building really adds to the immersionCons The parkour system is still unpredictable. On occasion, it will simply stop working for no apparant reason Major imbalance in the upgrade system. You can get to just below the top tier in a couple hours and then spend the rest of the game making it that last 10 percent. On the flip side, if you manage your inventory properly, this makes alot of things very easy. Tutorials The game doesnt really hold your hand and for someone whos been out of the Assassins Creed games for awhile, this left me feeling very lost at first. I got it though, so I cant complain too badly. Still, a newbie to the series might have trouble.Overall, Id say my opinion is pretty mixed. I like it, and Id recommend it to someone who wants to try it, but if you didnt like the previous games, dont expect anything to have changed.
