This really is a beautiful game. Absolutely astonishing recreation of Paris and wonderful effects. I havent been so impressed with a games graphics since I played The Witcher 3. I would say that this game looks best when looking at large, iconic buildings. If you want to be stunned, visually, then but this game on sale.
