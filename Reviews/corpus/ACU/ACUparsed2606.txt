Despite all of the negative press this game received, I must say I really enjoyed it. The only issue I had was a loss of my  saved game. Now I simply keep my own backup of the save file just in case. I even run this game with high graphics and without meeting the recommended specs. Im using a 2.6 processor and gtx960 nividia card. Although I just started playing Rogue, I like Unity better at this point.
