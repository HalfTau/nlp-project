I see alot of people having problems with the game, but It works just fine for me and to be honest, I really enjoy it. Assassins Creed III used to be my favorite, but this is just pure awesomeness. I understand why you would be annoyed if the game doesnt work for you but I run it on highest settings, without any lags and it never crashes. Hopefully everyone will be able to play it soon without alot of trouble, if so I would say 9.5/10
