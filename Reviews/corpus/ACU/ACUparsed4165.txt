The following statements are based entirely on first impressions less than 2 hours of play.Having not played an Assassins Creed game since the original, and having not seen the gameplay of any since the second, I had very high expectations of the newer titles, believing that only improvements could have been made to the gameplay. In this respect, I was correct. The freerunning, combat mechanics, visuals and overall feel of the game are great.Unfortunately, I am victim to the same range of issues that countless others are experiencing. Sub30 framerates and input lag make this game almost completely unplayable for me. To be more specific, combat becomes extremely difficult, as reacting on time is not enough clairvoyance becomes a necessity.The integration of the companion mobile app as a gatekeeper between the player and certain loot is also very unwelcome. As someone with a dated cellphone, I have no opportunity to take advantage of this feature.If the performance issues are resolved in future patches, I will gladly recommend this game, as that is the primary problem. Otherwise, stick to previous instalments.
