I absolutely love this game. I cant understand why this has mixed results. Its different from the traditional Assassins Creed games, but its a good different. I feel like this game is more involved in many aspects. open windows and doors, the map, etc. I recommend this game to anyone who likes options. Yes, the quality is a little shabby, but every game has its faults. Not everyone has a super computer. I personally think the game is beautiful and worth the money.
