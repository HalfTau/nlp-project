Having played all previous games I had high expectations for Unity but due to all the launch negativity I decided to leave the game until now hoping that all the issues would be fixed. One concern was the performance issues but it ran fine on my midhigh end system. However during the course of the play through it has become evident that they just abandoned the game, constant issues with buggy quests and AI made it a frustrating experience.Its hardly recognizable as an assassins creed game and hard to believe it was developed by the same teams that handled previous games.There is only one real environment and whilst its beautifully done it does start to feel very samey after a while and it left me wishing for the variety of previous games.The one main feeling im left with after playing this game is why there is so much missing that has grown to be part of AC games  No Horses/Carriages No area control ! No Crafting No Treasure Maps No minigames No Unlockable Inns No Brawling No Sailing ?! I know its kinda outside the scope of the story but seriously France has a rich naval history and this would have been ideal excuse to add this. No upgradeable base as with previous games the cafe/creed lair is a poor imitation. No allies system like Brotherhood.Somehow they also seemed to make combat more clunky, weapon and item selection was done better in previous games and the camera seemed awkward too  someone tell them sequels are supposed to improve things!Another area that suffered badly was the enemy AI  it really is a joke in unity, far worse than previous games. Simply jumping onto a roof is enough to leave an enemy dumbfounded as to where you are !Whilst some might be happy with the addition of Coop its not something im interested in and i felt annoyed at the constant pushing of the CoOp modes even to the extent that you cant unlock stuff without doing the coops missions.Whilst there was a fair amount of sidecontent it felt very MMOish in nature with a vast majority being variations on defend NPC/steal something/kill someoneYet another premium game with microtransactions  sad times Feels like they cut corners in trying to rush this one out the door and also pushing the coop in a bid to capture a different market.By FAR the worse the in the entire AC series  Bought discounted for only 20 and still feel robbed.
