Stealth 1,00,0000,00 persent amazing, Combat 10000 perent amazing, Parkour TOTALLY BADA!!!!! Coop Much better. I didnt really enjoy the other games Coop, I really liked how they did the dressup, Story AMAZING!!!! But I really didnt expected it to end the way it did I HATE SAD ENDINGS  I have not yet played the Dead Kings DLC but im sure it is going to be bada. Good thing I had a game pad becuse I dont think I would have enjoyed it as much, Im more use to playing AC on the PlayStation3 I wish could have bought a PS4 but I didnt have the money. I could talk about this game for hours im just the biggest fan of Assassins Creed. I dont care what all of you say you can fight me to the death but nothing will destroy my love of Assassins Creed.And im also excited for Assassins Creed Syndicate coming this year. I got to stop our else im going to be here all night.
