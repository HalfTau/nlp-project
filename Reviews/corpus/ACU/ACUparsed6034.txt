PATCH 4 UPDATE This was supposed to be the patch that fixed performance issues, unfortunately however this patch changes NOTHING, the performance is still exactly the same that it was at launch, ubisoft is literally lying to your face and laughing by telling you that this patch fixed performance issues.Quite frankly its disgusting that they can get away with doing things like this, this is the kind of company that just need to die ASAP, hopefully costumers will learn from this and start boycotting ubisoft from now on.I CANNOT even average 30 fps with everything on ultra plus TXAA, on a ING GTX TITAN, yes you read that correctly, a GTX TITAN CANNOT MAINTAIN CONSTANT 30 FPS IF TXAA IS ENABLED.Without it however i can get around 35 ish maybe 45 on outdoors and 60 fps indoors Without any action onscreen, for those people out there that are defending this game and ubisoft ill just say this NBA 2K15 has better graphics than this game and with everything on max plus AA, the game never drops below 100 fps, whereas in this game its nigh impossible to get constant 60 fps.If thats not bad optimization then i dont know what is.Score 5/10. Avoid this game like the plague.
