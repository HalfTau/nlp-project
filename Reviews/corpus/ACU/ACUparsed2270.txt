This is the prettiest Assassins Creed game out there. Gorgeous graphics, beautiful vistas of Revolutionary Paris augmented by the milling crowds and lively AI, going for a walk through ACU is a treat. Looking at all the details  children running about, people fixing wagons, talking, shopping  the environment truly is a wonder to behold. Unfortunately, all this beauty was rather let down by the simple fact that the games too busy crashing for you to notice all of this.Unity was a two steos forward, one step back kind of thing. Every couple of releases, Assassins Creed really comes out with something brilliant, but also fatally flawed. With the release of Assassins Creed III, we were treated to radical advances in story and lore at the cost of gameplay and repetitive missions. However, it was redeemed by Black Flag  with a brilliant story and excellent gameplay. Hopefully, Unity and Victory later known as Syndicate will follow this trend.To conclude Unity is a beautiful game that is startling to behold  unfortunately, story wise the game is a bit of a let down. I would recommend you play this game only if you desire to wander around Paris for hours on end, and like details. If you want to advance the story, or dont like exploring the sandbox, this isnt the one for you. Go play Rogue instead.
