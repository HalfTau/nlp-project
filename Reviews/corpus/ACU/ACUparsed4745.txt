Apart from the high system requirements and the fact that there are frame rate problems, this game is actually very good.I really like the character customization and new combat/free run system even though it took me a while to get used to it.Give the game a chance and youll appreciate it. Dont be expecting to play this game on high graphics levels if you dont have the recommended specs though. I have the exact specs it is recommended and I get about 40fps  60fps with everything maxed out Not including shadows which is on high and AA which is on FXAA.
