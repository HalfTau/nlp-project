Ill try to be as thorough as I can, because I was as confused as many of you might be I purchased this game off steam, and with the full campaign behind me, along with 67 hours of gametime, I have experienced 0 bugs or glitches, as reported by many of the reviewers here.Now, to clarify, many of the bugs that originally made the game unplayable have probably been patched by now. And it could be due to the fact that Im running the game on an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti, along with 30GB of RAM, and an i7 7700K Processor. or I could have just lucked out and got a bugless copy.That being said, however, the game itself is stunning for a multitude of reasons1 It is perhaps the most visually stunning Assassins Creed game, along with Black Flag, and I found myself often times simply watching my character move and marvelling at the fluidity. Ive been running the game at Max settings with a locked frame rate of 162.2 The story is genuinely engaging, and nails all elements of comedy, intrigue, adrenaline, and continuation of the Assassins Creed storyline. Anyone whos been following gametogame will enjoy the story.3 It introduces new mechanics that expand the playability and challenge veteran players. The combat, and stealth, this time around, seemed more challenging requiring more focusTheres more, but honestly, it just feels great to play. That being said, all other reviewers have valid points, so to anyone considering buying this game, I would say its a 50/50 shot and you should hope youre lucky like I was.
