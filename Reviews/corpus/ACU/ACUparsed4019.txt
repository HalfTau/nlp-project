Multiplayer is not working properly, i can only see myself a bunch of times on the Members List in My Club. One of the biggest reasons i purchased this game was to play with a buddy of mine.Ubisoft keeps disappointing WatchDogs, enough said... They are just as bad as EA.If Tom Clancys The Division ends up the way i fear, then i am boycotting Ubisoft.
