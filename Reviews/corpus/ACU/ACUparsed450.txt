Dont do reviews, but I wanna see Unity have more positive feedback.Heres my experience in a nutshell Low hopes on first buying the game, got it for cheap so why not check it out? Get to know the characters and setting, seems okay. Having fun with earning new weapons, gear and skills. NPC glitches out and sails off into the distance, not gamebreaking just funny as hell. Try coop and laugh with friends as we realise howwe are at being Assassins. Continues story, not best story in the world, but fun. Can tell that Im gonna put a lot of hours into this installment
