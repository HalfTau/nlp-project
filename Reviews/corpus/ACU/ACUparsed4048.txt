I was one of the more lucky ones I guess, I was able to play through most of the game with only  a few glitches showing up, much as I would expect from any new release really.I will admit that Ubisoft is pretty much on the no buy early for me anymore do to the all too often shakey launches.The mixing of the companion app once it was working correctly made for a nice addition on a tablet. Having a large map to see your location was nice, and for some of the side missioins it was a good bonus to look into your database on clues and stuff.I did find the weapon control much less to my liking in this version of AC verses the others, didnt have the option to always fight with hidden blade which I use to love to do nor using anything other than sword feels right. This is depite the tie ins it had into AC Initiates.Now AC Initiates was kind of a joke on launch and for very much of my game play. Even to date, they have challenges marked as comming soon which will be way after Im done. They really didnt coordinate and test the 2 interactions well together.Companion App other stuff is eh.. ok.. the finding the symbols minigames is kind of fun but gets very hard to notice some times on such small screens 10 hereMy best advice is wait until it his a price point you like to get it. Its still a fun play, though feels less AC than the previous games.and bonus cause I had the damn season pass, I got a free copy of another game far cry 4 do to the fubard release. So I really cant complain.Over 60 hours in it and  still not done with all the side missions or the DLCs when they  come out
