I was really doubtful about buying this game.  People were saying there were bugs and crashes, but really, it worked fine with me.  My game does freeze from time to time, but not for very long.  There are minor bugs while Im playing, of course, but Im sure Ubisoft is working to fix those. But I am really enjoying the game.   The storyline intrigues me, the characters are a bit boring, but likewise, enjoyable, and the graphics in this game are fantastic.  The coop modes in the game are also very fun and entertaining.  But remember that this may not be the case for you.  I would check your PC specs before you consider buying this game.  If you have the requirements, then it may run well for you.my PC specsI54670 Haswell QuadCore 3.4ghzNvidia GeForce GTX 9708GB RamWindows 7
