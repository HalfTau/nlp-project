I have been impressed with Assassins Creed games in the past, but this game is horrific. They didnt make any of the graphics translate to PC, and honestly havent even bother to try and fix anything within the past two months. Not to mention they really promote this as a game to conquer with friends, but the only coop content is about eight 10 minute missions that you probably cant even get through since the terrible lag and in gamebreaking glitches. My worst purchase since I can remember, and I hope someone reads who is curious about the game and is turned away, because I wouldnt pay more than 5 dollars for this game.
