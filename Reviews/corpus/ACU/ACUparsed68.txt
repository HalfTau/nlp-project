One major drawback, the control, this game have one of the most dredded control.How awful the control is ?You can wall eject between edges that is far, but no response to edges that is near.Free run up/down is a good addition, if and only if it works all the time. Tried to vault over some fences, ended up stopped there, I have to release the button then press again for it to work.If anyone going to buy this game, take note that UBISOFT no longer have support for it, so dont expect they will fix the control. I pretty much regretted buying this game to torture myself with those control.
