Good story, solid Assassins creed game that has terrible optimization, broken online, and far too much online tied garbage. most of the chests are tied to stuff that you cant access without online play, most of the items in the game, including the best stuff are all tied to online play or features which simply do not function, Im not sure now, and certainly not at launch. The story is worth playing as it brings the core Assassins creed gameplay back with added difficulty but they removed a ton of items and features in a way that seems really unnessecary. Overall, this is a step far down from ACIV Black Flag, better than 3 in many way,s but far far below Even Revelations, If youre a hardcore AC fan its worth picking up, if youre meh on it, dont bother until it goes on sale.
