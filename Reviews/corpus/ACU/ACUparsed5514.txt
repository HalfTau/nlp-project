After playing few hours of ACU, I wouldnt recommend to buy at this moment. There are so much flawed in this game that make you annoy rather than enjoy the game.First of all, there are bugs and glitches everywhere. people walking in the midair, player falls down into nowhere, etc etc....Second of all, I didnt experience the drop fps during the gameplay but during the cutscene, it happen so horribly that I almost have to skip the cutscene instead of enjoy the storylineLast of all, the program is unstable it keep crashing after I play couple of hours. This IS MAKING ME MAD AT ITEventhought  I  like the ACU system like Self customization but weapon of choice still not much as I aspected weapon are most from sub weapons from other AC series, COOP gameplay which causes bugs time to time like no objective after clearing one, and Free style gameplay I gotta say its a good idea to use your imagination to assainate the target with your own gameplay style , BUT comparing bugs, unoptimized games....... I wouldnt recommend to anyone to play at the moment
