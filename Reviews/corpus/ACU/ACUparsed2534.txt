Pleasantly suprised! I uninstalled game many months ago because I couldnt handle the unstable graphics even at low settings. Based on recent reviews posted which were still not very positive I almost didnt give the game another chance. I think the game plays fantastic now patch 1.5 even at the highest settings. I feel it is now worth purchasing  if the graphics/performance are not acceptable for you then a refund can be requested.
