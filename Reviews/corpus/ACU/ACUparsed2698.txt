Assassins Creed Unity has great gameplay. It has been improved in almost every way from other Assassins Creed games in combat, character customization, a true stealth mode, etc.There are many graphical glitches, though. While it is beautiful, there is so much popin and stuttering that it is obvious the game wasnt fully optimized. These graphics issues can also easily cause ridiculous bugs. Another downside are the microtransactions, which have their place, and it isnt here.I, unlike most, will still recommend this game. Look past the bad design choices and graphics problems and bugs, if you can, put Uplay in offline mode, and play it like any other Assassins Creed game. The gameplay is great, but it needs some toleration of a terribly unoptimized and buggy engine to be enjoyed. I used to hate this game I learned to look pst its flaws, however, and now I actually enjoy it.
