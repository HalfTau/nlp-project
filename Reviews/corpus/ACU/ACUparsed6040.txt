I am on maximum settings and Im getting max framerate, no visual lag except when initiating cutscenes, small hiccups when that happens. I dont know what most of these people are smoking but dont listen. If you have a highend PC, you can play this game. If you have a medend PC. You can manage this game. If youre having issues, update your drivers if nvidia to 344.65. Happy killing!My specs 1440x900 monitor, 60hzAMD FX8350 8CoreGeforce GTX 78016GB RAM
