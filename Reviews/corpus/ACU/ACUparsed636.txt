Just awesome.The feel of the game is so good.One of the best graphics and majesty i have seen in a game.I am a fan of assassins creed games since a long time but i will be unbaisedSome glitchs are there but they are highly avoidable.Still i will recommend running it on ultra for the best experience as i hadrunning below ultra spoils the fun.The feel of assassins creed games is mentained be sure of thatfew of the best leap of faiths, believe me.So go for it if you have rigs to run it ,it will not disappoint not now.Long live the creed.
