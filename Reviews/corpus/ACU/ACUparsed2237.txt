I started playing this game on PS4 last year but was not happy with the performance, so I put it aside. Bought it on sale because the price was right and I had been thinking about picking up where I left off. I like it and I think it plays fine on pc right now. It still has issues but it is very playable. It is still not well optimized because if I try to run it on anything other than high settings the framerate fluctuates wildly. And this is on a machine equipped with a i74790K and MSI GTX 980! Im playing it on my TV at 1080p and the framerate on high stays pretty much at 60 with dip into the high 50s. I havent tried using DSR to play it at 1440p yet as it looks fine to me now but Ill probably give that a try tonight to see if it affects the framerate. Itll be interesting to see.  Despite the optimization issues Id recommend it now to anyone that has a relatively high spec. machine to run it on. I would think definitely a GTX 970 would be fine. Probably a GTX 7880 too. The city looks great and the soundscape is immersive. As long as there are no other problems that pop up it is worth the sale price. I got it for 19 but I would be surprised if it goes lower during the upcoming holiday sale after Christmas.
