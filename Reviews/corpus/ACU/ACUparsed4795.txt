This game is absolutely horrible. It essentiall has the same basic play mechanics of a free to play game with pay walls, only you have to actually pay for the game first. You make virtually no money when completing missions and the only effective way to make money is by buying up properties and litterally just waiting for the game to give you money. You could do long, boring, tedious, and repettitive side missions if you like but I prefer to just leave the game running while I go out and do stuff. This is the only effective way to upgrade your equipment in this game unless you want to pay real world money to get new gear in the game. The game was intentionally designed to waste your time and entice you to spend money to end your waiting.I dont even have to mention how much of a buggy mess this game is and worst of all this game will destroy your save files. After grinding myoff for hours just to have decent equipment e a crash made my save files corrupted and now I have to start all over from the very begginging. No thanks, Im just going to ask steam to refund my money so that I can play a good game.
