I have played more than 50 hours on Unity, so I have my fair share of experience of this game.7.5/10ProsExcellent time, the idea of fighting during the French Revoulution is a great idea, wish the main story focused more on the revoulution than Arnos love life, but I understand that it was necessary to show the flavor to Arnos personality. I also wish you got to spend more time with Napoleon.Personality, Best likeable assassin since Ezio. Excellent Personality, not the brick wall, emoitionless Connor not the scallywag, total dbag pirate of Edward Kenway. Not the badass OG Altair. But still a pretty awesome assassin.Story, not as good as a story as black flag AC4 is still my favorite, but still good, probably my third favorite storyline.Customization finally customization in an AC game, dont have to be Assassin whiteCoop When it works, its awesome, the combat is not OP like in the other games just counter and win and it is actually a challenge.Faffing about, most fun faffing about in this game than any AC game besides black flag. When it comes to doing random, nonstory stuff, this game had it nailed down.ConsFrame rate Yes, sometimes it drops below 40 fpsGlitches Sometimes the AI in a mission coop doesnt move so you cant complete it. Rarely you fall through the world. Sometimes you can see random AI that arent walking normally, but are walking straight up you can fall into a building that you arent suppose to access that has no doors or windows that you can access. you can randomly jump into the carts of hay no, not into the HAY, but in the cart, Arno is standing up, walking in the cart of hay. SometimesSave corruption heard of people getting it, never had it happen to meOverall 7.5/10, love the game, love the story, love the assassin personality, love the customization.But I HATE the glitches.
