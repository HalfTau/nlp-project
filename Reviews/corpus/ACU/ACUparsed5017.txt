Bugs note this version of the game has been patched twice alreadySudden corrupt saves taking away several hours spent in playing the game. This can happen from quitting the game during multiplayer or just plain anywhere else. Confirmed a common problem.Bugs and sudden lag spikes which is annoying, and sometimes can cause your death.Flickering corners in every object inside your headquarters or many other interiors with a high performance PC in any antialiasing settings, especially the lowest one.And a lot more glitchy stuff you see in other peoples reviews, too. Theyre geniune, not complaints.GameplayCombat improved with the parrying system and realistic difficulty and AI, reruined by its sluggish approach.Freerunning made easier by new upordown system, but also causes new navigation problems where you still press the right thing and jump to your death/the wrong place.Stealth smoother than in previous games, made better by the crouch system. Broken cover system, lack of whistling, and sometimes being detected while hidden brings it back down.Controls still as broken as ever!The coop is pretty useless and occasionally annoying unless you have actual friends to play with. I got more done doing the missions on my own.Didnt believe the majority on the Internet, I thought it was just haters being haters. Nope. The game is actually broken, which is too bad. The characters are less forgettable than in the previous games, the story more engaging, and the missions are actually fun, and there is some pretty decent customisation in this game. Either wait for a lot more patches to come out, or just dont buy the game.
