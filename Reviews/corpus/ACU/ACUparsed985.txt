I have a love hate relationship with this game.  I consider myself an Assassins Creed fan boy.  I thought Black Flag was the pinnacle of the franchise, so my desire to play Unity at launch was low.  After hearing the disastrous launch I decided to skip this one.  However, seeing recent reviews being mostly positive I decided to see for myself if it was worthy of a recommendation.I will say it certainly is a good Creed game, but crashing issues, graphical artifacts in Helix Rifts only, and no Naval combat kept it from being a great Creed game.The new changes werent all bad.  In fact the free running and combat changes are great.  Coop is implemented seamlessly, but a missing multiplayer mode was a huge disappointment.I recommend it.  Especially to Creed fans, because it is solid in story and traditional creed gameplay.  Hopefully you wont have to suffer through too many crashes to enjoy it.  I did, but Im a fan boy.
