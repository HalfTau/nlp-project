This game is good and I enjoy the story a lot decent fps is needed or fighting and parkouring just looks choppy and lame I play at 4050fps ultra high settings i5 4460 3.2ghz Gtx 960 2gb 4050 is good and can easily enjoy the game some fps spikes but nothing that takes away the experience to much worth the buy
