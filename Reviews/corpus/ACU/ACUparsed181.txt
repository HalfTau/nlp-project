I did not find this game enjoyable at all alone. However, the multiplayer can be really fun with friends. I didnt like the main character that much, and its hard to stick with him and the choices he makes. I did like the aspect of getting money in the game though. Theres also this one mission where you escort some lady and you have to silently take out a group of enemies at a location, but then she goes rushing in all alone and alerts the guards. She 1v9s them and then blames you for not killing them in stealth. Its really, really, realllllllllly frustrating.
