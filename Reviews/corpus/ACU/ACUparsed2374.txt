This Game I was so like nah maybe I wont test it out, eventough I heard so mutch bad stuff about. but then Aegin I am intressted into late 1700 s and that Period of War and Drama so. and I tested in out and I relly enjoyed it, I like how they made this game and it would be intressting to test out MP/CoOp thing asswell someday. so I give this game a rating of 10 out of 10 Eagle Standrds. P and yes I reccomend you try out the game, before you do give it a bad sign or mark.
