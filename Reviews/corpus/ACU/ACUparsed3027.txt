Well guys, I played through the entire game now and this is my expirience.I think the gameplay is actually quite good, i know this game has its down sides and i definitely recommend picking it up if its for sale on a cheaper price. the 60 euros is not worth it but the game aint that bad! i only encounterd 1 minor crash after an hour of gameplay but apart from that the occasional lagg spike here and there when entering crouded areas. There just is a lot inside this game and a lot to it. The story was decent enough, i personaly like it but i can understand if some dont. Its a little bit of a romance going on between Elise and Arno.Apart from that ill list it up a littleCombat its a bit different but good id say 7/10Story Like said a bit of a romance personaly  7/10The scenery world itself well this is i find most interesting. there are loads of npcs and i think it looks nice. Same gos for all the structures  8.5/10How buggy the game is Well like i said, only 1 crash and a few minor spikes every now and then the game runs solid for ME apart from that. However! this might not be the case for some others from what ive read. so just be cautios. but if you are a true AC fan, this game is a nice game no matter how muchit has gotten. i recommand it if the price is lower!!
