Wow, got halfway throught the game...and saves get corrupted. Best game ever, I dont know how you guy ever got through testing this..if it cant even run on super high end PCs I doubt your testers were able to play it, which leads me to believe that you guys purposely released a Broken game. When all you guys go on about a time frame for a game release, realise that us gamers are lenient we really dont care when a game is going to come out as long as it ing works. This is very embaraasing and unacceptable.
