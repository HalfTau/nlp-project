The game has probably the best visuals and facial animation ive seen in a game. Yet the gameplay is still too easy and the story is still too weird with its scifi elements. The connection between the world youre playing and the Animus comes just too sudden and breaks immersion. Youre playing in one moment and suddenly you need to Server hop which means the world gets corrupted and you have to get from A to B.The game deserves tons of recognition for its visuals, the artists behind this are geniouses. The characters are also well done. But it gets boring without good gameplay, you end up doing the same thing all the time. The AC series have a chance to be something very great but they need to change up the gameplay for me to continue with these series.
