First off, this game is powerful. Beautiful in every aspect. All the people complaining just need to upgrade. Fluid movement, new fantastic fighting style, and a massive map thats fun to get lost in. Loving every minute of it. 101/10. Its a great addition to the series. And ultra high settings looks amazing. Just saying.
