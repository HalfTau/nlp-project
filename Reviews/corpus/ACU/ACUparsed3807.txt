My computer dont even meet minimun rec, but it still play at 24 fps...  so if you say you got a good computer/laptop whateva and you got laggs and thats your problem. now when it comes to the gameplay combat, free running that stuff is good, realy good, some bugs here and there, yes some buggs in coop missions, and some when it comes to obejcts you should be able to climp/not climb/be able to walk over. but the biggest and most anoying bugg I had is that my wepons dont save, I buy a wepon and upgrade it, but it dont save, so if I was to switch between sword/pistol to a rifle and back, my new rifle is gone and I need to spend same amount of cash to rebuy it but for some reason, I got to buy some wepons in the beginning but after sequence 5, the game dont seem to save the wepons I buy.
