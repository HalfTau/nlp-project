Great Game.  10/10.Graphics and Sounds are amazing. Combat and free roam runs smooth as butter.  I have everything set on ultra.  lots of negative review for some reason.. either they didnt bother reading the spec requirements, or they just dont have the rig to run this properly.   I dont get all the hate with DRM and Ubisoft.  never had any issues with both.
