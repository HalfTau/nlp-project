A great game no doubt. As all the other games, it has an intruiging story and exciting missions. If it were not for lots of bugs, crashes and framerate drops this game would have been absolutely amazing! The climbing/running is also more advanced now and if you master it you will get a more fluid movement and jumping. I really like that!Pros Exciting story Rewards you for good climbing/running Harder combat Multiplayer A harder AC game!Cons Bugs Lots of bugs Game crashes now and then Framerate dropI will recommend this to fans of the franchise. 7/10.
