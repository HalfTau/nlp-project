Single player is great It hooked me, is a lot of fun to play! Coop... is a frustrating, buggy nightmare.I purchased two copies of this game so I could play it with the Mrs. However, we didnt stick with it, and coop experience wasnt compelling enough to put up with the absolutely maddening issues we encountered while playing together.Single player is super great fun, though.
