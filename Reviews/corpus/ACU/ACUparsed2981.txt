Assassins Creed is one of my favourite game franchises. For that reason I wont be too harsh on this game. Is it any different to other AC games? No. Although the free running element has some slightly new and tweeked movements. I dont like the fighting and dont like the weapons. This AC looks very nice but with just the same graphical visuals as Black Flag. It hasnt blown me away so far and the storyline and general gameplay is actually very boring. In fact, its boring to the point where I am not even sure I am going to finish this game. This is in stark contrast to Black Flag where I was actually dissapointed when I finished the game because I wanted more! Overall this game is not worth the money. Wait for sale. It is now fixed which is good considering the amount of things that were broken on release but even still, I want another Black Flag...something different. Boring!
