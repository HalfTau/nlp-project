Paris is increadible, gameplay is better than previous Assassins Creed games too. Honestly, you know what kind of game youre getting with Assassins creed and this is just like previous ones good art and stabby stabby without  follow missions and a plot that is half decent.I say only half decent because there is two stories being told, one a revenge/romance, the other the assassins vs. templars. Guess which one drags the game down its the templar half of the story. I honestly would have been so much happier if I did not have to listent to bad guys prattle on about their awesome society after I killed them. The giant elephant in the room for this game is the performance and Ill be honest about it. Its not great, if you have below a 680 graphics card, do not buy this game. But I have a 780 and an ultrawide monitor and was able to run it at 3060fps consitently. I will also say there is a reason for the bad frame rate, it is because the graphics are really, really good.I feel like I liked the game more than most, I would pick it up on sale though.
