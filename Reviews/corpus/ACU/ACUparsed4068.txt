This piece of art was overflowed with negative reviews here on Steam without a proper reason. It does really have some practical troubles in means of performance, though you really should get attention around the game itself rather than poorly optimized engine.I really like the game so far 16 total sync at the moment, I enjoy random crowd events as much as storyline flow and character cast. I love a lot the firstever customization within the game, its always nice to give your hero a personalized look so your Arno doesnt look like... well, other Arnos.I preordered Gold Edition and I have a dated PC. And I still not regret any single coin.P.S. I also ownnow, thanks for that!
