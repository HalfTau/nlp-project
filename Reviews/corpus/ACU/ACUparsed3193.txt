Wow, where do I start! one of the clunkyest games I have ever tried to play, except for Sniper 3 You have to be an octopus to hit all the keys you ned to to perform an action.  You get into free run and jut hit walls that you would think you could climb up.Great story, but after mission one I went back the the stream stor e to look for a new game. Save your money.
