I preordered the game and I didnt come across any strange bugs like many others claimed.  Ive played the game from start to finish twice and enjoyed it both times.The story itself is kinda dumb but thats nothing to be surprised about.The free running / parkour is really fun but I wish it was more fluid that way it would feel faster.The walking animation is fine but whoever animated the run animation has obviously never watched someone good at running run.  Though I guess the almost stumbling run does explain the lack of speed when running, the speed at which you run would be closer to a jog.I enjoyed the sword combat.There is a lot of visual customization but with the items tied to performance you can end up with some really dumb looks if you care more about performance.  And with the exception of two found outfits that you cant alter the look or color of, your character just does not fit in with everyone else.The multiplayer experience with randoms was horrible.  And I cant say if the multiplayer was good with friends because none of my friends would get the game.Overall I enjoyed free running through the open world.
