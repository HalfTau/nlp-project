Assassins Creed Unity is not a bad game per say. But in my opinion, it is a bad Assassins Creed game. My main interest of this franchise is where the meta story is heading, whats the mysteries of the First Civilization and heck, what the hell is going on ever with Junos disappearance since killing Desmond on Assassins Creed 3? This iteration doesnt feel like a canonical followup in the main setting storyline.Instead, you barely have anything to do on the modern setting. Bland and boring setting. Now that Desmond Miles is out of the portrait, the new unknown guy from BLACK FLAG you played as in the Abstergo Entertainment Montreal studios had little to offer in the main Templar vs Assassin everlasting confict. That setting felt forced and I had hoped AC Unity, that the modern setting will be much more developed, just like AC3 and before. But nope! Here in Unity, you dont get out of that Animus chair and you only get some quick briefing inside the Animus from the Hacker girl and the awkward Shawn, who keeps whining as much as before. Heck, you arent even told who you are, if you are still the same guy as AC IV!Im still really annoyed that that portion of the story was ignored. From Altair to Ezio and to Connor, these characters had SOMETHING to offer towards Desmond Miles point of view! Such a missed opportunity to this failed launch, rushed story and a huge step backwards from previous AC games.
