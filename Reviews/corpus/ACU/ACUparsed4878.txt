DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! !Ive been a fan of this series since the second edition and they have always had a frame rate problem with my pc but unity has to be the worst of all. I can play most triple A titles from medium to high graphics but I can barely run this game on all low settings. Throughout the game the little i could actually stand to play I ran into many bugs and glitches with textures randomly becoming invisible and me going through walls. They probably rushed this game. The combat system is ten times harder than the previous ones some people like it but I dont and the game mostly relies on stealth. I like DO NOT PICK THIS GAME UP UNLESS YOU HAVE A BEEFY UP TO DATE COMPUTER AND YOU ARE AN EXTREME FAN OF THIS SERIES. Otherwise wait for a new AC game. They seem to have been pushing them out quite frequently.
