I have quite a good gaming PC and before getting the game I went into detail all over the internet to see if I had specs good enough to play this game, and from what i saw it was OK. But, as soon as I got it it started laging and even if I put it on the lowest settings it still lage. I want my money back. But if you have a BRILLIANT PC then go for it from what Ives een on YouTube its an OK game.
