I meet the minimum requirements for the specs on this game and the game is playable at around 3060 fps at 720p. Me not being picky about quality of graphics in a game even though I have a gaming pc, the game is very enjoyable with even just one other person to play with. There are still some qwerks but thats with all AC games Ive played. Single player is very fun if youve got an hour and a half to kill for a memory or just a few sequences. although co op missions with a group of friends in a call is highly recommended and its great that skill points earned in co op missions stay with you into single player and vice versa. In game currency is a little bit of a grind grind to get through missions and loot chests but being smart about equipment usage helps because that stuffs expensive.
