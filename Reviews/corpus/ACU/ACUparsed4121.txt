DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you are expecting an Assasins Creed game that is actually good, and you can actually run... Leave this page now. This game is no where near complete... It looks like a better version of the first Theif game. The gameplay is horrible compared to Black Flag... This is by far the worst AC ever to be released... Ubisoft ed it up.. They legit ed it up.. The music/voice acting is not good, the game on high looks like a potato... Dont even try Ultra or very high. I play every single game I have on ultra/highest and this game? dropped me down to a normal for a good 40 fps.... Ubisoft have legit ed this up.
