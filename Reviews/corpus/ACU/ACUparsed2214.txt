This game was probably the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced. I bought the game when it first came out, hoping that over time it would slowly develop and receive updates to make it somewhat playable. It has been over a year later and I am still experiencing issues. Black Flag runs fine, but this game was just truly awful for PC.If you really want this game, play it on console.
