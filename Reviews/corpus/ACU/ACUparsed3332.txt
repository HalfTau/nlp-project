While in theory this game would have been an awesome game, in execution it was a tragic disaster. extremely high computer requirements, bugs left and right, HUGE glitches, promised things never happening and all it took was a poweroutage at the right time to loose my save. It took them a week to get to my tech support question instead of the couple of days it claimed... which means many of the details were lost in the process. im severly disappointed by ubisoft this time. maybe as time goes on and they fix things... i might be more likely to recomend it. as of right now though, i wouldnt recomend it... play the rest first.
