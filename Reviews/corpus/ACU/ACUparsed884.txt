This is my first AC game i have ever played and to be honest i only have it becuase my friednt told me to so we could do the multiplayer missions..... to be honest i loved the game sure the story cut a bit and i was somewhat disapointed that after you defeat the final boss there is nothing left to do. i would have loved some wonky side mission. coop worked fine for me when i used it.... and i havent go much into it but i do like it.... but if i were to complain whatsoever i felt week up untill the end untill i found out that smoke bomb are over powered when mixed with the group heling trait.... i am looking into buying syndicate please exuse if i spelled that wrong to continue the story and i really hope there is more stunning games like this to come
