Revolutionary Paris is very much my dream setting for an AC game, however with the state this was launched in, Id given up on Unity, and basically the series. However I managed to get it dirt cheap lately, and from the reviews it seemed like the issue had been fixed. And it turns out, they are for the most part. It didnt crash on me a single time and though I did have some graphical glitches including some hilarious ones, I didnt encounter any game breaking bug.For a time it was a pleasure to run around Revolutionary Paris, which is beautifully rendered and feels geniuinely alive. However this is an AC game, which means the gameplay got stale a while ago. They do try to improve things but, as has been the case in the past, namely for controls and stealth mechanics, they take a step forward then they take a step back. They added some things that could potentially be good to stealth, but removed others that were working like hiding in bushes and the controls have been improved for some things, but are the most frustrating in the series to date for other things.The map is probably the biggest in the history of the franchise but as all Ubisoft games for the past 5 years, its filled to the brim with pointless collectibles and boring side activities. While you dont have to do them, it does make finding the worthwhile ones hard.The story is okay at best, the final mission is easily the worst in the franchises history, and you can see the plot twist coming from a mile away. You do however, as is the norm with the series, get to meet many historical figures, which is always nice.All in all, I recommend this to history buffs, especially if you love the history of France, and the most dedicated AC fans when its on sale.
