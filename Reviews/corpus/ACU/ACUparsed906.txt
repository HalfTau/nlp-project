this game is amazing ive been a massive fan of assassins creed since 2008 and played this game for over 50 hours on ps4 and now playing it on my desktop ultra graphics. graphics r overkill in this game even on lowest they r still good. if u want everything in the game well good luck because that might just be about 10 mio there r over 100 armor hoods,chests,gaunlets,pants and colors and 15 outfits this is the hardest game in the series the blocking feature u will need to be alot faster on the buttons i realy recommend this game if u r good enough and fan of assassins creed...WARNING! the game is extremely hard to run so have a good computer.
