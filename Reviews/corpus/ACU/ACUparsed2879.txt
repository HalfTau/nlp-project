Even after buying this game on sale, I feel like I was short changed. It is full of poorly written code and it is quite obvious after contacting their help desk that they are not interested in repairing the game. Their answer was to try assigning different keys to the game as a work around. Why would anyone need to do that when the game should work properly when purchased regardless of what keys are assigned to perform a specific task?? Needless to say I got about halfway through the game and could not progress any further due to a malfunctioning code. And yes I tried assigning a different key which still was a failure. So, I have a game which can only be played halfway through. I think that there should be some course that gamers can take which allows them to get a refund when the game that they purchase does not function. Frag the programmers and get someone in there who actually knows what they are doing! I have lost all trust in the Assassins Creed franchise. I would strongly advise against buying this game unless you enjoy getting upset due to malfunctions.
