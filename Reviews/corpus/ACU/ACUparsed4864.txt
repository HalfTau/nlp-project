 Impressive recreation of Paris, good characters, lots of stuff to do. Disastrous performance, unbelievable bugs, disappointing ending my opinion.I recommend the game but not in this state. Wait for Ubisoft to fix it, if they dont do it, then dont buy.PS the british accents are really ridiculous. And Ubisoft, I really wanted to play as Elise.
