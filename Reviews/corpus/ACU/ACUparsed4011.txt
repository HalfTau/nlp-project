ABSOLUTE RUBBISH, what is ubisoft thinking. Terrible game controls and conbat mechnics, kind of reminds me of assassins creed 2 combat. I cant get past Sequence 9 because of the slow and bad fighting with no human shields making it insta death for me. I am so disapointed with this game which still cost 30 on sale, right no not even worth 10. Still crashing with lag spikes lasting 1020 seconds, not what I expected with a game like this.
