Please, Id like you to take some time to read this, because you may waste 50 or more on this game. I have an incredible gaming computer which can stand pretty much every game, high settings at 60fps but that being said if youre like me and can handle the extreme lag of this game which most people have the glitches actually make the game unplayable. Not meaning the game is.. It is actually unplayable. I can not see the main menu, the map or most of the game at all with a white screen which keeps on flashing. This game does have potential and I love the story line so far but I just cant get passed any more. I am extremely dissapointed in Ubisoft, the game has been our for a fair few months now but the PC version is complete crap. Either get this on a PS4 or Xbox One, or dont get it at all.
