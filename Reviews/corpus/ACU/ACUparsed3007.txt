Hi,To everybody with a medium config Pc or lower who can run Assasins Creed Black flag with 26 Fps and think that it will be as good in Unity do not buy it I just waisted 59.99 euros today my recommended config that they say on steam isnt enough to run the game higher then 17 fps even in the menu so dont buy it or buy a ps4 with a good tv.Ubisoft you guys are disapointing in all the bugs I already saw on ps4 and the biggest WAIST of money ever made!!!!!!!!!!!! !
