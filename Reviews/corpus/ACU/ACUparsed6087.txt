DO NOT GET THIS GAME. I am a personal fan of the Assasins Creed Series and I was very much looking forward to this, game but I get this whatever you may want to call it. I have an alienware m14x running a GT 750m geforce ready driver and I can play the game but only if i play on the lowest graphics and turn my resolution down to the point where the game looks so awful it isnt even worth playing. Ubisoft you have failed me.
