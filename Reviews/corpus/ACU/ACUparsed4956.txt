Cant even play it.  I thought I would give it a shot even though Black Flag broke my GPU from overheating it so much and giving it so much stress, but no it literally is so poorly optimized that I dont think any amount of patches will significantly help.  Hopefully next time an Assassins Creed game comes out, Ill be smarter and not get it on PC because everyone has been terribly optimized.
