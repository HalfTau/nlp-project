A truly next gen experience. Everything from graphics, animations, voice acting and sound is absolutely amazing!The story itself is good and enjoyable but its focused more on the main characters selfish needs of redemption and love and leaves the Assassins Brotherhood in the shadows which is a disappointment.Like previous games in the franchise there is a lot of content that will have you spending close to 100 hours if you aim for 100 sync.Despite its flaws its a great game that is enjoyable from beginning to end.
