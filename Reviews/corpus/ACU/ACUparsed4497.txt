DO.NOT.BUY.Unity is by far the WORST AC game ever made and I doubt they will continue the series after this massive flop.Not only the game is a buggy mess that WILL melt your computer and make you have to force reboot whenever it crashes  because the game makes your GPU crash , not only the application itself  with little to no optimization 2540 fps on a GTX 670 with a intel i7 , it also has NO redeeming qualities at all.Combat sucks. The AI is dumber than it ever was in any AC game and will lose sight of you from 3 meters away behind a barrel. The parkour is choppy and unintuitive. Coop is awful and laggy , and other players will make you lose rewards by rushing in like gigantic idiots because they dont know you lose points from being spotted.The story is awful and predictable. Characters have no personality and names are thrown in with no cohesion at all, and now apparently Alexandre Dumas was a war hero.Without a single doubt the worst game of the year. If you really want to play it , download it from a torrent, but DONT PAY A CENT for this piece of crap. There is NO incentive to play online , because the game is basically a pay to unlock .Youd  rather have everything unlocked from a crack than play any coop mission, trust me.
