This game seems really good but I have not actually gotten the chance to play it yet because I cannot get past the first 30 minutes of gameplay because of me getting 1015 fps even on a pretty decent rig. These are the things thatme off about ubisoft. I thought Ubisoft could get it together in this but as usual, I was wrong. The optimization on this game is terrible. I am getting 15 fps when all the setting in game and the settings in the nvidia contol panel are low and this is unnacceptable. Next time I will think twice about buying a product from Ubisoft.
