Lovely story, Lovely graphics, and weapons and outiftting is just fantastic.Too bad its ABSOLUTELY UNPLAYABLE.On a laptop that has a i7 7700HQ and a GTX 1070 This should be no problem.Of course optimization is bad so 5070 fps is to be expected.  But thats not what makes it unplayable.what makes it unplayable, is the damn fact that it crashes EVERY 510 MINUTES.screw you ubisoft I want my money backinsert anger face here
