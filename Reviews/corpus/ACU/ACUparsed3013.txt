Ive played this game not long after it was released, and i was very disappointed. Performance was horrible, bugs on every step ... so i gave up on it despite its outstanding gameplay and good story.I started playing it again recently thinking that by now there had to be some updates released to fix what needs to be fixed and i have to say i was pleasantly surprised.Game runs smoothly and i havent come across any serious bug so far. Just to say, i am running it on same machine as before.So, its a shame game wasnt released in this current condition, that way game could have been even better by now.
