So, I wrote a bad review when I first made it, but I said in it, that if I played the game later that I would edit anything I disagreed with later on. Well now is later. The game is fun. I realize my mistake, saying that the combat is too hard. It really isnt. A challenge is good. The story seems fresh, but I will edit if I change my mind. The parkour is the best AC has had yet, the combat is hard but fun, the customization adds a mechanic that was unseen before Unity, but will be picked up in Syndicate, and overall the game feels fun and fluid. Although, I will say that Arnos special hidden blade mechanic feels too familiar to the throwing knives from other ACs. Most everybody got a special hidden blade ability past Altair, Ezio got his double hidden blade/poison hidden blade, and more during the Ezio trilogy, Connor got his hidden blade that could unhinge to become more of a handheld knife, mainly used for skinning, I dont think Edward got anything correct me if Im wrong, and so on. Arno just gets this projectile thats silent and can instakill people. Sounds an awful lot like throwing knives.
