Overall  This game rocked.  I loved every minute, and Im still playing it.  Story, graphics, controls, immersion  I was truly addicted and couldnt stop.  The game was gorgeous, fun to play, and really took the AC franchise to the next level.  Rather than rehashing the same old mechanics and game infrastructure  they took the time to recreate this game for the Next Gen from the ground up  and it shows.  I would absolutely recommend this game.When I booted this little  up, I was skeptical.  From the reviews, I expected the worst game of the series.  I was concerned that the AC series had run its course.  I was very happily mistaken.From my very first minute ingame until now, I am blown away by the game  both its improvements, and what theyve kept.Graphically, this game is astounding.  Climbing atop a roof in Paris for the first time and seeing the sun glinting off beautifully rendered Parisian rooftops as my cloak flowed realistically behind me, I realized I was playing a piece of art.Controlswise, this game is 70 improvement, 30 regression.  The control scheme has been tweaked to give the player more control over where he/she goes, and how.  You can now very easily parkour your way DOWN, something new in this series, and it really improves the gameplay.  I did experience a bit of nonresponsiveness and some glitching which could be annoying, but it wasnt nearly frequent enough to impact my enjoyment of the game.Story, loved it.  Ive seen some bad reviews of this games story, and Im not sure why.  I thought the characters were interested and well developed.  I noticed growth and character development as the story progressed, and I felt connected to the characters, and affected by their tragedies.  We also got the first real peak into the culture and inner workings of the Brotherhood since AC1, which I really loved.
