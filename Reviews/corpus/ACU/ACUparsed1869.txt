Dont bother.Paris is amazing, best city since Florence.But the good in the game stops there. And also the city is non very good to play. In black flag and rogue getting the animus shard is minichallenge. Here is just a way to waste your time and pollute the map.Honestly the fact that the dlc provide a reduced play time time saver packs, money packs, you are better off just not playing it.Try rogue instead, not visually stunning but balanced gameplay that is never tiresome.
