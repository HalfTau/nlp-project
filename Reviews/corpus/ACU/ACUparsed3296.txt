Honestly, I am a fan of the Assassins Creed series, but I would not recommend this game to anyone for multiple reasons. Unless you have a gaming computer, the graphics are terrible and the fps is low. I gave a gaming desktop with an Nvidia 900 series card and still cant play with max graphics. The ending is terrible and leaves you with nothing fun to do when the main story is finished. This took up 45 Gigs on my computer and wasnt so great. The only good thing about this game is that it gives you many choices of customization like weapons and clothing.
