Not playable in its current state. Character cannot move for more than a few seconds before the game freezes for about 20 seconds sounds still playing in the background. Cut scenes are the same, when they start you get 20s of audio before you see any action on the screen.When the game runs its beautiful, but the game is in beta at the moment so I will wait a month or so for the developers to finish writing it before I attempt to play it.
