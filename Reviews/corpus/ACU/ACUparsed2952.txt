Im going to have to disagree with many and say that Assassins Creed Unity is one of the best Assassins Creed developed to date. From its outstanding sound quality to immersive world to welcomed new gameplay mechanics, this game is beautifully well done.Yes it has bugs and not well optimized for PC and rather predicable story but that is all its negatives.It has the most believable environments where the world actually feels alive with a filled world with lots to do, not just collectibles this time. From its Paris stories which I personally loved, to the murder mysterious which does not hold you by the hand and I hope they keep in future Assassins Creed games, to its enigmas personally did not enjoy, it felt like a boring scavenger world but yet I welcome it as it is different, to its theatre missions, to the Dead Kings outposts and underground exploration, I loved this game.It had the potential for so much more which I was sad they did not utilize but makes me excited for what the future of Assassins Creed beholds.Overall, if you computer can play it, it is a must play.
