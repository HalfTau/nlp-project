Well, I wrote a review for this last year and it was very VERY negetive. Overall, I felt as though I had been robbed because despite meeting requirements, the game was epic slow on my computer, and there were a ton of game breaking bugs. Naturally, I posted and didnt play the game until a year later.Ill tell you what, if i had gotten to play this product when it was first released, I would have given it a glowing review. With an updated system, better fps both due to developers working with the engine and a new computer on my part, and no gamebreaking bugs as of yet, I am now happy with my purchase.Thanks Ubisoft for stepping up your game and fixing some of the huge problems with this, it really reflects well on you. There are a lot of groups that would have left it broken.Now if youll all excuse me, I have to jump down 11 stories and stab a guy in the face with some handdaggers...
