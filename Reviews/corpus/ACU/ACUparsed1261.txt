Assassins creed 27 the new beginning, after the events of the only good game Flag of Black we travel to the Land of Baguettes and Croissants, the new custimzation means you can be decked out in the latest neck scarf trends and constantly wear a hood at questionable times of the day, thankfully we never enter the dreaded modern day realm as seen in recent times and instead have to go diving through Nether Portals which is a nice recreation of ubisoft diving into development hell as they try to salvage this series, Id give this game a 1 same as the frames when i load it up
