I realize that most people out there dont have great specs for a machine, but lets be honest, this game is meant to push the boundaries of where gaming can be going graphically. This game is absolutely stunning. I have not had any super noticable framerate issues, no crashes, and no glitches of any kind so far. If you have the rig to run it, this game is pretty great. Have yet to try any of the coop, but Im expecting that to be pretty fun. What I have seen of the story, it seems to be a step above some of the latest title. I can already tell it is going to fit in at 2 right under ACII in terms of story to meHopefully they can get some of the performance stuff tweaked so more people can run this and enjoy it to its full potential.
