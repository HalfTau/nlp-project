Assassins Creed unity has got a hell lot of backlash since its initial buggy release. But i gotta say, 90 of its bugs are fixed. The game is still definitely flawed, with bugs here n there, but its still a very beautiful game. In my opinion its way prettier than Syndicate. Im giving it a thumbs up because its very very playable now, and its a must have for every assassins creed fan out there. Go ahead and buy it. You wont regret.
