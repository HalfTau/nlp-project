Runs flawlessly, zero crashes in the entirety of my playtime and the only glitch Ive seen is an enemy hitting me on a different floor once. Game is patched up pretty damn good and is also pretty damn fun on top of that.EDIT Because people were asking Im on a 780 Ti, i53470, and 16 GB of ram at 1080p. The game is set to max settings on everything except for antialiasing which is on FXAA. Average framrate is around 55 and occasionally goes to around 30 in very high intensity areas.
