The optimization sucks, yeah, but the game is currently riddled with bugs.So far Ive fallen through the world once, CTD twice, and twice now ive gotten stuck in the walls of buildings.There are limited settings aswell, for instance I cant rebind the parkour down button as well as many others.Also, whenever you go into the menu screen the second option is for an estore which allows you to pay for ingame cash. Furthermore the first and only chest I tried to unlock said I needed the AC companion app to open it not sure how that works.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag at this point is more enjoyable than this, and thats a little depressing...This is the worst launch of an Assassins Creed game I have ever experienced, Until this is fixed I do not recommend a buy.
