It worked for the first three hours. but when trying to do swan leap the character just jumps down reguardless of where it is.Also why can you not change the controls of the leap when pretty much everything else is customisable?if you have bought this horrific example of unity  well about average for unity charging too much for rubbish.please make a small trench and then put your expectations 3 feet 90CM below it.I hate it!also it stops working after 3 hours of gameplay for me.
