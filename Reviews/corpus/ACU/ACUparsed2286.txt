I havent gotten a chance to play it because its not runnable. Plus the Uplay is to confusing. I also accidently put the code I got from Uplay to a different acount. No I have to ing return the game, after that I am going to redownload it and put the code it gives me to my other acount, which is also my PSN acount. So I can TRY play it on my PS3. Because, you cant ing withdraw money from steam! YOU STEAM! YOU UPLAY! MY LIFE!
