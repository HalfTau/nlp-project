Ubisofts online system for Unity has been down since last year. Unity crahes and Uplay saves are corrupted if this happens while the game is saving. You have to backup the Ubisoft save folder Progam files x86 before the crash or the game starts from the begining again and any saves left in Ubisoft save folder maybe corrupt after crash. Constaly backing up your saves files to another folder every minute sucks or replaying hours of gameplay because you dont have a recent backup sucks.Changing Uplay save system to a curruptible one via updates is . All the Assassins Creed games are now affected, and online services for the game dont work as they have been fixing the for many months so they say.Only worth purchasing on special for 5 or less, unless you love broken save systems, replaying the game from the very start often or replaying parts if your latest backup of your saves wasnt 30 seconds ago. The only unstable game that still crashes a year after release and many updates which havent fixed the problem, they actually made it worse with new corrupt saves feature.Story wise it fails to draw you in and is generally a very crap story with very long seperations between story progress. Ubisoft also removed the whistle from haystack or hiding spot feature and replaced it with fire crackers you must buy and throw on the ground. Stealth gameplay not as good as previous games and gear loadout is pretty poor and unbalanced for a large part of the game. Just another grind game without any immersion, flair or substance. Very weak in comparrison to previous games in the series.They just dumped a fair chunk of the original story line, but there is a lot of French history during the revolution and some guillotining. Gameplay fairly repetitive.7/10 maybe, 1/10 for the online support
