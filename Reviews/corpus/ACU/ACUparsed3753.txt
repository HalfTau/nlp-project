If you can actually get past uplay and your computer doesnt melt and the game runs on more than 1 fps and it loads textures more than 10 meters from you ,you can kinda see how great this game couldve been. The game is playable but it just doesnt look good as I said you can see what they tried to do and how it was supposed to look but it fails somewhere along the way .However at a 33 discount its worth buying.
