Hello, this game is fantastic. I personaly have no issue with it, it runs fine maxed out  I still wouldnt mind further patches and such to improve on ot  It does have few bugs and pop up issues, but I am confident most of it will be fixed.The game is gorgeous, theres at tone of missions and side quest.On a more negative tone, I wishwould work, uplay rewards are still lock although I purchased them in the uplay rewards screen and I dislike very much to be forced to play a phone app to get equipement for the game or that I have to play coop to get also equipement...I recommend the game and it will only get better with futur updates and hotfixes.Cheers.
