I suck with reviewsIm a huge fan of the Assassins Creed series, but amazingly enough, the developers are running it into the ground.The last AC game I thoroughly enjoyed was Assassins Creed 2But with these yearly Call of Dutyesque releases the series is becoming less and less interesting.And more and more infuriating as you can tell from the many reviews of Unity.Ubisoft.Stop. And listen to your fans.Put your fans first before listening to the jingling pockets of investors that only want to make a quick buck.And fixing MicroTransactions before fixing game breaking issues is just sad.The audacity to even announce it as an update. Jesus.Its really insulting.
