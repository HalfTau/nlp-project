I played an hour of this game and it has crashed 6 times, you think a game would work 3 years after release and after the hate it got for being so borked, i guess they dont care lmao, sucks because i had it for the ps4 at release and it ran smoothly... another  pc port. 1 HOUR OF GAMEPLAY AND IT HAS CRASHED 6 TIMES I WILL FIND U UBISOFT AND I WILL END YOU RIGHTLY... this game is good behind the fact that it crashes quicker than it takes for a pizza pocket to cook. NEVER BUY
