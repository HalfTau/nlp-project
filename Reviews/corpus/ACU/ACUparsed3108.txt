I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this one however after reading so many reviews about horrific performance and the crazy 69 price tag I decided to wait.  Hoping that the price would come down and also that they would fix the game.  Well the price came down to a reasonable level however they havent fixed the game.After playing through the first sequence with absolute horrible performance and by far the worse glitching videos I have ever seen I hit AltF4 with total disgust.  I tried changing the settings many many times restarting over and over with no effect.By FAR the WORSE game I have purchased on Steam to date.
