Okay, seriously, this is a new low. And Im not talking about performance issues which are horrific, Im not talking about DRM, microtransactions and all other stuff. Im not even infuriated about the lack of english language in my regional version. Well, I am, sort of, but only because the preorder clearly stated that all languages are included.And suddenly after the purchase it isnt, and few hours later store page is updated to reflect this issue.THIS.IS.ING.FRAUD.So Ive been trying to resolve this with technical support of Ubi since release, aaaaand you guessed right! Basically, their answer is You can go  yourself, we took your money, we owe you nothing. Additionally I must mention that support took their time responding. After first response We cant help you, go talk to Valve and me catching them on their  publisher admins store page, not Valve they waited WHOLE MONTH even more, 34 days to be exact to just copypase another We cant help you, go  yourself.It really amuses me. The price of changing one digital copy for another for a company is a ing ZERO. Yet their support wastes time writing meaningless And worst of all there is no other channel of communication. No phone number, no address though they have regional office, but its superduper secret, so I cant even make a complaint about their horrible support.You know what, Ubi? Ive had enough of your I will never ever pay even a single cent for you game, no matter how good it will be. Go  yourself  thats my answer. I was a loyal customer for years, Ive tolerated your lazy development, bugs and stuff. Buton me and saying its raining? You must be really delusional to think youre doing good job. More importanly I will tell every person I know, every friend, every fellow online, when it comes to any of Ubi games, and the person wants to know whether its good, should he buy it my answer will be short Hell no.
