Assassins creed unit i snt the most optimized of the collection but if you choose the right settings it runs fine.Hell i ran it with out an issue on my old gtx660 1.5gb card, on the new gtx1070 g1 gaming it runs like a dream on 2560x1080.Some of the older assassins creed games had more nostalgia but this version hung onto the core values of what made the games great.Worth buying.
