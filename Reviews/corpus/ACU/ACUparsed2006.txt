This game is realy nice.But there are still some annoying bugs. The Story is just okay not interesting enough like the others AC games. but i realy liked the transition from AC Rouge to AC Unity, its was great. The Graphic is realy awesome, but the optimization for the PC version is not good.There are some FPS drops. The Combat system is a bit uncomfortable, but i realy liked the new abilities.And the option to heal your self is realy great. The character customization is realy cool, and refreshing i realy like it.In general, AC Unity have great potential, its a good game, but not good enough like the other games.If the develepoers had more time to spend in this game, it could be one of the best AC in the series.I will recommend this game, for AC fans.
