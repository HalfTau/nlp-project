Purchasing this game would be a grave mistake. If they actually decide to work on it, and make it better, then maybe itll be worth 10 bucks. Youre better off buying I Am Toast for that 10 dollars actually. Youll get just as much frustration from a game that is meant to be frustrating, compared to this piece of trash. There has been no efforts to make the game better, even with these updates. They still have problems with even keeping save profiles. The first time I started this game, a was 2 sequences away from beating it. Then the next time I log in, no save. Have to start a new. So what do I do? I start the game up again, get past the long, stupid, god forsaken intro, become an assassin, AGAIN, then a few weeks later, sign back on, and wouldnt you know it, I have to start over AGAIN. This game is and it deserves every single  review it gets.I will never buy any assassins creed games anymore, I will not supportgames. Dont even tell them whats wrong with the games, because they dont listen anyways.
