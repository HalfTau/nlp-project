Even though AC is an yearly release franchise, and to be honest AC IV is not exactly what Im looking for, I gotta say, AC Unity is freaking awesome, and totally fresh. The graphic, the setting, the atmosphere is perfect, the characters is well done, the story, although predictable is still pretty good. And I didnt even experience any frame drop, and hardly any glitches at all. Overall, this is definitely the best AC game  for me at least
