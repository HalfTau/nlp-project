I bought the game some time after its release so I didnt catch even a single bug through the entire playthrough.  For me, the game was actually great, the second best title in the series in my opinion.  AC Unity is seriously underrated so dont mind much how people reacted immediately after the release.  I would say that it is definitely a much, much better game than Syndicate.
