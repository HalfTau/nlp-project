Initially, I was worried that this game might not run well on my PC after having read so many negative reviews. However, after having tried out the game for myself, it wasnt as bad as I had expected. In fact, its similar to many games ported to PC on their release day. With minor glitches such as missions getting stuck or stuttery problems, it does affect the overall gaming experience. Its also disappointing that with my rig, I can only play on high settings to achieve 2050fps.  Looking back, Assassins Creed Revelations, 3 and Black Flag had similar issues too on their release.My PC Specs Intel i73770k 3.50ghz, geforce gtx 780, RAM 8GB.. And an SSD, not sure whichAs for the gaming experience, I like the fact that the mechanics have reverted slightly back to Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood. The medicine system instead of health regeneration and stupider Guard AIs have always made the game more enjoyable to me.Oh yes, the map is way too huge. If you like it big.Get the game, theyll fix this soon just like their previous games.UPDATE Patch 4 seems to give mixed feedbacks. For me, Patch 4 was horrible, I now experience constant stuttering in game. Truly a disappointment.
