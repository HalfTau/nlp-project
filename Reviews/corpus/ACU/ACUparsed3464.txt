brilliant game, yes it can be slightly glitchy every now and then. But you can find bugs/glitches in all games if you look hard enough. Peopl moaning abou fps, need to look at what the system requirements say that the minimum and recommended is. Cause Im running i7 with a 970 and I play on highest possible graphics on a 4k monitor. If you have bad frames, it means you need to either delete the porn on your computer and start from fresh and go out and buy an actual good computer... and by computer I mean desktop not laptop.
