At the sight of all these bad reviews, I feel like giving my opinion on what I think is the best Assassins Creed since Brotherhood.First things first  Paris is huge, magnificent, full with stuff to do and to see. I live in Paris myself and even discovered a few locations I didnt know about.I like the story and how it is told. Its something that was completely off with the latest ACs  the story telling was completely off and it was just annoying.I, for one, hated all of the present phases, which are completely absent from that episode, so it makes it even more appreciable for me.Yes, the game needs a very high end rig which I have to run smoothly. But were at that period of time in between two generation of consoles where games evolve and it will take some time for the average PC to be in par with what those new consoles can do. Yet I completely agree that the developpers COULD optimize the game much better. They just never do, just deal with it.And with all graphics parameters maxed out, the game looks gorgeous.I didnt meet any really handicaping bugs. NPCs sometimes do weird stuff, but with so much of them on the streets, can you really blame them ? Again, comparing with older episodes, it seems to be much improved Im looking at you, AC 3...All in all, excellent game, that will best be experienced with a high end PC, but that doesnt surprise me, nor does it bother me.
