This game has a huge difficulty gap compared to the previous Assassins Creed games.It is much harder. I couldnt even get past the first level where I had to click New Game on the Main Menu. It wasnt even an assassination. The lag monster made me lose and crashed my game.11/10 Ubisoft would play again
