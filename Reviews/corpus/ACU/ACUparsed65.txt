Havin a great time playing this for the story. Overall its great and the combat mechanic isnt that hard, but isnt easy either and its a classic French combat style base on the animations obviously imo. Another props to those gorgeous interiors of every household/mansion/landmarks in the game. Theres also a lot of things to do like customization, heist, coop or assassination contracts. The parkour animations is just S W E E T 3 !Though on the side note, the game is a little bit of poorly optimized on pc. I have encountered like 5 bugs/glitches in the game especially during the campaign story so I have to restart the checkpoint or the memory it self. The online coop is pretty much like dead? though ive played with a fellow assassin once in a random heist but after that, I cant find any more people doing coop online searching for coop takes a lot longer so I do coop/heist by solo.About the DLC after the story called Dead Kings, It would turned out so great if the writers kinda make the story more interesting cus i feel like the DLC is just another way of redeeing the unity in the first place after its release, but who knows.Anyways thats my opinion  8/10 would play again for the story Note you dont need any other dlcs.
