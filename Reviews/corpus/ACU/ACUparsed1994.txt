Looks pretty but plays badly.The lighting is fantastic, the ambience feels right. But the game is just too glitchy.Lets not mention the crash and freeze I encontered, just the flaws from design point.There is a memory sequence called the Dead Kings DLC, it happens to be near location of a very early memory sequence. Therefore, when I finished the nearby memory sequence, I got into this one. Turns out, it should be played at much later stage, because enemies will basically onetwo shot you.Its simple, just leave the sequence, right? WRONG, there is no way to leave this sequence unless you finish couple missions!JUST Google how to leave dead kings and you will find that many many people fell into this trap. What the hell were they thinking? are they forcing people to find invincible hacks? or make people stuck so the play time is longer?Countless glitches  design flaw  worst AC Ive ever played.
