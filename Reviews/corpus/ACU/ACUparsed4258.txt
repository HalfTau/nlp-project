I do love the assassins creed franchise, but I cannot recommend this game. It was never ready to be launched and the post support has stopped with limited improvement to the game overall since launch. The story never pulled me in and I felt there was limited freedom in what I could do in this game. It is a however a technical step forward for the franchise, but I dont think that makes it a good game in its own right. Play Black Flag or Rouge you will have more fun.
