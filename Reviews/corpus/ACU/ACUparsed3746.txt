Okay this game is getting some bad reviews. However I do not think this game is bad. Ill agree that you need a pretty good pc to run it. But the game itself isnt bad. Yes there are some bugs, I have not come across many but I have experienced a few. The story isnt great either but the latest Assassins Creed games did not have very good stories, so people cant blame this game alone. After youve played for an hour or so and youve learned how the game plays, you can start exploring Paris, which is really cool. Paris is huge and you have a lot of things you can do. Coop missions, random events and a ton of other cool stuff, are some of the things you can keep yourself busy with. The customization in this game is great. You can choose between many different clothings. You can also buy color so you can make the character dress like a rainbow. There are a lot of different weapons in this game, from swords to axes even rifels. Obisoft also made a great decision putting stealth into the game. Now you can sneak around without being seen. The graphics in this game are really good. Standing on a high point and looking out on Paris is beautiful. Huge open world Great customization Stealth Coop Graphics/ The story Bugs
