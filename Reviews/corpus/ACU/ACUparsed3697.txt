This game is worth nothing, Ubisoft again wants to make money quick...and here it is! I have never seen a game that has so many bugs and errors...it is very frustating as a player to be bother by that kind of negligence from the makers of this game. Ubisoft you stink... and if you keep on selling us game like this one that never properly worked from day one...well you just lost a good customer and mostly a loyal customer. I am fed up with your casual disregard towards your fans and customers. Enough is enough I dont want to have another frustrating year like last year, playing your games and having to deal with bugs after bugs....no mas!
