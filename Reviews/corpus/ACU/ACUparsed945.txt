 It took the game like 5 minutes for the first crash. It took me 2 days to forget about that fact then started it one more time  game crashes again, so did my motivation but as i am used to technical suffering during ubisofting i gave it another try the green screen is hitting me like a punch in the face and tears my hope apart pc doesnt start anymore, smells like hell, well i asume hell smells a little scorched, so did my pc thought i was dead, was like half an hour in a sort of twilight zone cause i didnt know if my 1200 pc was ash and dust RX 480 dances with the devil and seems to be on fire as i touch it newest driver yes blabla luckely pc was alive and after dispairingly checking everything for damage it starts again right click, delete game breathYou think, well, this time ubisoft doesnt ctrlc ctrlv, this time will be different, it happend over and over again, but this time will be different, and its just coincidence that the game crashes..NOUBISOFT...if you listen closely while you say the word ubisoft you can actually hear it...u..be..suff..eringDid i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?
