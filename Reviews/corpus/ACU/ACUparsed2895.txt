This game is not ready yet. I feels like its been tested on a super computer by the military and was given options and proformaces that only that computer can do at a steady fps. I cant even play this because after the first cutscene in the game It CRASHES. It always CRASHES there for no reason. Right now I dont recomend the game. It has been months since this was out and Id expect the problmes to be delt with by that time but no. Its like the astethics and art and graphics were all done and the programming and setting were seavirly rushed and extremly poor.
