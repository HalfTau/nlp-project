Do you think your monitor would look better with a hole in it? Do you think your newly built computer can handle every game on the market? Are you on antipsychotic meds that make life seem dull but yearn to have something spice up your life? Well, there is good news! You can have all these things if you buy Assassins Creed Unity! Be in awe as you mysteriously travel underground into the magnificent underground white dome to which you will fall into oblivion, never to return to the hustle and bustle of Paris. This game will bring you into the story of a young lad whos hair will mysteriously change colors, or will run in one direction then simultaneously into another direction making you fail your missions in haste! Much like the guillotines of the French Revolution, you will lose your mind as you attempt to make your way through the spontaneous NPCs that will block your path with no remorse.Unlike many Assassins Creed releases of the past, Unity offers many heartracing, brainblending moments in which you will begin to question your view on life itself. Unity will push you into bringing every aspect of your life into philosophical conundrums, hoping that you could perhaps one day witness a multimillion dollar gaming empire release a game with more optimization than a governments forceful placement of mandatory health insurance.In all seriousness, this game could have been a great step forward in the right direction for Ubisoft and Assassins Creed. However, due to poor optimization amongst other reasons, Unity has failed to impress on multiple levels. Hopefully a patch or likely a series of patches will solve the issues that many are experiencing, but for now, Unity is a bust.EDIT 11/27  Even after the third patch, the game will still not run correctly with overclocked recommended hardware.
