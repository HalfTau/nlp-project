Finally, after all thethis games been through, its playable.I personally have really enjoyed the game as an Assassins Creed title, even though it didnt feature any new awesome mechanics like black flag did. As far as performance is concerned, I managed to keep a stable 60 fps at all times except cutscenes, when it dropped to around 45 and have had NO frame drops. Also seen surprisingly few bugs while playing it, apart from some dodgy climbing spots. Finally can reccomend it !!!!
