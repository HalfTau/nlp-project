The game is buggy, and still has random crashes that havent been fixed yet. Considering the price you haveto pay for this, if youve played the previous AC games it doesnt feel inovative or like theyve brought anything new to the genre. The main storyline seemed captivating at first, but since I cant complete it due to the fact that the game continously crashes whenever I try to Continue on my previous save I cannot say whether or not the game is worth playing through, but it is definitively not worth the price you haveto pay for it. The whole thing seems like a major ripoff as contentwise theyve done nothing new from previous games but add some coop content and make a new buggy main story.Last time Ill buy anything Ubisoft untill it has already been out for well over a year, and dropped atleast 50 in price. Feels like I bought a new cellphone for full price, and it turns out it was only a cool case with nothing in it...
