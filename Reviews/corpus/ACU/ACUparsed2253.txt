Its running better than it used to, but there are two main gripes. One, is the camera is too close most of the time. Especially in combat, where you need to focus on multiple enemies, but all you can see is the guy in front of you. The second criticism is that a lot of info in the game isnt really taught. Its one thing to increase the difficulty, but its another to not tell the player something, and then continuously press X to die.
