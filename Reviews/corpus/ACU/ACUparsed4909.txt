A LETTER FROM UBISOFTDear Assassins Creed Fans,We know and aknowledge how much you have been wanting the Assassins creed games to be more challenging, with more versatile combat and less counter kill repetition. Loyal Consumers, we have your salvation! It comes with a twist. Intead of changing gameplay mechanics to aid with your requests, we have strived to challenge you in a new way. What makes Unity more challenging than other Assassins creed games is how in the heat of battle against low level enemies, they still provide challenge due to the fact that you are constantly treading through a thick swamp of glitches and framerate drops to below 10 fps. The camera angle will almost never show your Assassin and you will always be in the dark when fighting those evil templars. How does that sound for a challenge? We hope that you will enjoy Unity with as much enthusiasm and dedication as we put fourth into optimizing it.Love,Ubisoft MontrealEDIT The recent updates HAVE IMPROVED the quality of the game bit it is still far from where it needs to be. Just ran into a glitch that required me to reatart the game and i felt that this edit was necessary.
