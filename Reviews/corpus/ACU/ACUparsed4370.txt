Clearly BI soft tried to go back to the original Assassins Creed style. Too bad they brought back the boredom of the first game too... This game is huge and pretty nice if you have a decent computer but very, very repetitive. The commands are sometimes very strange with Arno not doing what you want him to do. Then you get an update with items you cant buy unles you purchase another overpriced DLC not available anyway at this time go figure.So no, I feel like being ripped off once again by UBI soft...
