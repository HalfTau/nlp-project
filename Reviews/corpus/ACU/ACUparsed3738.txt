I couldnt even play. It was about at 1 FPS and the contrast in the menu was so high I managed to just click things until my game started. I dont even think you can call this a game. It is a big steaming pile ofwith wrapping paper.Edit 3 months later and I still cannot play due to low FPS and a high contrast menu I can not use. I have a gaming rig btw I can run more demanding games easily 60 FPSAnother Edit Still unable to play due to problems above. Ubisoft just wants money I guess. 60  mistake I will never make again.
