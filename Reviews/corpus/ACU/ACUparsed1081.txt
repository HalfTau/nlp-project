I have played every main Assassins Creed game so far and can safely say that this one is by far the worst.I dont mind the story and I really like the customisation but what I cannot stand is the buggy combat enimies lounging from 5 meters away and constant guard aimlock, unresponsive movement climbing buildings and jumping in another direction randomly and sometimes to your death and maybe most of all VERY poor performance dropping to unplayable framerates with GTX 970, i5 4690 while other AC titles I got an easy 60 FPS. There are also a whole array of other bugs that make the game so frustrating to play.I HIGHLY reccomend all other AC games I have never played Syndicate bar this one.
