Great game IMO. I have played most of the Assasins Creed series games and to me this is about as good as any. My only complaint is that most of the side quests are rather repetitve and boring. Controling Arno is quite easy jumping from roof to roof, almost too easy. There is not a high amount of skill needed for fighitng or manuvering your character. The game does require some smarts though, using stealth really pays off and in some cases you cannot accomplish your task without it.The story, voice acting, graphics, sound, and overall presentation is top notch. I got a good 50 hours of entertainment out of playing the main questline, a few side quests, and liberating all of the taverns. If you liberate the taverns early like I did then you have plenty of money from income to buy your equipment. Some of the previous games like Black Flag come across more open world because of the travel by sea. In this game you only travel by carriage to two different cities in France, but most takes place in Paris. The city of Paris is rendered amazingly in this game and walking the streets make you feel like you are there. The surround sound in 5.1 is great. If you like good stories and a challenge for your mind then you will like this game.
