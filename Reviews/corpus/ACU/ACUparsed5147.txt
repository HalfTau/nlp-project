NEW REVIEW Over two years later, Im giving this another shot. The occansional bug still, but it seems to run rather well this time around.Story didnt quite grip me like some other AC games, but Paris felt more alive than ever and the combat and running are pretty smooth once you get used to them. The game feels way too crowded with things to do and missions, but some are fun.In the end, I had fun this time around, and thats enough for me to recommend it now. If only it came out this way to begin with.OLD REVIEW The way this game is right now, it is pretty much unplayable. At least wait for a patch that fixes the crippling framerate issues and bugs if you want to buy this game.Releasing a game with this many bugs and problems is unacceptable.
