Let me start off by saying I can neither recommend or not recommend this game. It is because of the books. I read them, usually first and the storylines within them are so perfectly crafted and brilliant that they get me hooked. Because of this I play the games. The reason I couldnt play Unity however is because the story telling within the game is terrible in comparison to the book and I found myself getting annoyed at it. Because of this I stopped playing.
