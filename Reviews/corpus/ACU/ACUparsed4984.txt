ProsIt is AC. The gameplay is decent. Some new sidequestse.g the detective ones are well designed.ConsPoor optimisation  wait for a patch.Requires wasting time on a rather stupid mobile game to unlock some of the content. That game is not even AC  it is just a poor mans spot and touchathon.Some missions have poorly placed checkpoints. The difficulty is not higher or lower than previous AC games, but due to that, those parts feel like a chore.I expect all of these problems from indie gamesexcept the mobile app crap. Not from a major developer like Ubisoft.
