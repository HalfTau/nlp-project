Ok so. I love the series . I do recommend this game, but not yet.That out of the way. . . what the hell is this ? Its clearly not finished . I paid 60 for this and from the first minutes of the game it freezes every now and then for a couple of seconds I have a pretty good gaming computer , so I set up settings accordingly, I even tried Lowering the settings to the bare minimum and freezes and some jumping occurs. Then I jump onto the bar to hang from and the character just appears to be standing in mid air and not moving, its not frozen , i can still move the camera around, but not the character... Please FIX this . Oh and in the future please do a better job testing it and polishing the product before release . Better to miss your dead line and release it a month or two later than have a ton ofcustomers/fans .Thank you
