The game is running smoothly now with my current pcs specs..Previously i said the game badly glitched because of my overclocking profile, thats not it. The fault was I forgot to plug the ez plug cable on my asus motherboard because im using 3 graphic cards which needs more power, by plugging the ez plug cable, my graphic cards have sufficient power now..
