The story isnt perfect, but its fun. I like the revised mechanics, and it looks good.Ubisoft fixed all of the bugs, now it runs just fine.The only thing thats actually wrong with this game is Ubisofts insistence on microtransactions.If you like the series, its worth playing. Its fun, and thats what really matters.A lot of the flack this game recieved is about small, nitpicky things, or about the releasewhich was botched entirely at the fault of Ubisoft. I think they learned their lesson, and a messed up release isnt a good enough reason not to play.
