Either Ubisoft is lazy or they had some dense people working on this game and optimizing it. The optimzation sucks and not on just PC, but across the charts on PS4 and Xbox one, which is suffering the most. Like many people, when Ubisoft posted the system requirments I thought my rig was outdated and weak. Rest assured its safe to say it isnt your rig. In fact any decent gaming rig should be able to play this, but the reasoning to why Ubisoft set the system requirments so high is so that they can make up for their utterly terrible and lazy job at optimizing this game. I love the franchise, but this is just complete and utter garbage. The programmers and everyone who contributed to ACU is comparable to that of a brain dead person confined to a hospital bed. Ubisoft should not be proud of the release of Assassins Creed Unity. There are numerous bugs to be fixed Ive come across at least 4  5. Even in the other reviews down below a person with 16gb of ram, i74770k and a 980 can barley get this game to run 40fps. ACU is not worthy of the asking price from Ubisoft. In fact it isnt worthy of a price at all!
