When I first picked up Assassins Creed Unity, I was hopeful that all of the firstday complaints were just angry people who couldnt run the game. Im not saying that Ive got a beastly computer, but Ive got a decent one. I run every other game I have on maximum settings, such as Borderlands 2, AC Black Flag, Shadow of Mordor, etc, no loss of framerate. Then this thing comes along. I had to lower my settings quite drastically for it to be playable. I was still praying that it was only temporary. Then, the main reason why I bought this game, to FINALLY PLAY ASSASSINS CREED COOP A seemingly dream come true. was completely held from me. This feature, essentially the only reason I bought the game, is still not working, and Im done with Unity. Unfortunately, there is no way to get my money back. Do not buy this game until Ubisoft learns to keep its promises.
