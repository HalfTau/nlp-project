While the recreation of Paris is really impressive, the stealth gameplay isnt really well done and the game still has visible bugs. NPC behaviour is often buggy. Also, the templar/assassin story becomes dull and superficial. It feels like it has been added as an afterthought and made for the largest customer base, looking more like a Superman story than a philosophical meditation as in the first AC games. More and more, the AC series are becoming mainstream and the gameplay shows its limits...The game is decent, but I would recommend something with a more refined  and tactical gameplay and a more mature/original story such as Metal Gear Solid V.
