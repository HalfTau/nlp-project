Ive played every Assassins Creed game up until this point, and simply put, this is NOT an Assassins Creed game. Not even close. Without any doubt the first.... easily two hours of gameplay had me utterly lost. I was completely disinterested in the entire storyline before the freaking credits even rolled, which might I point out, is nearly an hour of fluffy, pointless gameplay that involves sneaking around guards to get into a party, flirting with girls for no apparent reason, stealingfor no apparent reason, and just generally useless filler gameplay. I have never been more disappointed in an AC game until now, and I faithfully worked my way through even AC3 without much complaint, but Im sorry, as AC games go, this is a pure and utter failure. Save your money and wait for Syndicate.
