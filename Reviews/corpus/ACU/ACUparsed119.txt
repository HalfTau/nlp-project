I really like this game! This is the first AC game i have played in the whole series! Everything seem perfect except lots of bugs happened throughout the game and its optimization was very bad! One more thing that i feel very disappointed is EliseArnos girlfriend, she is a mature women, but her action and her emotion were so childish! They could be a great couple, but Elise ruined it all!
