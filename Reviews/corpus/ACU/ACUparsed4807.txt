I was fine with the millions of server problems, bugs, and crashes... but when I was unable to play all day then returned earlier, I got a message saying my save was corrupted and I ahd to start the game over again. WHAT IS THE ING POINT OF ALWAYS BEING ONLINE IF IT DOESNT SAVING MY ING GAME YOU GODDAMN PIECE OFCUNTS FROM UBISOFT. I love assassins creed, but this game is a pile of horsethat ubisoft put out without a goddamn concern for their innocent customers. I love ubisoft in general, but I hope their president and CEO both choke on mechanical bullwhile being anally violated with a lawnmower blade. This is not acceptable for a company of this stature to put out a utterly broken game. They needed to have pushed back the release date so they could at least fix one problem. I absolutely love the idea of the game and many mechanics, but I will never start this game again unless I get 1 my saves back 2 a hand written letter from corporate staff at Ubisoft that offers both an apology and a sloppy  and 3 any form of financial compensation for my wasted money, time, and goddamn stress this smelly pile of scat I was presented with has induced. yourA highly offended and never to return customer
