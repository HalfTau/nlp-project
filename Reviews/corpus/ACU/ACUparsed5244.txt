I do not recommend.First off, the useless optimization, its just like Watch Dogs.Bad FPS on a decent computer and not possible to use AA.And now gameplay.Everything has been simplified, which is not positive for me.For example, climbing now is TOO easy, you just hold WShiftSpacebar and then you can climb any building in the game, without thinking how am im going to get up here?And they have entierly removed the option to carry and push bodies around, which I hate since it removes stealth possibillites.And then also the notoriety seems to be removed, instead you are always little known for the guards, you just stand close to them, they will eventually kill you. Which is very simplified and boring.And to add with the climbing, since there is douzands of ways to get up a building now, its actually hard to get the guy where you want him to go.The HUD for guards detecting you looks very ugly, a square 3D box that is filling up now, it is unfitting for the gamestyle and sometimes hard to see how much filled it is.And another big bad part is the microtransactions. Its now possible to buy yourself into the highest gears within minutes now, for real money of corse.Another simplification is that you can now access and buy new gear/clothes anywhere, its in the ESC menu now, not in shops.Another gameplay related thing I think is stupid is the fact that the Eagle Vision has some kind of short timer and a reload now, you cannot choose when to use it entierly.And same goes for tossing coins, very bad implemented now.It uses the coins as ammo so you dont take it from the currency you have, its simply ammo like arrows or smoke now, so you can use it limited times then you have to refill it at a consumable shop.It also has a 20 second long reload timer after every time you toss the coins, which I hate VERY much.And also, the non existent weapon wheel is totally useless. ONLY way to get through weapons/gadgets now is 123456789 keys, no scroll, no button to hold to get the wheel up, which dissapointed me alot.Whistle? Gone.You cannot attract guards while in a hiding spot in any way now. You can only hope they will magically go to the haystack and happens to look into it for no reason.Combat system drastically changed now, and I dont find it particuarly positive.While going full on attack on a guard, another one can attack you from behind instead of the whatnowwaitingThat is good.But I still find the fights alot slower and boring to engage in now really.Guards can no longer climb at all, so its VERY easy to get away from guards, way too easy really.Now I have only written down bad things, because... I am that type of guy that complains alot, but its still all fact.I know this is not really the kind of review people may want, but I really focus more on the little stuff that is bad with this game.I also wrote all this meanwhile playing, so hence the unformated sections.
