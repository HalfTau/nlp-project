Runs Pretty Well on my pc Gtx 780ti, i7 4790k 4.5Ghz, 16gb ram, getting 5060fps on ultra highthe game itself  is pretty good so far. Arno is much better than the dull as mud Connor, overall not bad despite the regular popins now and again. 810 would recommend if u have the specs to run it, and downloaded the latest nvidia driver.
