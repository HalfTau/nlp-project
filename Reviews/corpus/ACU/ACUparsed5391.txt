NOTE THIS IS A PERFORMANCE REVIEWMy rig is5960x  4000 mhz2 x 780  1440p16 gig ram ddr4  2800MhzPeople are right to say that the game has some issues and gliches, but the game is not broken. I play at high settings  1440p and have 60ish fps. AA at FXAA.  and have no wierd framerate dropsFound out if you change graphic settings ingame you need to restart the game.I have disabled overlay in UPLAY and STEAM and havent had a game crash since. I could only play 10 minutes at a time.As for gameplay.....only time will tell have not played far enough to make an opinon on that
