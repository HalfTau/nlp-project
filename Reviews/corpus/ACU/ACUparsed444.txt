I gotta say, I really enjoy the assassinations in this game. As in, the missions in which you infiltrate X building during X event and assassinate X person. The game forces you to stab them, so you cant shoot them from the building across the street. You can approach the mission in many ways, and sometimes theres a special kill you can do, such as killing and later posing as a person the target was supposed to meet in a confession booth in the Notre Dame cathedral, waiting for them to come and stabbing them inside the booth. I also love the customization, and while the parkour will still betray you every once in a while and make you accidentally reveal yourself to everyone, it is impressive how much freedom of movement there is. I hate how the music is used, the soundtrack is amazing but most of the songs are only played once or twice, and a few are played too often. But most of the time theres no music at all... Still, great game.
