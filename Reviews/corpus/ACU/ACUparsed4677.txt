Awesome game IMO. Ive had a lot of fun since launch.The combat is very engaging and fun. The A.I. has improved since the previous games. If youre not careful they can kill you just as easy as you can kill them.The Parkour system is much improved also. The choice of freerunning up or down really adds to your choices of routes to take while chasing or running away.The progression of your equipment is nice too. Lots of choices and color schemes to unlock and choose from. There are plenty of missions to partake in that are solo and coop and reward you with equipment and currency.The amount of NPCs in this large immersive world and the random reoccurring minievents that happen between the NPCs makes the game feel living. Not to mention the amazing graphics.The Coop in the game is an amazing addition as well. To coordinate assassinations and to take different approaches to your targets is very fun.However, there are plenty of bugs in this game that need patching, none of which I have experienced other than the FPS drops in some cutscenes and UPlay connectivity. My friends have experienced falling through the floor but that has been recently patched. All in all, I do recommend this game. Maybe about a month or so when they iron out some of these bugs.
