More of a rant than a review.The most boring one in the series up till this one. Missions are less varied than the previous titles. Even the detective missions where you investigate a murder, usually involves you running, running, running and murdering dozens. Ending with the culprit, who had a motive, behind bars, while the mass murderer gets a new shiny weapon he can murder with.The storyline isnt all that bad. But I may be biased, Im a sucker for redheads you see.Controls are clunky and unresponsive. Combat has long lock down animations, and goes from time consuming, is it not over yeteasy to rediculus impossible in a blink of an eye. Enemies teleporting, animations not in sync, camera issues doesnt actually help either.The free running has got an upgrade and looks better. But you get stuck on small objects all the time. Running from a group of enemies and you suddenly jumpes half sideways onto a chair, and just sits there like a crow, while you hammer the buttons trying to figure out which direction you must steer for him to respond  thats not my idea of fun.And the popups... those constant messages popping up, obstructing text and hindering you to open the map for a certain time. Why isnt there an option to turn these off?Ive experienced some mission breaking bugs  nothing a reload couldnt fix. But oh boy, is it fun to run those 300 m again.The upgrade system is a complete mess. It tries to make you choose a class of some sort and wants you to play with others so you can support each other. The multiplayer is dead btw. I find it hillarious that you have to upgrade your skills before you know how to sit down on a bench between two people.Despite being a patient persona I dont think Ill be finishing this one. I cant recommend this. Maybe if you are a hardcore fan. I wasnt hardcore enough.
