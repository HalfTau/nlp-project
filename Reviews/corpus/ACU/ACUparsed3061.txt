This game really reminds me more of Assassins Creed II or Brotherhood more so than any other of the newer Assassins Creed recent releases. Honestly I have yet do go very far in the story due to my play style, however the missions and the interaction with the crowd are all enjoyable.In regards to this game being laggy or slow on most machines, I have to assume that patch five fix that problem. I am playing on a system that does not even meet the minimum requirements and I am playing on high graphic settings with only  seeing lag when fast traveling and that only occurs about 1 out of 10 times.The cons that I have seen are that I have trouble connecting to online COOP, however this could be tied to my internet connection versus Uplay, and the sheer number of side missions. With the side missions it is not a complete con, but I can see people seeing things getting repetitive, not that I have,Overall I have but in a decent amount of gameplay and can say that I am enjoying this game.
