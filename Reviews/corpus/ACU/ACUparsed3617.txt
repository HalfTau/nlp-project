So where do i BEGIN? ?I have been a huge fan of this series since the beginning and have loved most if not all of the entries. Well, there was part 3, but I mostly liked that game. Then I played this one. Everything is wrong with this game. The complex backstory involving finding pieces of the puzzle and decyphering all the history of the assassins and templars is gone. The story is boring as and the AI is so abhorrent that I found myself pausing the game just so I could laugh myoff at it. The controls for Arno are practically non existent and I constantly felt as though Ubisoft was just cashgrabbing for this entry. If you like Ubisoft as I do, and you want to play a new one of their games, then just buy Far Cry 4. But if you, like the Marquis De Sade, enjoy pain, then this is the game for you.
