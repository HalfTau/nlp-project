This game has the capacity to be as good as AC2 or ACBF. It is NOT there right now, based off of bugs and framerate issues ALONE ie, excluding all storyline/gameplay related issuesI play on a good PCmaybe highermid level or lowupper level quality and I have horrible framerates, and other highend PCs are having the same issue. My PC is only a year old, and even though the value of it has degenerated at the same rate of a banana, it still can run Black Flag at its highest graphics settings without ANY lag. That being said, if Ubisoft wants to keep the PC market intact, it needs to come out with software patches for Unity very quickly.GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760CPU IntelR CoreTM i54440 CPU  3.10GHzMemory 8.00 GB RAM 7.92 GB usableCurrent Resolution 1920x1080, 60HzDriver version 344.65Operating System Microsoft Windows 8If the bugs are fixed, I will change my review.
