This is a performance review, only played until the opening city is unlocked but can clearly see this game needs a patch to help optimize for PC. Getting constant lag spikes/stuttering, texture pop feels like Im playing an ID Tech5 game and horrible aliasing everywhere. Least my game will open unlike a lot of others. When you buy a tripple A title and pay 100 with season pass you expect certain qualities and not have to wait for a patch in order to play which is exactly what I am going to do since the stuttering is a little to much for me at this time.i7 980EVGA GTX 780 Ti16GB 2133mhz DDR3
