This is a great game  YES it was released with bugs, and perfomance issues. But thatwill be fixed soon and all I can say is the game looks amazing, and its a pretty awesome storyline so far. COOP  although it isnt single player campaign coop, its ing awesome all the same. Saving a friendswho is about to beby guards or vice versa... is such a good feeling. Id give it a week or so for the bad bugs to get fixed  but certainly worth picking up a copy.
