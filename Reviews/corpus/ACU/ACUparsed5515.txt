This is the first Assassins Creed I have ever owned. Repetitive gameplay may have been a problem for others but so far it has been fun for me. The physics with hair and clothing is amazing... if it were in 60 FPS. The 30 FPS cap ruins the entire game by making gameplay choppy, ruining the realism, and killing my enthusiasm. The multiplayer gameplay is new and exciting but when I play the 30 FPS sucks That is many peoples problem with this game and I wish that Ubisoft would get their head out of their Fix the damn problems and just skip making the next game so that you will have one good game since Assassins Creed 2. Hope you can listen to every review that people have left you and fix your backwardgame.
