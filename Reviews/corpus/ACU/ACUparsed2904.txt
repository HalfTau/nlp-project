I really wish Steam offered a Meh option for when I wouldnt recommend nor would I chastise a game. This is a good example. As with most new AC titles, stunning visuals for its time Outfit customizations with individual stats to fit a broad range of play styles, with plenty of mixing and matching for each players ideal experience Rewards the completionist Decently engaging storyline, not just the Assassins were literally everywhere when they were supposed to be in a decline continues to offer the alternative view that the Assassins were no longer the paragons they were shown to be Interesting new take on multiplayer, encouraging cooperation a step up from their previous huntstyle deathmatch Improved and more challenging combat mode, mostly eliminating the spam block for invincibility technique Overhauled parkour Easily at least a 20hour game I logged 100 hours on console2014 was kind of a rough year for Ubisoft Though its expected from most AC titles that sometimes, your character wont do what you want them to in terms of parkour, but its a much heavier issue in Unityin many aspects Unoptimized possibly because of the level of detail they crammed into the game Storyline does the exact same thing that every previous installment has doneAll in all, Ubisoft did a decent job in making me want to play a lot more of the game than I had in previous installments excluding Black Flag, yet they still failed to deliver on key issues. Im putting Recommend simply because I dont want to make people think I hate it. I dont. But I dont love it either.
