This game is simply the one that got me in Grand Theft Auto. And its still one of my favorites. The fact that you have three full maps to explore. Plus nine different factions three for each map to work for. And to get the full expierence you get to have as much fun and killing as you want. Is it as modern as recent games? No, you have to handle the top downperspective and the fact that it might not be the entire idea you get from the games after GTA III. But its still is one and will ever be one of my favorites.
