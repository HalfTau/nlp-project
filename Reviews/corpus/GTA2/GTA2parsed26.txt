A godlike game, 1st time Ive played on PS2 like 15 years ago. FIFTEEN years! ago, maybe more. And it was an amazing game, despite hard controls, hard to drive properly cars, everything was hard for me, maybe because I was a kid, or maybe because this game was simply BRUTAL.Run and gun actionBurps, farts, and smokes  your character is a manly man.Gory fights with the pedestrians and the policeTANK!WASTED!Famous radio!Races! those are not curse words but hearts 3
