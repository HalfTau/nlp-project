Classic game! You are a gangster, you steal cars, kill bosses, complete missions. There are three big cities to explore. You can even drive a tank, which is great fun. There are several rival gangs in this game, which you can either work for or destroy them. If you help a gang, it gives you respect and, as you should know, RESPECT IS EVERYTHING. This game also has the multiplayer  your goal is to be better then the enemy and kill him first, and again. Game mechanics is quite clear, you watch the world from the bird perspective and the controls are responsive and configurable. I like to play this game since 2000. I think it is still fun.
