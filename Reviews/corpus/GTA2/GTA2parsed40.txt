Great classic arcade game where you try and rack up as much points as possible while doing odd jobs for gangs and causing as much mayhem as possible. I prefer this over gta 3 which says quite a bit,  years afterwere talking over a decade I still played this on my ps2/ps3. for PC you have vikes gta 2 patch which optimizes and fixes the game up even more, I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes arcade shootemup exploration type games.
