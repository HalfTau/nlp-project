The rampages, gang missions and the karma style gang relations with the tripartite of gangs is quite interesting. One minute youll be working with the Yakuza, the next youll be killing them. Theres no real story  its just an arcade freeraoming rampage mayhem. Its not too easy so it isnt boring. The game is pretty long given its arcadish feel, and the only way to finish it aside from doing all the missions is to gain maximum amount of money to unlock bonus levels. That will take many hours. The intro kinda sums up the game really... or at least the context anyway. Definitely worth checking out if youre bored. And remember, respect is everything.
