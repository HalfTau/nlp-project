The first GTA game with the so loved GTA feeling. The whole game is played from a topdown perspective with 3D objects.You can do missions for rivaling gangs Zaibatsu, Loonies, Yakutza,.... An important part is dealing with the respect level of these organisations. You can only do missions for gangs with positiv respect level.But technically you can finish the game without doing missions, because you get points for everything you do in a way.Additionally you have to juggle your saves. You need to pay 50.000  per save especially at the beginning this is the money of 23 missions.Wonderful game with outdated graphics, but starting point of one of the best franchises.btw, my playtime of GTA2 is after GTASA the highest.
