Regarding the game I have only just started playing so it would be unfair to give a review at this time. BUT if you read the recommended specs it states at the bottom you need a uplay account. I didnt bother reading this when I bought this and two other ubisoft games. Upon playing the game for the first time was met with UPLAY. Ubisoft not content with people legitimately buying games through steam AND having a steam activation code FORCE PAYING CUSTOMERS to load more bloatware onto their pcs. There is no guarantee that it will be secure enough not open you pc up to internet nasties and trojans etc ESPECIALLY considering it insists on only running as Administrator!!!!.  All this apparently helps prevent piracy. Well it doesnt. What it does is just wind people up. Those who may not be too bothered about software piracy may just decide to stop buying ubisoft games and download uplay free versions for free. People like myself will just avoid any software houses like this one. If the industry goes this way then I will definitely be keeping an eye primarily on the indie games. I recommend valve do the same as it looks like the big companies are moving to be independent of steam.
