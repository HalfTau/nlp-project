Couldnt we have just called this Assassins Creed 3?Although little more than sequel to the previous game, it still gives you enough new mechanics and locations that it doesnt actually seem like a retread. Unfortunately, it is much more integrated into Uplay, including a sharedmarket idea that totally misses the mark and detracts more than it possibly adds. The excellent story arc continues, with an ending that is spoileriffic  so dont go searching for it.
