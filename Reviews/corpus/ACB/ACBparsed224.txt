never, even if we escaped to steam purchase, even if we chose a title with 5 years of age to its name, can we escape from the hell that is Uplay.While game from other publisher and studios take 2 verification/registration step at most, anything Uplay related has the risk of forcing user to goes through at least 10 step to hell and still cant even get the game to start.I wish I could meet the  of a manager who decided to force Uplay on all Ubisoft title regardless of publishing channel and stomp his head so hard he can never enter the gaming industry ever again
