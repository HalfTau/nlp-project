This is such a fun game. Ive played through the main story, but still have more to do. I dont tend to think about reviewing games, but this is the game Ive played the most, and enjoyed virtually every second of it. Some of the basic assassins creed mechanics dont quite work, such as sneaking through open fields, but that really doesnt detract from gameplay. I love this game, and Im just now realizing its hard to write a good long review. Well, I suggest you play this game if you enjoy the franchise, and even if you dont, youll probably enjoy it.
