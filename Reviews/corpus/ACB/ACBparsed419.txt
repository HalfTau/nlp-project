Good game. Runs flawlessly. Combat is addictive. The continued plotline is fantastic. Game is let down by an incessant need to upgrade and purchase everything, which distracts from the idea of being an assassin. Or at least for me this felt odd compare to the previous entries in the series. The highlights for me have always been the modern day sections out of the animus. Id like it more if ubisoft played around a bit more with the character you adopt in the animus rather than fixating on ezio. Sure hes a great character but Im getting tired and its obvious that Revelations will still feature Ezio... when I wish they moved on. Still its their project and not mine, so its up to them to deliver what they envisage
