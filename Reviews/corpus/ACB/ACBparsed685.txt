This is recommended for the good storyline and great character building of Ezio, however the last hour was pretty boring. This was also horribly gltchy for me. Allies behaving like enemies, following allies and they just stop in place, falling through the bottom of the map, teleporting onto the edge of a cliff and falling, people in missions not appearing, also the last minute of Desmond dosnt work for me it just feezes and wont go onto the next scene, also for a couple days the game did not start for me. It seems like im the only one with these problems so it may just be me. Altough the story still allowed me to look past all that stuff and still be a good AC game.
