Not the innovation that the second game was, but still a great AC game with plenty of new features. Ezio once again proves himself to be a fun and interesting character to play as. The big drawin on this one however is the Multiplayer. A fun and challenging type of gameplay where you and other players compete in a game of hide and seek. Hide in the crowd or run across rooftops to find and dispatch your target. Confrontations are quick, brutal and immensely satisfying!
