I would recommend this installment even if you were able to FINALLY get through AC2. This one is much better managed as far as the length of the storyline goes.Rome is one of the greatest cities to be mapped out for a game and they did a spectacular job. The plot up to this point has been great. AC2 was too long in my opinion but AC Brotherhood is nicely balanced. You also get some long awaited closure as far as the Borgias are concerned.As with AC2, the ending seem grafted on, but not as bad this time. So I am still enjoying the plot for both Desmond and Ezio. At the end of the day, having Rome as your personal playground makes this a great game.
