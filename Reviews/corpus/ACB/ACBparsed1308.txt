One of the best assassin creed games. This is pretty much assassins creed 2 but with the added ability of gaining more members for your brotherhood by saving them from templars.Also there is multiplayer but noone plays it anymore so dont bother.And i dont know why everyones complaning about uplay, I just put in the code and its done. The added ability to get outfits and weapons in the game for uplay points is cool as well.I should also mention that you should not get the dulexe edition unless you want 2 admittedly cool characters for multiplayer but noone plays it so theirs no point, you get a outfit for singleplayer, and also the songtrack of the game,and some more singleplayer maps.8/10 Get it on sale
