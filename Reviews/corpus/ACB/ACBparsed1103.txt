Great game. Honestly, I was skeptical at first since it seemed so limited compared to Revelations. Turned out to bring me back into the good ol days of being a no life gamer. The Assassin Recruits are fun to experiment with. Sending in your 6 tagalongs to destroy every single guard that you decided to mess with  basically going around, assassinating one and running all over the town into the Vatican then sending in your assassins to fight off the 20 guards youve managed to get on your tail.
