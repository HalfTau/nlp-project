Assassins Creed Brotherhood is an impressive game, especially for when it released.A true open world, that can rival open worlds in 2016 games easily.The game takes everything that was great about AC2 and improves on it. If you enjoyed AC2, there is not a single reason why you shouldnt play this game.
