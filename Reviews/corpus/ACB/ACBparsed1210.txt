Wow, this game is only that tiny bit different to Assassins Creed II and maybe it is only the fully clothed sexscene that got me into buying this one... nah, just kidding. It was the Return of Ezio Auditore aka manlyman who came to rescue the day and place some punchlines with blades I mean.This game seems to go out to the unreachable guys and gamers that like to play other games like GTA San Andreas or True Crimes Streets of LA. I can not think of any other reason why they should name this one Brotherhood, xcapt for your crip in which you be hustling together with the girls of the streets and 5fingers of the subs when you are going to kick some dogs who go by their crip of the Wolfpack  Yo Sorry, I got no idea where this is going9/10 Assassin attack! Good boy.
