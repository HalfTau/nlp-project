10/10PLUS Great continuation of AC2. Story continues and is still very creative and inspiring. Rome is absolutely beautiful if youve seen it live, youll be surprised!. Game runs perfectly on my PC and looks better than AC4Black Flag which runs very slow. Brotherhood is very long and the amount of side activities is huge! Creating your own Assasin Guild is fantastic and is implemented well. Soundtrack is a piece of art!MINUS Cant think of any! Buy it!
