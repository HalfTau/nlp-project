Assassins Creed Brotherhood is an extremely difficult game. The combat is surreal in which you have to hit your mouse buttons multiple times on the Play button to actually attempt to make Uplay work, and its a never ending process as Uplay never works. ACB is one of those games where you have to make your own story. One I made is that the main character who I pretend is actually me is in a world where when he wants to play a game, and the only way to play that game is through an extremely  ing service named Uplay. Its a really rivetting story of greed, greed, greed, and greed.10/10Origin is better I cant believe I just said that......  ing UbiSoft.....
