I cant recommend this game, I bought it because I was interested in the back story as I played black flag, but the control scehem makes no sense and is completely distracting from the game and the game is a direct continuation of the story from the previous game, meaning if you didnt play it, you have no clue what is going on anywhere, and the game does an incredibly bad job of telling you whats what and whos who, I still dont have much of a clue whats going on, and I suspect it will stay that way.If you havent played the previous game, you probably shouldnt play this.
