Again this was a great incarnation of the assasins creed series. Continuing with ezio where he left off and keeping the great gameplay style of the last game it was a winner for me. I would recommend this if you played assasins creed 2, however if you havent then i suggest you play that first. I havent played multiplayer so i cant comment on that ive only ever been interested in the single player.
