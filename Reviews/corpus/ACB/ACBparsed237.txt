Assassins Creed Brotherhood is the third installment in the longrunning AC series, and is a direct sequel of Assassins Creed II, including the return of its protagonist and cast of side characters.Globally speaking, while the gameplay of the more recent games of the series is smoother and has a higher degree of visual beauty, this is a solid game that aged relatively well both graphically and gameplaywise. While the series has evolved a bit since this game came out, its still a worthy experience.The city of Rome is a large, detailed and beautifully rendered open world to explore, and is a really cool setting to play in. While it can be argued that its annoyingly the only city truly explorable in the whole game, its sheer size and elaborate construction compared to the previous games locations makes up for it.The combat has been graced with a bunch of new animations and overpowered mechanics that, while significantly lowering the difficulty of most fights, at the very least makes them entertaining.While this can easily be called a filler episode while getting away with it, the plot is still interesting and solid, following Ezios adventures right from where ACII ended, while also expanding on the present day story as always.Good longevity thanks to a decently large amount of main missions ACII was longer, however, many sidequests and optional tasks and the Monteriggioni management mechanics from the previous game expanded unto the whole city of Rome, which by itself, along with exploration for collectibles, is quite a timeconsuming task.The game runs right, thankfully, and looks good enough to have aged decently even by todays standards. The Italian voice acting, my main language, is great, but i cant offer an opinion on the english dub.While Brotherhood does a great job at cutting out some quirkiness from Assassins Creed II and improves to some extent in every field, from graphics to gameplay, its decidedly a more of the same game with the same general setting, weapons, combat system and mostly the same cast of characters too. You should not expect anything but a VERY surefire followup to a hugely successful game.The game feels too easy most of the time. If you combo your instakill followup to your first kill, you can easily plow through dozens of enemies neareffortlessly, and the rest of the gameplay isnt much more challenging. Its fun, sure, but if youve played this series or any third person meleebased game, really youll have a really hard time dying.The side activities can get repetitive.Oh, right, this is the first game in the series to feature multiplayer. But its dead now and it never was amazing, so whatever.If you liked Assassins Creed II you will find this game a good but somewhat lazy sequel that doesnt take absolutely any risks, but rather reprises the successful formula with a few tweaks and minor additions here and there. A literal, and surely well made, more of the same.
