Personally, this is my No. 1 Assassins Creed. It took the best things AC2 brought about, added mechanics that are not completely ignorable and useless Revelation Im looking at you, and coupled them with Ezio just at the right age not too young to be naive and hotheaded, nor too old to realistically parkour  Revelation Im looking at you again for what hes going to be facing.
