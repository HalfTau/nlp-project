For some time now developers have stoped porting games they way it should be...most games ir not optimized and they want you to preorder ? HA ! this is one of my fav assasins creed games why ? you become the master of the assasins you level them up send them on missions use them how you want even to assasinate your targets...it kinda makes you invincible but hey you ir the legendary assasin Ezio what i liked the most was how i felt playing the master of the assasins even unlocking the city and doing all the puzzles and stuff was fun hell i might play the game again from 0 just for fun eather way if you want to have fun in assasins creed and other games didnt feel fun playing them then this one will 100 to bad the online comunity is dead !
