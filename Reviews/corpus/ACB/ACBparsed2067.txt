One of the better games of the series, Brotherhood continues with Ezio Auditore and adds in several fantastic elements to gameplay. One the whole, the game is smoother for low end computers than ACII. The character interaction is fantastic, and the addition of killstreaks completes the improved combat, allowing it to flow more smoothly. The addition of the Borgia towers, as well as the improved economy, add a whole new level of detail to the game and a second alternate goal, the rebirth of Romes economy. Many of the additions are continued in Revelations, although the combat is not as fine tuned. Overall, Brotherhood is a wonderful game and a must play for anyone interested in the series. But play ACII first. Seriously.
