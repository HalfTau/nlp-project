The most epic, deep and powerful AC done to date, and last one done by AC creator. It uses a huge sandbox reign over all rome. You get to explore its fields, its house disctrict, even its anciens.Everything feels alive and you feel like a part of it.Characters are further explored and developed, you really see them grow since the last game. I must say that one of the standing points of the game is its writting.The engine and gameplay feels a lot more polished than the previous one, more soft and confortable, again you feel like you have complete control.
