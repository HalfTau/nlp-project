Wonderful game. Beautiful graphics with improved faces and long lasting, open world gameplay. The game has some great new additions as well, in comparison to ACII. Running around also feels more natural this time.I continued playing this even after I finished it, and I dont do that very often.The multiplayer is great as well, very tense. Loved it.Rating 91/100
