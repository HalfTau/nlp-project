Brotherhood is an amazing game that was extremely hard to put down. There is so much to the game its crazy! The sights in the game are breathtaking, the sounds really draw you into the gameplay. The fighting are totally fun and looked foreword to. The story is indepth and makes sense. The Brotherhood itself are great to have with you in battle. The multiplayer is so fun and really unique. The controls are great , I played this with an Xbox 360 Controller. The overall game really is a must play for any lover of the Assassins Creed series. If you have played the previous 2 Assassins Creed then dont hesitate any further. This is a must have! Ive loved playing it to the end and I know you will too!
