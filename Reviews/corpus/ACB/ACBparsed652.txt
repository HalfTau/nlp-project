This game is heavily overrated by critics, I only praise it as a pack continuity of AC II...     6.0/10.0 Early Reinassance Rome is still great to visit The ACII Ezios storyline has an epic conclusion hereCriticism Just one city no matter how big and a few localized areas versus the north of Italy feelsbadman The story is significantly short, evidently, as a conclusion of ACII plot Features on the game were copypaste from ACII, no innovation at all
