Uplay.I wish I could just put that in but I wont. So it was about 4am and i was a little tired. I went on steam and saw ubisoft having a sale and thought Why not buy assassins creed? But of course I forgot about Uplay that comes with it on the pc. Basicly It is an addon you have to download to play any ubisoft games and it is really annoying. Im not trying to discourage assassins creed, it is a good game, brotherhood ive played on xbox and loved it, the same with black flag. But Uplay creates problems with gameplay.Also takes up a bit of space in a Uplay folder it makes in your computers Program files/x86. And it can be seen in all of ubisofts public reviews. This is part of the reason their games get poor reviews from the public due to nonneeded add ons that make it hard to actualy get to the gameplay. Example EAs Origin or Rockstars online social club. If your going to buy a game from these companies I would strongly advise buying it on a Playstation or Xbox, but if your like me ond only like to use PC there isnt much to do about it.
