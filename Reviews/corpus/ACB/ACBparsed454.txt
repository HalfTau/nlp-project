I cant say I dont recommend this game. Is is a fantastic addition to the series, and if you like Assassins Creed II, youll love AC Brotherhood. It adds many cool new features, new dynamics to fights and new things to do around a beautifully recreated 16th century Rome.But I have to say Ive encountered a bug in almost every mission. Or a gamplay problem or stupidity. E.G. theres a mission in which the game tells you toa group of people, when in reality youre supposed to say. Some missions have a requisite of, for exemple, not being detected by guards to achieve 100 sync and thats ok, but sometimes after a cutscene the game repositions you and puts you right in the middle of 75 guards all looking at you. Kinda hard not to be detected. I also experienced a few graphical glitches things like a part of the roof or peoples clothes disappearing, but I cant really say these graphical glitches were a problem to my experience playing the game.Ive also come across a glitch in one of the last missions where the cutscene wouldnt start after I got where the game told me to go. I had to restart the game and try again. Thankfully, it worked this time around. This seems to be a pretty famous glitch that has never been fixed. And it sucksgo through such a bug when youre in a such a great environment, running for your life and at the same time trying to kill an enemy, but you are forced out of that immersion and have to hope for the bug not to happen again. I saw people on the internet saying they fixed it by chaning display resolution, Vsync, monitor frequency, but there seems to be no apparent reason for the glitchto happen. Seems to be pure luck. And I hope you are lucky enough not to experience any bugs in this outstanding game.
