Fantastic multiplayer!!! And more of the great campaign tied to AC2 that makes you feel like the coolest dude in the world.  But whats special about Brotherhood is the multiplayer, it provides a much needed break away from all the shooters out there in the industry.  Youll love trying to pick out your targets in the crowd of citizens but also trying to keep a low profile.  If you want a unique and refreshing multiplayer experience, or just plain love Assassins Creed then you need to get this game!
