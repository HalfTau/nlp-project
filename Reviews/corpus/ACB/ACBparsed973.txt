Continuing with Ezios storyline and adding in new elements of combat, Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a good experience overall. Though the fact that there is only one city to explore, Rome, can be a little limiting compared to the various setting of Assassins Creed 2, there is still plenty to do. The combat has become quicker and better with sequenced executions and  you get a ton of opportunities to fully exercise these new skills throughout the game. Added on is the fact that you can recruit other assassins and manage a guild, which I found an interesting element of gameplay. The storyline is somewhat more predictable than in Assassins Creed 2, but it nonetheless carries through just fine. Aside from that, multiplayer is good, but rather basic. Nonetheless, is this game a good sell.
