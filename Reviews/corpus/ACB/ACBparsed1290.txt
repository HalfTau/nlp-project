I was pleased with AC2, and to be perfectly honest AssCreeBro is the same basic game under the hood. But I cannot recommend this installment in the series like I did its predecessor.The real shame here is that Rome has none of the charm of AC2s brilliant levels. Where Florence was towering and beautiful, Venice labyrinthine and mysterious, and Tuscany open and warm, Rome is just a dissapointment. It feels lifeless and indistinct, even small at times.Adding to the problem is AssCreeBros story. AC2 got it right, by telling a straightforward story about the protagonists journey from simple vengeance to deciphering his role in a larger mystery. AssCreeBro falters, picking up immediately after the admitedly weak finale of AC2 and going nowhere slowly. After the Borgia launch a counter attack that an idiot should have seen coming a mile away, Ezio heads to Rome to regain the Apple and thwart his enemies. The plan includes rebuilding the Assassin order, which plays out in a profoundly boring way. You meet bland, faceless citizens who are under attack, save them, then recruit them to your cause, where they become bland, faceless assassins who do nothing of plot significance. Youll slowly liberate Rome by climbing towers and setting them on fire for some reason, and then buying all the shops in the area.AssCreeBro adds a few features like the Assassin recruits. The disappointing part is that most of those new features are bland or unnecessary. The investment minigame seems to exist only to fuel itself. The missions you send your recruits on earn a tiny amount of gold and do nothing for the plot. New full syncronization challenges have been added to every mission, further restricting the way you experience this open world adventure usually in arbitrary ways that dont make any sense and often with bugs.Without the charm of the setting or story, issues that have plagued Assassins Creed gameplay since the original begin to take center stage. The controls are atrocious. On PC, the stronger option is to use an Xbox controller rather than wrestle with the horrible keyboard/mouse options. On the controller, one must hold the left trigger to perform all the most common actions. The X and A buttons on the controller are each map to dozens of different often contradictory context sensitive commands, and other buttons are underutilized or outright ignored. Keep in mind, none of these issues is new to AssCreeBro, its just that without the distractions these issues swiftly come to dominate the experience.Its not that AssCreeBro is bad  its just not good enough to overlook the flaws. If youre already invested in the series, you might want to power through this chapter, but if not, Id skip right past it.
