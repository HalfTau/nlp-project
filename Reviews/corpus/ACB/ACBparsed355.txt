Ive got a bit of a love hate relationship wth this game. Im a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise, but found myself frustrated with the mechanics of this game on a regular basis. It is in many ways an improvement on ACII, the addition of assassin recruits that you can call to assist when fighting is awesome. The story is also solid, both animus and Desmond arcs, even if there arent many targets for Ezio to kill outside of the optional side quests. And the addition of parachutes is great as you dont nhave to worry about falling to your death when you accidently fall from the top of the Colloseum.However there in lies one of many things that are a niggle aboput this game. The movement is a back step from ACII. Oftenwhen trying to free run Ezio will either jump in the wrong direction, miss a leap of faith or sometimes just stop entirely and star hopping up and down on the spot. Add to this the you will often find that your weapon has been dissarmed and replaced with fists and in one of the Leonardo warmachine levels your vechicle stops responding to your input and this game becomes as frustrating as it is satisfying.Im still going to reccomend this game as there are so many more games out there that are worse than Assassins Creed Brotherhood, which is full of redeeming qualities. That said I would advise against paying full price and look to get it when its on sale.6.5/10
