Another improvement over the previous game, and continues to wonderfully scratch the Tomb Raider itch.  A huge amount of things to do and manage, a giant city to run around in, buildings to climb, etc, as well as a neat historic setting peppered with plenty of information on buildings, people and events.There are problems of course, the controls dont always respond as quickly as you might like, the 100 synch challenges are more annoying than challenging, the investment system is a drag, and the scenes outside of the Animus continue to feel like irritating distractions to the real story of Ezios adventures in Rome.  But theyre minor problems in what is otherwise an extremely engaging game.
