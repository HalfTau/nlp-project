Whats there to say, hmm... Well, I guess Id have to say that this game is the pinnacle of the series. Best locale yet Roma! Ezios as capable and charming as ever and the War Machines are excellent, certainly the highlight missions, especially Leos tank. For a History Major with a great love for Roman History this game was a match made in heaven.
