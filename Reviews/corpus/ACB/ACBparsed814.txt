The  parts of the game that I played are great, I played for 12 hours straight one day. Then I came across the Leonardo missions, and like many other people could not steer the bomber, I tried everything that was said in forums but none worked. But, that was just a side quest so I just said meh, who needs it.I got all the way to seq 9, and I was like ohboys Im ready, I was staring down the head of the Borgia, but the fight wouldnt trigger and he was stuck there with no collision just fighting some random grunts, I tried again some of the things forums suggested but none have worked yet, verifing game cache right now.Along with moments of pure frustration when the controls make you jump off a borgia tower, it has to be negative.And I know that I most probably could fix my game but backing up my save and reinstalling, but why should I have to.But a positive is I didnt have to do anything to get a screen res for a 219 monitor.Requiescat en Pace my AC Brotherhood career.Update Verifying game cache fixed my problem so its back at it!
