Its a pretty good game. Story was amazing as usual, but gameplay remained unaltered. Graphics were a step down from ACII even though this came out a year later. There were a few problems, and it felt like a poor console port. The entire game lasted onethird of the time that ACII did, which was a little bit of a surprise. Also, the whole Assassins Guild system was pretty easy to master however, recruiting new people felt repetitive. There were a lot a structures that were clipping through each other, but most of the Assassins Creed games have had lots of errors like this flying lamps, lots of clipping, etc.Overall, it was a nice edition to the franchise but they could have done better.
