AC Brotherhood is a great game, but it gets a thumbs down because having a game launcher within a game launcher is the most ridiculous thing Ive seen all week. Yes, Im talking about the cancer that is Uplay.I purchased the game on Steam. I have a Steam account. It is absolutely unnecessary to force upon players an additional hoop to jump through just so they can access the content theyve paid for the pleasure to use. I will gladly change this review to a positive if Ubisoft ever digs their head out of theirand stops forcing bloatware on its customers.
