This game didnt work the best on my computer but that isnt relevant.  I felt the story was drawn out and I was about 30 some odd hours in the game and it still isnt over.  Im not the biggest fan of Assassins Creed games but this one isnt the worst one out there.  I would say only get this game if you really like the setting or if it is on sale. 6/10
