It is a very good game. The addition of assassin followers is the newest and most exciting feature which sets AC Brotherhood apart from the earlier AC games and makes it a definite improvement. The only real problem I had with the game was the very ending. It offers no sense of closure and instead of doing something good, you kill a close friend and ally with no explanation. Even aside from the ending, the game still isnt quite perfect, but it is easily worth its current 40.00 price tag. Id give it a reluctant 9 out of 10.
