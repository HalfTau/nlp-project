Score  9/10 Like other game of AC series, great fighting and free running system. A lot of various side quest and activity. u can recruit ur own assassin brotherhood for help u to assassinate or fight enemy. all collectible marked on map but u have to buy some treasure map. investment in shop is online. It sounds good but it often disable and take a time for load in investment page. Its unnecessarily to be online. I understand that developer try to annoy piracy but the victem is license customer. Sometimes, the fighting and movement lock on system is very troublesome.
