By and far one of my personal favorite iterations of the AC series! Brotherhood felt like the peak of the series at least until the release of Black Flag especially after the poor showings of Revelations and AC3. In my opinion Brotherhoods expansive content trumps even AC 2, and the story is top notch as well. Recommend purchasing on sale given the long shelf life.
