First Assassins Creed game, liked it a lot. I liked the open world aspect  and being able to hire s and train assassins, not necessarily in that order. Ezio is a cool protagonist, and I did like hanging out with characters based on real life historical figures, reading about different reallife landmarks.Some of the missions were a bit annoying, though, and there were a few times when the game bugged out. Theres one part in one of the sequences where I literally couldnt get to the next cutscene because I had vsync turned off, which is weird but manageable. Nothing game breaking, but definitely needed a restart at least. Id probably recommend playing this on console, but if you can get past these mild issues depending on what you consider mild, youre in for a good time.
