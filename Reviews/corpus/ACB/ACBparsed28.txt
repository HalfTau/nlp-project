Assassins Creed Brotherhood was a fine game.The story continues after Assassins Creed II  which I missed before cuz I went right to Assassins Creed III. So I missed quite a lot of story and now I am replaying it to understand it.Gameplay is pretty much the same as in Assassins Creed II. Graphics are same only few new items added to the game  such as crossbow and investing and building up store systems to earn some cash. I didnt really invest time in building the city up because it didnt add much to the actual story. Finished game without it very easily.If playing the game for story  I recommend it. But play previous ones first to understand what is going on.xTzharkz Eric.
