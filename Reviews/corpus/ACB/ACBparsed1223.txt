is a parkour beatem up adventure game. On the run from Abstergo, Desmond further explores his ancestor Ezios memory to find where he had hidden the Apple of Eden, bringing him to the Papal Wars when he settled in Rome to rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood and oppose the Templars that controlled the Vatican. Once again improves on the previous one, introducing new mechanics early and giving a coherent reason for starting from scratch. Replaced multiple medium maps by one large open world Rome and the surrounding countryside and villages, which you assist in rebuilding by investing in it. Looting enemies now gets you ammunition, more money, and actual loot which can be sold or traded to unlock equipment. The nearfuture is also more relevant, as Desmond can log out of the Animus and interact more with Lucy and the others. Oh, and another WTF ending! Rome is a clusterfrak to parkour in streets zigzag incoherently while rooftops are so uneven its faster to just run on the floor than climb up and down all the time. The loot you get is mostly clutter youll sell, only a few of which youll use to unlock stuff. Graphics didnt see much change at all. The last Ezio chapters are rushed. Next on your list!Great sequel to, but its basically more of the same with some light improvement and more story. Dont play without playing the previous one first, and if you did like the previous one, youll love this one, too!
