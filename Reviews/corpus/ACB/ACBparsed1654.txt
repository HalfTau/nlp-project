The game continues the story from the 2nd game except they added multiplayer which I never tested out because assassins creed has always been a single player game for me. It gives us more of the same from AC2 and continues Ezios quest for revenge. Still a very solid game, no obvious glaring problems with it other than the usual repetitiveness that can creep into all AC games at some point. If youre looking for multiplayer though, your best bet would be to get one of the newest games that supports it because Im pretty sure AC Brotherhoods is dead.
