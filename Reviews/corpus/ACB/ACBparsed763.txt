First of all,  this game is good,  It doesnt lag at all,  FPS satys at a range from 5060,  but the storyline. The storyline is terrible with one of the worst endings ive seen in a game EVER. Yet the free roam is awesome. And the Da Vinci machine missions in my opinion are the greatest part of the game.
