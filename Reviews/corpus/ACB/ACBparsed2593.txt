The 3rd sequel in the series, and conceptually the same as its predecessors. I guess UBISoft is sticking fast to their rise and repeat strategy. Splinter Cell anyone?. The game isnt terrible, and the graphics are pretty. What really sets it apart from its predecessors is the multiplayer.I love it. Basically its hideand go seek, but replace seeking with stabbing. Its fun and challenging.
