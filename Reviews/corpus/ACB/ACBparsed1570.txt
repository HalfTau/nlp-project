Im going to review this as a PC game. This review is based on my experience of buying the PC version of this game, and not about what the game offers itself, simply because I have not had the chance to truly play it.I do not recommend this game on PC. When buying it on Steam, you will be redirected to a software called UplayEverytime this program tries to open the game up, it crashes. It wont even update, because it crashes before you have a chance to. I recommend buying this on PS3 or Xbox 360.
