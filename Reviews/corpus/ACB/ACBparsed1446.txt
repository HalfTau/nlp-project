Assassins Creed Brotherhood isnt a whole lot different than its predecessor, Assassins Creed 2, but the few changes are for the better and make this game a hugely enjoyable experience. You continue to play as Ezio Auditore from AC2, an assassin living in Renaisance Italy. Full of awesome action, believable characters and some crazy new weapons like the crossbow, this game is definetely worth your time and money. I would rate this game a solid 8/10 and would easily reccomend it as one of the best Asssassin Creed games, right behind AC2.By the way, dont be fooled by my low hours on this review 6.9 at time of posting, I have played through the entire game before, having only bought it on Steam very recently.
