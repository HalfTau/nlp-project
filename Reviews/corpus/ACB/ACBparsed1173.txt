I was not even able to play this game because UBISOFT/UPLAY is a bunch of garbage. So many other  people are having the same issues and yet nothing is being done. In my opinon I would not purchase this because uplay is a bunch of crap that barely works. I have never had any other problems from any other game producers/companies besides ubisoft. What i would like to know is why would they create this uplay crap when it does not even work. My only guess is that they do not care if the program works correctly but only care if they receive the amount of profit they desire. Im sure this is a GREAT game, just due to the fact that I cant even play it, will make me reer AWAY from UBISOFT in the future.
