It was exactly what I expected it to be a continuation of the second one. Again, fantastic story, amazing music, good graphics, it keeps the same style of the second one. The gameplay is pretty much exactly the same. The real kicker for this one is the actual brotherhood system being able to pick and choose your allies and stuff, its really neat and engaging. Also this game had a totally kickass ending. All in all, 9.5/10. On to Revalations! D
