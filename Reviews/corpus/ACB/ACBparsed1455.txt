This games alright. Its not as good as Assassins Creed II. Its not terribly worse, but it doesnt really add anything. It continues the adventures of Ezio Auditore the renaissancey murder specialist and Desmond. Desmond deserves no description as he is blander than wet graham crackers. This might sound like Im jumping on the HateDesmond bandwagon. I am because said bandwagon is warm and has free wifi and is GENERALLY CORRECT.This game is good if your a fan of the series and curious to see what happens to Ezio, but it doesnt do anything that interesting or new.As usual it adds some new weapons and a new setting. They have replaced the two fairly large cities of Florence and Venice with the pretty large city of Rome. You went to Rome briefly in the last game for an oddly linear mission, but its back and fleshed out into a totally new map.Rome is neat, considering it has its fair share of cool landmarks. The Colosseum comes to mind. Rome is one of the only things that is new though. You still follow the same group of modern day people Lucy who falls a bit deep into the uncanny valley, the british guy and the other woman. You still follow Ezio now a bit older, with a beard, but still as spritely as ever. The bad guys are still the Borgias and you still take down key members of the family in a quite brutal game of Family Feud.Money is back too. This time you have to renovate all of Rome, which leads me to ask how the fck does Ezio have permission to fix the goddamn Colosseum.Anyway, the games pretty good. If you plan on playing the Assassins Creed series then I suggest picking this one up, at least to fill in the story holes. Its pretty fun, but doesnt do much. The name is a key indicator. Its not Assassins Creed III thats a different game. Its not a straight sequel. Its more of a time occupier.However, its pretty good.
