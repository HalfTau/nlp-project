ACBH is a beautiful story, on both sides of the Animus. We get a deeper view of Ezio Auditore da Firenze reconstruction of the Assassin order complete with your own Assassins to train and summon. Ill personally make claim that if you even slightly enjoy political drama you will love the story, even as cliche as it is and full of conspiracy theory. The combat is definately smoother and more satisfying without removing any of the fun of the PK, although the detection can be a little bit sorry if you dont use a controller, which you should for playing this game. I wasnt a personal fan of the revitize rome system in this game but I can see how one might be. Really the most interesting, not really the most fun for me I like solo games is the multiplayer which is created under the guise of a training program for the Templar corperation Abstergo, trying to capitalize on the bleedthrough effect that they are using to train Desmond. 10/10
