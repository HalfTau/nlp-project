Off all the games in this series this one is my favorite.  The open world combined with the beautiful architecture of Rome makes for hours of exploration.  The plot is great and has some fun twists which make playing it over and over easy to do.  Like in most game series it is best to play the games in order but if you really dont want to get them all and just want to try one I would recommend starting with this one.  You will not be sorry.
