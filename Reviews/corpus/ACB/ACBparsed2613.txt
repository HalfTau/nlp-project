When Ubisoft suggested Assassins Creed II would take place in Italy, the setting in Assassins Creed Brotherhood is what I had hoped it would be.Never mind the fact that in terms of single player, Assassins Creed Brotherhood doesnt bring anything new to the table  Assassins Creed II nailed the formula between mission originality, familiarity and sheer repetiveness, so I honestly see no need for this instalment to add much more in that department. Regardless, Assassins Creed Brotherhood does add some interesting gameplay mechanics such as assassin recruits and, together with with the impressive new locales becomes what I see as probably the game in the franchise thus far.For those who enjoyed Assassins Creed II buy it  you wont be disappointed.
