Absolutely excellent game, a clear improvement over AC2, and thats before you even get into the multiplayer. Combat has been improved upon, making it more fluid and exciting, and missions have been expanded to provide opportunities to increase syncronisation. Completely new features were introduced as well, such as the Assassin Apprentice system.Depending on how much you like Desmond Miles, this could be either good or bad, but there is more opportunity to play and explore as him, developing the story further.Multiplayer is great as well. While I found the interface a bit awkward, gameplay was quite smooth aside from lag and entertaining.Only real downside to the game is that it took Ubisoft so bloody long to release it on PC. Thankfully they did it without too much DRM garbage  you can barely notice it here, so you dont have the same problems that existed in AC2.
