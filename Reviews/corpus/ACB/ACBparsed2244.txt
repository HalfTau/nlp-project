Yet again, Ubisoft delivered my favorite Assassins Creed entry to date. New gameplay elements, faster gameplay, better graphics, incredible soundtrack, and of course, more conspiracies make this for an awesome Assassins Creed game. I had mixed feelings when they announced multiplayer but they proved me wrong for the 2nd time Splinter Cell Spies vs Mercs anyone?. UNIQUE multiplayer component thats second to none and interweaves flawlessly with the campaign storyline. Highly recommended.
