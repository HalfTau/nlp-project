Even though Assassins Creed 2 left me wondering what the feck just happened after the anticlimatic end fight, AC Brotherhood does a good job wrapping things up and explaining more stuff related to Desmond. After all, its fun collecting all these bits of information and work towards an explanation for all that is happening.This game would be perfect if it wasnt for the sloppy consoleport  the controls feel stiff when using mouse  keyboard.Apart from that I recommend this to fans of the Assassins Creed series.
