Assassins Creed Brotherhood is an excellent game. It offers plenty of playtime and a great city to explore. While it isnt much different from the gameplay in AC2, it does change and add a few new things. It does only offer 1 city Rome to explore while AC2 offers 4 cities Venice, Florence, Forli, and Tuscany. For that reason and a few others, AC2 is the better game in my opinion. Nonetheless, Brotherhood is a worthy sequel to an amazing franchise.9/10Great Game
