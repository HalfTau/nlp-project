After AC2 being a much better game than AC1, I had expected to like ACB equally well. But for some reason I cannot explain this never happened. I really tried to like it but somehow they managed to change the existing game concepts in a way that makes me experience the game as an incredibly slow paced and tedious piece of work. I  never felt fun playing it. Maybe I overplayed on AC2 and need to give it a break. For now I wont finish this.
