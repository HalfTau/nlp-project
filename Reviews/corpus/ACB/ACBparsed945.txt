Honestly, Brotherhood was my favorite game to play on the PS3. I spent hours on it trying to complete every side quest perfectly and get every achievement. When it was on sale for steam I jumped at it hoping to create new memories but now all I wil remember is how uplay kept crashing everytime I started the game.0/10
