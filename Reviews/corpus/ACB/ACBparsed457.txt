a good free running game, you must complete missions to get better weapons, assasinate guards to steal coins so u can get better weapons, like for an example crossbow, double hiddenblade, a gun and much more. the game is story based so u must complete the missions to get further in the game. if u havnt completed some missions u cant get in some certain places, untill u have complted what it requires to enter. the game is a fun strategy based game, in some missions u are not allowed to be seen, or you will fail it.the battle with the guards can get a bit boring, because only 1 will attack you at a time, sometimes 2.
