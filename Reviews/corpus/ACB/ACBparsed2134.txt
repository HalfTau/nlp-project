This game is better than its predecessors in certain ways and worse in others. The shadow war between the Assassins and Templars seems to be happening in the public now, with Rome knowing about the Assassins.The story is the most simplistic in the series to date, and the main villain the same. Luckily the side characters are more actively developed and featured, and Ezio is shown as a leader, but we dont really see his development into that role.The gameplay, however, has been improved from the last entry into the series, with combat being more fluid and the side missions correlating more into the story.In this game you finally get a place to freeroam around as Desmond in, although its small, but he also gets an interesting sequence at the end of the game.89/100
