This is a good game and you really need to get it, one of my favourite Assassins Creed and also if you have a low graphic card like Intel Core i32310M CPU 2.10GHz Not really low but it is not highest also after i3 is i5 and i7 Best in Intel i7 So if you have a graphic card like mine or a little better then buy this version Assassins Creed Brotherhood! It can also run I and II but I find Brotherhood is the best version out of I and II.
