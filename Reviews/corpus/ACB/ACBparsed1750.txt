Definitly a step up from AC2, combat, weaponry and customization are way better than its predecesser. The mission are tough and can be very annoying. Out of all the AC games I own basically all except one it has the most bugs e.g. versing Cesare Borgia, for some reason Caesare decides o fall down and not get up. Ten minutes later and I have to start the memory again, sucky. But this is a worthwhile game. 8/10.
