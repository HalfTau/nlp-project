Another year, another turgid crapfest from the AssCreed series. Unskippable cutscenes really, were still doing these in 2010?, sticky cameras, lousy storytelling, etc. To be fair, though, this isnt QUITE the same sweaty nutsack that AssCreed II was the combat is vaguely improved, and the scenery looks as nice as ever. Eventually, Ubisoft might make a worthwhile entry in the AssCreed series thats actually worth the 10 bucks I pay for them during Steam sales, but I doubt it. In the meantime, Ill keep slogging through the pigshit that the AssCreed series leaves in its wake, all the while posting whiny nonrecommendations on Steam.
