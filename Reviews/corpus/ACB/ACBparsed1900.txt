Assassins Creed Brotherhood is by far my absolute favorite game in the Assassins Creed series. From a story standpoint, the game absolutely delivers. The story of Ezio and his revival of the Assassin order is well crafted and well executed, and any hardcore fan of the Assassins Creed series will appreciate it. Now, from a gameplay standpoint, Brotherhood does an amazing job as well. The returning old techniques are as solid as ever, and Brotherhoods host of new mechanics and items integrate with the already amzing title flawlessly. Whether you are a casual gamer or a hardcore fan of the series, Brotherhood absolutely delivers, and is well worth the 20 price tag. All in all, I would rate Assassins Creed Brotherhooda 9/10.
