I have always loved the assassins creed games but this one remains my favourite, not including new releases, unity and rogue, and black flag as I have yet to play those.  Being able to recruit your own assassins and train them up is a great feature they added to the assasssins creed games.  As well as Etzio remembering where you have seen things like flags and feathers by adding them onto the map once you have seen them in eagle vision, this way you can come back for them later and not have to remember where they are.  Such a simple improvement and useful feature.  Love this game so much !!
