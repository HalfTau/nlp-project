DONT BUY THIS GAME      the game itself is pretty freaking awesome... but its next to impossible to get working on PC. Fisrt off, you need to create a Uplay account, and, normally, i would be completely fine with this, but the code you use to play the game DOESNT WORK. it took me a crazy amount of time to find a work around to get the code to activate, but after that I managed to play the game without much trouble. The whole campaign, all the way through, and it was fun. However, a couple months later, on a new computer, im trying to get the game installed, but once again the Uplay system is screwing me over, telling me this game is already installed on a Uplay account. Yes, yes it is, ON MY ACCOUNT, but it wont register with my new computer. It has me so frustrated i dont even want to bother with it anymore. I just want whoever created Uplay, to fall down a well. Look, do yourself a huge favor shut down your steam acount, logon to Amazon, and buy it for a PS3 or Xbox. Its really a great game, but only if you can play it.
