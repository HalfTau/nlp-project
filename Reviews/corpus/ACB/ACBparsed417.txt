Okay, better game play than pervious one, but still terrible level design! why I have to find flags!!? stupid idea and not challenging at all, wasting time only. even rest of missions feels so useless also, hate it when camera change to still camera! I mean what the  man!! it completely messed up my experience. is it resident evil game? I didnt enjoy it.
