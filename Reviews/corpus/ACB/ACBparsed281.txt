So I am writing this review on the basis of game functionality with some nods to the gamplay and story itself. I say that because in 2017 I cannot recommend this game because of the plethora of bugs and crashes I faced during my playthrough. I am playing on Windows 10 Pro 64 bit and whether or not it is different on other operating systems is of no consequence since I assume the majority of people will be playing this on that platform and that eventually the majority of people will be using that operating system.During my playthough, I had three crashes. The most distinct of which happened during a Follower of Rommulus mission where textures dissappeared and a majority of Ezios clothes disappeared. The other two happened at random during the playthough. However, it was the continuous amount of bugs that happened throughout that were more cumbersome. Various missions do not progressing because of vsync not being on Leonardo flying mission, assassination mission, story sequences, etc., several missions would not even allow for success since enemies could not be defeated and many times I feel into false holes that I could not get out. All of these detracted from the game since you had no idea when they were  going to happen and you had to be hypervigilant to do everything perfectly not to fall into something or on something that would permenatly stick you. With these problems alone I cannot recommend the game. Oddly Ubisoft updates the files through Uplay happened twice although it seems only to plug their other projects in the crawl on the opening menu.Although I will list some concrete postivies and negatives that I found about the game.PositivesMore Assassins Creed 2 like gameplayHaving assassins to call upon is pretty coolNegativesFast Travel is useless since the points are not labeled on the regular mapAssassin Trainnee program is tediousAnticlimatic followup from Assassins Creed 2
