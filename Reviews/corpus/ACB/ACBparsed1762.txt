Never been a hardcore fan of Assassins Creed but have played the first two games. Great characters, great story, amazing concept Im surprised a 200 million film has been released yet and a very fun game.Definetly more of a sequel of AC2 rather than a standalone game however it does catch you up at the begining.Loved playing the game, classic AC gameplay however surprised at how short the main story was.
