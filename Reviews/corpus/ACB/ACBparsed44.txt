A somewhat disappointing sequel  the Assassins Creed walking simulator. Assassins Creed Brotherhood takes place right after Assassins Creed II. Despite the exciting intro sequence at The Villa Auditore, the rest of the game slowly loses its momentum. I love the newly added chain kills, summoning recruited assassins to help in combat at any time, and the beautiful graphics. However, the game does a terrible job with transitions. A majority of the time you will be walking alongside your allies enduring boring dialogue or chasing a target you cant assassinate. Also, theres just enough bugs and glitches in this game to become a noticeable annoyance.Overall, there were few moments in this game that made me smile like the dialogue between Desmond and Lucy, but not enough to justify the playthrough. Id recommend watching all of the cutscenes on youtube and just save yourself the money. Theres not a whole lot youll be missing out on.
