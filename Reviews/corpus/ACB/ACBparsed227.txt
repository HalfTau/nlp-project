If you have played Assassins Creed II, I highly recommend Assassins Creed Brotherhood. Ezios story is continued in this game and its so interesting. If youre a history geek, like me, youll find the whole portrayal of the Borgia family quite interesting. Also, the fact that you can see all the great monuments of Rome is just wow. The only negative part about it that I kinda didnt like is the fact that I rebuilt Rome to around 40 and then the game let me finish the entire story. Yeah, you can go back to finishing all of that once the credits roll down, but I was kinda disappointed. But besides that, the game is really good. Bonus you get to have your own group of assassins that you can call if needed. 9.5/10 D
