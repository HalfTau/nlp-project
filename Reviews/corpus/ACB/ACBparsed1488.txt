Yes, this is an old outdated, no longer nextgeneration game. Yes, AC III, and AC IV have better grahpics, but Assassins Creed Brotherhood triumps all other Assassins Creed games, because if you play AC II, you will be both emotionally invested and a understanding of all Ezios actions. This game was the basis for the current recruiting system Assassins creed has.I would buy this game, and you should too. Because some games are worth keeping.
