The great story of Ezio continues.He is now a Master Assassin, and the game sure makes you feel like one.Many additions to AC II that enhance the gameplay, and this is, for me, the best gameplay in any Assassins Creed.Gameplay is better, but the story is ok, not even close to the story of AC II.Soundtrack is also, in my opinion, not so good as that of AC II.Overall, great game...
