One of the finest piece of art from Ubisoft, I always tought that Assasins Creed 2 was the very masterpiece and this new version will had to climb hard to get ibto my favorite PC games, but i was wrong, the game is huge, lots of things to do, play on the same city all the time provides a good challenge to maintain a low perfil, the long waiting for PC version worth it.Multiplayer games are not the best, but i hope soon  we get better patches and fix the glitches.
