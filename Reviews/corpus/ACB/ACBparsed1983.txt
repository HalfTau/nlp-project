This was my introduction to the Assassins Creed franchise. I chose to try this one first because it seemed to be the best reviewed entry. I thoroughly enjoyed it. You have so much freedom to do missions as you like, and the parkour and platforming is very well done. It deserves all the praise it has received. Its not without its flaws, but its such a fun game.I regret not purchasing the whole series while they were on sale during Christmas. I hope theres another Steam sale for this franchise soon.
