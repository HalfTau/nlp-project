This game is the best of the Assassins Creed series to date, and that is saying something. It took all the awesome of the Assassins Creed II, added more history, more story, and a couple of new features, all resulting in a game that I personally couldnt put down for more than a week straight. And I already feel like starting a 2nd playthrough!
