Yes, I would reccomend you DO play this game. I love the gameplay, graphics, animation major advantage for the game, and a lot more. Assassins Creed Brotherhood has its evens and odds like Uplay, but the odds can be reasoned with. I like most of the game, but what bugs kme the most is that when you want to play it, you MUST go through Uplay meaning that you MUST have or create an account in order to play the game you just bought and want to play. But other than Uplay, I would reccomend this game, it goes for the win, so you should buy it! And if youre feeling nastolgic, then you might want to play this.
