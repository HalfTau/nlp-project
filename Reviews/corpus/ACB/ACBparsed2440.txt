Some call it an Assassins Creed 2.5, but thats a heavy understatement. Ezio is back with even more clever and amusing ways to kill Italian and later, French guards throughout Rome as you strive to rebuild the city for its people, along with additional character development with Desmond.Perhaps the most innovative thing about Brotherhood is its introduction of a multiplayer deathmatch, where the objective is to find and assassinate other chosen target players throughout a town or other similar map.
