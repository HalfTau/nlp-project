8.5/10  A backstabbing adventureThe parkouring in this adventure is smooth yet can be a little inacurate once in a while. It is cool how you can combo the parkour moves and climb around wooden beams like stairs. There is a little bit of upgrades with the knifes and weapons. The story is good and engaging. The missions vary quite a bit with some submissions that are the same. The enviroments are pretty different.
