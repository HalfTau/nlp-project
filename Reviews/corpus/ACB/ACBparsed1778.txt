My second Assassins Creed game what an addictive game! The game is sort of boring at the beginning of the game. However, the game is very immensive and what you expect for a stealthy gamestyle. I highy recommend this gmae for anybody who likes to parkour ingame.8/10 THERE IS NO WINDOWED MODE! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT IT!
