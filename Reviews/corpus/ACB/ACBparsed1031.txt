A step up from Assassins Creed II, The city of Rome comes to life in incredible detail. Animations and character models are beautiful. Controls are nearly identical to previous iterations of the franchise, although combat mechanics have been greatly improved. Fans of the last game will notice some familiar tunes, but the score as a whole suits the action well. Voice acting is solid. With the new ability to switch between memories, a plethora of sidemissions, and an engaging multiplayer component, there is no shortage of content here.
