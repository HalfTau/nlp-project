This game is awful. It could have been great but the sheer chore of trying to get 100 sync on every mission just to unlock all the missions is the most repulsive game design I can imagine. It literally is not worth the wasted portion of your life and the game designer ruining an otherwise great game with such a stupid design decision should never be allowed near another game for as long as they live. It has all the problems that AC2 did, bad controls, tedious timed elements that did nothing for the game, etc. only now they actively lock content behind ridiculous requirements that you complete multiple missions in either a ridiculously short amounts of time that DEMANDS multiple playthroughs. Timing is so tight that you basically have to know the optimal path ahead of time, and the junk controls make it pretty random if youll pull it off even if you know it, or it will require that you fight a huge group of enemies while taking no damage. Fail? You will. Its designed to artificially prolong gameplay by forcing you to do these missions over and over again until you do it perfectly. You can ignore that of course, and miss out on a bunch of the game you paid for, since unlocking some of the game requires you to hit high sync rates. In short. I played this game, I love the setting, I loved the story, but the constantly retrying segments to hit 100 sync sucked almost all the enjoyment out of it on a regular basis. If I could do it all over again, Id just watch the movie of it that someone edited together on youtube.
