I changed my view on Assassins Creed Brotherhood. The game itself actually make me remember Italian landmarks easily such as Castel SantAngelo, The Pantheon, Colosseum and many more! I can learn something about this game and try to relate it with my history class especially The Renaissance. Quite a keen game to educate about The Renaissance. However, do not believe 100 of it as it is edited version. Only some or certain parts of it.
