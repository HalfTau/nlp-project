I couldnt get past the part where youre running through the underground place with that girl in modern times. Not because it was too challenging, but because it was unbelievably boring puzzle platforming, frustrating when you would fall and have to start over, and it NEVER ENDED! Rubbish!Not to mention Assassins Creeds usual unplayable controls for consoles.
