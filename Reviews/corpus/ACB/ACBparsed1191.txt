I didnt think it possible for the deranged, dissentient, masochistic s responsible for AC 2 to create something worse.. When I see Very Positive in blue up there.. I feel sick. Shame on every single one of you simian mongoloids who revere this inexplicably disgusting, abhorrent creation. Thos who dismissed the failures in this failure of an excuse of a pitiful defeat. I bought this game knowing full well what lie after AC 2, It could be worse. but it couldnt be THIS cunting bad. I bought it for the story.. One of the, if not the best, most enthralling, enjoyable storylines I have ever experienced.. But the gameplay? I just finished Brotherhood. Its an abomination. Every single ing thing you can conceive of that comprises in some way an aspect of this game is ING BROKEN. Everything. Everything. EVERY SINGLE LITTLE ING THING. From the movement to the combat to the camera angles, AI, pathing, texture glitches, mounted movement/combat/interaction, general crashes, secondary objectives failing to sync, hitboxes, LOS, animation, the mechaincs, the triggers, the algorithms, the processes in their entirety, direction control, delayed responsiveness, flawed environmental interactivity placements. Oh and enjoy the cutscenes. Especially if you want to get a full Sync.. ing enjoy that masochists, as I didnt. Common sense.. Within the confines of this game.. It doent exist. The single worst game I have ever played. Period.
