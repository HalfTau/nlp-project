Assassins Creed Brotherhood was major stepup for the series, fixing many gripes I had with II. For one, its help up visually much better then any game before it. The combat is undescribably better, just take my word on it. As for the story, I spent 20 something hours playing through it and I still want more. Definitely pick up this game.Revelations, here I come.
