So, I know I dont really have that much time clocked in this game, just under 200 hours, but honestly, its one of my favorites in the franchise. Ive played all the games, I love them all in special ways, but Brotherhood just touches something within, the way not other games really can. The story is pretty solid, although it seems sometimes like theres just thrownin filler missions but what can you expect?Its a big game with a lot of stuff to do. Contracts, renovations, guild quests, the Leonardo missions, etc etc, and its easy for me to just play for hours and hours without really getting bored. Im also really happy with the brotherhood part of this game, recruiting assassins throughout Rome...it seems symbolic, lolThe game seems kinda buggy sometimes to be expected and some of the collecting is...tedious, but this is still TOTALLY a worthwhile game in the franchise and, in my honest opinion as a diehard AC fan Its most definitely one of the best games in the whole series and I totally reccomend it to anybody looking for a genuine AC experience.
