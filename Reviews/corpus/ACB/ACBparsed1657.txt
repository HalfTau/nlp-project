Better than Assassins Creed 2. After playing this I started a rerun for the previous game and I feel that as a game experience, this one is a lot more solid and fun to play. Rome as a city feels better for the gameplay than FlorenceVenice. Also concentrating only on one city, the game area becomes more familiar and yet has almost as much to offer as all the areas in AC2. Also the subplot makes now more sense, although it still takes only baby steps. Animus interface and controls are less akward and running in the roof tops seem more intuitive and fun. I still dont like the idea, that some areas are unreachable until advancement in the main plot, but atleast it isnt as annoying as in the previous game.If you are looking an entrance to the series, this might be the one to start with. Although the subplot might not make much sense, it does not do that even with previous games played. So you might just enjoy this games main plot and then think about getting the other games if you like. I took the bit harder road and purchased AC2 first and almost didnt buy this because the flaws in it. Now Im glad I did buy this.
