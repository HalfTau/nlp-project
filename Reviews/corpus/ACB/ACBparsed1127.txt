AC Brotherhood is so much like its predecessor, AC II. It continues the story of Ezio Auditore and offers a fewer minor, but noticable improvements over the previous title. The most obvious improvement is the ability to recruit a band of assassins and deploy them on various missions throughout Europe or even assist during actual gameplay. There are also a plethora of new weapons, paintings, armor, investments, and various Leonardo da Vinci gadgets that continue to make this a fun series to play. I also noticed I didnt find myself cursing at the combat system like the previous titles so they had to make some improvements in that regard as well.The main story takes place in Rome and while it is a much bigger city, the story seemed to be quite a bit shorter than the prior two games for me and this one left an obvious wide opening for the next game in the series. There did seem to be a larger variety of side missions though. Graphics and voice acting are top notch as usual.While Ive been a little slow at playing the more recent AC titles, the first three Assassins Creed titles have been an enjoyable series thus far.
