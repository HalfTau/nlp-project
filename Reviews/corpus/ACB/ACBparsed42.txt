A sequel to Assassins Creed II, Ezio on his quest to restoring Roma is beautiful. Creating your own guild of assassins is great. Side missions are great except Leos...those are a pain to execute 100 synch. Money system is a bit more balanced, a more reason to spend money. The Sequences got shorter though, so the story is a bit short, emphasizing more on activities than the story.sidequests, collectibles, etc. 10/10 Last game I got issues with controls, this is a bit better.
