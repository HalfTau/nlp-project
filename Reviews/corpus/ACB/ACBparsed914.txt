The game continues the story where Ezio left off from the previous game.The gameplay has minor improvements and additions to the game with assassin recruitment being the major one hence the title of the game but the rest of them are same and you can only free roam in Roma only but at least its huge and wide.I highly suggest this game to those who have played the Assassins Creed II.
