After finishing Origins, I decided that I needed to expand my AC library going back to the beginnings of the franchise after starting with IV or Blackflag some time ago and liking it alot but getting distracted by the likes of Witcher and War Thunder. So AC was really good. Really good. I get the Ezio attachment. So after completing II I decided to stay in line and play this one, Brotherhood. It was ok for me. Some familiar characters, some good new bad guys, continuation with Itally as the playground. As usual, I love the scenery, I never have an issue there it seems. I guess, for me, there was more busy stuff that was really not much fun and had nothing to add to the story line. It felt like this game was hurried out the door or rushed without the benefit of better dialog. Many of the quests seemed quite repetitive and that dissappointed me a bit. Yes, here in 2018 I do recommend the game as the second installment of Ezios time, but keep your expectations in check, it does not match II, its predecessor.No major issues with the controller or the game play on Win 10 and decent internet. Sometimes things did go wonky to the point ofme off in the middle of a long quest, but I always managed to get back on track fairly quick. I guess Ill get into another in a bit, after the highly anticipated by me anyway Origins DLC drops and Ive slayed that one.
