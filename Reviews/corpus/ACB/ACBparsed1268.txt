Amazing game. A lot like AC2 but even better in every way except the length. I found that the end came a bit quickly after playing the second game and expecting something similar. I suppose I could have explored more and done more of the side missions, but it felt like I was maybe half way through exploration and side quests and then I was finding myself at the end of the story. Well I shouldnt focus this review on that as the game itself was incredible and the story was great. Overall it was better than the second one and I cant wait to start Revelations to complete this trilogy.Side note, If you didnt play AC2 first, do that for sure, then play this.
