Plays a lot like Assassins Creed 2, but with some cool extra features. Most notably is  the Brotherhood system where you recruit civilians to the Brotherhood to work as assassins. They can either pounce from the shadows to take out tough targets or send them out on missions to earn more money for your cause.The story picks up immediatly after AC2. For this reason, its hard to recommend ACB over AC2. ACB is pretty much AC2, so if you can only buy one buy this one and read up on AC2s story on wikipedia.
