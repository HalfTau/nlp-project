Top notch game!This first expac to the AC2 game is just crazy. You got so much stuff you can do with your assassins crew its really fun. You can send your assassins on misson to improve their lvl and skills and make them master assassins. All kind of new achievements galore. The story continue with Etsio pursuing the golden apple. Somehow, i found the story a bit more dull than with AC2, but the gameplay was more fun. Actually, i spent faaaaar more time with my assassins crew and side mission than with the main story.I think i sank 60 hours in the game and i still had a few achievements that i didnt get.
