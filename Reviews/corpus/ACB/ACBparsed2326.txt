This game REALLY took a leap of faith in giving us a whole new story and gameplay to associate Desmond Miles and Ezio Auditore with. Leap of faith yeah, Ive been waiting to use that one. Honestly, though, it isnt the story that takes frontrunner here, as it seems that with each entry the story gets more and more confusing not that that is necessarily a bad thing in this case, but the thrills that come with being able to call forth allies on a moments notice to help you take out your enemies. Leveling up your Brotherhood and becoming more engrossed in the brilliant side tasks gives players more reason to come back than any other entry in the AC series, and that is saying a lot. Of course, however, those who would try to play this without playing at least AC2 will be making a gross mistake. Fair warning to any who havent touched upon this fantastic series.
