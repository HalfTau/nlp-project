I had this game sitting there for about 4 years because it wouldnt run properly.I recently decided to reinstall it and go through a bunch of Google searches trying to find a way to make it work. The solution was so simple and silly it was infuriating Download Uplay. That was all. The game runs like a charm.Despite Ubisoft being, well, Ubisoft, Assassins Creed is a great series and Im glad I can finally resume playing through it. Brotherhood has all the great things about AC2 and takes a little further.Good times.
