worst purchase Ive ever made on steam by far. controles are terribale, textures are blocky and looking with the mouse is slow. increasing the sensitivity does nothing, making it very hard to controle were your going when you try to run.I do not recommend this halfport over to anyone.untill ubisoft gets its act together do NOT purchase this game for pc.
