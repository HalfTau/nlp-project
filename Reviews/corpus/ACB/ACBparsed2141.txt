Many of my friends believe that Brotherhood is the best AC title out there. While I agree that many of AC IIs qualities and faults were improved and corrected, respectively, the games limitation to one worldmap Rome is amazing, but still and almost insultingly easy combat makes it get old VERY fast, especially when youre going for the 100. If you want to kill mountains of people without any trouble at all, this is really the game for you. One of the games saving graces is the Assassin Brotherhood mechanic... rounding up and training your own assassins is pretty awesome.
