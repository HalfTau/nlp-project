After 30 hours on record I really enjoyed this game and there is still a lot to do after the campaign. This game can be frustrating e.g getting the 6 keys to unlock romulus armour and igniting some of the borgia towers. Other then that it is a great game. But you have to install UplayMy Rating 10/10
