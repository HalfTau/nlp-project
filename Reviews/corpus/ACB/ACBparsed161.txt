Its just like extraCreed 2.Its more fun that I thought it would be, Ill say that much. Shorter thanCreed 2, and instead of 3 cities its only Rome but way bigger I think. Its kinda cool to recruit assassins and have them fight for you. Fewer and fewer Desmond sections but really who cares about them at all. As for plot, honestly I dont really know what it is all that well because I would watch videos at the same time but its a great fun turn off your brain game
