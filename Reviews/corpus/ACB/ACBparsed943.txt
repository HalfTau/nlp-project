Im assuming people that play this have experienced Assassins Creed 2, which everyone should experience really. Anyway, this is a revision to the formula of AC2 that improves upon nearly every aspect of the game. There are bugs I experienced but they are rare instances and nothing game breaking. If you liked AC2 youll probably prefer everything in this one but the story. And even that is still top notch with a couple nice looking cutscenes to make everything more epic.On top of that, THERES A MULTIPLAYER MODE. I didnt really play it for long because no one plays it as frequently anymore but I had lots of fun in my first few matches.P.S.  Look around in uplay to get the Da Vinci Disappearance dlc if it wasnt included. Its a really sweet dlc in my opinion.
