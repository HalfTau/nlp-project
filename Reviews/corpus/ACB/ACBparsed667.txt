If you liked AC2, youll love ACB. If you didnt like AC2, youll love ACB.Its similar to AC2, but now with optional objectives it makes it more challenging. Ive found myself thinking how to get the perfect assassinations, restarting memory sequences, and failing optional objectives so often. But thats whats fun about it.I think my favorite is Ezio out of all the AC protaganists, not because of the trilogy, but because of his epicness.I recommend playing with a controller, but its not required.
