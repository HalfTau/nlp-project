This is a game I both love and hate. This is the first in the series that I actually enjoyed playing.The story is cool and continues right where it left off. It is slow to start but worth it in the end.The gameplay is VASTLY improved. The combat is faster and with the ability to chain combos together you dont have to spend a half hour per fight trying to take down the baddies.The controls are still frustrating and the character movement still infuriating when you are in a hurry..not to mention the horse pathing is absurd randomly slows down and can jump a fence yet not a 1 foot high rockAbout half way through I was happy that I was finally enjoying this series and loving the improved combat when I learned of the abillity to recruit and train fellow assassins to aid you throughout the game. VERY COOL FEATURE.Now for the main downside to this game...I would argue that about 60 of the time or even more you have no creativity in your missions. It seems like you almost always have some restrictions present. The missions are always either forcing you to keep from being detected or forcing you into a major fight you would rather avoid or some other such nonsense. Then of course there are entirely TOO MANY timed missions. Just give me a point A and a point B and let me handle it on my own!All in all, this is a drastic improvement over Assassins Creed 2 and is in no way a standalone expansion or anything. This is a legit game all on its own and took me over 24 hours to complete.
