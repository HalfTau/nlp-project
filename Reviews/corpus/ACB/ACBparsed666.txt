Out of all the ACs I enjoyed this one most!Its been a while since Ive played it though so Ill sum it up nice graphics. great sounds, great story  I loved roaming around Rome! Great characters, a lot of exploring and a bunch of collectibles for the extra challenge.The only negative that you might see others mention Uplay.... sighsBut get it and enjoy it! Overall very smooth!
