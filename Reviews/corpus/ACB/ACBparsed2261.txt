Brotherhood exhibits most of the known standalone expansion symptoms, but that doesnt make it worse by default. Addition of requirements to 100 memories in general doesnt do much in terms of difficulty, but its a baby step in the right direction. Storywise the game holds up mainly thanks to a charismatic new villain because the rest of the opposition is generally forgettable and Brotherhood itself continues on with the same characters from the previous game with no major twists in sight. Speaking of which the ending goes for fullon cliffhanger bait, but all it manages to do is show that the same trick wont work twice. Usually.Also worth of note is Brotherhoods multiplayer which delivers a surprisingly compelling experience for the series first foray into uncharted waters, even if it is essentially a ripoff of The Ship. Provided you can get enough players of similar rank in the game because higher ranks easily fall under Look Ma, no hands! builds with their abilities, though.
