The first part of this review is coming from my childhood. The second is based on today.This game was legendary. It was easily the best Assassins Creed of its time. The introduction of multiplayer was glorious. The game ran perfectly well albeit I was on PS3, the game was so much fun, the music was a nice depth into the game and time. I love the story behind Ezio.Today, the game still holds a lot of the same standards. It is still my favorite Assassins Creed game by far. I am playing through II right now and while that game is still good, I still prefer this one over it because of the overall polish of the game compared to the II. Plus the II doesnt run as well it still runs fine however.If this game becomes 5 dollars, I recommend it hardcore for some hours of fun. 20 is alright too but honestly wait till a sale for a better deal. Its still amazing however. Just know the multiplayer is good as dead. Which is shameful.
