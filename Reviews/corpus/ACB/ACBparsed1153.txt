I previously had bought the game Assassins Creed III. It crashed. Every time. My whole pc. I would have to force restart it. But i figured, hey maybe Brotherhood will be different! So i bought it. Same problem. I contacted Ubisoft support, useless. Tired of your bull Ubisoft. Why do your games crash my computer.
