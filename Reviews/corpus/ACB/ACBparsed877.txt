Editied...At first this game refused to work on a really good rig. Didnt know why see EDIT.I use a good keyboard for games like this. If I wanted to use only a controller, I would buy a fkn console.It takes a bit of practice to get used to the controls, but at least its keyboardcoded far better than the garbage spewed out of KONAMI Studio called Metal Gear Solid 5, which REFUSES to allow you to remap all the controls for disabled players missing fingers or the lefthanded, Unlike this far older game.In regard to MSG5, I dont think Hideo Kojima was responsible for that remapping MESS, but I think he/his team was Ordered to make it a Console port, and not cater for PC specifically especially in regards to Controls remapping. Asanine twerps wanted to chop costs.This game Brotherhood, I have not have much chance to really test it out. Buy it in a Sale if you can if AC Creed games work for you.EDIT.Now I fixed AC Brotherhood with switching Steam BETA on and rebooting and Switching Steam BETAS back off, and rebooting, and now the game works after hours of determination to find a fix.I updated my review to thumbsup when I got the frustration out of my blood enough to play the thing without gritting my teeth trying to get it to simply start.As for Peonzas comment when I initially game the game a thumbsdown when the game refused to start, I can certainly understand why some people hate such awkwardtocontrol games but like I said, its Keyboard controlled FAR BETTER than Metal Gear Solid 5.
