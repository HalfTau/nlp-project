WOW! there are no other words to describe this game it is fantastic. Set between 14991509 Assassins Creed Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassins Creed II, featuring the 16thcentury Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and on his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies the Borgia family.Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezios memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins enemies, the Templars, and to also prevent the 2012 apocalypse.Assassins Creed Brotherhood introduces rectruabile Assassins to the game. Ezio can now recruit new members to the Assassin Order by destroying any of the twelve Borgia towers around Rome where the papal troops are stationed, then by rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from the harassing guards.There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those that were seen in AC II such as the horsemen, arquebusiers, the papal guards and others. Horses now also have a much larger role in AC Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport, but also as a component of different acrobatic sequences and also so much more advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them.Assassins Creed Brotherhood is also the first game in the whole Assassins Creed Franchise to feature multiplayer which consists of three game modes, Free for All, CoOp and Team. This game is just full of amazing detail in every aspect The story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and much more.I really recommend this for the mere fact that its just always fun to play, and there is just so much things that you can do in the game.
