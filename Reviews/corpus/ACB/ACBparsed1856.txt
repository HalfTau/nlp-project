For me, this was the best part of the AC series. It surpassess ACII mechanics of combat and movement in almost every way and even now, years after its publishing is still a lot of fun to play. There are a lot of activities to keep you busy and entetained and there is the synchronization system and collectibles which add a little more. The plot is the weakest point, sadly, not due to low quality, but because it seems so short. It is also a shame that you cannot explore monteregioni anymore, and while you do get your own base, it just isnt the same. The BEST thing about the game is the world, which is open and well designed. Walking, running and climbing through rome is a joy, the finest city experience any part of the game has served up yet. It is a shame that the multiplayer isnt active anymore, but u guess thats just how it is.Summing up, i recommend this game. The best argument i can find is that it really is a very enjoyable gaming experience, and really, isnt that what matters?
