Do you love Assassins Creeed? Youll probably love this.Do you want to try out Assassins Creed? I recommend you try Assassins Creed 1, and 2 before this. Without the first and especially 2nd, games under your belt, this story will make no sense, you wont care about the characters, and you probably wont enjoy this at all.This is a filler sequel.The gameplay is extremely similar to Assasins Creed 2. It is hard for me to identify too many new elements. I dont know if any of the weapons were actually new, of if the ammo for them was just more plentiful, but I definitely used the gun, poison darts, and crossbow a lot in this game. I also found myself playing a lot less stealthily, possibly because the crossbow was so much fun to use, and I could loot ammo from any dead body.The one new element is that towards the midgame, you start an Assassins Guild, sending assasins out on missions throughout Europe. They reward you with money, and some rare shop quests i.e  crafting items. You can also summon them during any battle and they will fight well. It almost feels like cheating compared to previous games, but it is kind of fun to say, screw this stealth crap, everyone dies now.
