Finishand youll know whether you want to play Brotherhood, which serves to extend the storyline and gameplay of its predecessor.As a fan of the epic nature of the series, Brotherhood was a satisfying experience, if somewhat tedious in parts I found myself watching another screen while playing through the more mundane activities, and idled ingame for for several hours while AFK, waiting to earn income for city improvements, however by the end I was excited to continue the adventure in the Ezio trilogy finale.
