In spite of the hours Ive logged on ACB and ACII, dont be fooled only about half of those hours are worth the playing. Most of all the AC games involves running around and trying to avoid being attacked by guards, who seem to spawn just in time to complicate your escape. The storyline and actual missions are great, but they tend to be variations on the same basic types tail someone. Assassinate someone without being detected. Hold down W  RMB  SHFT indefnitely what the game calls freerunning. ACB seems to be particularly annoying with regards to how the controls and freerunning works sometimes Ezio will leap off a tall building even though you told him to walk cautiously in the opposite direction, and sometimes he will lock on to something you didnt even know was there and save your hide before you even realized it was in danger. There are also several annoying features of the game, like the camera switching perspective, which throws off the direction Ezio moves in.
