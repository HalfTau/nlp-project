Didnt buy this originally because I thought it would play like a DLC money grab but I couldnt have been any more wrong. Sure its still the same game I know and love but theres a good 20 hours plus of single player content set in Rome and theyve introduced the most original multiplayer mode there has been for decades based around blending in with the AI civilians. Theyve also added challenges and some hard time trial stages which are very much welcome. Ended up getting 100 as usual too because Im so fond of the free running and climbing.
