So my lack of a recommendation for this game has nothing to do with the story or gameplay. It was a solid Assassins Creed entry as far as Im concerned, coming with a diversity of side quests that I was planning on enjoying more of until I saw that I had already stumbled on the closing phase of the game. So this thumbs down is because my laptop has an I74720HQ, GTX 960M 4GB, and 16GB of ram and this game has a hard time running even with all the graphical settings turned down. So poor optomization is my rationale for this rating. Both of the other games on the Ezio trilogy are running well at highultra settings  quite well. Even AC Rogue worked on my old laptop that had an R7 M260DX in it. So yeah, good game, tough time with the gameplay a lot of the time. Still on the lower end of playable most of the time. So if youre just trying to play through all the AC games like Im trying to do get it for the story and see if you can bear it or maybe your PC will just fare better than mine.
