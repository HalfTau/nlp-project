The sequel to ACII didnt disappoint, Brotherhood was really fun to play.The story continues the fight against the Borgia and their Templar agents in Rome, Ezio takes it upon himself to lead the Assassin Order as they try to free Rome from their influence.This was nicely portrayed as you rebuild your Assassin Order while crippling Templar presence. The story was shorter than the previous game, but it was still very well made and packed with intriguing characters.The gameplay didnt change much from ACII, but did add some entertaining side missions like liberating sectors of Rome from Borgia oppression, further develop the citys economy and various assassination contracts.Ezio develops his leadership skills while training recruits and managing the Order, this also allows the ability to call assassins as backup or send them on mission across Europe.The graphics and animations are amazing, the streets, the architecture and monuments and landmarks of Rome are breathtaking and really add to the games immersion. The soundtrack itself adds to this, combining some old songs with new ones, really good work.Definately a game worth buying and a great addition to the series.
