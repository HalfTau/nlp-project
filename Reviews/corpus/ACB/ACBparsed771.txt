after ac4 black flag, this is my fave assassins creed. i get to play ezio in roma, with the old imperial ruins all around and good story line. if assassins creed crashes on the ubisoft logo try turning off the uplay overlay. that fixes the issue for me in this and ac4.if i only was allowed 2 of the games it would be AC brotherhood and AC4 Black Flag. the first two games are good also.i didnt like ac3 personally, but revelations was ok tho.
