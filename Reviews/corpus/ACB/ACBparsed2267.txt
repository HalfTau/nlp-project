Maintains some aspects that I loved from Assassins Creed 2 but overall its an unecessary sequel that feels more like an expansion pack. The story is getting nonsensical and Im getting tired of Ezio and his mates, which I really liked in the previous game. I guess I recomend it if youre hungry for more Assassins Creed 2, I wasnt. Oh it has multiplayer, but I dont care about that.3/5
