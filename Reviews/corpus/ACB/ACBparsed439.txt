The best AC game in my opinion, even better than AC2. THe story is amazing and after you beat the game there is so much left to do that can kee you paying for hours... I made up my mind to complete rome by buying all shops and upgrades and this left a good 10 more hours to play. Additionaly the game is really old, so it will be cheap during every steamsale.
