I have always been a fan of the Assassins Creed series ever since I bought the first title for Xbox because I was interested in what the word Creed meant and even now that the series has beenby Ubisoft I still enjoy returning to the older games to relive the fun that it offered. This though is a ing mess.I dont know if this title was a port but it is riddled with glitches and game breaking moments. I played through this on Xbox360 with no issues but now, years later playing on PC, I am struggling to want to continue playing.The crossbow bolts will deflect off gaurds in random directions at times.The counter attack is almost entirely useless as it only works when it desires.Gaurds strike you midattack so finishing fights unharmed is impossible.Ezio occassionally disregards commands and will begin walking slowly away from enemies, usually attracting more hordes.You can be spotted through wallsEzio will sometimes forget to grab onto ledges causing deathUnsynced Audio/Video in CutscenesAll that and so much more t, its ing pathetic.While the game is still playable these glitches make getting 100 Sync impossible at times, I would almost always make it to the end of a quest just to have something unfair happen and bam ed up my entire waste of careful planning and actions.The only other title in this franchise I played for PC is Revelations, thankfully Ubisoft fixed all the issues this had for that. Only play this if you have serious patience..
