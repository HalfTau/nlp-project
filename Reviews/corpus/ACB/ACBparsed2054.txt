After completing the first AC and second AC I had to move on the third installment. At the moment I think this was one of the least orginal of the series being heavily influenced by the second game. I feel like it is more of a just an improvment from the last game, yet the game really stands to be great. The graphics are better, the characters still remain people you can connect to, and the scenery of course is excellent. Good game, really recommend this series.
