The game expands on everything Assassins Creed 2 was great at, as well as add in a few minor details such as secondary objectives now. The singleplayer is also longer this time and is in more depth so there arent as many tutorial sections now. The multiplayer is lovingly excellent, only a few ppl can play it at a time however it is a great cat mouse style of gameplay with unique characters and abliities, seriously buy this as it 15 in the summer sale.
