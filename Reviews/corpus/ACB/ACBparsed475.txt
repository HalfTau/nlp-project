Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a gret game, I had all my hopes satisfied playing this game. If I only could have a few changes made would have been the skipping of the end credits, and a few gitches. But otherwise. It was a good game. I just wish I had a Heads up about the gitch for the ending of the game. I got it fixed by applying a few methods all at once. So I guess I got Lucky. I recomend this if you love The Ezio trilogy, and truely feeling what it means to be an assassin.
