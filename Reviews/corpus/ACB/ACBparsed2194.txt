Well, actually my favourite Assassin creed game is the second title but i have it in another website. Brotherhood tries to follow the same way of the second, with secondary missions less tedious as tedious as the first title. I think the goal is having the player in game the more possible hours. The story is nice like the others and you can do a lot of things, fight, jump, climb, etc.I saw in this game missions like Tomb Rider saga. To me its impossible not to recomend at least 1 game of Assassins creed series.
