 Has everything you would want and expect from an Assassins Creed game. Lots of assassination tools at your disposal medicine, poison, smoke bombs, throwing knives, crossbow bolts, and bullets. Really easy game. I could take lots of enemies head on if I wanted to, but I shouldnt be able to because Im supposed to be a stealthy assassin. Cant skip the 15min ending credits.
