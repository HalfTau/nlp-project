This game for sure a pure gem I only could recommend to play. It follows Ezios story from the young vendettafull still a youngling turning into more of a self aware young man with ambition, goal and actually a plan to rally the people for the good of everyone.The gameplay similar rich and fun like it was in AC2 with amazing graphics and views with more toned little details for the better and more variant gameplay to offer to its players. Literally Ezio becomes a leader, a mentor in front of our eyes and we share a bit of this path as we controlling him and making up the decisions. The view of Rome is amazing and the little hidden secrets giving a great blast upon completing and collecting the rewards for it.Lore wise we not get that much more then earlier games but the story continues on an unexcepted and very shocking way makes you want to learn more and fast jump on the next game.I had here and there small frustration on the controls and targetting but nothing I could not bypass. I was grateful this one picked up my controller properly which I had problems with AC2 and unfrotunately in the following game as well.I didnt try out the multiplayer part nor planning to so cant give further comments on that part  I enjoyed the core game and it worth the money I paid for it. Only can suggest this, though a warning this game gives a lot more potency if you played the previous installments before. While it gives a short summary, that is nothing like experience the stories since beginning.
