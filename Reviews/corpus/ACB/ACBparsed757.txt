I liked everything about the game, but as with many other poor console ports, it features horrible mouse acceleration. It cannot be corrected by any setting or .ini tinkering and even mouse curve registry hacks didnt work for me, although a combination of many of these attempts did improve it enough for me to at least make it to the end. Normally, Im a completionist, but I didnt bother with this time. Uninstalled as soon as I saw the credits. If this was an FPS game, I would have abandoned it within the first 5 minutes. Im sure it would have been much better with a controller, but I still prefer mouse and keyboard even for these kind of games.
