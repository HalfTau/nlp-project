Im finally catching up on the AC series.  Ive played AC I  II and enjoyed them very much.  But they pale in comparison to the 3rd installment, Brotherhood.  I think I could get lost in Rome forever  there is simply so much to do.  Where the previous games had a small set of assignments you could do, this game includes a ridiculous amount.   Im really enjoying recruiting townsfolk as Assassins, buildling my own Assassins guild. Sending them out on various missions and upgrading their armor and weapons is quite fun.  Sure, it lacks any real depth  you cant play as the other assassins and you dont have a lot of options to upgrade their skills/weapons/armor, but it is a really nice change of pace to the game.So, between rebuilding Rome, building an army, reclaiming Ezios lost memories, obtaining art for my hideout, amassing wealth, taking assassination assignments, uniting thieves, s and mercanaries, Im swamped!I havent even touched up on the story arc, which, of course, is epic.  Between discovering the truth of Subject 16  similar to AC II and discovering what happened to Ezios love, Christina, not to mention, taking down the Borgias  yes, even Lucretia makes an appearance here, the scope of this game is LEGEN....wait for it....DARY!I realize this game is a number of years old, but for those who havent gotten into the Assassins Creed games, this is a great one to jump into and get aquainted with the series.  I highly recommend this installment and look forward to continuing on to ACRevelations.
