As a fan of the series this one is one of my personal favorites with arguably the best templar antagonist. The middle chapter of the Ezio trilogy this game does a great job of continuing Ezios adventures. However if you have not played Assassins Creed 2 I recomend playing that first as this picks up right after the cliff hanger ending of AC 2. In my opinion the game serves more than an Assassins Creed 2.5 it is a true sequel.10/10
