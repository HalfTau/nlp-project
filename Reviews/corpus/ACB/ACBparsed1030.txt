This is a Good game. As an example, I present that I have purchased this game twice once for console and then the disc disappeared, fortunately after Id already beaten it, and once now on Steam.In some ways the game feels more like an expansion to AC2 than a full game in its own right, but you get enough done over the course of the game that it stands on its own fairly well.My only real complaint is that this is really where Ubisoft started to listen to the fans complaints about the MetaPlot. Yeah,  you get to explore Ezios home, but it really feels like there was going to be more to it and they just never got around to doing it.Is this canonically part of the 40K universe? Well, it takes place on Terra, so in the broad since it certainly could be. Minerva, Jupiter and crew could easily be Eldar screwing around with early man, and the Apple and other artifacts would be Eldar tech.
