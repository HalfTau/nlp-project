Expanded Assassins Creed 2. Using practically everything from the previous game, and just updating/upgrading some stuff to make it feel like new. Is not a bad game, actually is very good, and  you surely will enjoy wasting hours and hours exploring the old Rome and giving back the city most of its former beauty, but think of it as an expansion.
