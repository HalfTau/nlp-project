Pros Story is good enough, not nearly as good as AC2 or even ACR, but its still quite good, mainly because of the characters and setting. Great gameplay, Rome is a large enough city to satisfy completionists, the combat is good and the parkour is also decent, but it can be a little bit blocky or clunky at times. It does get better with every new AC game however. The players interaction with the city has been improved a lot since AC2. Rome in ACB is a massive playground full of opportunities.Cons There was a few glitches here and there be sure to turn on VSync to fix most of them if you have a 60Hz monitor, if not, set your RR to 60Hz or cap your FPS at 60. The worst of the glitches is in Sequence 9 where you cant start a particular cutscene unless you go and ingage the guards dont kill them and then run past them into the objective marker. If you dont do that you cant start the next part. Slightly buggy. The game literally introduces stealth missions, but has either no, little or bad and I mean atrocious stealth mechanics. I am excellent in Splinter Cell, Thief and Hitman, because the games mechanics allow me to be. The detection system is illogial and the AI badly programmed, considering the fact that 2005s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory had better stealth AI and its also made by Ubisoft. The game also lacks a cover system and the ability to use diversionary tactics, such as whisling or throwing a bomb to cause a distraction. It makes it very difficult to be stealthy, even for someone who has been playing stealth games since 2005.Rating 8.5/10.
