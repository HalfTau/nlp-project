I have been playing this game for almost 6 to 7 years. I am completely in love in this game, whenever I watch the trailer or listen the music of ACB I cannot control myself and start playing it again and again. I think I have completed this game more than 10 times and the progress is still going.Dont look at my hours count coz I had no steam and internet connection that time.  I really enjoyed this installment of the Assassins Creed series.The game does a great job picking up where the last game left off. The gameplay mechanics are very similar, and the graphics have the same feel, which is not a bad thing. Rome looks great through the eyes of Ezio Auditore. In the previous game your entire base of operations was housed at Villa Monteriggioni which had to be upgraded and renovated. In Brotherhood you must rebuild Rome.There are some new gadgets, weapons, and abilities, but other than that, it feels a lot like AC2. There are pistols and crossbows now, giving Ezio more options to take out opponents at range. Horses can finally be taken through the city, which is extremely necessary. And there are more quicktravel options than in AC2. One of the most helpful additions is the execution kill streak.Through his travels, Ezio has become quite the Master Assassin, and must begin training new recruits. You can choose to assist certain citizens throughout the city and recruit them to your cause, training them to become part of the Assassins Guild. When you have trainees, you can call on them to take out targets or assist you in battle. All it takes is a full Assassins bar, and a nifty little eagle whistle.Assassins tombs have been replaced by Romulus Lairs.Soundtrack of this is insane and very heart touching.Ubisoft did an awesome job on Brotherhood. I didnt found any cons in this game so sorry
