Third installment of the Assassins Creed Franchise. Its an openworld third person action adventure. As in AC2 you play as Enzio in italy around 1500 ac.Graphics and Sound are topnotchAs in AC2 there are climbing puzzles which are funBoth story are really boring and the Desmond part ends up with a HUGE cliffhangerYou are collecting stuff, buy stores and build up stuff for no good reasonThe fractions are pointless. I did not need s, soldiers or thieves for anythingThere is no connection to the assassins you trained. You send them to a random city and they will get XP for that. In the game you can mark an enemy and they will kill him and disappear. Its like an autokill function
