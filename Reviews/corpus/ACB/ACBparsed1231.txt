Great game! Good successor after Assassins Creed II. Rome has been made well and after the initial confusion it turns out to be very huge and explorable. There are lots to do for everyone, who has even bit of an adventurious nature and even though combat is way too easy and crossbow is significantly overpowered, one can easily overcome these by trying pacifistic hurt minimal amount or ghostlike not been seen or vanquish right away when seen, or what ever the player feels like. Little problems setting up ubisoft user but game made it all quickly up. Also I was suprised that the online player vs player was still plentifully occupied with fellow assassins.
