This is my favorite part of the Ezio Auditore de Firenze triology of Games II, Brotherhood, and Revelations.  AC2 was the longest of the three and the most justifiable for the price but Brotherhoods ability to better integrate Claudia Ezios Sister, horses, and the Poison weaponry makes Brotherhood somehow my favorite.  Rome is a far larger town than anything from AC2, and the updates to the HUD and controls are much needed from AC2.Short Version Get AC2 for the Story, Brotherhood for the Gameplay, and Revelations for the history of the Assassin Order.
