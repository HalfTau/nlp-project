Good Assassins Creed game if you like the type. Story continues well and ends suprisingly. Some small annoyances like some parts of the game bugging out if you dont have VSync on which is... confusing.And at the end of the game, be prepared to go for a coffee, walk or watch a movie since you cant skip the 36mins long credits.
