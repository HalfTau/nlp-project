While the story is more grounded then AC II this game is far from disappointing with all your fellow assasins by your side as you begin to develop the reach and influence of your brotherhood. The gameplay is smooth and their is plenty to do on the side to get more florins for your coin purse. The story is incredibly well done and has been done so that even in short play sessions you can make enough progress to leave you wanting more . Overall, assasins creed brotherhood is a perfect 10/10 and remember nothing is true , everything is permitted!
