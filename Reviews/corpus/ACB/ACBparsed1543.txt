game is quite short. its like gta but in the olden days  instead of cars you have horses, instead of guns you have swords etc.having said that, the game is short and sweet. and when i say short i mean the main story,  you can always kill a few hours fooling around the city. just look at my hours on record. LOLin conclusion, i recommend the game but be prepared to buy the rest of the assasins creed game cause the story does not end in brotherhood.
