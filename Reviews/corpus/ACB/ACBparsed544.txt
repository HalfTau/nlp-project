This game is beyond words. I cant describe nor explain the depth it brings to the franchinse. In order to really get a sense of how the game works, you must play it. I bought this game cause I once had a PS3 but had to sell it and I never got the chance to beat it on my PS3. The lairs of Romulus were my favorite! The Da Vinci DLC was beyond anything I have ever played. Every penny I saved up to buy this game was worth it and I highly recommend it to anyone.
