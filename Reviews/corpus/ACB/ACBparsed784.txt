If you definitely want to get this game make sure you play AC2 first because this game is a continuation on the story.So the best way I can describe this game is its enjoyable bs. I recommend the game because its fun and entertaining and if thats what youre looking for then great but if youre a seasoned gamer then you probably want to avoid this its going to bore you.The combat is so dumbed down and an example of this is countering. All you have to do is press the counter button at the right time and your guy will automatically position himself and rotate to take out the enemy. Large groups of enemies pose barely any threat as they basically wait their turn to attack you. I see youre attacking my friend there, no problem buddy Ill wait until youre finished before I start to attack you. Its so easy, I havent died once yet, and have barely lost any health. In fact Ive lost more health from fall damage because he often wouldnt jump the direction I was pointing lol.The game is also so planned out for you. So much hand holding. Sneak in without being detected by guards. There just happens to be a big pile of hay to jump down into, and the only guard in the vicinity just happens to be standing in front, with his back to you for an easy kill.However, the story in the game is well done and there is quite a lot of depth in this game which is awesome. For example you can invest in places or you can hire and send assassin recruits on missions and you can train them up to help you in battle. Thats why I recommend this game. It may be a bit simple but the fact is the game is still entertaining and Im having fun playing it.
