Continues straight from where AC II left off, Brotherhood has even more varied missions mainly in Rome. Even though there are a lot of simultaneous missions and lots of areas open at the same time, which might cause a headache to some, it also gives the opportunity to choose what you want to do instead of following the plot all the time. Also features tradable items and maps that help you find feathers and flags.
