To start, this game is AMAZING!I just purchased it on steam after playing through AC2 for the first time in probably 5 years. Now Ive already played this game on console, but didnt have the Leonardo DLC.This game is hands down a must have. It expands on what AC2 does, storywise and gameplay. You have an expanded shop/ownership system, while in AC2 all you have is one city.ProsSingle city RomeGreat storyline, both inside and outside the AnimusMore weapons that past games.Great animations and graphics for its timeConsThere are a few glitches with AI that can affect the gameplayFinal present day timeline that will allow exploration. Present storyline starts to head down the drain after this game.
