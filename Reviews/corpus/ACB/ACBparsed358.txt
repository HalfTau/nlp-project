Recommended! If you want some more of Ezio, that is what you gonna get.Lets see, its a very buggy game, not game breaking bugs but your gonna find yourself in situations where you expect the game to do something but you either freeze or the action your taking keeps repeating itself until you have the brains to turn your brain off for a few seconds and let go off your anger.Now to the good part, I very much keep enjoying the music, this time in only one cityRome so the game is very static in terms of music but it is a shorter game than Assasin Creed 2 so I was perfectly fine with it. 8/10 musicThe highlight of the game is again Ezio and Desmond, they are so damn awesome to follow around. They are not this amazing inspiring characther but they have the ability to make the journey from point A to B awesome.I cannot believe you guys killed X, I swear to god if Ezio or Desmond dies, there will be violence!Ps The game could have done better connecting all the sidequest with the main story, I never got the chance to collect the ancient armour and now that the game is over I dont really care. That and it would have been cool if you had made us conquer some more Borgia towers like in one of those war games where you need to keep the city X colour and yu could win prizes by having X  of the city in your colour. It would make for a more insteresting game and longer without me finishing the game and be slapped with Here is 30 more hours of repatead free content that you already pay, dirty Ps2 The game was too easy, if there was a dificulty change option then perhaps I made a mistake.
