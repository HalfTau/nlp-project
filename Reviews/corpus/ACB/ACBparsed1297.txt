Dont mind the 2 hours, ive played this on other systems and its the same ol assassins creed. nothing spectacular from the others. not sure how it got in my library must have been drunk or stoned when i got it. go with black flag and forward those are the good ones. and the first one. i do not recommend due to repetitiveness and the fact it took 4 years to make the first one and now they come out with one or two every year. they just use the same interface guys but with a different time era and story. i feel they re becoming a major rip off like call of duty franchise. what i see. sorry
