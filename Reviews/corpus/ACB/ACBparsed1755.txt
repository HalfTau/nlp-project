To be honest, I wasnt expecting much out of this game. Killing, parkour, constant missions. After the tutorial mission, I realized it was more than that. Theres missions scattered around the map, you have free play, and you get to strategize your killing. I like how you always need to stay aware of your surroundings, inventory, and resources. The free play allows you to pay attention to Ezios needs, like allowing more ground to explore by eliminating the Borgia infulence, getting medicine, making sure you always have income room, keeping your armor repaired, and buying new weapons. Theres a wide varity of content in the missions, youre not always saving the damsel in distress. Also theres ponies. PONIES. You can ride the ponies!ProsFantastic graphics, even the hugging of characters is realistic.Freedom between missions.Keeping up with the characters needs.AdventurePlotVariety of mission contentMain character developmentPONIES.ConsAutoparkour button set space, w, mouse 2Annoying background voice tracksMap concept is really confusing at firstBasically any character except Ezios developmentOf course I reccommend this game to any person that likes the adventure genre, has played previous games in the series, and enjoys having the freedom between missions. 8.5/10
