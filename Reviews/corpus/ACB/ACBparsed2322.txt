Assassins Creed Brotherhood suffers from a socalled intermediate chapter syndrome. Its just as good as Assassins Creed II with improvements in some areas. What it lacks though is surprise. Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio, becoming the second chapter in a subtrilogy within Assassins Creed tetralogy. As a result, few new characters are introduced, and the story progresses at a slow and steady pace. Its not any less interesting than in previous games, and its ending, again, is cool and unexpected, but while the second game was a major step forward compared to the first one, Brotherhood feels more like an expansion pack for the second game.It introduces multiplayer which is surprisingly fun for something that shouldnt have existed in the first place. It has integration with Assassins Creed Project Legacy, a Facebook game that sheds some light on the series mysteries.That being said, AC Brotherhood is still a mustplay for everyone who enjoyed the first two games.
