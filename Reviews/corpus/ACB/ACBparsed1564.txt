Fantastic addition to Assassins Creed. Great story and setting revolving around Ezio in Rome, aguably the best character and story in the whole series.Not much different from AC2, but for me, thats a good thing. You can ride horses in cities, call them from anywhere, recruit assassins to your brotherhood, carry doublehanded weapons, use parachutes, and play with Leonardos war machines. Also has a few nice flashbacks to Florence and Venice.A few glitches and hiccups here and there, but the setting is otherwise stunning. Beautiful graphics and visuals, combined with a killer soundtrack, makes 16th century Rome look very enticing.
