Extremely aggravating optional objectives that you have to start over from the beginning of the mission to reset. Apple of Eden when you finally get it is annoying. You dont feel like its an ancient relic of great power. It feels like a ball and chain. Hidden pistol and crossbow sometimes miss even when youve aimed perfectly. Since its automatic, when youve held down the button until the aiming line tells you its a guaranteed hit it should never, and I repeat this, it should never miss. If there is even the slightest chance it wont, I shouldnt even let you lock on. Recruitable assassins are nice, but at the end of the day the system has no depth. They could have just given you an automatic crossbow that took out multiple guys and it would have done the same job that they do.A good game, but you can feel a hint of current Ubisoft, the incompetent Ubisoft, slipping in to this game in the background. Seven out of ten.
