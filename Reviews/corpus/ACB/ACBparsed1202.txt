Without a doubt the best Assassins creed game out there, being the second game featuring Ezio, this game is one to buy and never forget. 10/10 story line and beautiful gameplay.  Playing Assassins creed II I just had to buy this game just to see what would happen to Ezio, then following this game Assassins Creed Revelations Ezios story just gets even better. anyone who has enjoyed Assassins creed games in the past will definitely want to play this game, just be sure to play Assassins Creed II before playing this one to understand the story line. Overall 10/10 would bang.
