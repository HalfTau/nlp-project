The Best Assassins creed Ive ever played.After Revelation, Assassins creed Series became bored. But Brotherhood gave great experience. Battle is quite good. Only One Full Sync is better as revelation did. I purchased it with Revelations and Black flag, AC2. Also. In the sidemission, It has full sync challenges! I love it!
