Im sure the game is great if you can actually play it, but i just get a windowed white screen, and a noneresponding game in the task manager. I looked in the forums and on the internet, but none of the many fixes I tryed actually worked. Im gona become a console peasant to play the game, and Ill refund it on steam...
