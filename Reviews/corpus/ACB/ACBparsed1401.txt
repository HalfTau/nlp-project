AC Brotherhood continues just where we left off in AC2 this time well be spending almost the entire game in Rome only fighting the Borgia.The general gameplay is further improved, being able to ride horses in the city and quicktraveling through the sewers are appreciated additions. I liked the idea of freeing zones from Borgias influence making the classic towers unlock more challenging and fun, while also allowing you to develop Romes economy, just like AC2s Monteriggioni on a larger scale. Oh, did I mention the assassins? The more areas you free, the more assassins you can recruit in the brotherhood, helping you out in combat when you dont feel like END GAME SPOILER AHEADThe map is once again well designed and we finally have a little action going on in the present with Desmond as well.The game is on par with AC2, if not slightly better, only negative thing to mention is the shorter play time, it ended too soon and unexpectedly for my taste, penalizing the final score.82/100
