a surprisingly great game, it takes insipration from older games eg the ship for a unique muliplayer experience where you are the hunter AND the hunted. it ticks alot of the boxes, great animation, art style, sound, and great gameplay. only a few issues remain, such as lag. this wouldnt be a problem, but it becomes such because of the lobby system. they did not put a server browser, and instead put an automatic lobby system that will sometimes pair you with people with SUCH bad internet connections that they may be residing in the bahamas.On the camaign side, i cannot really judge, as i have only started. But it does seem to follow to press X to win theme of previous games, and the story wont make much sense to those unfamiliar with the assassins creed universe.Performance is also a big issue, and you need to be careful of your computers specs before you consider this game, otherwise the framerate is just PAINFUL.A great experience, with a fair bit of replayability.
