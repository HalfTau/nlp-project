Rome is awesome.In AC Brotherhood, Ezio travels to Rome to confront the younger Cesare Borgia for being an evil twit. The plot revolves around the Assassin brotherhood, and gaining ground in society. That was my favorite aspect of the game, the recruiting and training of the assassins.The actual plot involves Cesare Borgia, the son of the Rodrigo Borgia, or Pope Alexander VI. Cesare is a psychopath in the truest standards. Hes relentless and lusts for blood.As you can imagine, the gameplay is much like the previous game, but with some fixes to the parkour. Also, the graphics look a little bit better. Not much else changed in technical terms though.Its a great game regardless, and the vast openness of Rome was epic, yet a little boring in the area south of the Coliseum.9.2/10
