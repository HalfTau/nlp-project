I kind of hated this game. I liked Assassins Creed 2, but this game just kept ramming itself into walls. The missions are terrible and boring. Im tired of following people through crowds to eavesdrop on their conversations  its not fun. Then you have some completely buggy and broken stuff to go along with it. Some of the side missions or optional stuff lets you assassinate a Borgia family captain who walks around a general area. One time I came across a ship yard, where clearly the developers wanted you to dive off the mast of a ship and air assassinate him. I didnt want to do this  I had seen it done many times and I wanted to do it my way. The problem? Approaching him made him run, which is fine, but he runs about 10 feet before he disappears into the side of a building. No doors or anything around, he just vanishes. I felt like I was playing a Playstation 2 game. There were frequent occurrences of ridiculous design like that and I had enough of it. I did not finish the game nor do I want to. It also turned me off of the rest of the series.
