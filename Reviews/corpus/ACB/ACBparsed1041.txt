This game picks up where Assassins Creed 2 left off, continuing the story as Ezio Auditore via Desmond. There is a lot of content to play through if you want to complete the whole thing.There are definitely some fun things here. The addition of the crossbow and poison darts as stealthy alternatives to the pistol is good. Being able to use a parachute glide anywhere is quite a nice feature, but I didnt find it useful very often. The best bit is being able to recruit and callin your own assassins to take out whoever you like.Unfortunately, its all let down by the implementation and design being inexcusably sloppy in places. I found quite a number of bugs which made me lose progress although in most cases the checkpoints are quite frequent so I didnt lose much time overall. I also had almost constant controller problems. Im not sure if this is specific to using the Xbox 360 controller, but it was very hard to make Ezio actually go where I wanted during climbing/freerunning. He frequently leapt in the wrong direction.The worst part though is the mission design. A ridiculous number of them assumed youd do things in a specific way which wasnt obvious at all. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why mission events didnt trigger and so on. In addition, the tasks were often very repetitive and dull. Way too many follow this person objectives.Having completed the story now, I wish I hadnt bothered with this game. The plot is quite weak and unengaging. Playing through it became a frustrating chore, and I certainly wont bother trying to get 100 sync. Its a pity because as I mentioned above there are some fun bits. I would recommend steering clear though unless youre madly in love with Ezio.
