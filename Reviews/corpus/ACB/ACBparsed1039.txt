For what is arguably the long DLC to AC2, brotherhood is a romp well worth having and even more i found, enjoyable than AC2.Its basically AC2 but with more content and in my opinion, a better story driven plot. I enjoyed grooming my own assassins, finding rewards and galloping everywhere be it a little difficult in the narrow streets from time to time. The fightings good be it a little too easy once your assassin numbers swell not that you have to use them what with having thieves, s and the likes to hand and the graphics is well, AC typical fine.Well worth a play and again, well worth picking up in a collection steam sale.
