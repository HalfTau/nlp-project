Starting immediatly after the ending of Assassins Creed II, Assassins Creed Brotherhood continues and finishes Ezios story through Italy. Compared to its predecessor, the story is much weaker, but everything else is greatly improved. This game also signaled the beginning of annual Assassins Creed games, but this is a very good one. The map is shorter than all the combined maps of the previous game, but Rome feels more cohesive and alive, because the crowds are more dynamic and diversified. The combat is mostly the same, except for a new kill streak that makes it easier but more fluid. The stealth sections are also unchanged, but a new crossbow also makes it easier. This game also introduced a replay mission feature, optional objectives, and your own assassins guild, making combat and stealth even easier, but its a nice addition. A true sequel that feels both old and new in a good way. Even the Desmond sections are fun to play this time around. This was also the first Assassins Creed with multiplayer, and although the servers are still online, almost no one plays it anymore, so i cant review it.Regarding Uplay, i also didnt run into problems this time no cloud saving, but that doesnt mean that i still agree with it.
