This is a really cool open world game. Its so much fun running around Rome randomly stabbing guards from rooftops. The story is meh but thats not the main draw of the game. Like any Assassins Creed game it involves a lot of parkour and stabbing, which it nails down well. The one draw back for me is the lack of any sort of cover mechanic. Sometimes youre supposed to assasinate a target, yet all you have to hide behind is a pillar slightly wider then yourself. A cover system like Batman Arkham City would have been nice. Overall though the game is a lot of fun and you can spend hours just freerunning around Rome. I give it an 8.7/10
