88 hours and Ive yet to finish this game! And no, its not because of fiddling with the banks.Look, I dont really care whether the game has a 3rd party EULA or not. However, when said EULA not only fails to put your save files on a cloud, but actively prevents you from backing them up yourself, thats where we have problems.You see, twice I either had to do a system reset on my PC, or change to a new one. All my games either kept their save files on a cloud and survived, or allowed me to back those up on an external drive. All my games except AC brotherhood, where both times I was quite near the end of the game.While it was fun to play and all, its basically AC II all over again in terms of gameplay. Not really worth it unless you get it at a ridiculously low price.Maybe one day Ill be able to finish it.
