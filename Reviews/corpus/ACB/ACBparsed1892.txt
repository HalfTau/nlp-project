Combat is flashy but too simple and with only 3 attack moves needed Normal attack, Counter and kicking. Controls are not very good and parkour is too simple. Stealth is not very good as you will find yourself running all over the place. The a.i. is not very smart and does not notice you during stealth and attacks you one at a time.But, the graphics are very good even in 2014. The storyline is interesting notice I did not say bad or good and there is quite a lot to do, and you are in a beautifully made Rome. The reason why I did not thumbs this up because the combat, while flashy bores me and I like more complicated combat, and the a.i. is very stupid and stealth is too sensitive, I did not like it but if you are okay with simple combat you will like it. Not to mention multiplayer is dead!! !
