Let me make this short for you its AC2, but better looking at least compared to the AC2 youll find on steam and in Rome. If not for hardware limitations and/or business/development considerations, it could have been all part of one game.Pros story  music  graphics looks much better than I expected improved gameplay horse riding inside the city wallsBIG PRO you CAN use your Xbox One controller, unlike in AC2.Cons Maybe a bit shorter than one would expect.8.9/10Recommended to AC fans and casual players, like me, who like a good open world game, with nice story and fitting music, to relax.
