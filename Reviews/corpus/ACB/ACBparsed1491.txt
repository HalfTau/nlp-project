It took some time to get UPLAY to work correctly but it was worth it for the game. I would say I have basic competence at using forums to fix my problems so it really isnt to hard to get it to work.I only played the first two games and decided to buy this one because people said it was one of the best ones. I was not really to big of a fan of the first two, I just really liked the concept. However this one is so dope! There is so much to do in the game that I was not expecting. I have a hard time playing a game for more than a few days unless it is really good Skyrim, Rust, Cod 4 are just a few games I can find enjoyment after playing for so long. It is a little buggy during the cutscenes but that is probably because I am playing on a laptop. If you like free roam games and a decent storyline I highly reccomend it.
