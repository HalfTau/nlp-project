Assassins Creed Brotherhood follows much of the principles of Assassins Creed 2.The game is enjoyable and has a captivating storyline that, similar to its predecessor, does not contain arduous repetitve tasks.The game does not change play style a great deal but includes several mechanics like the parachute, ability to ride horses through the city, and improves on the fighting engine/animations.I would recommend this game for at least a single playthrough.Although there is not much of a replay value for singleplayer, multiplayer is somewhat enjoyable and can fetch an extra couple of hours here and there.
