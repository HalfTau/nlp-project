Assains CreedBrotherhood is my personal favorite assasins credd because of its stellar storyline and great combat. The combat may seem too easy for a good assasins creed player but the combat is still harder than the new assins creed combat. The graphics look great, the parkour is greatlike in every assasins creed And the storyline is good and there is plenty of missionsOverall score 8.5/10
