The jumping puzzles were more obnoxious than what was in AC2, but the story was all around stronger to me, in that I actually understood who I was fighting and why, which is more than I could say about AC2. All in all, a good game for me. I enjoyed the cityrebuilding aspects and the critpath chain isnt obnoxiously long like it felt in AC2. I did skip some of the side content, like the tomb explorations, since I hated those in AC2 and theyre not critical anyway. Storywise, it ends on a definite cliffhanger, so theres definitely an impetus to head into AC Revelations right afterward.
