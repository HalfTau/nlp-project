Ive only played a few hours, but the play control with a keyboard and mouse is terrible. Whoever designed it must have intentionaly been trying to make it more difficult and inefficient...oh and the when you redo keybindings it only redoes part of it, not everything, so yeah, good luck with that.Otherwise sort of interesting story, decent game idea, but unplayable with a keyboard and mouse.
