Did you like Assassins Creed 2?Yes?Well then ive got great news for you You will like this game too. The controls and invironment look and feel the same so you dont really have to adapt. I finished AC2 half a year ago as of writing this and as soon as i got in my first fight i quickly remembered the controls.Long story short, play AC and AC2 before you play Brotherhood otherwise youll miss out on 2 awesome games!100 Recommended! Would buy again!
