AC Brotherhood is a lot like II which is good and features the same protagonist. Instead of going all over northern Italy, you now stay mostly in Rome. Rome is a very big and interesting place, so it certainly doesnt feel limited but it is a bit less varied.Gameplaywise there are some nice improvements. The biggest and most interesting one is that you can now recruit other assassins, who can either help you out in combat, or perform missions for money. Besides this there are some small improvements, such as the ability to ride horses inside the city, and some noticable improvements in the controls. The story, however, is not as engaging as that of AC II.Overall, a very solid and enjoyable game, even if I enjoyed II a little more. 8/10 compared to AC IIs 9/10.
