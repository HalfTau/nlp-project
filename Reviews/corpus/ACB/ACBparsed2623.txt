Amazing Game. Update to the graphics engine improves so much on the look and feel, auditory sounds in the cities make it so much more lifelike than in the past two games, the HUD has been slimmed down and the optimization of the game is just amazing. New interactions, items, weapons, city economies, additional parkour elements and a brand new storyline makes this much less an upgrade with the same characters and different storyline, but a fully new game with four times the facets as the previous one.The multiplayer has been flawless since release day, being able to choose your own character skin and just the simple way to play multiplayer with the quick tutorial is so much fun and before you know it 2 hours have gone by in extreme fun. This was worth my 50 by a long shot.
