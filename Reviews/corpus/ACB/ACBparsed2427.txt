An epic game where you play with history. A great sequel to Assassins Creed II, which takes Ezios story farther. A game where you can literally climb anything you see and go anywhere you want, as far as its not outside the maps limit. And what a beatiful map to.. 1500 Rome, really beatiful setting for the game. And its even completed by the most unique multiplayer I ever tried. What else would you want?
