I enjoy playing AC Brotherhood but its buggy a.f. I wanted to recruit a citizen which was on the rooftop. I sent an assassin to kill one of the guards while I jumped to assassinate the guard that citizen held. It bugged out and Ezio flew to the river which is like 70100 units away. One time I was just running over the rooftoop then suddendly I fell through it all an found my self swimming in the water below the city. in sequence 9, I couldnt trigger the animation to start a fight with Cesare if someone has this problem just go down the tower and try to go back as much as you can... It triggers shortly after that. Overall, I really like the story and the gameplay but the bugs and the bards are so fricking annoying xD.
