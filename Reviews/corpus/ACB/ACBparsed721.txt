One of, if not the best, Assassins Creed games ever made, Brotherhood brings us to Renaissance Rome, picking up where the second game left off. While there are a few dull and frustrating moments, mostly related to insane 100 sync requirements in some missions looking at you, Hell on Wheels, the game is very well done and very worth the price when its on sale. However, Id only buy the deluxe edition these days if you REALLY want the two short single player missions, since multiplayer is very dead. If I were you, Id just buy the base game.
