ACB is IMO the peak of ACs storyline. I loved every corner of Rome If you are, like me, more a fan of good storytelling nad want to explore regions you may not be able to see quit soon just do yourself a favor yeah, I dont like UPlay either.. and buy it. Personally my last recommendation for a AC titel.
