It is not a bad game, nor a great one neither. Good graphics for the release year. A charismatic protagonist. It is fun, sometimes. I like the economy mechanic, but it is so unreal. It is a beautiful game. The soundtrack isnt remarkably good, but not remarkably bad either. The open world isnt a great deal. Voice acting. Not very good story. Boring gameplay. Ubisoft. Uplay. You dont play as Altair.Basicaly it is the same of all the years, nothing really shines in Brotherhood, but still is fun, so, yes, i recommend it.
