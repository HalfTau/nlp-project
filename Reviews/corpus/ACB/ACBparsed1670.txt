Do I recommend this game? YES YES YES. Talk about good gameplay, and an awesoem storyline. This game is mosty better than AC, AC2, AC3 an ACR in my opinion. But, AC4 will win it. On the other hand, if you do not have a computer that cannot run AC4, than this game is the AC game for you. Putting the ridiculously OP counter aside, the battling part of the the game is still decent. The free roam adds more gameplay time in this game, which is always good. Of course, the part where you can recruit assassins is so good. Its just like AC4, but with assassins, not pirates. So, all around, it is a good game.
