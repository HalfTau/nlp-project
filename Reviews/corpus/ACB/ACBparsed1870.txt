The history may not be that good, still is acceptable, and there are even more new things. I loved the additions to the game like buying things, making quests for shops and etc.. Even though, again, I got bored sometimes, as there are too much repetition.This time, also, the game has potentialized its believing that the player is a noob. Many of the challenges of the game have gone, and most of the time it is like running and killing. Sometimes the game gives you so much tips for easy things, and some times when you may really need it it doesnt give you any hint.The worst part, I think, its the camera control. Many times the camera will change and make you miss a jump or something else. Made me rage quit sometimes. Really annoying.In the end, it is a good game. Recommended for those who like the series and want to go to the end, knowing the history. Still, as an isolated game, I think it just has many flaws and inconsistences. For the moment, I think this is the worst game of the series.7/10
