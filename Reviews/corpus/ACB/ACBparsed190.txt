Really glad I bought it on sale for 5 dollars because I actually cant get the game to run on my computer? I recommend this game because of the fun story and creative gameplay elements but not if you have Windows 10 or would actually enjoy actually playing the game because Uplay prohibits it from being opened at all ever. Buy it for console!
