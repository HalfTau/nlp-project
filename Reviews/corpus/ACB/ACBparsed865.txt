Its a great continuity to the Ezio Auditore Trilogy. The Assassins Creed franchise went down hill after that instalment. The game on its own feels like an expansion pack to Assassins Creed  due to the similar content. The graphics and visuals are breathtaking, the gameplay stays the  same as the last iteraion and the story only gets more complex.
