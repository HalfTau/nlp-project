Brotherhood did not run as well as AC2 did on my pc. There was a lot more glitches present, but nothing game breaking, but the game was very choppy at times. I have an RX470, i5 7600K, 8GB ram.I ran through this just doing the story mode, keeping side quests and other things to a bare minimum, and it took me around 1314 hours to complete. The story mode kept me interested the whole way through, but it was no where near as good as AC2. This is still an amazing game though, and well worth the 8 I paid for it. There is plenty of replayability there, but its just not for me as Im going through the whole AC series game by game so Im keeping strictly to the main storylines for the most part.
