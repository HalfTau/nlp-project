My first Assassin Creed It is excellent, the story is good, beautiful graphics, the city of Rome is niceThe gameplay is rich, several purchases are made for weapons, stalls, outfits ...Secondary quests are also interesting to do,The fact of having a small squad of assassin and that one can bring them to the combat, the improved ones I find its rather brilliant.I recommand it !
