OK graphics, decent controls, plenty of different mechanics exploration, economy, rebuilding, conquering, assassinations.  A decent game overall but it has too much handholding and the openworld aspect is, as always with Ubisoft games, very restricted. You cannot play the game the way you want, you have to follow the footsteps of the devs.The combat! Combat feels disconnected and loose. You do not have direct control over your actions during combat, you feel like a spectator where you have to push a button as soon as someone attacks you very frustrating.The game also lacks the atmosphere and details of the previous games, it feels like a copypaste of AC2 and somehow the essence got lost.Alright game but not worth your time.
