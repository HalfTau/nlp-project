Another addition to the fantastic franchise that is Assassins Creed, this being the third in the series.After playing the second assassins creed and surprisingly enjoying it whilst sinking many hours into it, I took it upon myslef to play the only game in the franchise I had yet to play.The game is, fantastic, the story is gripping and engaging and the very fact that you are Ezio Auditore Firenze makes it that much better. The soundtrack has a kind of magic to it, that fits in perfectly with the atmosphere of the game.There is plenty to do, the addition of an economic system in Rome to which you can invest in is excellent, and managing recruits all the way to assassins is a brilliant part of the game.Other than that, this is a great game, will leave you entertained for many hours, and bring out the assassin that lingers within you....8/10
