If youre really not into games like Assassins Creed, then Ill tell you, even though you dont like it, this game is ing amazing! Its the best game in the entire Assassins Creed series, if you ask me. The quality is even really good for when it came out, although I dont really care about graphics. I recommend playing 2 before you start playing this one, but if you dont care about storyline, than go on son, by yourself a little gift! It starts off in the year 1499 at your uncle Marios Villa, where you start where you have ended in 2. After doing some small missions the Villa immediately gets attacked by a guy called Cesare and his army. Its totally recommended!
