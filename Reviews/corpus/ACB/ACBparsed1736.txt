This title expands to what Assassins Creed II so great, but also takes a small step back. And that step back is for the better. ACII wanted to make everything bigger and better. They made a lot of things better as opposed to AC1, but some of the cities and locations felt very empty. In this title which in my opinion should be could Assassins Creed III Brotherhood the entire adventure takes place in Rome. It is gigantic and very well detailed. It looks way better then Assassins Creed II and there are some subtle improvements to the gameplay of ACII.The Story is not as good as the last two games in the series. The ending is great and leaves you guessing. Ezio is now becoming a Master Assassin and thus recruits new Assassins. You can call these brothers in arms into battle whenever you wish. Yes, its a cheap and overpowered way to get yourself out of a tough fight, but I love the way these Assassins come out of hiding places just like Altar or Ezio would. You bond with a lot of characters and I love that.In other words, did you play the wonderful Assassins Creed II and you want to know the next chapter in the story? Brotherhood is a very safe purchase. Fun, beautiful and exciting! Love it.
