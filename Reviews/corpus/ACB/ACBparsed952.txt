If you liked Assassins Creed II and you want more of that, this is the game for you. It is more or less the same thing in terms of mechanics, with some additional weapons and the option to summon assassins to eliminate targets for you. You also get to head the assassins guild which allows you to recruit new assassins, send them on missions and stuff. The world is, like in the previous game, amazingly crafted, with lots of areas to explore and rooftops to parkour on. Parkouring is fun, although youll sometimes fly off a wall because the camera spazzed out or you were moving too fast to direct your character adequately etc. When this happens it breaks the flow and can feel quite frustrating. While assassinating targets remains fun pulling them to their deaths when hanging off ledges or dropping on them from above etc, the combat is still awful guards stand around you in a circle, waiting for their turn to attack, and the voice acting is just as atrocious as in the previous game, with a bunch of North American voice actors continuing to do an awful job at faking Italian accents... I suggest turning on Italian audio, it improves the immersion anyway.
