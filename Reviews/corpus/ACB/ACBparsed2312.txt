Fantastic 3rd game in the series filled with rich 15th century history loved the twised and sordid history of the Borgias, great characters more Ezio is a good thing, combat and gameplay. One of the best storylines in a game series to date. The downsides are that the Assassins Brotherhood gameplay addition is more of a gimmick than anything else which is a damn shame as it could have been awesome to train up your fellow assassins by being able to engage with them more directly instead of just sending them on prescripted text based missions. Also, being able to call them to help you in a fight is cool and all but can be used to easily cheese your way through the tougher encounters in the game.8.59/10
