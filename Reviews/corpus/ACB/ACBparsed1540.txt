Great game! Felt short compared to Assassins Creed 2, but still great.Only issue Ive had is that the video tends to lag in the cutscenes so youll hear things happen before seeing them, but the gameplay is lag free.Running onMacbook Pro 15inch Mid2010OS X 10.8.52.66 GHz Intel Core i78GB RAM 1067 MHz DDR3NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 512 MBTipIf youre a Mac user and download AC Brotherhood, you may find that it doesnt work when you first launch it. All you need to do is the following1. Go to /Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/2. Go into the AC2 folder assuming you have already bought AC2 and copy the Ubisoft Game Launcher from the Ubisoft folder.3. Go into the AC Brotherhood folder and replaced the Ubisoft Game Launcher in there with the version from the AC2 folder.I did this and it works fine.
