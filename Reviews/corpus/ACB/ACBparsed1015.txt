Let me start off by saying that I love the Assassins Creed game franchise, but this game is literally unplayable on windows 10. First, you have to download the crappy Uplay DRM launcher. It barely works and I had to reinstall it several times. Once opening the game, it lags and stutters at horrible speeds. I can barely get through th game menu at 5 fps. I am running dual GTX 970s.... my hardware is not the problem, the software is. Do not get this game if you have windows 10, I recommend reading the online forums about this game.
