The continuation of the story line is great, but Im disappointed that the gameplay is very similar to the previous two  fights can essentially be won by mashing your attack button and finding objectives is super straightforward.  However, the graphics and scenery are still wonderful, and the openworld exploration is thrilling.I would definitely recommend the game if you dont mind a lot more repetition, but I just cant get myself past that part to continue the story line.  In this rare case, Im fine just looking up the plot on Wikipedia.
