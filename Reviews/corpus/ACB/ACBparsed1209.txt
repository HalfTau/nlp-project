Do you like doing the same frustrating thing over and over again, and looking at the same flashing red FAIL screen everytime when you do not play the game exactly  the way the game wants you to play it?  Well this is the game for you!  This game is such a mixup of playing styles, some really fun and some really frustrating and totally not fun.  It really seems like a frankenstein game made up of different parts by different programming teams  as the INCREDIBLY long credits proves!  Just too much design by committee here instead of a single vision.  Yes, I did finish the game but it was such a chore to do so, I couldnt wait for it to be over.  I guess I do recommend it as I did finish the game, but its really not as much fun as the first 2 games in the series in my opinion.  And that ended  wtf!  Really a total letdown to end the game like that especially after the previous game ended so well.
