A good continuation from where it left off. Assasins Creed Brotherhood tells the story of Ezios journey after his time in Florence. Once again Ubisoft has done wonderfully in terms of graphics and gameplay. The city of Rome is an excellent place to perform parkour and free run. Some new additions were also nice, such as being able to recruit your own assasins to help you on your missions. 9/10
