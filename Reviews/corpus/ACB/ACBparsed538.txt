Its a cool game with a good story and easy controls. I recommend buying Assassins Creed II first, because this game is like a sequel to it. This game also has multiplayer, which is cool, different than other multiplayer games, but Im just gonna say that I couldnt find people online to play multiplayer. I guess not many people play it. Otherwise a great game.being an assassin is awesome
