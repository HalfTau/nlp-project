This game won my title of favourite game Ive ever played. That title first belonged to ac2 and god, this was such a good sequel. Although you play the same character as in ac2 ezio, you begin to adore him even more and Its still in italy, but that doesnt hurt the game at all. The beginning is so tense and you continue in the modern day with desmond where the beginning left off. Modern day and history are so good combined. The game felt shorter because there were less sequences but they all were longer so the things were more in depth. The city of Rome was soo big that i had to get used to not getting to the other side of the map in 20 seconds. If you would like to play a game thats awesome, has great character, lots of humer and a fantastic story. THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. Just begin playing already, please, its WORTH IT!
