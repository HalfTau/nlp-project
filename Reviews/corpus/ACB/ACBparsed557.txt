Assassins Creed had the potential, but it was a matter of whether you liked what it had to offer or not you got to experience everything it had to offer from the get go and if you didnt like it, tough!Assassins Creed II was more like a game, where the gameplay expands as you progress in the story, and Brotherhood was the perfect tuning to that great formula. So, great gameplay mechanics that keep evolving, charismatic hero and story that hasnt become too convoluted yet Brotherhood is the entry in the Assassins Creed series that most stands the test of time.
