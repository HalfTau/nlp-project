This is going to be a weird review...Ok first the game is a great game. I have played it on console and love it.the problem is that the whole uplay thing screws up the game so bad u litterally cannot play it. I cant even open the game to play. It just crashes at the uplay thing which annoys the heck out of me. Until its fixed, I am going to feel like I just wasted 20....However the game is a great game. Best in the series next to AC4.
