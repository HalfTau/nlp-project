Just another AC, the story is great, the character controls and dynamics are smooth, also if the main story wasnt enough for you, theres more than atleast 10 hours of side missions and unlockables, you can also use multiplayer feature for more extended gameplay.in general the game is good, but it gets repetitive at some point, id still recommend you play it.8/10.
