To play the game you must create a ubisoft account. I created one with no problem. Then it told me grats! Account made, logged in all fine. Then it begins to launch and then that launcher just disappears. Not like a usual crash where it says error, something wrong. It just exits itself. Every time i try to play it on through steam the launcher goes up, and crashes a few seconds later. I am on a windows 8 and have no firewall blocking it. Any help would be appreiciated but i cant find the support page on the ubisoft website. Ive seen awesome gameplay but i can get the game to start. In addition, my mac friend tries to play and it doesnt recongnize his keyboard so he can just afk in a lobby every time he tries to play. All in all, it doesnt work and is super buggy with nowhere to look for help.
