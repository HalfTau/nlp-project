Im already annoyed with launchers. Having to come back to the room every time my kids want to play age of empires, to type a password, is annoying enough. Something appearantly went wrong while I was installing/updating, because uplay will not stop crashing. So I burnt all that mobile databecause I cant get anything else here to watch uplay crash. Still have not gotten to play. So ubisoft, steam IS a launcher. It has an update system. Please use the system already in place, or there is no reason for me to buy your games through steam. Store page makes no mention of your obnoxious launcher or requirement to sign up for yet another account I have to keep track of. The reason I buy games through steam is to not have to do all that  for every individual game I purchase.
