Another good installment of AC.  8/10.  Picks up after AC 2, with Ezio again a few years after AC 2 took place.  Focused solely in Rome with 4 areas that unlock as you progress.  The story was interesting.  Ezio pulls together the 3 factions to defat a common enemy, and ends with a decent addition to the lore.  Graphics look good.  Combat is the same as usual.  Entertaining but frustrating.  Running through streets will enevitibly result in you running up a wall you didnt intend to, or hoping up on a barrel killing your progress in timed missions.  The camera will hide behind a tree during a battle with multiple enemies.  If Ubisoft could solve these issues this series would be a 9 or a 10 for me, but as of AC 4, they are still present.  I liked the economic twist they added in this installment.  Investing money in shops to get rewards to unlock more weapons, although it looks like they dropped the mechanic at some point, since it wasnt in AC 4.
