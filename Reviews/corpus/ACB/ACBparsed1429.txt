Overall still recommendable though the game is not without its minor and major flaws.The PC controls are inexplicably worse from part 2. A real mystery because they improved mucho between AC1 and AC2 and then in Brotherhood its worse again like the req to hit enter instead of space on many confirmation dialogues or how TAB opens the map but does not close it again... WTF.The story did not grab me as much as part 2. Leo Da Vinci added a nice touch in AC2 that was sorely missing in Brotherhood. Many story and optional missions were quite grindy and drawn out. Im not a fan of the lengthy escorts or tailing missions of which there seemed to be too many. There was also too much trial  error, in part due to the absence of mission critical info,  which led to IMHO unnecessary repetition due to the console checkpoint save system.I liked the 15th/16th century depiction of Rome though. The atmosphere and ambience was great. The story, while not stellar, was still motivating enough to make me keep playing and finishing the game. So overall it gets a thumbs up but Id warn anyone to be prepared to lose some hair over the games annoyances that are mostly owed to the games console heritage.
