Get it on sale and you might have a good time.I love the setting.I loath the controls, particularly while in combat.About half the time you jump where you do not want to jump to, you attack who you dont want to attack or do not attack when you want to. Combat is animation based which is frustratingly unresponsive.And this game probably has the worst implementation of a crossbow Ive ever seen in a game.A lot of missions are trial and error. The devs created one way to finish the mission and you can forget about trying to find your own way. Sometimes things dont work in a mission as they work everywhere else, and sometimes the camera does its own thing.Its not a bad game, its huge and there are lots of things to do though kinda rinse and repeat but I can live with that.But arghh those controls ...Still a thumbs up, but to me this game is a 6 out of 10.
