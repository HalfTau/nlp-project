For those of you who played Assassins Creed II, you will probably like Brotherhood, as it plays pretty much the same. It starts out fun and introduces a few new features and modifications that are definitely for the better.However, as soon as one reaches Rome, it quickly gets frustrating. Me, I stopped there after a while. Heres a few reasons why its basically the same reason all over, but it gets so annoying its unbearable1 You see a lookout on the map and try to reach it. However, you quickly realize that you can not access it just because you see it on the map. Because this memory is not available.2 You want to return to a place youve been before, perhaps to get money from the bank or repair your armor? Youll notice that, other than in every other Assassins Creed before, areas youve been to will not necessarily stay available. Suddenly these areas are not available anymore.3 I feel like Im squeezed into a relatively narrow tunnel of available memory, with only a bit of space opening before me, while it closes again behind me. Everytime I stray form the path a little, I cant continue because this area is not available. Like the game is trying to get me through the missions and areas in a most linear way. Not the Assassins Creed experience I came to know and love.4 I would like to repair a building to get a lookout point. I can reach the building. However, the building is controlled by a tower. I need to destroy the tower. However, the tower is in an area that is not available. WTF?!?At this point I was sothat I actually stopped playing, because I felt mucked.Seriously, its a great game. Gameplaywise, its even better than the original Assassins Creed 2. But the way it limits the player to a rather small area really kills it for me. So much for open world.
