The story was good in the end. But the controls made it an infuriating ride. Its taken 4 years to complete this game as I did keep losing interest due to the severe number of side missions in this game. But finally pushed myself to avoid them and focus on the actual story.Combat is even easier than previous games with the addition of crossbows and guns.
