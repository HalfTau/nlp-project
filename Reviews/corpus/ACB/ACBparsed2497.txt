The game it self is a masterpicethe problem is that the community for multiplayer is very close to nonexistenta shame since the multiplayer is very simple yet very fun and will make you come back for more.you will need at least 6 players within stabil ping range in order to play a game of multiplayer.I love the game and im sad to see that almost no one plays it
