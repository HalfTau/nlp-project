I enjoyed this games campaign very much so it was very long but very enjoyable the entire time. The different styles of play this series allows is great. However once you have completed the campaign and sides missions the game really just drops since multiplayer is lacking players based on the games age. But still if you are looking for a 1525 hour long campaign with a great story this would be a game to check out. Worth the price and worth the time.
