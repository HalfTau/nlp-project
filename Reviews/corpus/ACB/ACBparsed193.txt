Terrible plotline. I was let down on all levels Ezio wasnt thinking logically throughout the whole game, the characters were inconsistant, and the missions were bogus. They did a poor job of bringing Ezio back. If they really needed to continue Desmonds plot they shouldve made a game for Desmond and not an excuse to put in Ezio.
