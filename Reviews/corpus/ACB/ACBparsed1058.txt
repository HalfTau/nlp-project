To my mind, Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a milestone in the AC franchise. The story behind this game is exceptionally done. Here, Ezio is not as young and naive as in AC II. Although the combat system tends to be uninspiring, since one can beat an entire crowd if they just hold the block button and counter at the right moment, some missions can be extremely difficult. For example, expect to make several attempts at Da Vincis missions, as its not uncommon to take damage in the arena where the tanks are fighting, rendering 100 synchronization impossible. Furthermore, the player is not able to restart a mission from the last checkpoint. All in all, I found this game to be quite enjoyable, and I believe you will, too.
