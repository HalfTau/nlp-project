Definitely my favorite Assassins Creed game. It has a great story and the setting is just terrific. My favorite part of all the Assassins Creed games is the freerunning puzzles, and this game had a ton of them! Combat was also improved, allowing you to chain executes, so that you dont need to wait to counterattack, making a really smooth and flowing gameplay. My only real critique for this game is that the crossbow makes some parts of the game too easy. A ranged silent execute is just really overpowered. However, even though the crossbow may make some missions speed by, this game still offers many hours of fun, so buy it and play it.
