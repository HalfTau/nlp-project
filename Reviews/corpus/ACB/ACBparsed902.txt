Being me, I first bought AC1 in a guitar shop for 5.99 and instantly fell in love. Silly me though, I accidently bought brotherhood instead of 2 straight after! Woops. When I played this though, I was a bit confused but I instantly fell IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME. I played it every day atleast an hour for an entire year practically. Id often play straight when I got home till  I went to sleep, this game was an instant classic for me. Its amazing, really, just play it.
