It was a good game but it doesnt hold up.It was originally one of my favourite assassin games of the 5 Ive played.I just tried replaying it today and Ive spent two hours doing 10 different follow missions and watching a ton of scripted events and unskippable cutscenes.I completely forgot about the combat mehanics, they are kind of terrible. Your best option is to stand in the middle of enemies and wait for them to attack. There is no other option as successful.The few hours of gameplay I mostly sat through were mind numbing. I quit out from boredom and frustration.Its unfortunate to me that this game doesnt hold up to time because I remember it being fun. But I choose to leave those memories intact and never play it again.I imagine the only reason someone would read a review about a game this old is if youre considering playing the series over for the story. I would highly recommend against that. This series is way too long and far too boring to play them all for the story. Just read a plot synopsis somewhere.
