Ive been a big fan of Assassins Creed series since the second game came out. Its really the best series in my opinion.However, over these years with many new games of the series came out, I still find this Brotherhood is the best of the series Well for now I still didnt try the new Origin for some reasons. Its also the best in the Ezio story.
