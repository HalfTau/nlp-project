Assassins Creed Brotherhood takes what its predecessor did and moved it further into a commanding role of the assassins. While it does hold its own missions, theres an interesting metalayer that is used to improve Romes economy and business which in turn helps you outfit you and yours.The only downside is that if you invest the time into making sure you have Rome fully supported, you practically end up swimming in money which really damages the balance of the game.Despite that flaw, its more of the same with a bit of new on top that again justifies the asking price over its predecessor, DRM not withstanding.
