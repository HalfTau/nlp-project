Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a direct sequel to Assassins Creed 2. When beginning the game you start right where you left off in AC2. Without giving too much away you leave Rome only to return where the main game takes place.In Brotherhood a new mechanic was added that let you perform kill streaks much more easily. This new feature included easier kills and the ability to immediatly take out enemies one after another. This made combat a lot faster however it felt almost too easy. The city is quite large however it is lacking in actual buildings too parkour across once outside the region.Even though the main story was quite short it is made up for in the free dlc and side quests. Hope this review has helped you form an opinion on this game. D
