Ok, where to start.AC Great gameAC II  Epic gameAC brotherhood Ok gameThe story is nice overall stuff is nice, its AC nothing more has to be said.Things i didint like  Borgia Towers Imo this is only a way from ubisoft to make the game longer nothing more no challange boring as hellRebuilding Rome No way dude, No way Total t, you get money thats nice yes i admit but it takes ages to rebuild everythingThe new idea failed in my opinion. If we would havelets say 3 citys or so like in AC 2 it maybe would adapt into the game but here one city pressing one button to rebuild.... mehWhat i loved You have your own assassinsGod mode literallyOverall Fun game6/10
