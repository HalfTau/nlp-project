This game is such disappointment after the AC2 it has so little extra game content, it should be a DLC, but even for that wouldnt have been too great.To be fair, I have to say, it has some values, and I have to highlight the parts, I liked about it.These are like the crossbow you get, and basically all the new weapons. Also you totally get the good old AC2 feeling with it, wich you probably expect when you buy this.But other then these above sadly you geta disappointing storylinebunch of  annoying missions when you have to jump on walls seeing Ezio from awkward camera positionsa horse thats useless in fights but always knows how to be in your wayloads of business and assasins order micromanagment, that has to be done, or you are financially edetc...believe me there is a lot moreto sum up this, only buy this episode if you are a huge fanboy otherwise you going to find a better piece of this series just not the Revelations, its even a bit below this one
