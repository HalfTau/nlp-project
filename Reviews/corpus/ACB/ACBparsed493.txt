Pros Awesome Game, awesome game play, awesome story, having your own assassin recruits is cool.Cons It randomly freezes when your riding a horse, cut scean audio some times gets cut out but you can fix this by pressing esc, it glitches cut sceans not making them pop up  atall, to avoid this put it on vsync the game doesnt seem to like high fps and make sure your resolution is at 60hz, if you only play the main story once you will only get around 14 hours out of this game, side quests are kinda boring just my opinion.Conclusion Its still awesome get it.
