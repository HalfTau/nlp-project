Great follow up for the best game in the series, and in my opinion the last Assassins Creed game that doesnt suck. Reasonable story, beautiful city, great design overall.What makes it actually great is the multiplayer mode. In console version, I spend over 80 hours back in the day, just playing the multiplayer. Its appearently not everyones cup of tea but if you like it, you will be spending lots of hours. It is better than AC Revelations Multiplayer because Ubisoft watered down the damn game, in order to make it more accessible. Multiplayer mode in PC still has player base, which makes it a worthwhile buy for me. If you like stealthy, sneakystabby action, then this is for you.
