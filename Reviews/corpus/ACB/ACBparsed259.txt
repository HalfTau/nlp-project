okay wtf why do i keep buying ubisoft products? i love assassins creed but their games are always buggy as all hell on PC. this game takes the cake for bugginess, i cant use my mouse at all to look around, mount horses, or fight peopleits just a bunch of bashing the buttons until they work.its not even a good game, really. its basically like if AC2 had 100 extra hours. AC2 was a really long game, man. longer than it needed to be. i loved it, but i was glad when it ended. i dont want to pick up another of the same old.and after playing Syndicate and Black Flag, you cant really return to something like this in terms of plot or scriptits basically a bunch of trite hollywoodwhere every side character is either kissing Eziosor cursing him comically.the gameplay is boring as all heck as well like..... honestly? the one thing that kept me playing for 10 hours? the horseriding. love that thing. every time i tapped V to call my horse and saw it tumbling through a crowded market at light speed like unbounded madness, my heart just skipped a beat.
