The third game in the sries introduces both the areacontrol and recruitment mechanics, which however serve as little more than a diversion, as their execution is as bland as with the rest of the side quests You recruit randomly generated nobodies with the exact same lines over and over, torch a tower one after another to liberate a district. Rest of the optional activities likewise seem to be there simply to keep the player busy, with very little consequence to the story, and also very little connection with historical events. Managing Romes economy likewise seems to figure into little besides generating income. The combat mechanics have been improved, but in a way that actually makes the already dead simple combat even easier, what with combo kills allowing for dozen of enemies to be effortlessly mopped up.Nonetheless, this game presents the turning point at which the series becomes worthwhile, both because of the more involved writing  were finally getting more insight into the First Civilisations, as well as the Templars  and more fluent controls, which make navigating the game world seem like less of a chore.
