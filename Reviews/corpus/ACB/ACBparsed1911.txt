This game I thought had been just as good as Assassins Creed II, with the exception that some of the scaleable walls dont look so obvious anymore, the graphics have improved since the last game, but does not make it easy to see knobs at all times. Sometimes there are weird camera angles, making it hard for trick jumps where they are required and controls get a bit mixed up with the camera angle as it is. Dying clothes and capes requires money, which wasnt required in the previous game. You can now have execution streaks which are always dead useful when youre surrounded, counters are now 100 guaranteed to work everytime. Some of the viewpoints are at the top of the Borgia Towers makes sense but Borgia Towers that are lv5 will have Captains that will run, which was a pain to catch. Lastly, the Armor of Brutus the best armor in the game just doesnt look very nice to me, Altairs Armor had been swag, but Armor of Brutus....eh. All in all, this was a great game and definitely should be fun for those new to the Assassins Creed series, but if you are new, I suggest you start from Assassin Creed II since Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a direct afterward of Assassins Creed II
