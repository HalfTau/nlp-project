The best Assassins Creed game yet, and with multiplayer!A must buy, if only because it has multiplayer, so pirating it means no multiplayer!And the multiplayer is fun!Oh, and obviously the single player is as awesome as youd expect from an Assassins Creed game, and its still a step forward from previous installments in the series.
