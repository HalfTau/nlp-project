This game is packed with endless side missions, quests, and features. It brings back the best of everything from its two predecessors and adds its own improvements. If Brotherhood has any weakness worth mentioning, it its that the main story loses a bit of steam in the middle with all the other stuff to do, though, you probably wont care.
