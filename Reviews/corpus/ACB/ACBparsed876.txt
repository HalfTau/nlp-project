Arguably the best game of the Assassins creed saga, its my favorite one anyways. The fighting is pretty easy and diverse enough to keep one entertained, the puzzles and brainteasers are fun and fairly challenging, and there I really like how this game increased the economy factor giving you options to buy more stuff. I also enjoyed recruiting more assassins and building up the brotherhood. The story line is fun to keep up with, and greatly links it with the previous game. A great game to play for all you sandbox/platform/hack and slash type gamers out there.
