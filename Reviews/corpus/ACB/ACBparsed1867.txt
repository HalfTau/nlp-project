If you have just finished ACII and jump right into Brotherhood, you may feel a bit weird at first. Part of this weirdness feeling is good Ezio feels older  he should be. The patchy beard, the slight comments from NPCs here and there, the louder noise he makes when he drops from a height, it all adds to the feeling that the character you have played with since his teenage days in Firenze is now close to or in his  40s  but dont worry he can still do all the good stuff. This, ageing, is not an easy thing to convey in a game and many developers will not do it at all, keeping their character closer to a young aged audience, but for a story like AC it is both needed and, in this case, well executed.The other part of the weirdness is perhaps not so good. AC Brotherhood needs time. In the beginning you feel a bit thrown into the game world without much to go on, no real idea where to begin. Perhaps that is a good thing. Ultimately, the small pieces of your work here and there begin to consolidate the picture and you start to tread on more solid ground. One point of complaint is the map and menu navigation which Ubisoft for some reason messed with from the previous game, with not so good results.Ultimately, Brotherhood continues the story from ACII nicely, deepens the plot, creates more questions but is all in all enjoyable. The recruitment of assassins adds a nice touch to the feeling that you are part of something larger and eventually  at its head.
