Another great entry in the Assassins Creed Franchise. The story was cool, the scenery was great, and the setting was awesomeits Rome. This game brought one of the biggest changes to the Assassins Creed games, htis change is the Multiplayer. Which has a really cool concept. The only bad thing about the multiplayer is that people rarely play it ive only tried to play online once, so it may have been just that one time. I would highly reccommend this game, it is on par with the first game. And far better than Revelationswhich isnt a bad game, its just really short... like i beat it in 8 hours including sidequests, and someone i know beat it in 4 hours while just doing the story.9/10
