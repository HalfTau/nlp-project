AC2s initial release didnt include sequences 11 and 12, and it seems like the only reason sequence 13 was kept in was to segue from Ezios investigation of the motives behind his familys deaths into this game, where Ezio finally brings the fight to the Borgia within Rome. The map difference is nice, being able to go from packed buildings in the commercial district to open grass plains and/or ruins, without ever needing to leave the city walls. Chain kills, a new indestructible armour, a DLC thats all about making up for missed screen time with Da Vinci, achievements that mean nothing, a memory sync meter for unlocking certain secret memories honestly not worth the extra time to 100 a lot of memories. This game should be played immediately after finishing AC2, but still be aware that it plays significantly differently.
