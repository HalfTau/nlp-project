7/10Overall not a bad expansion, Ezio is a likeable protagonist though the story is a little dull and feels a bit drawn out and padded with too many side quests. If youre looking for more ACII then this will not disappoint. Builds on the same solid gameplay as ACIISome interesting developments in Desmonds story line Main reason I played this in the first placeLeonardos warmachines are a blast/ Lots of new mechanics, to the point that at times it feels like there are too many./ Tons of side missions Played 60 hours and didnt even come close to doing them all. Good if you want to spend lots of time playing the game but they feel shallow and tacked on at times.Why would you jump that way Ezio!?!  Of course I dont want you to jump to your death, theres a ledge right there, wouldnt you like to grab it instead?!Never get to use Leonardos warmachines outside of their individual missions!Would REALLY like if the achievements showed in Steam! Not the games fault obviously.Some missions have vague objectives where youll keep failing and not really know why.Definitely recommend if you enjoyed ACII, just dont expect any ground breaking changes.
