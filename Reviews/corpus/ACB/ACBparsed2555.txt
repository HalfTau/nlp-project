The multiplayer is so different in this game, such a breath of fresh air.  You have one target from 68 people and there could be up to about 4 people that have you as a target.  You have to blend in and not give away that you are an assassin  while chasing your target.  Its brilliant!And thats not even mentioning the single player!
