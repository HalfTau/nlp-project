This game follows the story after Assassins creed 2.right after ezio exits the vault, he met uncle mario and the story of brotherhood began. In this game, ubisoft offered more side missions than AC2, the main story is shorter but more epic than AC2. There are more equiments in brotherhood than any before it, for example crossbow, poisonous darts and even parachutes.ProGraphic is okstorycharacterside missionsgameplayConbugsuplayOverall 9/10It is still my second favorite AC game
