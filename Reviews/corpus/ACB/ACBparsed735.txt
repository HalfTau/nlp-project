After an initial feeling of being stretched thin with so many things to do and tasks pulling in many directions, the game really pulls together nicely. I sincerely had been close to calling my time with it quits before finishing Mem Seq 1. It was just  an overload of content. But perseverance won out and Im glad it did. Currently through with Mem Seq 8 and have completed the majority of renovations and purchases and have a couple assassins in my brotherhood  working toward that magic number 5. Im pretty much just mapclearing before going on with the main plot thread to afford my brotherhood the chance to level up. I have the feeling that the rest of the story missions will go quite smoothly.Perhaps the opening interval made me wary of Brotherhood and its standing as a sequel to ACII, but I think it works out the kinks smoothly. A good romp through Rome.
