Excellent game, great sequel to an already awesome game and a very nice following point within the Ezio Trilogy. If you havent played the previous installment of the franchise, I strongly recommend you to do so, because this game is completely integrated with ACIIs story, so go play that game and then come back to this one.9/10, completely recommend it!
