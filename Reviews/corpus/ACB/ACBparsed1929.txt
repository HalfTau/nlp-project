Assassins Creed Brotherhood improves on its predecessor, Assassins Creed II in almost every way. The graphics are more detailed and combat systems are even more finely tuned. The commerce system is a bit distracting at first, but proves invaluable if you wish to rebuild Rome as a side mission. Give the game some time to gain its momentum because it gets more fun once you start recruiting people to join your brotherhood.
