The multiplayer is super intriguing and enjoyable but is sadly devoid of most players in it nowadays.  Rome is a beautiful locale and the attention to historical detail with a few liberties taken is quite impressive.  The assassination targets are fun, the new abilities and such are fun, but the one thing that sorta makes things frustarting is the addition of buying property and shops for income, which just becomes a bit of a chore to do and doesnt offer a substantial reward.All in all the game is wonderful to play but is slightly hampered by some collectemup side objectives.
