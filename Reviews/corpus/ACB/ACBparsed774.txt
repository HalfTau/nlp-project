Pros you can raise litttle assassin ducklings and make them into full fledged badasses who can save you when you do something stupid like aggro every borgia in italy, you get to kill templars in increasingly clever ways, and shaun/rebecca is some good stuff.Cons more forced camera angles. I do not enjoy when Im running forward and ezio suddenly takes a sharp right and plummets to his doom. If you can get past that, Id recommend it. I enjoyed the II characters that carried over, usually more than I did in II.
