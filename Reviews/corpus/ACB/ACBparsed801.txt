Assassins Creed Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio from Assassins Creed II. I would recommend this to anyone who loved the 2nd one. Its a bit shorter than the 2nd one but still amazing. The setting is in Rome so it is just as beautiful and the gameplay pretty much the same. Im off to play Revelations now!
