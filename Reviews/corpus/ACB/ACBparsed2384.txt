What a tragedy! Why, Ubi? Why did you let this game die and give it no love? ACB won several GOTY awards, and frankly if I could give one, itd win one from me, too. The atmospere is immersive, the voice acting is spectacular, and the music gives it a soul. With the exception of the controls often being the most epic boss in the game and the plot never going anywhere, story mode is worth the trip! But the MP flattens the SP by far! Vibrant, colorful, wellvoiced, well MOCAP player models and genius design, the MP is arguably the best gaming has ever seen. Unfortuantely, Ubi decided to go all COD on it, releasing another AC every year. The legendary MP that they did so well to make is now dead forever. What a shame. This game deserved to live forever like QUAKE or CS. Still recommended, just dont expect to get a MP game.
