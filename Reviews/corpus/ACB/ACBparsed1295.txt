Ubisoft games are absurd. I need to input a cdkey, i have to login to ubisoft after that and associate my email, I need to be loged in to the internet, and I need to remember my damn username and password and input it every time I want to play my OFFLINE game.Besides that the controller support is absolute crap.I will never ever buy any other game from ubisoft
