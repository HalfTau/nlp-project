Cant start the ing game because Uplay is not responding and then when I finally try to make a Uplay account 20 attempts already, I get the message that Uplay has encountered an error and has to close. I have a gtx 960 i5 6600k 16Gb Ram  Windows 10 new computer and this oldgame wont run on it because Ubisofts t Uplay doesnt function in the slightest. Its too late to return the game I should have tried to download and play it earlier. A big  you to Ubisoft. Ive been through countless forums with thousands of people that have the same issues with Uplay and no fixes. I will not be buying from Ubisoft again.
