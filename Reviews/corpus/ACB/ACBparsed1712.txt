Where to start with this game...Well, it comes straight off the heels of AC2, not missing a beat. Its expansive, has a TON of collectibles of all kinds, a massive map thats genuinely interesting and fun to explore, not to mention a handful of additional areas outside of Rome. Rome is a spawling, living, breathing city that really comes to life with purpose and function, both helping and hindering you depending on how careful you are. The social stealth is still in strong and the extent to which you can customize your appearance is also nice.The new features in the climbing and combat are welcome, making things more fluid and tactical. I liked the boss battles that dont repeat themselves or rely on simply being strong enough, instead weave story into their encounters. The story, by the way, is fantastic. The voices, both in english and Italian are also amazing. Characters are great, lovable, amusing, visuals hold up well... etc. The pluses go on.That being said... I did have a few small critiques. Not that they affect my rating, but you may have trouble associating which way is forward during some fixedcamera sequences, as well as some inconsistent behaviour by the AI and engine in general, such as guards detecting you immediately when they normally dont, or even glitching to appear out of thin air. It wasnt often enough to ruin my experience, but its not a perfect game because of these, and the sometimes frustrating requirements for 100 completion.All in all, a fantastic title and well worth playing AC2 for, I look forward to playing Revelations greatly. Highly recommended.
