What is there to say about Assassins Creed Brotherhood? Its definitely an amazing game that can entertain you for hours and still make you want to come back for more. It is such an open world game and the things to do sometimes can see limitless. The game definitely builds off of the success and completely badaery that both Assassins Creed 12 had to offer. I played this game so many times on the Xbox 360 that purchasing it for the PC was just a must. The new additions to the game make it just even better than the ones before it and it just keeps building up in a positive way. Especially with the most amazing thing they could have ever added, but I wont spoilt it If you have the extra time and money, definitely get this game. Especially if you love platforming, action/adventure, with some stealth here and there. It is very much worth it.I also recommend Assassins Creed 12 as well.EDIT I would also recommend playing this game with a controller Xbox preferred.
