Im going to keep this review as straight forward as possibleIs ACB good? On a techincal level, if not mediocre.Will you enjoy it? If you can be ok with a ton of repitition, other wise avoid or take caution.Brotherhood is probably one of the more boring games ive played, which is dissapointing considering I thought Assassins Creed 2 was quite good. All the story missions are the same thing over and over game, kill that thing, go here, dont get caught, and of course FOLLOW MISSIONS, which are one of the worst mission types for any sandbox game ever considering the stealth in this game is shoddy.In comparison to Assassins Creed 2 it is staggering how much quality has been lost.Optimization Assassins Creed 2 was nicely optomized for pc, it ran well and I dont recall many issues. For ACB the game is laggy, it looks kinda bleh at times, and the video settings keep going to their defaults every single time you reenter the game, and I found no way to fix this.Gameplay Already covered above story mission too repetitive, and not really varied. Nothing memorable here.Setting Rome is dull. The landscape is bland and honestly uninteresting. We went from the streets of Venice to the open grass lands of...Well Rome. I dont know if it might suit someone elses tastes, but I find it uninteresting.This is honestly a pretty weak game in my opinion, not bad persay, but following Assassins Creed 2 it just doesnt hold up as well, considering its more of the same plus it being incredibly boring and repetative at times. I wouldnt really recommend it that much, not even if you are trying to follow the story because the two timeline plots have simple start and end points, no real inner meat to add anything signifigant or worth noting or caring about.Worth a skip.
