AC Brotherhood is on the same level of quality as AC 2. It improves on a lot of things from AC 2 and it is overall a masterpiece in design and execution but I personally prefer AC 2 because I think the story was slightly better and I preferred Venice and Florence over Rome for the setting but I still really love Rome in this game. Just like AC 2 the recreation of the city really makes the world feel real and the attention to detail is just outstanding. The combat is much improved from AC 2 with the kill streak mechanic they added and it overall just feels more natural and free flowing. The animations are so fluid and on point its great to look at. The way Ezio dodges each attack when he counters with the hidden blade and then just going seamlessly between enemy to enemy is masterfully done. The combat in this game is the best in the series and it slowly started going downhill after this game to the point where I started to dislike the combat by the time AC Black Flag came out. Soundtrack is beautiful and just as good as AC 2s. They added so many new little features and tweaks to the overall gameplay and design just like AC2 did from AC1 that it feels like a whole new experience and not more of the same like the franchise ended up being called out for later. When people say this game is their favourite in the franchise I can definitely see why.9/10 Amazing
