Much like II, one of the only games Ive not stopped playing until I got 100. Overall a good continuation of the series, with an ever so slightly worse story than the previous ACII, it more than makes up for it by having more improved gameplay and fluidity, especially in combat.If you were into the story of ACII, about becoming a master assassin from a youthful noble, theres not much development here. If you were into the gameplay of ACII, much has been improved, from the addition of the crossbow allowing for more stealthy approaches, cinematic executions from your bare hands to two handed swords, and everything inbetween, and being able to use your pistol in a combo with the tap of a button, its much less of a chore to fight than it was in the previous games.
