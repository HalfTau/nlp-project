Brotherhood picks up right where Assassins Creed 2 leaves off and its very much more of the same  not that thats a bad thing. The animations and graphics have improved. The game has a much more fluid feel and pushed the AC storyline along nicely. Being able to restore Rome  and expand your faction houses is a nice addition.
