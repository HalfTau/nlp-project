This is a pretty decent sequel. It ties up the loose ends of 2, and I like that we get to spend some time in the present. Its got to be a stroke of genius that you get to explore Monteriggioni in the present as Desmond. Inventory management is a lot better, you can equip different weapons without having to go all the way back to your safehouse. Its also pretty neat that you get to form your own guild of assassins.One thing I didnt like is the shop quests system, which requires you to collect trinkets like wool and tomatoes just so you can buy a sword thats relevant to the game, and the specific trinkets are hard to come by. It requires you to grind and loot and hunt for chests which takes away from the fun.I also didnt like the addition of random encounters, especially since they increase notoriety. I dont want to have to digress from the quest Im on to kill a bunch of guys and hunt down posters to tear down. It gets really old, really fast.
