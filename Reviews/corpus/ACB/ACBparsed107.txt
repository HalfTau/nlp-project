The best assassins creed to date. 100 Syncronization will take around 3040 hours depending on how good you are. A new mechanic that was added is being able to have your own assassins. They help a lot when doing hard missions but sometimes make it too easy. Controls seem a lot smoother than its predecessors but I do recommend using a controller as I had a hard time adjusting to the mouse and keyboard controls. I used an Xbox one controller and it worked well. Overall the main plot is interesting and hypes you up for assassins creed revelations and 3.
