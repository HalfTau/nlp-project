Im a bit upset with the fact that most of the time I played the game in offline mode, losing about 5060 hours of hours that could of displayed on my profile... Why am I upset? Because it doesnt show how much I LOVE THIS GAME! Now, before playing this I played every other Assassins Creed title on the Xbox360... clearly it didnt do it justice, the assassins creed stories were amazing on the console yes... But the PC was a whole other level! And some of the graphics modifications for Brotherhood online just make me wish I lived in 1500 Rome.
