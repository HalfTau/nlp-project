Terrible i want my money back, I have a Dell XPS 18 All in One. Its not terribly slow, but isnt terribly fast. I downloaded This game excited to play it, But EVERYTIME the UPLAY launcher opens up, it says that the program has stopped working than Crashes, Ive redownloaded this game more than 4 times and even tried it without updating it, and it worked when it wasnt updated. But didnt want to allow me to play the game without signing in. I just want my money back at this point.
