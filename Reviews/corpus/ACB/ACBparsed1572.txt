Assassins Creed Brotherhood ultimately is another Assassins Creed game. These games sit on the borderline between recommendation and nonrecommendation for me theyre okay games, and do solid enough stuff, but also contain an unpleasantly large amount of tedium in them which isnt much fun. Some of the missions are solid, some of them are boring, and overall the game is kind of variable in how good it is over its length.I dont really regret playing these games, but it is hard to really recommend them either, as while the conspiracy ideas underpinning the game are neat, and the game is cool in places, theres a lot of time spent doing things which just arent very interesting.Overall grade C
