One of the most broken games Ive played. When I heard that people thought this game was great I had high hopes, however it appears to be the worst of all the series.I had a section of the game that if I failed stealth the game would crash.The cannon section at the start is incredibly unforgiving.The port is terrible and controls make no sense. for those of you just saying I should play with a controler, this proves its a bad port and the only thing a controller fixes is this part.A gap that Ezio can cross one time wont work the next time you try it.I jumped onto a ledge with a horse that was about 30cm 12 of the ground and it couldnt get off the ledge.The camera changes to an awkward angle the worst moments and the slightest movement of the mouse makes it look like a 2year old with a handy cam.While the camera changes the directions dont work the way you would expect and you can often jump to your death.This is a buggy piece of Bovine Fecal Matter and unless you care about the overall Assassins Creed story avoid at all costs.
