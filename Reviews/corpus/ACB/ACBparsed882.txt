This isnt a standalone game, despite it being marketed as one. This is in essence, an expansion.The game is gloriously long, it adds more beautiful things to what 2 did, it takes a step back from travelling through several zones and tries to flesh one out properly, and succeeds.It feels like the primary reason for this installment was to promote story, while also satisfying the publishers greedy demands for moar money, to siphon the excitement 2 created. Still worth it though.The only real qualm I have with this game is that it can at times become too monotonous, where you do the same thing again and again to get  some small unlockable progress, but such is the nature of the series and it is a trend I have yet to see it move away from.
