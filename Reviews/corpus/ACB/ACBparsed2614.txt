Highly addictive game involving parkour and blades.  If you can look past the hilarious italian accents, youll get hooked and play it WAY too much.  To the point where you actually start to believe you can jump and climb overjust as easily as that guy on the screen does.So, old people and small children unable to attempt parkour without dying should not play this game.  Agile and athletic people such as myself, however, are fully aware of what is at stake.  You can totally make that jump.  Do it.
