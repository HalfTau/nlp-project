Amazing storyline, theres a new system where you start an assassin order, you send them on contracts or fight along side you. You have the Rome economy where you build up Roma by buying shops, POI and collections of weapon and armour. It helps to you income. I love the storyline of enzo and the time period in Italy so heritage rich.There is multiplayer but currently not worth it as servers are dead. If you want to play any creed then it black flag
