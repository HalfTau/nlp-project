Excellent game, combat is fluid and enjoyable, think batman arkham asylum, yet not overly simple. I love the parkour gameplay and they do an excellent job of making it fluid and easy to master. AC 2s story was more engrossing, but ACB has more overall, and has more of a sandbox feel to it. I recommend doing the virtual training early on in the game to understand the gameplay mechanics, and I recommend using the dual hidden blades for most combat as it is not only the most effecient at killing but also the most enjoyable to watch. However it seems that multiplayer is dead for this game now, so that sucks.
