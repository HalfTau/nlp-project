While the changes are not as drastic as the ones from the first Assassins Creed to the second,Brotherhood goes a nice way to improve upon the already extremely solid formula cemented by its predecessor.Combat is made quicker and flashier through the ability to use both meele and longrange weapons together and the introduction of a chainkill mechanic. The Assassin recruits create a simple, yet surprisingly engaging past time that pays off big in the long run and for those who enjoyed renovating Ezios villa in the last game, there is now the entirity of Rome to do as you please with. Even with all this, there is no doubt that this does feel like Assassins Creed 2 2, but when the changes that are there build so well upon the last game all the same, one cant really complain.
