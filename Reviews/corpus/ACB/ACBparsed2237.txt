GG! D Continues the story of Ezio Auditore in his quest against the Templar scum. The Assassins liberate the city from the hands of the church. Many cool additions since AC2 such as having assassins do your bidding, new weapons like a crossbow, better ways of getting around Rome via fast travel, etc. improves upon every aspect of AC2. Now I cant wait to get ACR then AC3 but when they are on sale like this one was.
