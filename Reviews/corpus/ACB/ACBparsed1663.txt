First of all Ubisoft failed at Macing this game, WARNING Mac Users Do Not Buy This Easily!!! Check System requirements! !I have mavericks and it took a long time to fix it, I had to replace several things including the game launcher. After I fixed AC brotherhood, it was quite awesome. A delicate open world stealth game, with graphics better than the games made in 2014, and of course frustrating parkour that makes u look cool. Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio Auditore Da La La La in Rome, with intense main storyline, and lots and lots of side missions. Once again I have to warn mac users that before you buy this game think twice, or you can add me on steam, ill tell you how to fix it.
