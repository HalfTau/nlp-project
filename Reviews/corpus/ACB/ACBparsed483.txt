As my personal favorite of the series, Brotherhood perfects and expands upon many of Assassins Creed 2s features. Riding through town, fasttravel points within the city, kill streaks, brutal new animations and missionreplayability are some of its many improvements, fixing a few negativities I found in the previous game.Instead of just rebuilding his family villa, Ezio is tasked with liberating a Borgiaoppressed Rome and bringing it to its former glory, with the help of not only a few old friends, but of a new Brotherhood as well. Assist citizens in need and watch them rise through your ranks, ultimately shaping Master Assassins to aid you in your quest. The main antagonist is ambitious, vicious and ruthless, stopping at nothing to achieve his goals, which, in turn, make his every appearance exciting.Unlike former entries, Brotherhood offers a wide variety of interesting side quests, such as excellent tombs to explore, advanced war machines to destroy and templar agents to silence, even though they mask the rather short length of the main story. Rome is filled with great sights, which help make every area feel distinct from the last, and, for the avid completionists, accomplishing eveything didnt feel as great a chore as Assassins Creed 2 did, although the reasons for that may vary according to each player.
