a great game that brings back many memories. although it gets me thinking as to how is it that im getting frame drops between 1533fps every single damn time i start to play the game in open world and it stays between 1329fps on previews. it bugs me aas i have an intel hd 5500u gpu and a core i5 duo with 2.7ghz max and 8gb ram!! its an old game but really, it requires more than what i got? its rediculous! i tried running on very low settings and still get the sme results and very high as in maxing everything out is the same except i get little flashes as if my game will crash. it does not skip when running down to 15fps but rather good enouph yt it still frustrates me at the thought of it. i recommend this game if you love the series and if you have the hardware. ill be keeping this copy, but i just hope AC3 wont dissapoint in framerate as well.
