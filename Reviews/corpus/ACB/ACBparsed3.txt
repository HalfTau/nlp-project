What I hate the most are games specifically made to  with you. Every  mission is preceded by equally  unskippable cinematic. I swear to god I spent at least 1 hour of the 45 Ive played watching cinematics. Even the damn map takes 2 seconds to visualize because, of course, you have to watch a  animation.I beg of you people, do not make my mistake and give Ubisoft money. Better spend them on crack, booze and hookers.
