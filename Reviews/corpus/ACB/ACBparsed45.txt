The best entry in the Ezio triliogy.  Youre an unstoppable killing machine thanks to the chain kill mechanic and having recruits at your disposal is a great addition.  Story isnt as deep as the previous entry but still plenty enticing to want to see it through.  Romulus story and temples are a bit awkward from the story perspective but provide a good refresher to the assassin tombs.
