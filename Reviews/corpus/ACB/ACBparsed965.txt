Unfortunately I dont get to rate the game as the designers intended because stupid Ubisoft didnt include controller support for the Mac version. Be aware, after much searching online, I have not been able to find a solution to this. How dumb a problem is this ot be having? Its 20ing15. If I could control the game, itd probably be super fun.Please also know my review only pertains to the OS X version of the game.
