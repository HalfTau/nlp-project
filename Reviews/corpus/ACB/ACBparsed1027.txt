At first, I was confused with the multiplayer addition  I thought all those awesome guys on the cover are to be assassins, alas, they are your targets in singleplayer portion of the game. Despite this, the real brotherhood was something new and experimental. As usual, I would list the best points from the gameIn my opinion, this game has the weakest soundtrack from the series, save for some tracks, it is quite repetitive I believe this is due to the fact that we are in the same city and the need to differentiate does not arise.Also, because of unknown reasons only in Steam version, two missions are bugged  the final mission, unable to interact with Cesare after climbing the siege tower, and locked controls during flying the bomber. Dont know if I am the only one who encountered this problem.Still, it is a good sequel to Ezio story, recommend it.
