I waited 5 hours to download  8GB worth of data only to find out that I could not play this game..I do not recommend this game simply because Uplay the system by which assassins creed brotherhood is launched from crashes incessantly when I want to play it........Which is a real shame because this particular stealthy variant of Assassins creed looked like so much fun to play!Its ridiculous that I cant play a good 2011 game in 2014. Ill try troubleshooting launching this game again tomorrow........Will probably uninstall it if unsuccessful..
