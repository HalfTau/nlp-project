very fun game with minor mechanic issues.youll sometimes find yourself trying to climb walls but instead ezio will run up the side as if there were no ledge and drop back down. when theres a low climbing spot hell sometimes run up the wall over the rooftop ledge like theres an invisible wall above the roof. its also difficult to change direction on a rail to try and jump off. most of the time you have to come to a complete stop and turn ezio the direction you want him to leap for him to actually do it or else hell keep running straight on the rail even though your camera is clearly facing the direction you want him to go. the a and d keys really had no effect on this problem. in ac2, this problem was non existent. other than that, this game is very fun.
