So first off, Uplay. Ew. And figuring it out can be a pain. But Brotherhood is an excellent game. Traversing Rome which is absolutely gorgeous by way of the roofs, streets, or on horseback is enjoyable. The combat system is fluid and easy to master while still being fun. You start the game feeling like a badass and end feeling like an even badasser badass. Slowly taking over the city and recruiting and upgrading your assassins is gratifying. The missions arent incredibly varied though some differ incredibly, like the ones with Leonardo da Vincis war machines but they remain fun, because, again, you feel like a badass. Id definitely recommend this game, even at full price.
