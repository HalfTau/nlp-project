A continuation of the second games story that doesnt do anything different.Gameplay  3Graphics  4Story  4UI  3Replay Value  2Overall  3GripesGame felt more like DLC than a sequel, doesnt do much other than continue the story.In DebthAs I stated, the game doesnt do much more than continue the story. And while I realize its a sequel, a good sequel should bring something new to the table while preserving the thing that made the original entertaining. The game basically just continued the story and gave Edzio a few new toys.If you want to play the Assassin Creed games for the storyline and you should, then you should play this game. Its still fun, its just a bit tiring in the gameplay department since weve done all of this already.
