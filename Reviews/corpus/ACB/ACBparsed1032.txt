Brotherhood... where do I start, So a about 20 minutes ago I wrote a review on AC2, if I where you I would read that and then read this. ACB took everything that was good about AC2 and added a little more, the world no longer has multiple cities and takes place only in Rome. A new mechanic has been added where the player can save citizens kind of like in AC1, after saving the citizen they can be added to the Assassins guild. These assassin recruits can be summoned in combat. ACB has a slow story in the begining, but as the story heats up it gets better. Im kind of bored so Im gonna stop writing, its a great game so get it10/10EDIT oh and it added muliplayer
