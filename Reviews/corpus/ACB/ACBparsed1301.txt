I just couldnt be bothered to finish this. Assassins Creed 2 was long and tedious enough that even a fistfight with the Pope and a crazy twist ending barely justified it, and here were right back to the mapclearing trudge. I might be missing another wacky ending or a multiplayer mode that does a nice reimplimentation of The Ship, but the core of the game is so tired at this point that I simply cant reccomend it.Play the first one instead, at least that one has tension and some charm between the sloppy mechanics.
