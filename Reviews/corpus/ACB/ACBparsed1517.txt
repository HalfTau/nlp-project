Ive only just been introduced to the AC series by some friends at school, and ALL of them said that Brotherhood was their favourite AC game. I agree 100. Its not only one of the best AC games, its also my FAVOURITE single player story game EVER. The graphics quality is great, the storyline is amazing, the combat is unreal, and all the Training Missions and Multiplayer modes are AWESOME!!! Definitely Recommended.
