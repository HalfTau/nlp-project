Continuing the trilogy of semiyoung assassin, Ezio. Struggling with fighting templars and securing the Apple of Eden. Not quite as long and complex as second Assassins Creed II, although it is still great. Controls did not come through a lot of changes from previous Assassins Creed games. Nice graphic style, and Roma looks so good on high details. We work in the dark to serve the light, we are Assassins.
