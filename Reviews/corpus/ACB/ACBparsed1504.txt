A pretty fun game, if you can get past the utter ing hell that is Uplay which right off the bat wouldnt let me start the game, and then after that never allows me to have sound unless I forcefully close it. Oh wait and a few more things, there is only full screen mode, you cannot play multiplayer with anything less than 6 players, there arnt very many people even playing multiplayer, and all the menues themselves appear to have been made by someone trying to make this as much of a pain in theas possible. But the game itself is accualy quite fun once you get past all that.
