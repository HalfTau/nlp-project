My favorite Assassins Creed game, until 4 came out. While Brotherhood does feel like a well polished game at most points, there are times when Ezio will do something I swear I didnt mean him to. It can be very frustrating when he jumps out at 90 degree angles and whatnot. Overall, there arent too many collectables to where it feels like a hunt and find like later Assassins Creed games, but there are enough to keep you entertained. The brotherhood aspect feels amazing, and the ability to recruit and train assassins makes this rate above 1,2,revelations, and 3. The sailing aspesct of 4 really captured me, but this game is amazing otherwise. Some of the missions will challenge you, and make you swear like a sailor, but oh well. One of my favorite games in a nostalgic sense, and one of my favorite assassisns creed games.
