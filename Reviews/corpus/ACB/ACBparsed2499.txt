Assassins Creed Brotherhood is what I would consider a very good expansion to AC2. Ubisoft refined the combat system and the storyline is as enticing as ever. Sure, the Desmond parts are just the usual acrobatic feats but its great. Ezio, now in his 40s and an experienced Assassin heads to Rome, and Rome is huuuuuge! I wont waste time on the SP experience as I loved it. As for the story? It was good but it doesnt top AC2 in terms of the wowfactor.The Mulitplayer is what shocked me. Its so fun. Its really fun! I thought it would fail but it didnt and I cant get enough of it! Sure you have the nooby roof runners which willyou off and the MP will get on your nerves and have you raging, but its great nevertheless. 8/10 from me overall.
