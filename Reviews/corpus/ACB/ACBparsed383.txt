I had forgotten the AC franchise didnt get good until ACIII. The early Assassins Creed games and Chronicles make me cuss at my computer more than any other game series. Your character never moves the way you want him to, the combat is wonky, block is the same button to run so there are times where your character will just stand there. Parts are fun sure, and Im going to beat it but damn, it doesnt deserve the 89 it has on Steam. The controls ruin it. ACIII and ACIV are where its at.
