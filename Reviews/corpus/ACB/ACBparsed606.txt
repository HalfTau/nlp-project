It falls short of Assassins Creed 2, but It was better than Assassins Creed Revelations and Assassins Creed 3.In terms of gameplay it takes the same formula of Assassins Creed 2 and refresh it.In terms of plotline, well, think of it as a really big standalone expansion to ACII.In terms of graphics, they aint the best, but when the game was released the graphics were top of the line.
