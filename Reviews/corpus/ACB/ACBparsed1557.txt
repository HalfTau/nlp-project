Fun to play but extremely bad bugs exists, tip is to turn graphics to console specs i.e. do not have above 60Hz on the graphics and so on. Otherwise youll have huge troubles with one of the L missions to avoid spoilers.Theyve skimped on quality assesement and its noticeable through the whole game.... suspect some frustrating times parkouring.Big two minuses are the bugs and the story, and the story part is probably just not my cup of tea.Otherwise a really good game!
