Out of the series, this is my favourite so far. Familiarity of AC 2s HUD system and combat mechanics with additional ingame features such as building up your very own troupe of Assassins and sending them on missions to gain levels and become more powerful. One of my favourite features was having the Assassins at my beck and call to terminate any tricky targets or just to troll the guards for a bit of fun. Great continuation of the story so far with even more intrigue thrown in and questions raised. Definitely a worthy addition to your AC collection, or just a fun game all around.
