Only AC I played on a pc and its by far my favourite. The controls can be a bit weird at first but I think its very easy to get used to them. I remember that the story was amazing and that the wall climbing was awesome too. Thats basicly it, a good game with good mechanics and a cool story.Bye, Zan
