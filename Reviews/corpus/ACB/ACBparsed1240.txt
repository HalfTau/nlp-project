Its legitimately better than Assassins Creed II.  While Assassins Creed II may have had more locales to explore, Brotherhoods single locale is straight up better.  The samey environments of II cant stand up to running across aqueducts and seeing the Colliseum for the first time.  So as far as environments go, it blows II out of the water.Now I know you all like bullet points, so let me run some bullet points on you.ProsConsIf you like Assassins Creed, Brotherhood is a must.  If you hate Assassins Creed, this game wont change your mind one bit.
