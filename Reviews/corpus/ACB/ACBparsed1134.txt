Like with II has problems confusing its self with 360 to side scroll movements at times, not terrible, worth the cost now, not have said go for it as a new game. It also continues that annoying hard to escape turn based almost battle system. The glyphs are rifts and more annoying. Not mandatory, but this is where  sync effects most story events first happens. Hated that too. Its got a slightly better flow than most.
