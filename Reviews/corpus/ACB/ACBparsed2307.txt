Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a great game. I liked the story and enjoyed exploring Rom. I remember that I often lost track of time while playing, wanted to finish just this one quest and ended up spending another hour. Some of the quests are very challenging and others are very easy, but almost all of them are fun. There were a few quests I needed more time to figure out how to solve them.I also tried the Multiplayer Part, but had a similar problem like I had with Splinter Cell. Other than with Splinter Cell I at least found a friend online, but couldnt make it work. I do play a lot of other Multiplayer games and had only problems with Ubisoft games so far. I know that I am not the only one, found many posts in forums and on blogs about that subject and think Ubisoft needs to make it easier for players to enjoy the Multiplayer portion of their games.But I still can recommend this game, because the single player is fun and will keep you occupied for some time.
