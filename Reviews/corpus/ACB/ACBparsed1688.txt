I enjoyed the story, but it was too short and less exciting than Assassins Creed IIs in my opinion, but still very nice and absolutely worth 20  I bought the Digital Deluxe I am playing this with HP Laptop with Win8, and works well, though the FPS is still a bit laggy.Ive never tried the Multiplayer, and not gonna try as long as I am excited about the story After Credits.
