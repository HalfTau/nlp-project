Fun but not renewing.And therein lies the problem of allCreed games theyre good games with the exception of AC1 but they do the same thing over and over. AC2 was good, so in this game they copy AC2 and just add more distractions. And the game after this one does it again, but with even MORE distractions!Ill expect you know at least a little about ACs gameplay from one of the five games. And thats all there is, in this game. Its just... More Assassins Creed. Its never boring though.The story revolves around Ezios fight with the Borgia. The underlying, hugely boring and complicated story about Desmond as well, but to be honest, noone pays any attention to that. Noone has more than a vague understanding of it anyway. And considering itll take 5 games to reach the end of that boring and vague connecting story, why bother?So is this game fun? Yes. If youve played AC2, and youre looking for more, thisll give you just that. If youre completely new to the AC franchise, get AC2 instead.The free Da Vinci DLC is fun but not worth interrupting the main story for. My advice is pick a few side quest storylines to follow, then do the main story. If you still want more by the time youve finished it, do the other stuff too.The Good Still fun, Assassin buddies are very useful, does what AC does well.The Bad More of the same, freerunning can occasionally feel really slow and clumsy, far too muchto do, Subject 16 puzzles get mathy and really hard with little to no payoff in the end, UPLAY.6,5/10
