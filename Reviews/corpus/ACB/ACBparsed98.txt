I really dont understand why this is regarded like one of the highlights, if not the one game in the series that truly demostrated the quality of this games.Ive played through the entire thing a couple of years ago on my ps3, and hated it.I decided to give in another go now that im on pc, but my opinion towards the game hasnt changed much, if at all, maybe it has even worsen in comparison to my original assessment that this game simply was mediocre at best...I find it to be a mess in its pacing, fitting cutscenes in the middle of gameplay, provinding minutes of actual control,  only to remove it right after, everything its cosntantly switching back and foward between scenes that dont really contribute, nor tell you anything relevant to the story, or to the characters.Luckily you can skip most of them, keep in mind I said MOST, others youll simply have to sit down and watch because thats the way the developers intender for it to happen.It isnt even done to hide loading times, given thay often times just skipping the cutscene lands you into a loading screen that probably, depending, wont last more than a couple of seconds...Then theres the gameplay, this is I believe the first, and only, Assassins Creed game that I found to be frustrating, principally because there are certain missions that impose you a certain way of playing, they removed other aspects about the overall liberties you could take as a player, in the way you would tackle certain objectives.If that wasnt enough the first, true, indepth gameplay sequence that you get in the game its a massive battle in which you take control over cannons that you use to defend a fortress, by shooting at the upcoming... Cannons.Only to then be thrown yet again into another cutscene, so on, and so forth.Its as if the developers treated this game as an interactive movie, rather than a game.And dont tell me this is a game that focuses more into the narrative, and just because of its intention I should be contempt settling for a product that I simply dont find enjoyable for the reasons Ive stated before.I thoroughly enjoyed Assassins Creed 2, Black Flag, and even, for a bit, Revelations, and Rogue.But thats because those games understood, and respected my time, and the way they could fullfill it with incredible interactive experience, whilst, simultaneously presenting a compelling, and interesting narrative.This however doesnt offer that to me.If you have a nice time with it, then so be it.I didnt, I respect your experience, how sad that maybe some of you wont respect mine...
