Brotherhood in a way is a great sequal to Assassins Creed 2, the story picks up literally right where you left it in the 2nd game. Graphics are a bit more refined but still retain the same quality and style as the 2nd making the transition to this one easier I feel than the transition to Revalations. Story wise it is gripping and intersting, very enjoyable and rewarding system of gaining assassins and watching them grow up under your wing into ruthless effective killers.Most certainly worth it, even though im a bit slow to get through the Assassins Creed games, I still agree that these games are worth checking out.
