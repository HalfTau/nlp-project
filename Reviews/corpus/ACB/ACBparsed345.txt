First off, Id like to mention, this is the second game in a TRILOGY  Ezios trilogy.So you gotta play them in order. You cant directly start with Brotherhood.I see a lot of questions in the forums asking this.Thats like asking if one can watchbefore watching.Orbefore even watching.You might enjoy it but it wont be the same.Apart from that, theres hell lot of side missions in Brotherhood than there were in AC2  Borgia Towers, Templar Agents, Leonardos War Machines, Christinas missions.If youre the kind of person who does side missions as you come across them, you might take forever to complete the story.I remember there used to be these instances where, say, I would tell my friend A huge AC franchise fan Im at sequence 3 and after a week hed ask me again and Id still be on sequence 3. And hed be like,Naturally, with all the extra missions and the new Investments feature, its much easier to earn money in Brotherhood than in AC2.Story wise, I feel I liked AC2 better since I got to see a transition in Ezio there  from the naive Ezio to Assassin Ezio. But I liked the gameplay of Brotherhood better  more to do and easy to earn and spend.
