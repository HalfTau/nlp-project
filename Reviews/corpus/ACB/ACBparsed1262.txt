I played ACB immediately after AC2, and the game was way above what I had expected. Nearly all good parts of AC2 were kept and some flows were improved tooespecially the combot execution system. The Assassin recruit system is very awesome, I litearally yelled when I used a recruit to easily assassinate my mission target. The recruits provide a lot of help during combat and I sometimes think that  they are better assasins than me. However, the game seriously lacks custimization for the recruits, which is very disappointing. All recruits look pretty much the same once they reach max level. This is very different from the trailer where Ezio have different looking recruits holding different weapons on his side. The main storyline is pretty short compared to that of AC2. In order to compensate this, ACB has a ridicuously large amount of side missions for players to experience, although some are not that fun to play. Assasinating in ACB is easier compared to AC2 as players can easily use the crossbow and hidden balde poison to kill targets from distance without being detected. Although you can see I am criticizing the game from different angles, I have to say, ACB is definitly a good game that every AC fan should consider buying, as it has too much good parts that I cant explain simply in this review.
