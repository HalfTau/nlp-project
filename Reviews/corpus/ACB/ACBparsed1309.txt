Assassins creed broterhood is a good game with a wonderful graphic and with a faithful reproduction of the Rome in the 15th century.Unfortunately I  have not felt the same empaty like in the previous chapters of Asssassins creed,maybe because also if the story by itself is not bad at all,it is not the main part of the game ,It is more a killing  a captain to free a zone by the Borgia influence,without any strategy or story and so far for the major part of the game, not involving a real sense in your action!So...you can buy it and have hours of fun,considering the presence of a nice multiplayer too,but about me is a little step down in confront the other 2 previous Assassins creed games!My vote 7/10!
