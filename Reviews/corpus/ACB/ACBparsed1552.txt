The third game in the Assassins franchise, Brotherhood, introduces Ezio to well uhm the Brotherhood! The first few games of the franchise are the best in my own opinion, as they introduce a very interesting and different approach to the everyday game. Brotherhood stands out to its predecessors due to the fact that you can train other assassins and send them out to do missions.Interesting storyline with real lifeinspired factsParkour and freerunning over the roofs or RomeGreat progression of protagonist he ages as you playStill has the Assassins Creed vibe to itThe Uplay business is bearable but quite annoyingNo Steam AchievementsNo Trading Cards Emotes/BackgroundsSome missions can be really frustrating
