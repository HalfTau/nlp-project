I am rather upset at Uplay and my inability to play the Assassins Creed series I purchased during the steam summer sale. Had I been aware that I need another third party login that has shoddy uptime at best I would not have purchased this product. I am a fan of this series and would have loved to have played the PC port but alas Uplay denies me access. I wish I could refund this product.
