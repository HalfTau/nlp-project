Since this is my first Assassins Creed game Ill unfortunately have little to say about how it compares to other AC titles.So I really enjoyed the fighting mechanics in this game! Sure it takes getting used to, but once you do the counterchaining flows like water  halberd and spear wielding guys lol.The climbing did prove be be troublesome at times jumping at walls when I thought Id jump not into a wall. At times Ezio will just sit there clinging to a lefge like What? YOU need to move ten pixels to the left for me to grab that next ledge KAppa. BUUUT I love freerunning climbing games uncharted, tomb raider, etc. and when it does go fluidly its staisfying as hell.The economy system and all of the guild challanges were fun extra content for me to obsessively do/invest in and gave me a sense of RPG elements. I like RPGs so take that as you will 1million funbucks, and growing D. A few of the guild challenges did feel a bit tacked on and not concievably achievable through normal gameplay of the main storyline stupid clowns.The characters are pretty cool. Since I have like no context for the story Ill just say I liked enough to want to know more about it. I really like the ideas that the AC games seem to be trying to convey. Im a sucker for cheesy SciFi miss you Eureka.From watching a BrownMan Ray 3 video of AC1 I do see that AC Brotherhood has some nice menu/design/gameplay changes. Its also nice that it seems to have dropped the requirement for doing side missions to further the main story. Though I pretty much banged out all the side stuff I could inbetween main story missions, I did enjoy the open world feeling to the quest progression.Yep. I liked it a lot and hopefully you will too D.
