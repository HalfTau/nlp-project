The best game in the series. A wellpolished adventure experience set in the Rennaisance Rome without the usual AC bugs and camera issues that were present in the previous games. Fascinating  engaging story, various side missions, smooth combat mechanics and fantastic graphics that hold great against time.My overall rating 9/10p.s. And, contrary to what others say, it does work on Windows 10
