Now, I never played Assassins creed 1, and my memories of the second are blurry at best, but while all the ones Ive played since certainly has their own pros and cons, Brotherhood is my favourite. Revelations had in my opinion the best parcour curtesy of the hook, 3 has one of the best story climaxes Ive ever seen in my game, 4 certainly is a great pirate game but being in it for the stabbing in bathrobes, I find it a touch lacking and Unity certainly is the one where the city feels like a living, breathing city. But Brotherhood is the only AssyCreedy where I genuinly lost myself in the simple act of playing the game, from running around to stabbing to fighting to football team management. So I like itI guess the reviewer term would be its the most immersive one.
