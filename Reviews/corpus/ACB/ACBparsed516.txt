Best Assassins Creed gameOkay normally I dont write reviews but this game was an exception.I couldnt believe how good it was, the game I played before this was Unity so I was kinda not wanting to play more assassins creed but I did, I I have NO regrets. The game is simple but not too easy, its got a freakin amazing storyline, weapons are SO badass. This is like number four on my top ten list, freakin play it!!!
