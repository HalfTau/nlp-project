My personal favorite of the AC games I have played, we see Ezio at the top of his game. Unlike the previous game where the Quest For Revenge was occasionally hard to follow, the quest lines all link back to the single goal. Theres a good amount of humor in it too, which saves it from being yet another game about a man with facial hair frowning from a distance. The controls are still a little difficult on PC, but not insurmountable. This game cannot be shared through Family Sharing. If you liked Ezios spirit and determination in 2, youll appreciate his strategic prowess and maturity in Brotherhood.
