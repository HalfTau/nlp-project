In my humble opinion, this is the best episode of this franchise. Its a shame, that the Coppernicus conspiracy DLC is not available for PC. Anyway, Ive played this through multiple times, and still love the gameplay, the story and the locations it takes place in.I can recommend it to anyone, but before you start it, first play through ACII, so you develop an attachment to the character and understand the story.
