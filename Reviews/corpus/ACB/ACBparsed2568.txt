I waited for a sale to buy this game, as I was expecting it to be only focused on multiplayer and having a meager singleplayer campaign, with not much to add. Boy, was I wrong. Not only it improves on ACII playability fixing the combat system, it is as big, if not bigger, than its predecessor. With better city design, quests and antagonists cesare borgias if I want to take, I take speech is brilliant and beautifuly delivered, this is my favorite Assassins Creed game.
