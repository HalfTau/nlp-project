Assassins Creed Brotherhood is essentially a large expansion to Assassins Creed II. However, do not let that determine your impression. Brotherhood is a fantastic game, building upon Assassins Creed II while resolving issues from the previous title simultaneously. Renaissance Rome is also truly and remarkably beautiful, as is the seamless combat when finally mastered. The multiplayer support is a little shakey, at best, but the single player campaign is worth the purchase on its own.
