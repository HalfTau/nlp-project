I actually prefer AC Brotherhood to AC II, though thats not to say I didnt like AC II. I really liked the story line in AC II so the continuation of that story in this episode kept me engaged throughout. Some missions do get repetative but there were some additions made to Brotherhood that helped seperate it from AC II.If youve never played an Assassins Creed game I would highly recommend this one, after you finish AC II. If you just play the main story missions you will still get a solid experience from this series but if youre someone who likes to complete all of the side quests and collect all items you will spend a lot of time enjoying this game.
