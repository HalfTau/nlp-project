Technically the third in the Assassins Creed series, this expands even more the realm of the assassin including forming and recruiting for an assassin guild single player mode. If you love stealing from the poor, you should probably be a politician, if you love murdering guards and politicians, you should probably be locked behind bars, if you love doing both then this game is for you.My favorite part, you can now kick someone in the nads until they die...I just cant stop laughing
