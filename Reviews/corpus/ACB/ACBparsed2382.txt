For only one area you deal in Rome its so in detail its almost amazing. The characters look wonderful and I have to say, Ezio, Desmon and even the Altair outfit for Ezio looks great. They really should have used the models for Revelations. At times it does almost feel like a DLC for AC2, but I feel that it holds up on its own as a separate game. I only wished I had known my username for UBIsoft UPlay would be the username I used to sign up, meaning Im stuck with a name I would rather not have causing me to really be unable to enjoy the Multiplayer aspect. All in all, definitely a game I would reccomend along with all the others in the series.
