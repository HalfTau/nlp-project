 multiplayer is fun... ... when you can wait 5 to 10 minutes for match making and stuff like that assassins recruits assassins recruits  you dont need them. I mean youre the boss in the ring, no enemy matchs you. and now, you can sit on your horse, call your recruits on your enemies and look bored like a boss to many boring side missions the main missions are also boring the whole singleplayer game feels like an addon for the multiplayer mode I couldnt follow the story anymore, I dont understand the ending and I dont really care the glyph riddles are very boring
