Just as much fun content as Assassins Creed II, and the same basic ideas and gameplay too, but not as well put together. The main story doesnt drive you to the more fun missions in the game. Do run around and find every Leo mission and clear every borgia tower.Worth playing if you enjoyed the second game, but if you passed that one up, dont pick this over it.
