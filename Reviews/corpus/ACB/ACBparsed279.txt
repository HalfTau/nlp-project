Like Assassins Creed 2 and ACRevelationsplayed it first by accident, Brotherhood has a great plot, relatable characters, beautiful reconstructions of medieval city states, professional voice actings, and great soundtracks.But.....................................................The control of ACs Ezio franchise has more than once made me want to eat my mouse. Why is the horses sides the only places to mount? What if Ezio is in a hurry to catch somebody? Why cant I shove the attacker off Ezio by pushing shift  LMB most of the time? The game is VERY enjoyable when you arent in a hurry to take someones head off, but if there is a time limit and/or the target is in an awkard location...oofOther than that, great games.
