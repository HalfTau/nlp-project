More stuff for Ezio to do and new equipment to do it with. The camera control issue is still there. I havent tried the multiplayer aspect, but it has received decent reviews from those who have. The game gets a bit repetitive in places and a few side missions are quite frustrating mainly due to camera control. The good folks at Ubisoft might have tried to bring in more than was really good for the game, but its well worth the time to play with enough variety to keep it from becoming a complete disappointment. Get it if you can catch it on sale.
