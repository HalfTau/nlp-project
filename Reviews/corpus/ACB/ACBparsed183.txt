I didnt enjoy this game. I played it on PS3 years ago but Im not feeling it today on PC. Why? Well, mainly because there are so many assets recycled from AC2 in this game like sound effects, music, animations and menu designs. This game is basically AC2 which a few things added. And thats not cool. AC2 is a good game but we need a refreshing experience here with original assets. This aint it. Spend the time and money to make a quality title, guys. Come on.Combat seems lessresponsive too. The addition of being able to chain onehit kills in combat is a nice addition, but the klunkiness kills it. When someone grabs me and the game is telling me to press right mouse and shift at the same time and Im pressing the f out of these buttons at the same time and nothing is happening I get The guard is just standing there holding me and nothing is happening until a little later finally another guard swings at my defenseless body to break the other guards hold. I also find blocking and dodging works considerably less in this game vs AC2. Its frustrating when Im properly pressing the right buttons for dodging a swing from a brute and Ezio just stands there and takes the hit.There is a bunch of annoying stuff in this game.And these da automatic cinematic camera angles in some tight spaces like dungons really need to stop. They f up your controls.And whats with the recycled music? Why is the synchronization of a viewpoint musical piece copy and pasted from AC2?I read some are having trouble getting stuck on the last mission. They think its a bug. I got stuck there too. The solution is easy, but not obvious climb up the opposite side of the ladder.
