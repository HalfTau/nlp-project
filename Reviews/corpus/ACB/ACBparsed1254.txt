This game is tremendously fun. The single player campaign provided me with over 80 hours of entertainment Im somewhat of a completionist, and even after that, I just had fun freerunning across the enormous openworld map. The storyline is extremely interesting and I dont have a reason to dislike this game. The combat is also extremely satisfying, with chaining kills together being easy to learn, but difficult to master.Overall, this is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite franchises.
