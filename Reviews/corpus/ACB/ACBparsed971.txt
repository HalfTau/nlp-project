I really wanted to like this game, I came from playing Black Flag where the controls are smooth and well setup and this was a clear downgrade.Really liked the story and the main character as far as I got, but the controls totally ruined the gameplay for me.After seeing how much easier it was to control your character in Black Flag, Rogue and even Unity I couldnt find the motivation to keep playing.If you can ignore the controls or get used to them, this seems like a good game. If you cant, Id recommend Black Flag instead unless you hate pirates ofc.
