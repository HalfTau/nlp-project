Assassins Creed Brotherhood is the third game in the series, and the second game in the Ezio trilogy composed of Assassins Creed II, Assassins Creed Brotherhood, and Assassins Creed Revelations. Mechanically, its not very different from other games in the series  it is a third person openworld historical fiction action game, where you play as an assassin in 16th century Italy, working to improve the standing of your faction and reduce the power of your opposing faction.Like seems to be the case in this series, controls are improved over predecessors in that it makes combat easier, but that also serves to transition the game from being a stealthy assassin and more into being the sort of person who just jumps into combat and runs rampant. The primary change in this game is the ability to summon other assassins to help with combat/kills, which actually is pretty fantastic.I played this game on the 360, and enjoyed it a great deal  its very much more of Assassins Creed II with very minor changes. If that sounds like a good time, by all means  check it out. The games a lot of fun. But by the end of this game, the mechanics and such were starting to wear thin  its probably why Ive taken as long as I have to get started in Revelations.
