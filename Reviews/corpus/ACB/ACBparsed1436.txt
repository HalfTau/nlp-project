 Classic stabbyclimby gameplay still not getting old. Improves a lot of little things from ACII everything is more expensive so money has more meaning, ability to buy maps to find all those damn flags  feathers Challenge modes in crazy virtualland are actually quite fun. Rome setting pretty awesome  climbing all over the Colosseum is cool. Ordering instant assassinations from the Brotherhood OP or hilarious every time? Story is confusing for the first few hours unless youve just played ACII. Is there any practical difference between the crossbow, throwing knives and pistol? Played 40 hours, still dont understand investment system.
