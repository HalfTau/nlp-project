Man, a Assassins creed game from back when they were still good, and not just mediocre. There isnt much at all to say, if your a fan of these games, youll be a fan of this one. I personally still think the second one is better, but this one isnt too far off. The game is fun, beautiful, has an engaging plot, and even sound nice. I cant say anything about this one is bad, but I can say it isnt quite as good as the two that cam before it.
