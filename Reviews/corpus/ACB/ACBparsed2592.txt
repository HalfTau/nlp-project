SinglePlayer More of the same from AC2, but nonetheless very enjoyable. Side missions have more variety, and the combat styles are more complex than ever. The sandbox Rome itself feels somewhat smaller from the previous games.MultiPlayer Very unique concept, completely deviated from other multiplayer games. However its also a real pain in theto your connection settings for me, I have to sit for literally hours just to find a session and play for about  23 rounds. This issue has not been resolved since its launch on PC.Overall SP is great, MP is great, but the matchmaking downright sucks. Ubisoft has yet to release a patch to fix this, and their support isnt helping at all.
