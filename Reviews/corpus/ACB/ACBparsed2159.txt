An RPG disguised as an open world game. For some reason, I thought the AC games would suck when I first played them, but the story is really good, of epic proportions like RPGs. It might not have stats, but it does have dang near every other thing RPGs have, especially RPGlite type games like Dark Souls. You change your fighting style based on weapons and the weapons have stats like ActionRPGs like Torchlight/Diablo. It lacks moral choices, but that only makes it a bit more like a JRPG like Final Fantasy than it does a Western moral RPG.
