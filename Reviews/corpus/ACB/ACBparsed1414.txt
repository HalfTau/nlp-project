AC Brotherhood is the sequel to the highly regarded Assassins Creed 2. While they didnt reinvent the wheel with this game, they certainly improved and enhanced it.Rather than the game taking place in multiple cities across Italy, ACB takes place mostly in the city of Rome. However, Rome is by far the most detailed location in the game up to this point. You can upgrade local buisinesses in the world, take out guard outposts and burn them to the ground, and  run a local assassin guild you build from the ground up. Among many other things. The game is also noticeably harder and basically expects that you already played through AC2 before this one. It also features V/R missions like Metal Gear Solid so you can test your skills in the combat and stealth challenges. Theres plenty to do in this game and the focus on side content is very noticeable.So if you liked AC2, ACB is the next thing to check out. On the other hand if you havent played AC2, or didnt really like it I dont recommend this one. It expects that you have already played through AC2 and apart from the setting and the inclusion of a few new weapons its virtually the same game.
