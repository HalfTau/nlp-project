It is a really good game.. I just dont like the main charactor that much..Still if you dont have any assassin creed games allready I reacon grab it next time its on sale for 75 off..Of course if   Assassins Creed 3 or 4 is the same price or just a little bit more you might be better grabbing that..   All the Assassins Creed games are pretty much the same really just new items.. But everyone should have at least 1 in their libary
