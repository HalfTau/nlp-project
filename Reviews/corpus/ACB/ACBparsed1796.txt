Brotherhood is Assassins Creed at its best. It takes whats best from AC2 and makes it even better, while changing the mission structure to be more openworld than previous games. I love the ability to call assassins at any time during the game. Theres only one city to explore, but Rome is absolutely big and varied, and full of things to do. Its a great and geographically varied setting, ranging from rural areas to densely populated city areas. Theres also some additional levels outside the city Leonardos war machines missions and some nice surprises along the way. The secret locations from AC2 also make a return as fantastically designed Lairs of Romulus  these are some great platforming levels and completing them is a real pleasure.Brotherhood has a great cast of characters and the overall story is interesting. My only gripe is lack of character development for side characters later in the game  Claudia, Maria and Leonardo all suffer from this, leaving their stories a bit incomplete. Whats great about Brotherhood is also the modern day bit of the story. Its fantastic  and you actually get to do things as Desmond.This Assassins Creed outing has also introduced multiplayer for the first time in the series. Keep in mind that unfortunately multiplayer is mostly dead, as the player base moved to newer games in the series.One last thing you can also unofficially unlock a free Copernicus DLC that was previously PS3 exclusive.
