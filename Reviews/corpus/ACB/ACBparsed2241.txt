Picks up exactly where Assassins Creed II left off, and for a side game theres a LOT to do, much more then AC II, the plot thickens as Ezio finds himself bearing down on the Borgia, and a few unexpected plot twists.If youve played AC II and havent played this, I strongly recommend you play it, you wont regret it.
