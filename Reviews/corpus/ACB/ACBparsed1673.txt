Always fun.  DLed it awhile agho and played it but, as always, I bought the game to help support devs as well.Not sure if I will play MP or not but the single player is VERY fun and I love the controls thus far.Wish it was NOT uPlay nonsense and had some Steam achievements. Guess I will survive but it would have been nice.
