Users with windows 10 need to run this in windows 8 compatability mode. I also run as administrator. If the game loads, but the graphics do not adjust the screen resolution to a lower resolution  800 x 600. If the graphics then work, but look bad in game, alter the settings with the in game options. Working great for me now. Good luck!
