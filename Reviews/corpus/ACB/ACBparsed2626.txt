You thought the crazy Adventures of Dezmond and Ezio are over? Think again. In this third and most likely last installment for a while, you are thrown right back to where AS2 finished.Anyway, the graphics engine has been completly overhauled to provide an even more interesting immersive experience over the previous two games. Its hungry for hardware so perhaps make sure you can play AS and AS2 at least on medium to ensure you can play this much detailed sequal.Story wise its been improved and as previously stated, its a direct continuation from AS2. More quirks and additions are in this packed game, so if you are an Assasin at heart, this is a MUST buy. If you have a controller, then all the best, good luck and remember, you are an elite assasin in the 1500s.Where will the fight with Astergo lead you? What answers does Subject 16 still have for you? Where did Leonardo get to? All will be revealed in this action packed, beautifully detailed game.Final Score 4 / 5
