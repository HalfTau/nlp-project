PS Dont look at my hours above, i only later got the steam versionGreat game, obviously it follows the storyline of AC 2, you are basicly the whole storyline in Rome, but the map is huge, the storyline is again amazing and it might be old game but still very good  afterall, now you can visit Rome.. and unlike the real world,, now you can climb that Colosseum. You know you want to.
