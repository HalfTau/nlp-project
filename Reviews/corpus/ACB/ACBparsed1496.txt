Okay, all Assassins Creeds have the same basic idea, but they are different usually. But, AC Brotherhood and AC II are VERY similar in many respects, and since I havent played them for awhile, I am literally copypasting the same review to both of them because I cant remember all the little things that are different, because really, they are very similar. So here we goI love the Assassins Creed series. I played the first AC about seven years ago, and I played it nonstop. The basic idea of AC is that you are and assassin, and you have a city as your assassinationplayground, usually multiple locations. You start the game as Desmond, a guy who uses a machine called the Animus to shoot back in time to his ancestors history. This is accomplished from the Animus being able to use his mind as a channel for those ancestors memories.Then, you are his ancestor, an assassin. and you have to kill things. The story is usually deep and intriguing, and it brings you along, and the gameplay of it is awesome too. And then you can just do random things as sidequests, usually pickpocketing, or another assassination target, stuff like that.You have two profiles Low profile, where you dont draw attention, and just push past people, or walk. Then High profile, by holding right trigger, where then you start running and you can parkour, fight, shove through people, and sprint.The combat is fun, and the sneakyassassinating is satisfying. Theres some flaws, but Brotherhood and AC II are probably the best out of this series. Would recommend anybody to try.
