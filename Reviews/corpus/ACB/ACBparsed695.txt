Playing on a mac, OS X El Capitan. Crashes, quits game, quits steam, logs out of computer user account have to log back into my computer and start steam, then start the game to continue playing. Seems to happen right during complex portions of a memory or fight with lots of soldiers. Also, the keyboard doesnt work on startup more than half the times I start the game. Sometimes seems like I should be getting paid real money for some of the repetitive things the game wants me to do. Fun game otherwise. Very buggy.
