Having previously played AC 1, 2 and this game on console, I wasnt really sure what to expect when I bought this during the Steam Summer Sale 2014..... but it delivered and rekindled my gamer crush on Ezio. Gameplay is immersive. Theres your main quest line, side quests, Cluster puzzles, plus a bunch of other tasks you can do within the single player game. Theres also multiplayer, which if I can remember my console days clearly, isnt too bad either. Controls take a little while to get used to, especially with the move from console to PC for me, but they are displayed on screen and once you get the hang of what all the buttons to do, the combat is so much more enjoyable. I find this game quite challenging. While completing the quests arent too difficult, the extra requirements needed for 100 sync makes it a little harder for those who are into full completion. I think this game is so much fun to play and I have yet to tire of the whole franchise.I highly reccommend this game and give it an 8 out of 10..... points lost because..... well running away and hiding can get a little annoying when sometimes I just want to kill em all.
