Play in the dark to serve the light of my gaming addiction. Liberate Rome in the meantime as well.One of the better Ubisoft games. Ezio is a bloody badass. Hes got humour, power, unending stamina, unrelenting vengence and manner of justice.The game will only make sense if you play the Assassins Creed II first though.
