I liked everything about this game.The world has improved so much since the first AC. Theres side quests and I dont want to spoil too much but theres just a lot of amazing aspects to this game. The storyline is great, and the graphics aspect is really well done in my opinion. Beautiful scenery.There is a fast travel system in this game, which is pretty good. I dont find myself using it much, however. I find it more fun to run or ride a horse across Rome.Lots of different weapons to choose from in this game, and of course you get more of a variety as it goes on. Leonardo Da Vinci appears in this game, which is GREAT.This game is hands down my favorite AC game so far. Im trying to give a balanced review of this game but honestly the only thing I can complain about is the unskippable credits at the end. Thats tolerable though / not so much for AC Revelations
