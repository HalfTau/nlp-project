While biased towards the series and this game in particular. This is still my favorite installment in the Assassins Creed series so far and still keeps in tradition with a big open map although there are areas blocked up until a certain point in the game, easy, fun combat, a cinemeaticstory, and lots of activities and challenges. It continues Ezios story right after the end of AC2 as well as continuing Desmonds story modern times. I very much recommend this installment.
