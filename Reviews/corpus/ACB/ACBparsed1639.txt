Definitely one of the best Assassins Creed games! This game continues the story of Ezio Auditore from Assassins Creed II, The entire game is mainly set in the huge city of Rome, When the Borgias are in control of the city, Especially Rodrigo and Cesare Borgia, Its up to Ezio and his fellow assassins to end their regime.Would play it again.11/10
