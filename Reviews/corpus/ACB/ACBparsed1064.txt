Good game, too short.So ACII was pretty good, it was a true upgrade from the AC experience and yet I guess Ubisoft decided to make money and ruin a great franchise going the CoD way, the only thing wrong is that they dont have 3 teams to build a game in a 3 year cycle. Anyway I really thought it would be better since people recommended me the game so much but it just feels like an episode from ACII.I was hoping the game to contribute more to the main story and not just give you the intro, play 10 in game hours and then give you another clue about the actual story of the franchise.If you like these games, then Im sure youll like to do the same stuff that ACII brought to us. If youre not that into AC then Id probably pass Brotherhood and Revelations to play ACIII. I hope Revelations isnt that bad since most people say it is.PROSAssasins are a really a great feature of the game, but I wouldve like to use them earlier on the game.CONSGame is too short compared to ACII, its actually half the story in game time.Story doesnt tells you much about what the heck is going on with Desmond.Rebuilding things is cool, but feels empty anyway it doesnt help much in the game to do everysingle shop.Gather all the insert anything that comes to your mind here.The game is good, but nothing great which I was expecting after playing ACII. I guess this is where money and Ubisoft face the downfall of AC franchise? Well I hope not because I will play Revelations for Reviewers sake and hope it has more to offer...
