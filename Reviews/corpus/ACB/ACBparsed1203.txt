When there wasnt anything else left to do, I completed the plot which was pretty bad.TLDRLots of sideactivities, including interesting economy and recruit training. You can throw axes. Plot is boring. Controls are extremly annoying.6/10would be 9/10 if I ignored the story and stopped playing after finishing all bussiness in the economy and recruit training.
