Compared to its previous part, AC Brotherhood blew my mind. The marvelous storyline, of which many things were not seen as coming, the lovable characters with their stories can catch anyones heart. Title beautifully optimised, even for lower performance machines  and even that does not take the beauty of graphics in it.Definite musthave for fans of hours of challenging gameplay and good plottwisted storylines, accompanied by even more beautiful OST.
