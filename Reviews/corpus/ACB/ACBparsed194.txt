The game is nice?YES,it is.Does it have more bugs than Unity?Yeah,it does.I have encountered several bugs that made the game unplayable,like the control bug on the Bomber mission and Ezio ragdolling when falling from some hights.Ive also encountered some minor glitches,like the throwing knife belt not appear.I dont know if its just me,but I didnt like the story too much.I didnt get interested in the lore at any point during the game.
