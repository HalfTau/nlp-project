I enjoyed this one as I was really digging Ezios contuing tale, but it felt like it was stretching off of ACII a bit, too. The MP was thoroughly dead by the time I got around to playing this one. If you played ACII and want more Ezio, definitely play this....otherwise I think you could skip on to AC IV and not miss much.
