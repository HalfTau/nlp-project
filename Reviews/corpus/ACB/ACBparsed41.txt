A truly remarkable adventure and history game that takes place in a mystery environment of 15th and 16th century Italian penninsula. Beautifully designed graphics enriched with numerous optional descriptions of known and less known buildings, paintings, personas etc. A lot has already been said about Assassins Creed, but with such truly unique screenplay, it will always be my pleasure to play it again, and again.
