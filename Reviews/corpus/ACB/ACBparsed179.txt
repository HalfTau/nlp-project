Assassins Creed Brotherhood is probably my favourite game of the Ezio trilogy and it also happens to feature completely overpowered and out of thin air spawning Assassin recruits which can literally destroy any amount of guards without causing a detection for Ezio.AC Brotherhood is a direct sequel to AC 2 and should be played in the correct order. It features a vast map of Rome during the end of the 15th Century and dozens over dozens of hours of content. Main missions are interesting if not extremely fun at times except maybe for the most infamously difficult mission in the entirety of Assassins Creed, namely getting 100 on the DaVinci tank mission.I had a lot of fond memories of this title and a rough 8 years later on PC instead of on console it is still bafflingly good in terms of gameplay. It also scales absolutely fantastic to 4k and therefore looks anything but dated. It also featured one of the most fun multiplayers so far, except maybe the brilliant coop from Unity.Brotherhood is simply great. Theres no reason not to play it, truly.
