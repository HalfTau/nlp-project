Major improvements over the otherwise great Assassins Creed 2. The missions in this game doesnt feel as much as the same thing over and over again. Great big singleplayer game that continuous the story from AC2 however, I do think the story in AC2 is better than in Brotherhood.I havent tried the multiplayer, but the single player is really worth the price.
