Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a great but short game fully finished it in 14 hours. I cant play it now because every time i try to open it it says it cant find the Ubisoft Game Launcher. Dont waste your money on it. If you do, NEVER delete it or you wont be able to play it again because Ubisoft wants you to use Uplay.
