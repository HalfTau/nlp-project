Four out of five stars. This is so exciting to play even on the fourth and fifth time around! Enchanting music, consuming atmosphere, a wonderful story, and a blitz of nearly perfect mechanics show themselves off with a surprising amount of polish. That said, when the glitches come they bring controller tossing levels of anger. Despite the spiritually taxing problems that pop up a little too often the pros are quite impactful. The preachy nonsense from ACII is back again but this time they have the grace to keep their opinions in the background so that the fiction can be enjoyed without having something shoved down your throat. If you can swallow the bugs, this is an experience youll remember for a very long time.
