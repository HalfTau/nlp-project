Initially, you get the impression that this should have been the DLC for Assassins Creed 2, but then they decided to stretch it into a full game. However, that is quickly shaken off and Brotherhood is a solid entry in the Ezio series. Playing as Ezio is as fun as always, possibly more so as hes got more gadgets than Batman.Theres quite a heavy emphasis on management, with rebuilding rome or recruiting your own assassins. I like this sort of thing, but if it doesnt set your world on fire you can pretty much ignore it once the training wheels are let loose. The graphics are good, especially considering this was released nearly 7 years ago.Rome can sometimes feel overwhelming, with there literally being tons of stuff to do  hundreds of side objectives are available. And this is where I feel it has overstretched itself, content for the sake of content. The plot is quite thin and tends to jump around, with no real sense of flow, just a series of disconnected objectives.I hold my hands up and admit that I found Assasins Creed skullcrushing difficult at times, with Altair dying more times than I could count. Ezio seems almost overpowered in this game, and sometimes battles can feel a little too easy when you perform a 15count execution streak.Overall, Brotherhood is an enjoyable game with possibly too much stuff in it, but saying that, I suspect I will lose a few more hours running around Rome before Im finished with it.
