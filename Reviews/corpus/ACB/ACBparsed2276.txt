Brotherhood adds some new gameplay elements to the base ACII format that adds some new variety to the AC format. Some additions make up for some of the more impercise moments when freerunning, especially when you accidentally leap from a very tall structure. Addition of you very own brotherhood to control adds some fun elements that can help you when you are trying to remain undetected but need to do some killing, but the system is shallow, as sending your assassins out on missions is less favorable than keeping them around to help you in combat.Story progresses right from the end of ACII, but really doesnt add much to the overall plot, but inside and outside of the animus. In all, it felt more like an extended expansion than it did a new title, and might have been better as such, in a trimmed down version.If you like ACII, than you probably wont be disapointed in Brotherhood. It can drag on at moments, but it comes with another 1519 hours of gameplay in the Assassins Creed world.
