Assassins Creed 2.5, as I would call it. Ezio is back in an extension to his storyline, and even more great features are added such as training assassins. Another fantastic storyline is introduced, and while it is not as long and there are not as many contracts to kill, the enjoyment as playing as Ezio still remains in this inbetweener game. While there were some plots in the game that I wish I would have been able to do which will not be mentioned for sake of spoilers I still thoroughly enjoyed the game. The rebuilding aspect is brought back as you try to rebuild Roma and eradicate every Borgia influence in the town which I did not do and struggled with getting money to buy extra armor to raise my health. I give this game a 9.1/10
