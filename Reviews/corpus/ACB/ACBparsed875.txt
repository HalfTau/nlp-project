WARNING UBISOFTOh wait, forget that. Take yourself back to the classic Assassins Creed. I absolutely love this game alongside AC2, they are by far the best in the franchise. Avoid those dull, boring, revolting games made recently Unity and Syndicate of which I purchased on console and I was so underwhelmed with them, a franchise with so much potential ruined by those games.This game is full of content, has a great story and an amazing protagonist that is unique. The multiplayer I also find really fun, just a lot of trouble actually getting into a game.This is worth your money.9/10
