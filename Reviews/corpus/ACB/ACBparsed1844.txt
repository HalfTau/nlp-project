Assassins Creed Brotherhood is an actionadventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a sequel to the previous game Assassins Creed 2.Desmond is on the run again. This time, Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca and Shaun visit the ruined Auditore villa on Monteriggioni and make it as their new hiding place. Desmond has learn much from Ezio, but he still need to uncover more information from Ezio, so there he goes again, and again, to the Animus.Assassins Creed Brotherhood gameplay is pretty much the same with Assassins Creed 2, but is now focused on the city of Roma, where Ezio battle his way to eliminate Cesare Borgia and liberate Roma in the process. Ezio needs to liberate each sector in the city of Roma by destroying the Borgia towers. Doing so will free the sector and let Ezio rebuild the sector, such as reopening blacksmith shops, doctor shops or banks, gaining income in the process. The game also let Ezio to recruit Assassins by helping troubled civilians who can then help him to fight guards or kill his mission target. Recruited Assassins can gain experience as they are being called by Ezio or by completing contracts. Also, for the first time in Assassins Creed franchise, Assassins Creed Brotherhood feature multiplayer game.The graphics of the game still pretty much the same too. There may be some slight improvements but we wont notice it somehow. At least there is no downgrade.Overall, Assassins Creed Brotherhood has taken the next step in Assassins Creed franchise by introducing recruitable Assassins, while retaining the open world feature. I recommend this.Rating 9/10
