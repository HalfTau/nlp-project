So far the game runs smoothly on the pc, but the camera movements arent as satisfying smooth as one would expect, even though its running at a constant 60fps. This isnt a bother if you put your sensitivity to a higher setting than the default. Other than that this game is amazing. Still one of the best games ive played since young, and i was willing to rebuy it, i never finished it, but i wanted to now, and its still as good as i remember.I would recommend a controller as this game was just better with one, and its the only game ill say that for because of the camera. But this game deserves to be played and it definitely beats the latest ones. Except black flag that one was awesome but still its one of those games you wish devs were still making...Ill give it a 8 to 9/10...
