Doesnt work on mac, which is not a surprise because its an old game. There is something wrong with the game detecting your keyboard, because ones you start the game, you will see that you cant move and only thing you can do is open your hidden blade. Ive tried unninstalling etc. and still not working. It doesnt matter to me that it doesnt work but still. why thesteam makes it possible to buy and run on a mac even tho they havent tested it!!? ?
