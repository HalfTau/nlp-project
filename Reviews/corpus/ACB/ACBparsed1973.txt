In my opinion this is one of the best Assassins Creed games out of the thousands that are now available.Ezio is in his prime and on the prowl for the ladies and revenge.Great brotherhood mechanics involve recruiting people to join your creed which add depth and a sense of impact on the world as you call in you brothers and sister to help you if things go wrong.This is one of the last Assassins Creeds to have a have decent story that I really enjoyed progressing through the game.
