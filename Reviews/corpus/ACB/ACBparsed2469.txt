It is like Assassins Creed 2.5, more storyline and further englufs you into the story of Desmond Miles and Ezio Auditore. You learn to appreciate how badthe assassins really are. I didnt expect much from it at first because it wasnt AC3, but really they do an amazing job with this game and Im VERY MUCH looking forward to the next in the series. The ending was crazy good as well and left you with your jaw on the ground and wanting more.Oh it has multiplayer as well but I didnt really try it.
