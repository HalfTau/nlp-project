Of the 2 AC games I have played so far in the series AC2/ACB, I would say I enjoy this one the most. A lot of the issues that frustrated me with AC2 have either been fixed, updated, or streamlined into more modern mechanics.Controls Probably the actual reason I stopped playing AC2 years ago on the Xbox 360. Its just so annoying to have your characer do something that you were not trying to make them do, then usually it will result in your death and having to redo missions over and over. I am glad to say the controls have been greatly improved. I found myself swearing at Ezio at least 95 less than what I did in AC2. There is definitely a few moments where I was angry, but overall the controls have improved vastly.Story I felt as if the story was probably the weakest part. It was interesting in the first hour how it picks up directly after AC2 and introduces the antagonist. However, after that I felt as if nothing was terribly significant. Near the end the story went from like 0 to 60 where suddenly theres a war going on and I have no idea whats happening. I was disappointed by how the game just skipped 6 years and BAM, last mission. The Desmond finale was much better than the Ezio ending.Overall, I would recommend this game, I enjoyed it more than AC2 and it continues to build on the story. Id give it a solid 7/7.5. For comparison, AC2 I would have probably given a 6/6.5.
