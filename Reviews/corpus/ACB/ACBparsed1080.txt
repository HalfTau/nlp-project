Holy I never really believed it was possible to outdo Assassins Creed II, but they did it. And they did it in style.Assassins Creed Brotherhood takes place almost entirely in Roma. The plot of the game is intriguing, and, unlike Assassins Creed II, most of the sidemissions are short but just as sweet. There is some DLC one could purchase and, honestly, I recommend it highly.They improved everything that has to do with combat without sacrificing the difficulty alltogether. Wall climbing is also substantially faster without being too much easier. The graphics are breathtaking, a whole step up from ACII. Horses make a comeback, and it is now much easier to move about a large portion of a city besides quick travels through the sewers and, more importantly, horses are now another variable in combat.I cant really think of anything that his game got wrong! Even the multiplayer is fantastic! Albeit, somewhat dead nowadays.YOU SHOULD PLAY AC  ACII BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME9 OF 10Silence Dogood
