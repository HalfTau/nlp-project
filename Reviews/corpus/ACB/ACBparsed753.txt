Finally closing the Italian story of Ezio being set in a smaller environment.You can only walk around or run or whatever strikes your fancy in one City Rome, if you hadnt guessed instead of multiple ones, which isnt a realy problem because of the amount of detail that has been put into the city.The fact that you can train assassins and renovate certain parts mostly stores in the city was something else from having an upgradeable homebase but not a bad thing in my opinion.
