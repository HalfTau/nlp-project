The 2nd of the Ezio trilogy. And if you are new to the games, I would reccomend starting with AC2 first justto understand the story. A definite sequel. Improves upon nearly every single game mechanic of Assassins Creed 2, and is personally my favorite in the series. The combat is more fluid. The guilds make sense and are utilized in the story. Even capturing areas and exploring the world are tied into the story of the game. I only wish the other games in the series took more notes from this one.
