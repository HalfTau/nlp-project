Although not as good as its predecessor in terms of depth and story, Brotherhood is to be considered to be more an expansion than a full game, if you take away pointless side missions and multiplayer dead you have a game with half the content than the previous.The combat system is really improved and new game modes are added like recruiting other assassins and territory control by killing captains and burning towers.The city of Rome is massive but not as appealing as Venice or Florence, but that is realistic because Rome in that time period was mostly ruins and old houses.The game finishes up the Borgia arc. Its not as epic as the previous one but its still a good storyWhat really bugs me is the white gradient on the top of the screen otherwise the graphics improve especially the shadows.The ScoreGameplay 9/10 improves a lot, adds more fluidityStory 7/10 Good but shortGraphics 7/10 The white gradient prevents from being 9Setting 7/10 Rome is realistic but too much of the same, several cities is betterInnovation 8/10 several new modes are added to the gameOverall 7.6If you loved AC2 buy this one but expect more of an expansion than a really fresh game.
