Still one of the best AC titles. This was the first AC I played and I ended up downloading all previous titles and continue to play the new ones. The historical angle is just so unique and the detail that they put into the maps is awesome. If you have never played an AC game, I suggest start with this one. Its a bit older and doesnt cost a lot. I played it after I got back from Rome and just couldnt believe how the in game world looked exactly like it would/should/does. 5/5!
