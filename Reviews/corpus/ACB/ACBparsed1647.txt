The best Assassins Creed game In my opinion. 2 reasons which are the story and Ezio.Of course, the first Assassins Creed is great, the story and all but the world is not like the one in the second and Brotherhood.Id suggest you get this game if you like historical games, the gameplay is great, the story is amazing, the characters are superb.By the way, Ive spent more than 100 hours on this game outside of steam, Ive play from scratch many times.9/10
