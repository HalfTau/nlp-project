Along side AC2 this is one of the more polished Assassins Creed games. Ive spend many hours playing this one on my Xbox, and think that the Multiplayer is still one of the best things to happen to Assassins Creed, though you may not be able to get into any lobbies because of how dead the thing is on PC.
