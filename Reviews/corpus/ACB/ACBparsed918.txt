Assassins Creed Brotherhood follows the same system as the previous title, just slightly improved, more beautiful, not as big as AC2, but equally concrete when it comes to gameplay and mechanics.We continue the adventures of Ezio, immediately after AC2 ends, not even 10 minutes pass before being violently attacked by the Borgias, who come after the Piece of Eden in our possession, Ezios decision on AC2 has direct consequences that bring death and destruction, everything we struggled for has vanished, wounded and with no clue what to do, Ezio follows a small trail to Roma, where our new adventure takes place.It happens that Roma suffers under the Borgias regime, people feel oppressed and its up to the Creed to liberate it. Ezio gets in touch with old friends and assassins that will help him rebuild the Brotherhood and start looking for the Piece of Eden and destroy once and for all the greed that suffocates the population and the city. Along with his friends, the assassins start recruiting new members and start creating a vast net of contacts that will support every decision we make, get resources and new tools for the task at hand.ACB takes what was presented on AC2 and improves it, combat feels more fluid and concise, fighting multiple enemies is now easier while the kill streaks are simple and demand no that much of a tactical approach, we count with new gadgets, thanks to our friend Leonardo da Vinci, who helps us once again, but under different circumstances. Now we have more chances to kill silently from a distance with poison darts fired from our hidden blade, which come in handy every time you want to sneak into a place or to have fun with the guards as they dance to the poisons effect, the pistol reacts faster now and can be also used while engaging into combos to eliminate your enemies in a faster way. The rest of the weapons do not vary that much from the previous title, however its up to you if you want to buy them as you can collect them just like before.Freerunning follows the same structure, but it feels slightly better, there are not many new things regarding this aspect, its the same old system with not many variations, it works better at times and some other times it just doesnt, something that AC has been struggling with since the first title.As for new ideas, ACB introduces an investment system, trading has been revamped and feels great to be able to repair old structures and buy buildings. Every time you buy a store you can revive the trading system which allows you to invest some money that every 20 minutes pays off with a certain amount of income which can be withdrawn from the bank so you can repair, buy and invest once again, nice idea here, this makes you feel that the city is constantly under a lively trading system. Tailors, blacksmiths, art dealers, doctors are part of the system, as well as new choices like stables, banks, an underground system that connects various locations in Roma, faction buildings thieves, courtesans and mercenaries or simply buildings and famous creations that look exactly like the real ones.The recruitment system is also a great improvement, every time you liberate a zone from Borgia occupation, you can aid citizens and once you help them they offer they support to join the Brotherhood, then it comes the training, for this a new idea comes up, for them to improve and become a true assassin, they can be sent to different parts of Europe to perform missions and collect resources, once they deal with a mission they get XP that helps them to level up and get a new title. Once they are done and reach max level, they are ready to get the title of Assassin. When they are not away on a mission, they can help you fight if you feel you are overwhelmed by enemies or you can simply activate the Arrow Storm option, which eliminates a certain number of foes in a second, this new idea is excellent, it gives you the feel of being always supported and empowered.They havent improved that much, though, some textures look smoother and its quite different to AC2, because we are most of the time on the same place, which is Roma, on AC2 we travelled to several cities which differentiate from each other, although the city looks great, the old structures that are depicted in detail are great, the Coliseum being the more attractive esthetically, there are some muddy textures here and there, but they do not have a deep impact on the whole concept of Roma, the water still looks stagnated and static, but as we are not on a diving game, it tends to be just a simple decoration for the city, it still looks ugly, though. The skies look clearer, the moon always shines above us at night, clouds look much more real, something that AC2 lacked. Overall, graphics do not stand out that much, but it remains a beautiful game nonetheless.The music has always been important in AC games, especially when we started with Ezios adventures, every tune fits perfectly the diverse situations that we face in every mission, the feeling of being sneaky or just face to face with multiple enemies, or every time we explore a catacomb or some underground temple, it enriches the sense of adventure and mystery that surrounds the AC games, the overall sound effects are great, there is not much to add here, the sound fulfills the expectations for an AC game, it stands out on its own.While not being that terrible, ACB suffers from the same problems that AC2 did, sometimes actions you perform tend to have a different outcome when fighting or freerunning, this is sometimes really annoying when trying to escape from a fight or when you just want to go incognito, many times I found myself climbing the opposite direction or attacking civilians because it happened the selection attack found that particular citizen right next to me, if killing civilians is forbidden for assassins, why not just make them a nontarget option?, especially in a fight, which mostly happens in the middle of the city crowded with nonmilitary population. Another annoying aspect of these games is the tailing missions, they are already the worst kind of mission in AC games and they tend to be repetitive, long and dull, with few strategic options other than staying hidden or incognito.Assassins Creed Brotherhood surely does not disappoint, it follows the same principles as the previous title, it has all the elements of a fictional/historical storyline, many real characters appear here as well, which adds veracity and a sense of realism few games have, and it also keeps us following the steps of our hero, one we watched being born, growing up, becoming an assassin and now mentor of the Italian Brotherhood, Ezio is older, yes, but wiser and not just that, he also shows many improvements as character, he has accepted his fate as an assassin, one that came with pain and suffering, however this only gives him the strength to continue struggling.
