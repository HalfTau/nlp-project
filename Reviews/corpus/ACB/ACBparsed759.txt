awesome game, highly recommended that you play AC 2 first because it will start where 2 ended. i dont know if its only me but i felt like the main story was musch shorter than AC 2 i did all the romulus quest and got the romulus armour and completedthe main quest with many side quest in a few days...but its a very coool game that i higjly recommend just as all the other AC gamessry for typing mistakes
