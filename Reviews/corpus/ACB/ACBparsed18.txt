Assassins Creed Brotherhood continues the convoluted story of the Assassins Creed series where Assassins Creed Two left off. The game takes most of what worked in Assassins Creed Two and refined and streamlined them. If you liked the first two games you will likely enjoy this one as well.Highlight of the game was chasing an old parkcouring Catholic man through a cathedral. 7/10
