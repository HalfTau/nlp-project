AC Brotherhood is one of my favourite games of the franchise. I have been a long time follower of the series, ever since the first game. You will not find anyone online for the multiplayer, but thats not really what AC games are about. Playing ACII will gie you a lot more context to the story of this game, if you havent played it already.Brotherhood is an amazing game with so many loveable characters and quests. It is worth the buy.
