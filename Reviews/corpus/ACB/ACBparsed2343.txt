Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a good game, no arguments, you cant debate it, ACB is a good game.It would be a great game, if you didnt feel like you were being milked while playing it.Good gameplay, good story, good pacing, that is hooked onto the AC formula seen in the first and second games.And thats it.You know that Ubisoft is going to milk you for every penny, making you pay full price for the work that is essentially DLC extras and fancy modding padding extra layers onto bloated thing they have already.This is more blatant with the new innovative feature of Assassins Recruits that really is a tackon, and the game would survive fine without it.But if youve already played the first two Assassins Creed games, youll definitely play ACB, so go ahead buy it, its still a good game.Just dont think about how badly your being played.8/10
