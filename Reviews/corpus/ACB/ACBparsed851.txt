A great game that extends the story of Ezio Auditore from Assassins Creed 2, as this game starts off exactly where AC2 ended. I really enjoyed the upgrades they made for this game which made the gameplay more enjoyable, which includes the recruitment of assassins to help you fight along the rest of the game, very useful. This game also has a great setting of Rome which you can explore. However, one of the things which I hate about this game are they included the 100 sync requirements in every mission. Its satisfying once you have completed it but some of missions are impossibly hard. The worse thing is that you cant revert to the last checkpoint if you failed the 100 sync. Apart from the cons, this game is still a must play for any AC fans out there, I give it a 8/10 overall.
