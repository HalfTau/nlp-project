If u havent play any nextgen or say newest Assassins Creed series, this one is really great. I kinda like it storyline, even tho its not as good as AC II, and its feature that we can call backup since the fight sometime kinda annoying to do it by yourself. Its graphic doesnt really bad either.But if u already play newest AC series e.g. unity and syndicate, ull find the control system might be frustating since its more complex and similar to previous series. Its gameplay also sometimes annoying, like when u try to climb a wall that actually he can but then he just jump off to the opposie side, and unlike in unity and syndicate, everytime I enter a battle mode, I unable to run away to directly kill the captain for example, etcThats my personal opinion
