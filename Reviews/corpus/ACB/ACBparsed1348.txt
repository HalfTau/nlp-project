Assassins Creed Brotherhood henceforth referred to as ACB is the third title in the Assassins Creed series. Chronologically taking place after AC2, this is a nice sequel. Admittedly the numerous graphical glitches ground not loading, birds stretching into the sky, enemies sliding on hills are distracting and do take you out of the moment. The story is gripping, and the addition of heavy weapons is a nice touch. However, ACB fails in the respect of convenience you have to buy the stores yourself in order for them to sell you things, and you often need quite a bit of money to do that. Frankly they should have not included that facet, it was the worst part of the game. The combat was much to easy, AC1 had the right idea in preventing you from using the counter move until halfway through the game, forcing you to dodge and such. Despite this, I still reccomend this game.
