This game had a lot going for it but for me, fell flat everywhere. The story was more convoluted and even harder to follow than in Assassins Creed 2, and had one of what I consider the laziest cliches where theres an enemy who I still dont know what his name is you have to kill but all he does is run away and is always just barely out of your grasp until the final fight. The final fight was pretty cool, but it was a little sad having to wait around 15 hours for that.Like Assassins Creed 2 theres some secret caves you can explore to unlock some cool armor, but unlike in Assassins Creed 2 by the time you get all these caves unlocked, the end of the game is just a few missions away. Its hardly worth using that awesome armor when youve already done everything in game. They also managed to make the menus even worse than the previous two games, and while Brotherhood definitely isnt as obvious of a console port as Assassins Creed 2 the horrendous map mechanics make me wish I was playing with the terrible console port controls of 2.And finally, the ending while good was totally ruined by 18 yes 18 minutes of unskippable credits. It doesnt count as you finishing the game unless you sit through all 18 minutes, but I dont care enough to see whatever postcredit scene there might be so I just closed the game after using my phone for 5 minutes and realizing the credits werent going to end anytime soon.Its sad that just minor things like this really downed my feelings on Brotherhood. Its ambitions compared to the last two and may even have more things to do in it than Assassins Creed 2, even if its in a smaller world, but the all over the place story and honestly just the credits made me dislike this game in the end. If youre planning on playing all the Assassins Creed games then this review wont stop you from playing Brotherhood but if you want to get Brotherhood on its own, I dont think its worth it.
