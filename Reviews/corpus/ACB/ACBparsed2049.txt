This games pretty cool, I liked the new features they added to it. Being a part of the brotherhood comes in handy and makes you feel like your character really means something. I would suggest this game to anyone who has played any of the assassins creed games thus far, I would suggest playing the second game before this one so the story line makes more sense.
