The best game in the AC series to date. Brotherhood replaces the slow counterheavy slog that was combat in the previous games with a system kind of reminiscent of Arkham Asylum in which speed, aggression, and precision are privileged.It also gets rid of the worst of the repetitive boring crap from the earlier games and expands on the plot, which is a hell of a lot of conspiracyladen paranoiac fun.
