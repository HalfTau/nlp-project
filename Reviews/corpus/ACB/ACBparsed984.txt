Fantastic continuation of the series. This and II are topnotch games that anyone can and should get into. My one complaint is that when you start one of the main quests near the end, it keeps going and you cant interact with any merchants until you essentially beat the game. So I had damaged armor, but no way to repair it until the game was finished, which made it hard. Overall though, fantastic game 9.5/10
