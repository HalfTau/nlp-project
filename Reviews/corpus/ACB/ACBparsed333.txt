The epilogue of this game is mindblowing.Mutiple new and fun elements were added in this  one, sync challenges, liberation of sections, new weapons and command within apprentice assassins.The main storyline was firmly executed, side missions had all sorts of style, the DLC missions were fabulousOverall, a great gameP.S collectibles and perfect sync were both annoying and timeconsuming, so I chose to ignore them P
