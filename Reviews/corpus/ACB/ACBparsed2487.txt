Brotherhood picks up right where Assassins Creed 2 leaves off.  Ezio begins gathering and training new assassin recruits for the order, which itself becomes a major new gameplay mechanic allowing you to find and rescue them, get them to join, train them, and call them to aid you in battle. Ezio on his own is a force to be reckoned with for a whole army of renaissance warriors, but with the Brotherhood at his side it becomes a slaughterfest.Again, this game builds upon its predecessors, adding new weapons, mechanics, refinements, options, etc. Better quest system and economy system. You can gain military control of parts of Rome by destorying enemy bases....etc etc etc etcThis game is awesome.My only complaint with it might be that between his ranged weapons, and the Brotherhood, Ezio might be TOO powerful.Also, Multiplayer.Its unlike any other Multiplayer out there and, contrary to conventional wisdom, Assassins Creed translates to be a GREAT multiplayer game.
