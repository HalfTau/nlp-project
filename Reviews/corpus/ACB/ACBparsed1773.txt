When I saw that this was available for a mac, I bought it without reading the reviews. A big mistake. On a mac, I had trouble getting the game to load and once it did, I played once and it never worked again. It would either fail to load quit unexpectedly or when it did, the keyboard wouldnt work. Seemed like a great game though, big pity it doesnt run well/easily on macs.
