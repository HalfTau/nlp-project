I love assasins creed with a passion but brotherhood isnt the best of the series, I played it until i found almost all of the easter eggs and did all of the quests and now it is just boring. All I can do is just freeroam, kill people, kill more people, or have my assasins kill people.In the end, this game gets old too fast
