Considerig how this game just came out for mac, I figured Id inform my fellow mac users on how it performs. Short answer great.Long answerI am playing this game with my 2015 macbook pro 15. This game has been incredibly optimised for this system, for I can run the game at 60 fps and maximum settings. However, since the game is so well ported, it works much better than most other ports. Im sure it can be run on any mac at various settings. As someone frequently concerned with port quality, I can confirm that this one is beautiful.One more thing There is a new problem where on some systems where the game crashes on launch.. There you go .
