I was already in love with its predecssor, Assassins creed 2, only to find out that brotherhood is an awesome upgrade. Guess relocating to the italian capital is exactly what they needed to take the game to the next step. Anyways this game is definetly in my top 3 for Assassins creed games. I would recommend playing AC2 first to get the whole backstory otherwise youll feel a bit lost.
