The next installment in the Assassins Creed series and the second game in the Ezio triology is called Assassins Creed Brotherhood. Building upon what Assassins Creed II was meant to be but did not really succeed to be and what will be the better of the three games in the triology. The new mechanics in this installment of the series makes it the better of the three.After the seek of revenge has somewhat plunged, we get to see who is behind all that anger. We get to be somewhat more introduced to Ezio, the protagonist. We learn that he does not only seek revenge, but also seek for a better world. This world is framed into clearing Rome from all the bad guys, which he does do best.This game its name, Brotherhood, specifies the very interesting new mechanic brought to the series. The ability to create a true Brotherhood and League of Assasins so to say. The ability to send them on missions to liberate cities and gain XP and thus get more powerful in the process. In addition to that, the player can call his Assassins to assist him during the missions. The player finally gets to meet the Creed, instead of the single protagonist seen thus far.After the first game in the series, I recommended Assassins Creed II as an improvement, Assassins Creed Brotherhood further builds upon that and is the better game in the Ezio Collection.
