Pretty average sequel with buggy controls and average story. Tasks have failure criteria all over them so expect to get the desync / restart animation at unexpected times. Movement and attack mechanics are still plagued with some weird autopilot system that has Enzio flying off at right angles to where youre directing him.6/10 dont spend much money on this.
