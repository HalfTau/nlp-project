The game has become so wide since the first installation. I dont know whether to call it a rpg or a puzzle game. This variety of content contributed much to the game? This is a debateble concern. Some might find it pleasent whereas some dont. I feel that the rich content may  feel like overwhelming sometimes. If you are looking for a simple game like in the first installation this is not your game. On the other hand, if you are okay with widening your perspective, i would definetely recommend it. Only thing i found lacking in this one was the inability to alter some of the keyboard shortcuts.There was this sense of uncomfortable feeling while you are navigating through the menus. W A S D doesnt work with menus and former TABquit changed into ESC button which i found disturbing.I believe only the PC version has theswe flaws since right now companies mainly focus on console version games. I found the ingame climbing easier in AC2 but like i said above, the game is lacking in PC version since sometimes while climbing you encounter weird camera angle which makes it nearly impossible to make the appropriate jumps while using a keyboard You definetely need a console controller for this otwerwise you are bound to suffer a lot. Puzzles are definetely more challenging from the previous games and as always the story was mindblowing. Overall, very good game but sometimes can make you rage bc of some awkward control issues in PC version if you are using a keyboard.
