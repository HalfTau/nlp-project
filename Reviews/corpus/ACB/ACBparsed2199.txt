If you like the AC series then by all means play AssBro! It does tend to get long in the tooth though if you try to 100 too many things. Its like AC2  some new things to add some diversions. But Ezio still likes to Randomly tackle people when Im running through streets, or better yet, randomly assassinate a random peasant instead of that guard that I was fighting! EZIO!! !
