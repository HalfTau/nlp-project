The Assassins Creed series is definiitely one of my favourites. From the story to the gameplay its just outstanding. I love the freedom of hopping between rooftops and doing quests and assassination missions while at the same time restoring different towns/cities. Brotherhood lets you recruit and manage your own Assassins group allowing you to send them on their own missions to get you money or have to assist you when youre in a tough situation. Brotherhood is definitely a mustbuy if youve played the other games and if you havent, I suggest you play Assassins Creed 2 first as this is a direct sequel to that. Playing Assassins Creed 1 is not entirely necessary, but it helps.
