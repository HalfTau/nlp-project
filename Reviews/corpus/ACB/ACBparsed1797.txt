Being a fan of the Assassins Creed series, this is the game to which I compare any of the following storylines, by far. With simple, yet elegant physics and a storyline which actually made me cry in a sidemission no spoilers, this game first drew my attention just to edge closer to fulfilling the story of Assasins Creed 2. Which it does with perfection by my standards, of course.Never before or since this game have I felt so truly free to roam a map and to choose my battles by myself.
