Brotherhood is AC II but with more to it. Theres more content, more missions of a wider variety and lets you ride your horse in town, which AC II flatly refused to do. Also introduces a fast travel which makes things a little nicer. The story is better in my opinion in this game than the AC II and has a far more interesting antagonist.Id recommend this game to anyone, but strongly suggest you play Assassins Creed II first, as the story really requires you too.A criticism, probably my only one, is that on my PC the graphics have to be right down, and there are still a few stutters in the video. The sound is also out of sync with the video, meaning the lips say their part 10 seconds after the character has. But I still think this game is amazing.
