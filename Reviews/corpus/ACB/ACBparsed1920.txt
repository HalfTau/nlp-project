A pretty good sequel to Assassins Creed 2. Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio/Desmond. There are improvements on the gameplay but mostly this is a continuation for AC2 but instead of feeling like a rehash the story is interesting and I got to care what happened to Ezio. The desmond story is not as interesting but you spend so little time as Desmond it doesnt matter. The game ends on an interesting cliffhanger so Now Im off to play Relevations.
