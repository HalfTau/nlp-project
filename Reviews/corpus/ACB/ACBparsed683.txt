Assassins Creed Brotherhood was just as addictive as AC2, which blew me away. I loved figuring out the Lairs of Romulus and liberating Rome one Borgia Tower at a time. They introduced assassin recruits which I found very enjoyable and super convenientyou can summon them around any guards or enemies. On occassion they stole the main kills which was a little more than irritating.As usual, the game is visually gorgeous, but I expect no less from Ubisoft at this point. They simply dont put out ugly games, at least Ive never seen one in recent years from them.I was hoping for more bromance with Leonardo but he wasnt nearly as relevant of a character this time around. His missions were completely optional and I havent done them yet so I dont know if it leads to anything special when you do them all.But thats another thing to love about ACB. There is SO much to do. I spent hours not even paying attention to the campaign just wandering, causing trouble, doing side missions. I also enjoyed leaving the Animus too. I personally am very interested in the presentday stuff. Its all leading to something huge, and Im looking forward to some heavy hitting games in the series the next couple of years.Ezio is as loveable as always. And Claudia!! Shes awesome and I wish there had been more of her. I feel that there was a whole lot more potential to her story than was given. Itd be so cool to see a spinoff just about her over the years, but the chance of that is next to nothing Im sure.The campaign was great, but the last two sequences were spectacular nine in total. Sequence 7 had a BRUTAL tracking mission that I loathed entirely, but the payoff happened soon after and was very satisfying to play and to seeprobably the most visually striking parts of the game were near the end.It didnt hit me as emotionally as AC2 but they did a damn good job with Brotherhood. Looking forward to the last in Ezios trilogy.
