The Single Player is not much more than Assassins Creed 2, just one or two new ways to kill people or get around the city, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, but any gripes with the series so far probably havent been addressed with this installment, and what people have liked about the series is still in the game.  My favorite aspect of Brotherhood was the multiplayer.  I personally havent played any game that had this style of gameplay, so it was fresh so to say, something new to learn, new mechanics to wrap my head around and master, a different way to use the mechanics we were given in single player.  I greatly enjoyed the way the multiplayer emulated the feeling that the original assassins creed created when it first released, which was the feeling of being an assassin, which I personally havent felt since AC 1 was released.
