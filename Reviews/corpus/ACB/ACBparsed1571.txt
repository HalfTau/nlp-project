I originally skipped this AC game since I felt it didnt wrap the Ezio storyline when it was released, and I only got it since it was on special.Given that I payed little for it, I felt that I got my moneys worth. This game doesnt add much to the AC story, but Ezio is one of the coolest assassins in the franchise and it was a blast to play through another adventure as him.The gameplay of AC2 before it were polished to a tee in this game, and the new features allowing you to hire assassins, level them up, and call them in for assists was pretty cool. Taking over the new city Rome, purchasing buildings, and restoring it to its former glory was cool as well.Assassins Creed  Brotherhood is pretty fun if youre a fan of the franchise, you can find it for cheap, and you have some time to burn.
