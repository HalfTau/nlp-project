The AC series is great, love the settings and storyline and all of that. But I have to say, the controls for AC Brotherhood are among the absolute worst in any of the AC games.  You will VERY OFTEN attempt to do one thing and your Ezio will do something completely unexpected.  The camera controls are sometimes cancerous, especially in small spaces. There has not yet been any AC that makes me want to punch a wall like this one. Other than that, a pretty decent title. Not the best AC, but decent.
