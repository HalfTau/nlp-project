This is my 2nd game in the series I own after playing AC2 never thought I would buy another one. The Deluxe was on sale for 7.98 so thought I would give it one more chance. I can only recommend this series if you have patience which I seem to lack for AC. If they spent their money on better design in control and view angles this could have been a better series. I get tired of not being able to do what I want and fighting the game system. Can only take it in small doses as in 1  2 hrs till frustration sets in and have to  walk away for a day and try again. This series is not designed for PC and if it is I would be hiring new designers. I would only recommend this series on a 50 to 75 sale. It has its moments and graphics are better but was never the problem to begin with. To me they tease us with graphics and story and let us down on actuall game play and I would take game play over graphics. Story is important but what good is a story if playing is frustrating.On sale it is worth the challenging play.
