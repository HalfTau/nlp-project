For anyone thinking of playing Assassins Creed, but do not want to feel that they missed a chunk of plot I recommend playing this game. It is the best Assassins Creed game for the Mac on Steam. I recommend playing this after Assassins Creed III due to the fact that 3 has the tutorial to many of the game mechanics used in Brotherhood. Overall, it is an awesome game and you should not hesitate to play it if you are thinking of playing Assassins Creed.
