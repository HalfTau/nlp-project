The second Assassins Creed title Ive played. The core mechanics remain the same, which in most cases is a mixed blessing. In this case I think it worked out for the best, since the level design and a handful of new mechanics encouraged me to try out new tactics I hadnt attempted in the previous game. In particular I made much use of the crossbow, poison darts, and minion attacks, the combination of which allowed me to take on much larger groups of guards without losing health. As a strategic minded player, I greatly enjoyed leveling up my minions by sending them on missions.I spent 24 hours on the game, and overall I think I got my moneys worth.8/10
