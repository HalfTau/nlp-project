Personally, I enjoyed AC2 way more than Brotherhood. I think that Brotherhood was good, but some of the missions felt tacted on to remind you of the new features added on to the series. I think the story progressed nicely, but I felt some of the side missions were too much. Capturing the towers and paying to open up the stores had me hesitant to stay away from those areas until I needed them. Overall the game was good, but not great like AC2 for me.
