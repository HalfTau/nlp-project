Assassins Creed Brotherhood is the third development in Ubisofts Assassins Creed series. Brotherhood continues the narrative of Ezio Auditore, the Master Assassin from Florence, introduced in Assassins Creed II. As Ezio and his ally, Machiavelli are forced to relocate their guild to Roma Rome following persecution from the ruling party of Roma, the Borgia. Ezio continues his quest to secure the Apple of Eden and keep it from the hands of the Templars. Brotherhood has exhilirating combat, semifluent parkour, and a large basin of armour, melee and ranged weapons, equipment, and aesthetic colours to add to your everdeveloping costume. Brotherhood introduced recruiting Assassins into the series, personally one of my favourite mechanics. Being able to send your comrades out on tasks for the Brotherhood, call them into battle to assist you, or have them rain arrows in defense of their mentor is quite appealing to the Assassins Creed fan. You have the ability to increase your Assassin followers armour levels by equipping them with sturdier armour upon leveling up, and equipping them with better weapons, all the while developing their skills as an Assassin. The game does encounter some relatively frequent graphical glitches and rare crash errors. Especially towards the late game, the cinematics will often not trigger or a required clause will not register as met, causing the need to revert to a checkpoint or restart a memory, which can sometimes be considered gamebreaking. In total, Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic development in the Assassins Creed series, which sets up the story for the fourth game, Assassins Creed Revelations.
