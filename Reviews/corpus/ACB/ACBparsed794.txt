This connects exactly were Assassins Creed II ended and spins down the story further.For me this one is the major part of the Assassins Creed 2 trilogy.You get to rebuild the order of the assassins you get to manage the training of your new novices and have a whole lot to do to rebuild Rome.Rome, a big city, beautifully build and atmospheric. The characters are well made and known.It was a little bit too big I just couldnt achieve everything.Completion time about 25 hours.
