There are nine sequences to this game. However, if you dont get all side missions especially the animus/ Montessigorni and glyph missions done before sequence 8 starts, you will never get to the finish them. For this reason, I HATE this game. s at Havoc/ UPlay/ whatever studio makes this game screwed me good. Thanks for 70 hours of my life that I will never get back.
