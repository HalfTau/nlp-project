Some of the missions were buggy, I had to reload the last chapter several times,The AI is pos, the soldiers were glitchy a lot of times,I synched one of the viewpoints several times, still didnt gave me the synchronization for that tower and it was still on my map,IMO, AC2 was better.I regreted buying the Deluxe Edition, Im disappointed.
