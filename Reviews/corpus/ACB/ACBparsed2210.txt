A purely awesome game. Even after you complete the story, there are many other side objectives to complete, and I mean, come on, freerunning across buildings and strategically planning assassinations never gets old, when in Rome  Although it is worth adding that I would not suggest purchasing the game for its multiplayer,  since there are problems searching for sessions, AND its scarce to see someone actually searching for one. However, the great singleplayer definately makes up for that. Allinall, this game is great and I would seriously recommend it. D
