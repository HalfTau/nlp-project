Pros The story is not bad. To be able to recruit new assassins and send them on missions is an interesting new feature. The game mechanics are ok.Cons This game has a double DRM UPlay which does not work for some people. Regarding bugs and gliches this game is really messed up. The missions are very repetitive. It crashes a lot and you cant AltTab out of it.I loved AC1 and bought this game because I really wanted to know how the story continues  now it is the last Ubisoft game I ever bought.Ubisoft tried a few interesting new things mainly the recruitment system and flying one of leonardos inventions, but the bugs were awfull. Unfotunately one mission couldnt be solved the flying mission because the controlls stopped working. After that my motivation to take on other missions or try multiplayer was gone and I tried to end the game as fast as possible.Some of the bugs are well known to Ubisoft, but they never provided patches as Ive learned on some message boards.UPlay worked on my playthrough others werent as lucky, but I still dont understand the need for a double DRM. Being forced to make an account for playing offline really got on my nerves.This game was also very prone to crashes and AltTabbing out of it was completely out of the question.Whereas in AC 2 you visit different cities, in this game you just remain in Rome. This and the repetitive missions killed most of the replay value.All in all Id give this game 3 out of 10 points mainly for the story and the whole climbing and stealth mechanics  if thats also what you love about the AC series Id reccomend you to buy AC 1 and leave it at that.This game was a total waste of money. If you really need to buy it, buy it when its on sale.
