Found this game to be very good.For a new gamer I was lost in the mire of movements, however the training section on the game aided me in improving my abilities.For any newbie this is the game to try.On the down side there is not much to say, as my gaming exprerience is still in the novice stage.Thank you to Steam for making it easy to buy and enjoy.
