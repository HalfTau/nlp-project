I have a serious problem with Assassins Creed, in the moment when i started to play i lose the time in my mind. This game is incredible, almost perfect for me. The game is from 2007. So the graphics are not the best, but the game is only good with graphics, are same of The storyline are amazing. You will be amazed with the game for this.The gameplay is excellent, better than Assassins Creed II A lot of optional missions, so you will never be stopped The game helps you, but dont let you have a lot of challenges Something i dont like is the gameplay in the boat, is the worse, like the Assassins Creed II, sorry, its my opinion. The game have some bugs Scenario in Roma is awesome  4/5
