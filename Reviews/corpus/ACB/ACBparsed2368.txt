You dont buy this game for the gameplay. It plays almost exactly the same as the previous games. You should only get this game if you are interested in the story. It is a bit of a filler but it builds on Ezios and Desmonds characters quite well. I think its worth the money during a sale though if youre into the Assassins Creed story.Rating weighted based on the genreIm basing my rating on the game being part of a larger whole of the series. I do not recommend playing this game on its own.Story 5/5Gameplay 4/5Challenge 2.5/5Discovery 3/5Replayability 3/5Aesthetics 3.5/5Visuals 5/5Atmosphere 2.5/5Music 4/5
