Assasins Creed Brotherhood is a very exciting game, where you live and breath as Ezio Auditore, the legendary assasin. I like how Assasins Creed Brotherhood has used colourful and good graphics. I also like how Assasins Creed has used many fashionable assasination moves, i.e if you press f, you lock in a target and air assasinate it.  Overall, the game is well made, and I especially like the graphical effects. This game is totally awesome! I recommend you to play this game!
