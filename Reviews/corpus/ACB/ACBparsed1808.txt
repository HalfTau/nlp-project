Most of you have most likely heard of Assassins Creed so I wont bore you with details about the series as a whole. Assassins Creed Brotherhood is the third installment to the series leaving off where Assassins Creed 2 left off. The game feels very much like the second in many ways but the most notable is that the main character is still the assassin named Ezio, honestly most of the time I think of this more as an expansion pack instead of a standalone. Even with that being said many new features were brought into the game, most of these changes are still in the most recent release Black Flag.The game takes the gameplay of the second and enhances upon it, for example now you can equip the hidden gun with the sword or the dagger with throwing knives. Combat is far less time consuming with the introduction of the kill streaks, although this is useful it takes much of the difficulty out of the game. This is also the game that introduces assassin recruits, although it feels less refined than revalations they are still a very welcome addition to the game. Also the game adds some replayablity by allowing you to revisit missions unlike the second game, it even goes as far as to give you a reason to go back with extra objectives in a mission to accomplish what is known as full sync. Full synchronization is nice for those who are completionists and want more out of the game but sometimes they get frustrating. Last but not least the controls are still a little touchy at times you may jump the completely wrong way, this can get very annoying especially when you jump off cliffs.Sorry about the rambling there, honestly this may not be mechanically my favorite of the series but it is still one of my favorites from the series. The game introduces many mechanics that would later be some of my favorite aspects to the series after they were refined. This game definitely has my approval for anyone thinking of purchasing.
