This is a fun game, but the community is horrid and the singleplayer in my opinion was boring. Multiplayer is a lot of fun but people seem to be.. cheating somehow? Or at a higher rank you have ridiculous spy capabilities.. that in itself, ruin the multiplayer? Its.. odd. Anyways. Its fun, but meh. Community kind of ruins it. Its also at least since last I was on, kind of dead. great FUN with FRIENDS. I dont recommend playing online with random people though. With friends yes, online, no. Maybe youll get lucky though, who knows. I enjoy it though. Multiplayer anyways. D
