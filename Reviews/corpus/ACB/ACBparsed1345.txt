Atmostpheric and beautiful with a stunning soundtrack, voice acting, and top notch cinematics and direction.The story was immersive, and the historical setting alone makes this game very worthy of playing. This has to be one of the best depictions of ROME 1500ish that I have ever seen. The quality of artwork is fabulous.This is a god installment to the Assassins Creed series, and while I suppose a player could spend hours completing all of the subquests, I stuck to the main storyline to avoid any boredom.Recommended.
