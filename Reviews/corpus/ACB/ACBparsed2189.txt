ACII ended fine, but I suppose the series had to go on. Its a great game. The camera angles seem to have gotten a slight fix, they still go all wonky when you dont want them to, but not as common as they did before. Two questions linger in my mind though. How were players supposed to figure out some of these button combos for required puzzles? Also, how did Ezio age so many years in the couple weeks that pass between ACII and this game?
