So this crap is where the 100 sync t started. Crammed with pointless collectibles and unskippable cutscenes, youre gonna waste a hell lot of time trying to get the most out of this game. And seriously, the whole investments thing is just silly.The only reason I played this thrash is because I played AC2, I loved it and I wanted to know Ezios fate.
