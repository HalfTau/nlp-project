I love this game! Assassins Creed II was a great addition to the series and Brotherhood makes the series even better. I only wish that they made the Mac version of Revelations so we can FINALLY see how Ezios story ends! Im not sure if the multiplayer server is working anymore. It keeps saying that it cant connect to Ubisofts server, but it could be all of Ubisoft thats down. I really hope so, because I really want to play with my friend who JUST got Brotherhood this year haha!
