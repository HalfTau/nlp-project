The missions are much more varied than in AC2 and they added some pretty neat new gameplay mechanics, like the assassin scholars for example. On top of that, every mission now has a secondary objective you can complete for 100 synchronisation, which adds a fun extra challenge. The gameworld is not as interesting, mainly since you only have one city instead of the 4 featured in AC2.Also, in order to buy something at a shop, or unlock a fast travel location, you first have to liberate the district by lighting a heavily guarded tower on fire, and then buy the shop. You have to do this for EVERY shop in the game, which is incredibly annoying. This annoyance is however balanced out by the fact that you dont have to go all the way back to the villa every ing time you want to deposit your feathers or collect your income.In order to get the best items in the shop, you have to collect specific items of vendor trash that are dropped by enemies and are found in chests. Luckily this is completely optional, since just like in AC2 you get the best armor in the game for free by completing enough freerunning levels.Aside, someone needs to find the guy who thought it was a good idea to have sudden switches to a fixed camera in the middle of timed jumping puzzles, and grant him a swift punch in the stomachThe combat is a lot easier, since the window for counterattacking is a lot bigger and you can chain counterkills. There are also more ranged weapons and if youre lazy you can just press one button and let your assassins murder everyone for you while you sit on a bench nearby watching the fight while eating popcorn.As for the story, there is a lot less character development for Ezio, but the game does have way more interesting villains,  and there is a fantastic subplot concerning a conflict between the assassins themselves about halfway through. Especially Bartholomeo, Machiavelli and La Volpe get some nice character development.Overall, the pros and cons compared to AC2 pretty much balance eachother out, and it is definately worth buying.
