If you simply change the name of your UPlay account, then UPlay deletes all your games. This is a common problem with UPlay, so common that the internet is full of information about this. Legacy account name change.BUT when you contact UPlay support to get your sons account fixed so he has all the games you bought him for Christmas and his birthday and even Summer and Halloween, the customer service rep will pretend to not understand what is going on. Then when you explain to her the exactness of the problem, she will get really y with you that she does understand the issue, but instead of fixing the issue she will insist on argueing with you constantly.I will not purchase UPlay games anymore because of this issue.Old ReviewIf you are getting this for multiplayer, its dead as a door nail.You need 6 players to start a match, but there was only one other player in the world who wanted to play too.Single Player, too much monoteny. The same thing over and over.
