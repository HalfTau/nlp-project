Assassins Creed Brotherhood continues right where Assassins Creed II finished,and the core gameplay didnt change alot,on the other hand,there were alot of changes have been made which made a good AC sequel , ive enjoyed every hours i have spent .a little thing that have been annoying to me, is the long riding distance from mission to mission . pretty much a recommand it
