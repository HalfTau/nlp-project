Trying to add to what was added and improved in Assassins Creed 2, but what it adds doesnt really give it much value. its more of the same with some boring side missings and uninteresting minigames. the overworld is boring, the villens are more forgettable then before and the main character acts too use to what he does and isnt enjoable to watch let alone play. if your going to play this game, then your only playing it for the story which isnt that great either. this one is passable but its not something i would recommend without a big sale tag on it.
