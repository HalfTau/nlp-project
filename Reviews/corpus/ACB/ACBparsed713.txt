.....reinstalled it after a few years to show the amazing cities to a friend, to see that this abomination of programming called Uplay has deleted ALL my savegames, at least for ACII and Brotherhood. I feel sorry for everyone who spent his time to collect all the items/buildings/etc.Will never buy anything with Uplay again, not the first loss of AC savegames.
