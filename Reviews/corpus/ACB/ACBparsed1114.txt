Soooo.... I didnt enjoy AC II but I thought what the hell since Ubisoft keeps releasing this series that I should continue with this So about 7 to 8 hours into the game close to the end it descided to  with me. It keeps glitching. ALL OF THE ING TIME. Ohh... and the last Ezio chapter or sequence or how ever the  you want to call it... I couldnt start the last part, the game didnt load the cinematic. I did a quick google search and it turns out Im not the only one who had this problem. So I eventually found a solution  turn on Vsync. Like seriously? I MEAN LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL . . This. Game. Dont buy it. Ubisoft, youre the reason I drink.
