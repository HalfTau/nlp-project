A healthy sequel to Assassins Creed 2, this game took what was in AC2 and added to it. Complete with new gadgets, a brand new, large city to explore and your own guild of assassins, Ezio is well equipped to confront Borgia tyranny.That is not to say that everything that this game adds is good though. In particular are the new challenges, the 100 sync missions. These are optional, additional challenges on top of the normal missions in order to appeal to completionists. And while most are reasonably possible to do, some are outright annoying, for if you fail the 100 sync, you cannot get 100 sync without restarting themission.Luckily, the game retains the same fun, do what you want sandboxy feel that AC2 had, and my gripes are really only optional content. If you enjoyed Assassins Creed 2, definitely pick up this title too.
