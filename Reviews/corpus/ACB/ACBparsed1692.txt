Rome is not so beautiful as Firenze and Venice.But its rather big.You can find and explore famous historical buildings as Colosseum,St.Angelo Castle, Pantheon.Improved economic system.Rebuilding Rome feature is cool.Improved fight mechanic.Combo kills rocks.Also i liked crossbow.You can create your own brotherhood.There is whole mini game where you can train your assassins and then use them whenever you need.VR training feature.It gives some challenge actually.Side missions became more interesting.Improved AI.Now AI dummies can attack you together,they not just stand around.Soundtrack.Its not so bad,but its still not so good as it was in ACII.Some of the story missons is boring.So there are some weaknesses in the story.Templars is too bad and evil.Ezio outfit became more unrealistic and pathetic.Also cape moving animations sucks.Graphics looks pretty outdated for 2010.
