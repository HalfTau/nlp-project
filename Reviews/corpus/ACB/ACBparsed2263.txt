The successor is a worthy one, rife with changes.Heavy weapons can now finally be bought, allowing you to weild big swords and axes whenever you please. Youll just not use them on a horse.The setting is different now though. Largely, youll spend your time in Rome. A confusing change. Not only for you, but your horse too it seems. Horse AI never needed to be very intelligent in past games, but here their intelligence true nature seems to really surface. Its limited to silly situations, thankfully.However, being one city, Rome is one big city to be in. Youll be busy renovating stores and freeing districts from Borgia influence. Which partly is entwined in the story.That said, the story becomes quite a bit more interesting. A matured Ezio is becoming the driving force behind the goals of the Assassins, and will later on be able to command a handful of his own trainees. This forms a new method of approaching a problem. Youll have assassin signals assigned to you, which you can use to send one of your apprentices out of hiding, and attack your target.Or, when you have enough signals saved up with enough aprentices, you can launch an arrow storm attack, killing almost all hostile in the vicinity. These signals slowly replenish over time.If the story of AC2 engaged you, you will not be hard pressed to enjoy it here as well. Ezio is the child youve seen from birth, growing into a confident and strong man.
