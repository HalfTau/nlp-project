Awesome follow up to AC2.  Plenty of stuff to do after youve done the main quest, including assassinations, training your own apprentices, rebuilding parts of Rome, investing in small businesses and just soaking up the amazing atmosphere of Renaissance Italy!  It will take you well over 100 hours of gameplay to 100 complete I have only about half of this because my game client used to glitch out and not count hours.  Anyway I would 100 recommend this game if you have previously played AC2, otherwise you will have no clue about what is going on when you come to start.Graphics  9/10Sound  9/10Story  6/10Gameplay  10/10Sound  10/10
