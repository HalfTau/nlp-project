The sheer amount of talent that goes into these games, is amazing. From the story telling to the beautiful visuals, to the engaging gameplay, theres so much to take in its almost overwhelming. The development team, which is so large it spans across many countries, takes what you loved from the first games, adds to it and improves it to create a truly unique game. The multiplayer is loads of fun, and it even has its own leveling up system to improve skills and obtain weapons. Brotherhood is by far the best Assassins Creed to date. The series gets better with every game, and I cant wait to see what Revelations has in store. Buy it, play it, and requiete in pace.
