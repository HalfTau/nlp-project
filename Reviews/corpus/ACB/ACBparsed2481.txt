The 3rd game in the series it contains single and multiplayer which are seperate.The multiplayer mode is Vs with you playing as a character that looks like the townsfolk so you can blend in and kill your target which is another player.Singleplayer is pretty much let off the last game in terms of story so unless you want spoilers to be given to you in cinematics I suggest completing the previous games or it will ruin it.This game reminds me of Assassins Creed 2, with a few minor improvements to the options and UI, but nothing major from what I can tell .
