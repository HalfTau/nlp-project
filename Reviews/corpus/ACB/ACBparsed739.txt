This game takes of where Assassins Creed 2 came to an end. I dont personally think the storyline was as good as Assassins Creed 2, but I still enjoyed this game immensly and would have no problems recomending it. It takes place in Rome, and only Rome  with a few side quests in the countryside , and tough Rome is a beautiful city, alot of it is in ruins even during the years this game takes place. Still quite amazing roaming around inside some of the buildings of Rome. Well worth my time. Apparently the game continues in the 3rd installment of Ezio Auditore  Assassins Creed Revelations  So thats where Im headed next.
