I had some fun its truebut some parts are just a real pain in thebrespecially with poorly fixed camera so that you miss all your jumps especially during that smegging templar hideout beneath an aqueduct ... I spent more time trying to do the jumps than to succeed ... and that wether I tried with keyboard or controller ... the camera is so smegging lame ...
