Assassins Creed Brotherhood is what you come to expect from an AAA product. Granted it would be a daunting task to do a reasonable follow up to the eversopopular Assassins Creed 2 however considering its very slow and somewhat confusing start, stay with it as from sequence four onwards catapults this game into a newer dimension  not as much as from Assassins Creed 1 to 2 however its a total blast to play. For a newcomer for the series, if you can handle the spoilers, this game is a wonderful entry point as it has a lot to offer. Overall I felt Brotherhood is a better game than AC2 however without AC2, theres no Brotherhood.Full review here9 / 10
