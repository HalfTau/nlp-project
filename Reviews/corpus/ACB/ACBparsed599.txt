A good continuation of the Ezios story. Roma is magnificent. Gameplay is fun and polished, but as any AC game it has many repetitive aspects, one of the reasons I decided to mostly focus on the story to not get bored. Multiplayers hide and seek can be fun, though I hate players that hide within a crowd of NPCs that have identical character models. I always kill the wrong one P Anyways, if you like the previous AC games you will this one too. Do not play this one if you didnt play AC2.
