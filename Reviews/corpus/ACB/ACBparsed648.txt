One of the best AC sandbox ever!Just a one large city Rome, own assassin guild, tons of sidequests and a lot of good stuff from all previous games.Very good thing is also that from present times you have just a few minutes.But the top in this game are missions for Leonardo da Vinci. Try the tank, airglider, flamethrower ship... cool!Also, missions with Lukrecia  Borgia are also pretty good!...Now... CONs. !SPOILER WARNING!Yes. There is 1 major minus. Ending. End of the main story. Its UFOdeusexwtfmoment.But, all around, this game is really excellent!
