Are you all excited for AC Revelations? Well then You better get this now and get practicing. Oh, If you care about the story, start with AC2, but NOT AC1. AC1 is a waste of your time. AC2 is WAY better and they got everything right. come to think of it, Id say ACB had better game play, but AC2 Had the better story and ending. Have fun going around killing people, and hang in there until you can recruit assasin trainees in sequence 4, THATS when the game really shines. Prototype meets GTA in the rennesance, BETTER than both games and you need to play now. BTW the multiplayer is first rate once you get the hang of it. Its less than 30 and theres no excuse not to own and play it. Its just DAMN good and theres nothing else like it.
