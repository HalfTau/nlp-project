Truly one of my favourite Assassins Creed Games, continueing the story of Ezio Auditore. Many new features and weapons have been added so that you do not feel the game getting repetitive in any way. Its truely a in depth and wonderufl experience growing with Ezio as he gets older and ventures forward to beat the Templars and continue his quest to find more information of the pieces of eden and those who came before. I highly recomened to those who already played Assassins Creed 2 and to anyone esle who wants to enjoy a game with great graphics and an in depth adventure!
