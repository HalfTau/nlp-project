up a wallwhere this control schemedriveth meSo I skipped the first one and played II, Brotherhood, and Revelations backtoback. Id have to agree with the consensus that this is the Ezio game you want to play if youre new to Assassins Creed.Still, what blows my mind isnt the silly animus framing narrativebut that to run in this game, you have to push the left analog stick while holding a trigger and a face button. The genius who came up with this control scheme must wear the label ironically.
