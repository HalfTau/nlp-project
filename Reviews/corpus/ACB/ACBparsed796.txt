Hoo, boy. AssCreed. I played a LOT of AC2, but by the time I dug into this I was pretty over it. The world is lovely but dead  this isnt a game about systems interacting, its about a bunch of little racetracks/missions in a gorgeous world, and a bunch of stupid money and timesinks as well. Its more like a pretty layer over a boxticking spreadsheet than a game. Once I got past the basics of movement, the game here is pretty bad. Mission design is crap, gameplay is overcomplicated and fiddly, and its a criminal waste of an amazingly gorgeous world. I want this to be about systems interacting  Far Cry 2  not about trying to stay far enough behind a noble Im tailing to not fail the mission. Again.Fail.
