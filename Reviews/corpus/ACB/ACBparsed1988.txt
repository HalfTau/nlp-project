a game that will continue the previous one from the moment you left off will start out as a blast first 3 secuences were a whole lot of fun i cant say that there is anything bad about the game until that point but ofcourse since this is a negetave comment i will say them1. a game with so little story the story is good but it feels too short that ubisoft just sqeezed in so many side challanges i spent over half my game time on these side challanges that the story was not fun.2. the game contains a DLC The Da Vinchi Disapearnce which for some reason feels longer than the main game and has a more solid story3. assassins  nice touch but overuse of the same npc face i went to reqruit my last assassin and 4 of the first faces i saw were exactually the sameSPOILER4. the game is too easy going at first but on the last misson it jumps you 9 years forward with no explanation of to how the bad guy is leader of a different army unless you read it in TABmaybe i didnt play it right though....
