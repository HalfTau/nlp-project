Assassins Creed Brotherhood is another direct continuation of the AC franchise and further continues the dual modern/historic storyline. The engine and gameplay elements have been even further improved, which is appreciated. The gameplay can be repetitive and frankly easy, but at its core, its good. The storyline, while not quite as impactful as ACII, is memorable in its own way, and the entertaining cast of characters helps with that.
