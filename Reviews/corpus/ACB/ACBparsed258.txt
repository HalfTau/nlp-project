This game is pretty good   it took me 38 hours to beat the game this was including me doing everything in the game for most part upgrading all buildings and stuff.Story while not as interesting as AC2 I give it 7.5 out of 10Art 6 out of 10Music 7 out of 10Overall I give this game a B it was well worth the time put into it and good value for the 6.79 I paid for it.I would wait until this is on sale 20 bucks is a little too much. I havent tried multiplayer yet will soon.
