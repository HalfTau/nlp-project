The first Assassins Creed was clearly a game with great potential and cool ideas, a new approach to the sneak and stealhgenre. But alas, it turned out weak due mostly to its highly repetitive missions and completion structure, unintresting plotline and world and its generally unpolished finish. Cue Brotherhood, the third installment in the franchise. This is Assassins Creed in its top form. A beautifully rendered Rome in the Reneissance Era with characters, buildings and events from reallife combined with the fictionous Ezio and his quest, vastly imporved controls that add to the fluidity of the parkour movements and the general feeling that now I, the player, am in control of not only Ezio but also Rome. This is how it should have been from the beginning!
