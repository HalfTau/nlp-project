In some ways, Brotherhood is a lesser game than its predecessor, Assassins Creed 2. It feels like a step back limiting the majority of the action to just one city in this case Rome instead of a larger portion of Italy. The game makes up for this by introducing more sandbox mechanics. Its also the first title in the series where you get to command Assassin Recruits and get them to help you in combat. It feels like less of a full title and more of an expansion for the second game in both length and scope, but this doesnt stop it from being worth your time.
