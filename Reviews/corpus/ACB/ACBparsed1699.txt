If you liked Assassins Creed II you will probably like Assassins Creed Brotherhood. Just like the previous game, its really easy, now easier with Assassin recruits that do your job and a Crossbow, also with Posion Dart but who uses that. The entire repairing Rome is useless since the game is easy, so you dont need better weapons, just keep the one you get for FREE, and the best armor is obtained for free. Only thing youre going to buy is pouches. Taking down Borgia Towers is fun. The AI is still dumb as . The side quests are more fun, adding a different kind of Assassination Mission Templar Agents. Multiplayer is great. You can do missions at 100, which adds a little replayability. This feels like an expansion to Assassins Creed II, but slightly feels and plays better. Did I say themultiplayer is great? Infact on Xbox, I spent over 600 hours playing it competitively.In a nutshell, if you like Assassins Creed II, you will like this, but its way easier... Multiplayer is fun. 8/10
