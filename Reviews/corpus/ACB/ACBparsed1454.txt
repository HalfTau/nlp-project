THIS GAME SUCKS! I installed it hoping to play multiplayer with my friend, but it lagged sooo badly! It is so laggy it is unplayable, I get about 2 fps. MY computer is not amazing, but it is not bad either, I have 8 GB of RAM and an Intel i5 core. It lags and glitches and crashes, so i do not recommend this game, even if you have a good computer, as my friend did and it still crashes for him, so it is probably a fault in the programming.
