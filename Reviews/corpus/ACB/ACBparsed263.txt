After returning to the game three months later, the problems seem to have largely disappeared and I havent had trouble with the game so far. Im still not sure what fixed it whether it was uninstalling, remapping the keys, verifying files, or just leaving it alone for a while, its up and running properly now. With that, Im pleased to be able to change my review to Recommended DOriginal reviewI really wanted to be able to recommend this game, but I just cant. Bugs strewn everywhere people walk into walls, people get stuck on flat surfaces, people walk right through me during cutscenes. Ezio is afraid of stairs, lets go of ledges and immediately grapples the next one down, immediately resheathes weapons upon drawing them, keys are sticky eg. cant stop sprinting, mouse sensitivity is whack. So far seen, the setting is unsatisfying and feels like a watered down version of ACII. I may give it another go in a few weeks, and will update this review if my experience improves.
