A refinement of part 2, which I liked more but which I also did not play on Steam, so youre getting a recommendation of this and not that. The gameplay is standard Assassins Creed stuff with a few additions that make it much easier, its up to you whether thats a good or bad thing. I found a lot of the upgrade systems to be largely unecessary and mostly just busywork. If you play it stealthy like youre supposed to you wont need more powerful weapons and armor. And as long as you learn the combat you can get by with anything. The dialogue is not always great but at least the overall story is not insufferably bad. Requiescat in pace, videogioch.
