Assassin Creed Brotherhood and Assassin Creed 2 are some of my favorite games. It was a pleasure to play this game with rich story based on true characters from history. Gameplay was just as good as in AC2 and I loved the continuation of the story. Its a must play for any fan of story driven action game.
