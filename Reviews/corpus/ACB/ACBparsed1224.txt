The story of Ezio Auditore continues on with Brotherhood that brings new gameplay elements and multiplayer.The story is on par with the last game and brings plenty of hours of fun. However the multiplayer is awful and unbalanced. Even if you would try to play the multiplayer you would probably never be able too because its long dead.
