This must be one of my absolute favourite game in the AC game series. Im one of those people who think that Ezios story and a bit of Altairs aswell, was the best in the series, and after Desmond died, the game followed.I particularly love the ability to recruit, train and use other assassins to fight by your side, and somehow there just seems to be more interesting stuff going on than compared to AC 2. I guess its Ezios more mature side spiced with that charming, wellknown personality of his.Definately recommending this to everyone who feels like giving Ezio a spin or two, once again.
