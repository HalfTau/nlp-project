Elements from ACII are carried to this game and the story continues with a little more of everything. This time around, the player feels more included in the Assassin band because you could send in a team at your command. The story is as interesting as ACII if not a little less, because the game tries to answer everyones questions, both the audience and Ezios. There are a few more gadgets and a brotherhood, otherwise that is it. The gameplay is basically the same as in ACII. By the end of ACII, Ezio got a bit comfortable, but right from the beginning of this game, it is clear that there are other powers out there that are constantly uprising. As usual, the game design is beautiful. The city of Italy has a lot to take in with many areas to explore. The missions are roughly the same as in ACII, but there are a few new ones that were refreshing. This iteration of the series was not as amazing as ACII, but was still a fun game to experience.The developers played it a bit safe by just using the same formula from the previous game. I enjoyed the sense of Brotherhood when interaction with the assassin family in the game. I thought that the addition of the crossbow was awesome, and on top of that the arrow storm proved to be very useful in many situations that I encountered.Although there was a good amount of features added to the game, I did not get the same sense of awe throughout the game.
