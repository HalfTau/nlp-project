Again, you play Desmond who plays a game set in the past in order to find clues in the future. Sadly still for Desmond, the character he controls in the game still likes to vere to the left when told to jump straight and assassinate bystanders standing behind guards. Though, Desmond seems to care little for those he kills in game as the Death toll really peeks in this game.In this title you rise up in the ranks from mere Assassin and owner of a small kingdom to the man who bought all of Rome through the proceeds of his personal vendetta.You earn followers along the way and can begin outsourcing much of the killing so you can focus on walking slowly through the streets and avoiding minstrels.Over time you will gain all the coolest gear that you had in the previous game but as with many games you are just handed a BFG for part of the finale and the tools you have earned can not be used in the lead up to the final pay off.  Luckily you hand that BFG and all your wealth to DaVinci and go in search of the bad guy at the end. Sadly, your posse of outsourced Assassins which you have earned throughout the game and painstakingly leveled up will not join you in the final battles so you will have to kill this final bad guy yourself.. and boy is it tedious. Why are the cowardly bad guys in games that throw wave after wave of guards at you always the most tedious to kill?4 stars.
