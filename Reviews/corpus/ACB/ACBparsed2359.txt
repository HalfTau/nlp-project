The jump of quality from Assassins Creed to Assassins Creed 2 was as big as the Grand Canyon. The leap to Brotherhood is not as big, but the game brings quite a few improvements. Now you manage a brotherhood of assassins while trying to take down the Borgia. It has a lot of side missions, which do not get repetitive and the city of Rome is really fun to explore. I highly recommend this game to any fan of actionadventure games.
