My favorite of the assassins creed games of the series  I dont really follow the franchise but I enjoy the mechanics for some sandbox fun. I dont pay attention to the story at all.I feel the controls are ok  sometimes clunky as other reviewers have stated. Highly recommend a controller for this.The graphics are still decent the map is medium sized with enough varied content for hours of enjoyment.I would recommend 7/10
