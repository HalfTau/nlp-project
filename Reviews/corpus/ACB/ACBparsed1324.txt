Coming in off ACII, which is undeniably one of the high points in the Assassins Creed  series, the bar is set high for Brotherhood. Set in Rome several years after the events in ACII, Brotherhood expands on the story surrounding the Borgia and their attempt to take the city and then the entirety of Italy.Personally, I found the storyline uninteresting and failed to drive me to move forward in the game compared to II where I was riveted the whole way through. I think this is in part marred by the introduction of the extra feats you need to complete to achieve a 100 Sync on missions, you find yourself concentrating more on some of the sometimes ridiculous extra criteria that have been set for you rather than the mission and its impact on Ezio, Rome and the larger world.Rome itself is quite possibly one of the dullest settings in an Assassins Creed game, players were spoilt with the multiple venues of II and if you move onto Revelations, Constantinople has more character and charm about it than Rome does. The Lairs of Romulus add in an extra spark to an otherwise boring landscape, but again the 100 sync challenges may mean you want to speed through these locations instead of taking them in fully.Combat hasnt really evolved from the second game, youll find a majority of fights easy and with the added bonus of being able to call upon your own team of assassins, any fight where your seriously outnumbered can be evened out in a matter of moments. The fact that you are recruiting assassins and sending them out on varying missions really does help you feel that you are being instrumental in helping to establish a proper order in Italy and will leave a legacy in Ezios name.Brotherhood can be considered a low point in the series, the game feels like theyve tried to cram too much into it in a short space of time, not really developing the new features fully, making the experience a somewhat stop/start affair. There is still plenty to keep die hard Assassins Creed fans occupied and there is enough lore here to warrant playing through the game to keep abreast of the whole arcing storyline that runs through the AC series. Worth picking up when on offer, just dont expect it to light up your life.Ignore the 230 hrs played, there was a glitch in the matrix that added 180hrs to my play time.
