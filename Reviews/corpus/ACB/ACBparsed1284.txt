This is the first game to tie the presence of a SSD to the ability to gallop your horse, ha! buffer speed. This game is too easy. Compared to the last game, some things are better, some worse, overall not much improvement. The main story is a bit shorter. As always, gameplay can degenerate to frustrating trialanderror. At least the menu is better. As usual Uplay is a pain. These games could be great without consolitis.
