I can say without hesitation that Brotherhood is easily the best installment out of the entire Assassins Creed franchise. Ubisoft Montreal took the massive breakthrough that was AC2s gameplay and refined it, expanded it, and built on top of it  giving the player an experience with an immense amount of depth and ceaseless enjoyment.While some might say that this game was more expansion than a true release the continuation of Ezio Auditores storyline did wonders for the character, the historical time period, and the AC universe in general.Brotherhood was also the first title in the series to feature an online multiplayer that not only amazed us with its addictiveness but also really challenged us  rewarding players for being patient and clever instead of relentless and clumsy.
