This was my first Assassins creed game and I was lost but at the same time fell imerse into the world and the characters are somewhat memorable. The plot and missions were amazing from just walkigna round hiding to stealhty killing and parkouring my way through venice. Tho I had no idea wf was going on I still fell inlove with it.
