After trying, over and over, to get into this game, all I can say is its one big disappointment. As much as Im sure the story and later levels are fantastic, I simply cannot get into this game because of the combat. Having played a whole lot of Black Flag, trying to learn the combat system for this game is a measure in frustration, incredulity, and stupidity. Sometimes you can counter. Often you cant. Theres no indicator for when your attempt to counter is going to work or not, and I cannot get the combat system to respond in any manner of consistent way.Sometimes you can break a hold, sometimes you cant. It seems to be entirely random whether or not your attempts to attack, counter, block, or dodge are going to work, resulting in even a modest number of guards able to whittle your health down significantly.I understand that the focus should be on NOT engaging in combat, but often the game forces you into it, and punishes you for doing so. I so very much want to like this game. I really, really, really want to like it. But the combat system is total trash.
