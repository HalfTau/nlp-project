Assassins Creed Brotherhood expands once again in every aspect of the game. Combat is even more fluid, story is even more engaging, and adds many new features to the Assassins Creed Genre. Oh and there is multiplayer as well. So it adds endless replay ability to the game. If you loved the previous games, you will love this one. They have done away with exploring countless viewpoints to view your map and have minimized the amount of points to explore the map. Though you are on one map of Rome rather than multiple environments, you are still thrown to various areas to spice up the scenery from time to time.Havent had any problems other than the rare ninja spot where the AI just immediately spot you, even though you are not notorious but it isnt game breaking. Definitely a must buy, if you loved the previous games.
