So this is where my enjoyment of the AC Series tapered right off and I just decided I CBA with it anymore. More of the same  admittedly cool running, the same bloat collectemall subgames, the substandard AI and lack of fulfilment of the original AC concept...the watereddown casualisation yes I just invented a word of the GTA openroamer. Inevitably, a typical allyoucaneat Ubisoft game.Personally I had my fill with AC1 and AC2. Observing the annualisation of the series and general direction probably had more of an influence on my decision not to continue with this game, and series. As a AAA stalwart, AC has always been very polished and maintained high standards, but it is just not the game for me.
