... Eh. Only if youve already beaten ACII and are hungry for more.Dont get me wrong theres nothing much wrong with it. Its solid, its just more of the same. There are changes here and there that make it more polished, but at the end of the day, ACII had a solid and interesting, if not terribly inspired, story backing up its gameplay and exploration every step of the way, supporting its flaws. Brotherhood... kinda doesnt. Its fine, its just less engaging than its predecessor, and while some of the new gameplay tools are quite fun, its hard to justify buying a whole game for more of the last one without having a story of some sort worth carrying it.
