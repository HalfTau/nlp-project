The game that broke Assassins Creed, both in terms of combat and world design. Its not completely terrible its no III, Revelations, or god forbid Unity, but its not quite as good as 2 either. If youre okay with pathetically easy combat that basically gives any pretense of this being a stealth game the middle finger and spending large portions of your time trotting slowly around big empty fields on a horse, hey, more power to you.I really wish Steam would let me give a meh score not quite yes, not quite no. Somewhere in between. Just... you know... meh.
