Assassins Creed Brotherhood, hmmm.. Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a Wholesome Gory, Enjoyable and Deadly Stabbing frenzy through Roma. Set in Renaissance Italy spanning 7 years of Ezios life 15001507. Assassins Creed 2 was a work of art so naturally Assassins Creed Brotherhood follows in its footsteps and the style of combat is the same but improved drastically. Perhaps the best edition to ACB is Assassin Recruits. Assassin recruits are like Ezios entorauge, as you explore Roma you gain the chance to recruit new brothers into the brotherhood, hence the name. The story takes off from AC2 and Ezio must kill Ceasre Borgia. Along the way you must assassinate lower ranking Templars and work your way up.This is the best Assassins Creed game yet to come in my opinion. 9/10
