23 hours or so long, I did lots of sidequest things.Game runs fine and looks prettier than AC2.  Controls are a bit righter, but there are a lot less rooftops to run around in and a lot more open fields.Compared to AC2, this game streamlines the combat without improving it at all.  Bosses are as dissapointing as they ever were, but now there are less of them.  There is not much innovation in mechanics or content, but zones are much more well designed and fleshed out.  Storyline is fine, but theres a lot of pointless sidequest and a few plot points just left unadressed.  Theres a trade good and shop quest system that is not at all developed or fun.  Theres a few new tools for the player to use but not necessarily in interesting ways.Overall the game is basically AC2 with more spitshine but, as will come with the curse of sequels, they dont do anything unsafe with it.
