Image this Youre strolling along in the streets of roma, florins in hand and ready to invest in shops and buy some new gear. As you reach your destination you suddenly cant accsess any of the ingame shops. You might wonder why.The answer Uplay.The worst idea ever conceved has been cramed into an otherwise excellent service, i.e. Steam. And although you stay connected to Steam servers nonstop, the Uplay Bloatware is hardly ever working, thus half of your legally purchased game is blocked. Its also a massive drain on your hardware so here is my tip for an enjoyable gaming experience1. Buy this game which by itself is pretty good, despite the controls not working and glitches that makes me wanna trow a donkey through the Lead Designers window.2. DO NOT INSTALL THE PURCHASED GAME. Instead just keep in your library3. Get the game torrented. Why? Because you can play your legally purchased game WITHOUTH Uplay, thus you always have full accsess to the whole game and never have to rely on a bloated joke of a program with giant quotation marks to actually work. The pirates simply offer a better service. So pay for the game, but keep the bought copy in your library.No problems
