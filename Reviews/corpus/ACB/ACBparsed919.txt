Only unity ranks worse than this game, 90 of the fights involve ezio in the attack stance and no attacking, but just watching, This is what happens when you map the attack button to the button that enables you to do things like attack people, if you let go, you cant attack, but while your pressing it, you cant attack either. Also, once you enter a battle, you cant leave, there no no such option as running away, even though the entire first mission is comprised of you running away. This is a complete piece of sht. Also, the game crashes everytime I try to leave it. Guess it cant even handle its own awfulness.
