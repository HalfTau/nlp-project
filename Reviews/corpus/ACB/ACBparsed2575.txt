This is the first  of the 3  Assassins Creeds so far that gives some love to the pc version. Way improved graphics, user interface and the like.the keys map to the pc keys for the first time. The fiction, gameplay and aesthetic are all there again and I highly recommend Brotherhood if you enjoyed the last 2 at all.
