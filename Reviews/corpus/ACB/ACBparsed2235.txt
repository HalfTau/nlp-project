Do you think you are a true assassin?This is so far my favorite AC game. It introduces many new things that AC 2 didnt have, while still giving the same feel of being stealthy and awesome. You can hide behind corners, on top of buildings, and assassinate targets without even alerting a bug. After completing the game, I was left with many things to do, but instead I decided to move on to Revelations. I hope it offers as much excitement as this game has!
