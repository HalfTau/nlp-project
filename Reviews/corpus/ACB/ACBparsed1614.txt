The only thing I hated in this game was the 100 synchronization accomplishment, it wasnt needed and it took the fun out of the missions.However, the story is just as amazing as the first one from AC 2. And the graphic design of the cities definitely improved since the previous game. Including new fighting mechanics, new side missions and now you can recruit Assassins and have them kill a target at the push of a button!A must get if you want to continue Ezios story.
