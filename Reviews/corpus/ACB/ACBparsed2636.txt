Assassins Creed II is a masterpiece of game design, vastly improving upon the original and somewhat bland Assassins Creed.Brotherhood is a game in the vein of the traditional expansion  more of the same, but with a vast new game world, tweaked mechanics and more stuff to do  a huge serving that vastly outweighs any piecemeal DLC.An absolute blast to play in a beautifully realised world, if you like action / adventure in a bit of a sandbox, you owe it to yourself to play this.
