A worthy follow up to Assassins Creed II. It advances the plot further and gameplay mechanics are much improved upon. I love this game and have spent alot of time on the whole series. Graphics arent improved that much from the other games in the series, but the changes in weapons, cities, and missions make it new and exciting.
