Very old but VERY beautiful game. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME ANYMORE. The reasons are the followings1 UplayYou have to deal with Uplay alot before you get to play the game. also uplay updates and overlay are very annoying and very unacceptable.2MultiplayerIt totally sucks and has no potential of being a good multiplayer.3 The cutscenes.BIG BIG MISTAKE, The cutscenes are made while playing which isent a big deal  BUT the big deal is that if a cutscene is in the room Every time a camera angle changes the whole room rerenderes and it will cause frame drops... lag and bad quality.4 Inventory makes no sense and is unusable for the most part.5Controlls, overall game response, and MOUSE ING MOUSE.The game is totally not optimised for pc and mouse game response and  everything sucks.Even though I finished the game 4 times I still dont recommend it because I dident enjoy my gameplay.
