Very much an iteration on Assassins Creed II, but not necessarily in a bad way. The combat and movement of Ezio feels more fluid and refined, and so does everything else in this sequel.Rome is a fantastic location with tons of unique scenery and history. The missions are varied and fun and the game is about the right length. A bit shorter than Assassins Creed 2 which was a bit too long in my opinion.Make sure you activate the free Leonardo DaVinci expansion in UPlay, it contains a couple of great missions.The biggest difference from the last game is that youre not on your own as much anymore. You get to recruit and train followers that can earn you money and aid you in combat.Lastly its great to see proper controller bindings now, bindings that actually makes sense. Assassins Creed II controller binds were just all over the place but now it works like it should.Overall a great, refined game!
