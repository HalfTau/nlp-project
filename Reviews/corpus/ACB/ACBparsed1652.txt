This game is a pretty good step forward from AC2, the combat system has been updated, I have a sense that the freerunning animations have been polished more and sometimes the story one ups the last. I like the Christina missions, as it gave a nice nostalgic vibe, seeing Florence with brotherhood graphics is amazing, and i definetly liked the Steel Armor for Ezio in some of them as it looked more fresh than AC2. I havent played the multiplayer yet, but I assume its good unless ubisoft have taken down the servers. The Lairs of Romulus are fun sometimes too, they act the same as the Assassin Tombs in AC2, Leonardos War Machine Missions are good aswell, I think they pay off too, I did sometimes get stuck, and sometimes they do get stressy, since Its not really in my nature to not get caught, I had to be extra sneaky. The customisation is more varied than AC2 aswell, but still sticking with some of the AC2 patterns, like Wetlands Ebony and some of the Florence colors. Overall, I would say that this game in my opinion is a bit better than AC2, since there are alot more story oppertunities, and it goes well with the big map too, plus it saves some loading screens going from one place to the other in AC2.
