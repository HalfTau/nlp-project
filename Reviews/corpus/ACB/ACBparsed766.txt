Sadly this is the final decent game in my opinion from the Assasins Creed Francise Not only did it carry with it everything that was great from the previous 2 games but it added more game machanics and improved on what AC 1 and 2 brought to the table. I felt this was outstanding and an original masterpiece in its own right  a game that stood on its own completly. This is an all time classic and deserves to get a 9.5 out of 10. Sadly after playing all AC titles after this, they all suffered greatly from the cash grab syndrome, being released with numorous bugs glitches and sound desync bugs otherwise known as rush jobs.
