It seems a majority of these negative reviews arent for Assassins Creed Brotherhood, but are for the Uplay client. When this game came out, Uplay was in its infancy, and it has undergone many updates since. Uplay is completely stable these days and hasnt given me a single problem in about a year.Whenever I hear somebody say Assassins Creed II is the best game of the series, I just want to tell them to replay it. Its glitchy and controls terribly, especially after being used to the updated control refinements that ACIII and Black Flag introduced. That being said, This game doesnt control as well as the aforementioned two games, but the controls are tighter and, overall, the intuitive nature of the parkour/jumping algorithms are significantly improved.The graphics, while not a drastic overhaul from its predecessor, are quite good and there seems to be more attention to detail in the texture work within the environment. Also the lighting is noticably superior.I would say the only thing that may be worse in this game than its predecessor is the story. But thats only because everyone loves an origin story, which was the heart of the first game. Although, the villains in this installment are far more fleshed out and its really fun seeing the family dynamic of the Borgias play out.In conclusion, this is an A game that refines its previous entries shortcomings and is really the peak of the Ezio trilogy, if not the entire Assassins Creed franchise.
