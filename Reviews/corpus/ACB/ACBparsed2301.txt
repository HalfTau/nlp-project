Same game as Assassins Creed 2. Slightly streamlined, but lots more sandbox stuff if you really want to get into it. That content is entirely skippable, luckily.Ubisoft ed up the UI controls in this one, however, by separating them from the character controls. So annoying now to switch back and forth on the keyboard just to buy a goddamn potion. Too bad the humour in the game dies after the first fifteen minutes, too. I liked Ezio getting made fun of.If you liked 2, play Brotherhood. Just be prepared for the longest, worst credit roll in history.
