6/10Fairly dissappointed. The story campaign was not as expected. Controls are obviously not optimized for PC gameplay, although still playable. Combat system improved since previous titles but not as good as the new ones. Parkour system is awful. Missions including side missions are too repetetive. Story length is equivalent to other AC games. Its honestly not as epic as the trailer makes it seem like it is.
