Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a great game. The setting is amazing. But as for my own opinion is concerned, I think Rome is not entirely remade as it should be in this game. The Capitolini is to the contrary of real life, in which it is way bigger. The Forum Romanum is just awfully done. The only thing the makers did well is the placement of all the buildings, the rest they just ed up. The Pantheon and the Colosseum however are a blast to see and experience in ACB, they are pretty well remade. Just as much as in Assassins Creed 2, I hate the storyline of Desmond and Co. Seriously, this is getting really annoying. Ubisoft knew nobody liked and cared about Ezios story, but still they decided to put this son of a B. in another 2 games. This kills the fun for me. But still i love Assassins Creed Brotherhood, even though its a replica of Assassins Creed 2 with a few adjustments just in another city, its still a good game to play.Have fun playing.EDIT It would be nice if you could actually skip the 18 minute long credits instead of waiting them through...
