Good way to continue from where AC2 has ended. If you want to play a good Assassins Creed game, heres more of it where AC2 left off. Combat is still lawful, and I was in no hurry trying to get the best armour of the game. I finished the story mode without it.I havent really played the multiplayer. Im not the one to judge it. I tried the tutorial  it required a rebind to the controller, but I havent really done much in that.I recomend it for the story mode.Update after 102 hours of playing If youre a fan of the series  you have a SSD, go on and have a go, but if you dont you cant 100 the singleplayer. Ubisoft back in 2010 decided to make galloping a SSD only feature in freeroam mode. My second playthrough was not as enjoyable as the first. Also to note some the DaVinci machines are awkward to control and completing the no hit requirement in the memory just makes it infuriating.
