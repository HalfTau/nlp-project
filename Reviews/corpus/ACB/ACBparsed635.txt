Ac brotherhood is ac 2 part two. I think brotherhood is just as good as ac 2.  The only reason why i would put ac brotherhood on spot 2 is because the story in ac2 was just a little bit better almost no difference imoIm a huge fanboy of the series. This is my opinion.Story Its about Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Hes an assassin. When the templars attack he descides to go to rome roma to make an end to thetemplars. Its a really goood story! I just love it.gameplay The gameplay hasnt really changed. There are more side quests in this game. and you never find yourself lacking of something to do. There is one diference. You now possess over a couple of assasin novices. who can help you in you in a fight or in stealth situations.graphics The game is old and doesnt look amazing. But i for a game from this age, i wouldnt pay attention to it.verdict if you liked ac 2 you MUST buy this. If you like any other ac game, consider buying it. If you are a real fan of the franchise you should have played it already.
