Awsome Game. Very nice the fact that continues the Storyline of the Anonimus character, Ezio Auditore dda Firenze. The fact that the assassins are recruted by him and they can be sent on missions around Europe is one of the best things and the only game where u have that much controll over your assasins. It was a pleasure to play it for the first time and the same way it was a pleasure to play it recently.
