Gonna keep this simple with no spoilers. I have a 300 laptop I was able to play this on, no graphics card, decent cpu. And running it wasnt real smooth, 1226 fps at 800X600 but I loved the game so much I finished it with it set so small with bad graphics. Which even with low and off graphics it still looked great. Wish I could actually make it look worse. Recomend 100.
