Brotherhood is a direct continuation of AC2, and mostly more of the same in terms of story, gameplay, missions, etc.One thin this game does that I really liked was that you can run your own assassins guild, send them on missions, level them up, and make money and gain items by doing so. I had a lot of fun with this, although its not a very big part of the game.Although the game is more of the same when looking at AC2, there is definitely quite a lot more of it here. Unlike AC2, I ignored most of the side missions in this game, and just focused on the main story. The reason I skipped most of the side content though, was because there was just so much of it. If you enjoy the side activities in AC games, theres quite a lot to delve into here. However, I never really felt it was all that necessary. I only upgraded my items a few times, and was able to beat the game with low to mid tier equipment. So challenge wise I didnt feel the need to level my stuff up.There is also a nice mechanic in this game, where you are rebuilding Rome by buying and refurbishing businesses, making money off of investments, etc. After a while I could afford anything in the game, but didnt really need to buy anything. Which I think is a problem AC games have in general. Unless you can offer me something really cool, or unless the equipment is really necessary, the ingame economies never make much sense.On that note, something else the AC series keeps trying to do but never seems to get quite right is the player housing. I love the idea of having an Assassins base, but theres really no reason to ever go there, and not a lot of customization options either, so I dont really feel like it became my home.The story feels very much like a middle game, in that it continues the plot from AC2 but you can tell its just filler before the third installment.Overall, a solid, enjoyable Assassins Creed adventure, although much of the same as the previous game in the series.
