This is one of the best Assassins Creed games. Rome is easily explorable, and fun to run around in.The only annoying thing is Full Synch, which involves completing challenges exactly how the main character did it. If youre a completionist like I am, this can get very frustrating on some missions.All in all I completely recommend this, just play for fun!
