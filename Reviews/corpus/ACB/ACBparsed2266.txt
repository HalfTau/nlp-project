This is in truth of of the greatest games I have ever played. Packing not only a story and some gameplay, it also delivers an ideology.The story is good, although not as fantastic as the game in the series prior to this Assassins Creed II. The gameplay on the other hand is brilliant, and odds are you wont be 100 done before youve spent a couple of days with it.Assassins Creed Brotherhood offers multiple ways to deal with objectives, as well as a lot of small side missions and quests. Youre able to build and customize both yourself, but also your allies.At the top of my head, you can do just about anything you would want to do in the rennesaince, apart from killing innocents. Including riding around on a unicorn.
