Great game that continues the epic story of Ezio, a charasmatic character, and a time when the AC franchise actually improved from each interaction.Liked the new feature about recruiting and training new assassins, even though it couldve played a larger role in the game if some deep was added to it, the gameplay seem more refined but betwen AC2, i have my doubts that is better tought, just a matter of opinion, i guess.
