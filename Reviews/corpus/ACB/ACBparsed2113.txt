A sequel to AC2, you could easily say that this is AC2 again but extending the storyline further with some better closure than the previous game delivered Its basically AC2s second half. It picks up right where AC2 ends and continues on with more funtimes and stuff to do. There are new improvements here to the gameplay, graphics, and the gigantic city of Rome is much larger and unique than any other location in the previous games. Its slightly bigger than its predecessor, and it adds multiplayer which probably nobody plays anymore as well. If you want innovation, there isnt much here. But if you enjoyed AC2 and want to keep running with that, this is the game for you.
