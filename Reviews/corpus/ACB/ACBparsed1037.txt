Assassins Creed Brotherhood had an interesting story, but it got very menotonous at times. The ending was terrible and the overall game value was poor, it serves as a time gap filler between 2 and 3.Makes a lot more sense and becomes better if you play Revelations, but some of the gameplay additions to this one make the game break even to alright.
