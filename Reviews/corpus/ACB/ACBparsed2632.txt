A must have for any Assassins Creed fan!The game adds substantial new content and improvements to make it worth the full price. While some people, myself included. Thought before launch that it would simply be a rehash of AsC 2 with little new content in terms of the singleplayer. We have definitely been proven wrong.This game is also a proper PC port with vastly upgraded graphics in comparison to AsCB on consoles. Proper UI, HUD and menus and for the first time in a while, the ability to play offline yes, thats right the DRM that was so hated in AsC 2 is now gone!The multiplayer is extremely fun and while some might say it bears resemblence to the Ship, the similarities are small, if any at all. At most one could say it was inspired by the Ship.The multiplayer mechanics work well and leave a lot of room for player skill to play a role. There is also a decent variety of modes, all of which provide different feel and play tactics.All in all the best AsC to date!
