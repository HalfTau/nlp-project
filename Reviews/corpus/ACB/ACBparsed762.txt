This game is really fun even though the wrist blade is unrealastic. I cant write much of a review because i am on a mac book air which doesnt run this type of game well. From my experience with this game i rate it a 7.5/10 I rate it this low just because I find that the future part and you are using a machine to go into the past is kind of stupid it should just be you are playing a character in the past. This is probably the theme throughout all assassins creed but i dont know so I cant talk about other Assassins Creed Brotherhood.
