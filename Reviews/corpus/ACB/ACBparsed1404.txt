ATTENTION EVERYONE WHO CANT LOGIN!!!!!! I cant promise that this will work for you but it worked for me. search your computer files for ubisoft game launcher. Or if you know where it is in your computer files just go to it and open it. When you open it find UPLAY. It is listed as an application. It is about 25,000 kbs. Right click it. Then select properties. After selecting properties. Click compatibility tab. Then select RUN COMPATIBILITY TROUBLESHOOTER. Just follow the on screen prompt. It took me two different settings to run but it worked when I tested the program. Be sure after you test it and it works to SAVE THE NEW SETTINGS. meaning just finish the on screen prompts. I really hope this works for all of you as it did for me. If this helps you please just give me a thumbs up. And if you have any questions please ask and I will get to you as quickly as I can. I hope I explained clearly enough.
