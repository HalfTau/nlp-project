The beginning of the game is terrible.  It throws you into the woods like a newborn baby without any introduction to how the new combat system works.  After you get past the enslaught it starts to get better.  The game is pretty much AC2 but with some new features.At least its playable unlike AC4 which I still cant get to run because its so badly optimized.
