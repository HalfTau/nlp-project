Without any concernable doubt, this is by far the greatest game to ever grace the Assassins Creed series. Brotherhood has the most enjoyable and free flowing combat system that truly makes you feel like a real master Assassin. Be sure to exploit every single crevice of Rome to find all the sidequests, because once youre hooked to this game, which you will without a doubt be, you will be thirsting for every drop of this games content. Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.
