16th century Rome is beautiful, a great continuation of the Ezio trilogy. Gameplay is identical to ACII with a few new mechanics so you have nothing to get used to. Difficulty feels like it has been increased but nothing too frustrating. The most notable new mechanic is right in the title, being able to recruit assassins and help you out when you call upon them. However the game starts to feels like a grindfest when you want to rebuild Rome, its the same mechanic on liberating each sector muder captain, climb tower, set fire. Rennovating the shops is also just as tedious.But if you a fan of the Assassins Creed series or open world gamplay, this is something you will enjoy.
