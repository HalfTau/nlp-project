This game is a direct continuation of AC2 and improves upon the gameplay in many ways. There are new gadgets crossbow, poison darts, parachute to name a few that make Ezios arsenal finally feel complete Im not sure why it took so long to get the crossbow though, Altair had one in the intro movie for the first game. The ability to call assassins is great fun and actually makes you feel like part of the brotherhood instead of just a lone wolf. In many ways Ezio is just completely overpowered which isnt necessarily a bad thing so when I see a group of guards its a question of how do I want to kill them as opposed to what is the most effective way to kill them since all the methods are effective. The Leonardo missions are also fun Ezio gets to drive a tank in one.That said, this game feels like it really should have been an expansion pack for AC2 instead of a sequel. There isnt much to the story and what is there is drawn out longer than it should have been. Ideally the best placement for this game would have been right before the final act of AC2 so Ezio builds up to finally confronting his arch rival. The bad guy in this game just doesnt seem all that exciting after fistfighting the pope at the end of AC2.The world is also MUCH smaller. Youre stuck in one city the entire game with no countryside either.That said, the game was still a lot of fun and is easily recommended. As with all older games, wait to pick it up on sale.
