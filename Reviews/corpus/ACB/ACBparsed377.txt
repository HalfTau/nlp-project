 Epic ending like previous series. Actually more epic. I was in tears. Controlling became LITTLE better I suppose? Maybe it was just me who got a little more used to it. If I want to finish it, Id say its a fun game. However just like the previous series it has serious bugs and aggravating parts. So prepare yourself spilling some harsh language at Etzio. Ezio? Who cares. That stupidly running parkour maniac. PULL FASTER! You will know waht I mean if you play. Hahahahahaha. Action became much more efficient and smoothing. I liked the graphics. These days games tend to become requiring needlessly high spec PC but Id say this, The Division, and GTA 5 is where graphics should stop and focus on programming you know? This is enough. Too many side quests! What the heck! Did you see the map? How did you even manage to put icons so close to each other like that? Jesus! Hey, if youre going to jump whole chunk of story because you spent too much time on side quests, just reduce it and focus on main quests! What the heck are you doing? Gliding quest was irritating as my grand mother.
