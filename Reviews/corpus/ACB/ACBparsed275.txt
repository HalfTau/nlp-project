Id say this is a good game to continue Ezios life and the future of the Brotherhood. So far Ive never got to play this game even though I played Revelations and the 2nd game and so on..... Finally got to play Brotherhood. The graphics are pretty decent for a game that came out 67 years ago . Fighting style is the same as any other Assassins Creed game. Id give Brotherhood a good 7/10 for Story , 9/10 for Gameplay and 6/10 for Physics. Worth the money and time . Cant wait for Assassins Creed Origins . Even though the previous games didnt have good ratings/reviews. Im still loyal to the Assassins Creed franchise.
