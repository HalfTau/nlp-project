Although the core gameplay of the Assassins Creed franchise remains undoubtedly fun, enjoying ACBrotherhood is made more difficult by an excessive amount of grinding and minutiae.Despite the lively environments, the game desperately cries out for an improved fasttravel system at least half of the game is spent running between the start points of the various missions, which quickly becomes tiresome. The game is further padded out by a heavy reliance on collectibles which rarely offer any benefit even if you do catch them all. The conspiracyladen plot that stretches imagination at times if /everybody/ is involved in the secret conspiracy, how can they claim nobody knows about it?. The graphics were too subdued and could have used a splash more color another victim of the real is brown design school. And a host of bugs and gameplay issues  including a flaky camera, AI scripting problems and a finicky jumping mechanic that far too often had me leaping to my doom rather than at the obvious target right in front of me  did nothing to improve things.On the other hand, the combat system was well done, with excellent and numerous animations, as was the parkour climbing that is the heart of the game. The level design were interesting, if too beige, and the voiceacting was excellent. Brotherhood shows that the Assassins Creed franchise remains enjoyable, even if it is growing a bit long in the tooth.
