Assassins Creed Brotherhood personally its the best assassins creed out there so far, you get to have your own creed to help you or send them on missions, the system to own shops is much better as well, and the story is lovely as well! Graphics are the same, or perhaps slightly better, and the combat system is as well equal as the II. 5/5
