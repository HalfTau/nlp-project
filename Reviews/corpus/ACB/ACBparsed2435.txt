Despite Revelations being the newer title, Brotherhood is what I consider to be the pinnacle of the Assassins Creed game concept. If you like the pairing of thirdperson action with RPG elements and free roam, you can easily sink 50 hours into it if you seek out the side quests! Multiplayer is also quite serviceable, though its probably hard to find a community playing it now  better spent playing with friends.
