After have finishing the game with 100 completion on PS3 many years ago I saw this was on sale and picked it up. I may only have an hour on record as this is being typed. much more to come on PC but on Play station I had somewhere close to 500 hours and I loved every second of this game even after 100 and nothing left to do it is just fun and casual to run around the rooftops of Rome whenever you have nothing else to play. Worth every penny even paying the full 20 for a 6 year old game but I was lucky enough to get it for 66 off and will never regret it. Highly recommended game. Amazing soundtrack, amazing world to explore, amazing story. My only complaint to date for now is a few awkward camera angles in a few scenes that make you think youre jumping one way just to jump to a sharp left and be on the floor again and dragging controls that sometimes dont pick up on some mouse movement but what do you really expect with a 7 year old game. Great game and great memories of it.
