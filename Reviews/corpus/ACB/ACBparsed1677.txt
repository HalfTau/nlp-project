Assassins Creed II was, for all intents and purposes, the game the original wanted to be but fell short of, do to a variety of reasons perhaps most largely its own incredible ambition. With the sequel, Ubisoft managed to monumentally improve virtually every aspect of the series, giving us a tightly wound narrative, a charismatic lead, and refined mechanics that came together for one of the best games of the last few years.Following up this achievement is Brotherhood, arriving barely a year after the first and on the surface seeming little more than a retread of what we already saw, and an easy cash grab before a full fledged sequel can be made. In some ways this is accurate, as Brotherhood in many ways is incredibly similar to its predecessors, but to call it anything less than an entire new experience would be a disservice, as for how short a time it had in the oven its just as large and engrossing as the games that came before it, while also adding an assortment of excellent new mechanics that push the game forward even when it occasionally stumbles in the wake of critical acclaim.Being a direct sequel, Brotherhood picks up mere moments after the end of II, with the surprising arguably convoluted events that transpired still fresh in Ezios mind though it would appear he has finally arrived at a moment of peace after all his struggles. Of course nothing good ever lasts long, and it doesnt take long for his enemies to catch up with him, kill yet more of what little family he has left, and send Italy tumbling into chaos, leaving you to pick up the pieces though for once you arent alone.After the fantastic birth to assassin story of II, Brotherhoods more traditional tail of revenge mixed with some incomprehensible supernatural elements never quite manages to achieve the same level of intrigue and pacing. Though perfectly solid and enough to drive the experience, aside from the first and last few hours it meanders through much of its plot, spiraling off into dozens of disconnected tangents that feel more like side missions than an overarching narrative which left me feeling rather disengaged with everything that was happening. By the end I had lost the investment I previously had in these characters, and simply wanted it all to wrap up in a way that somehow made it all pull together, which again it unfortunately failed to. This isnt to say that Brotherhood isnt entertaining, or that the story is terrible, but it lacked the sense of urgency and tightness that exuded from every moment of II and came off a tad rushed.Thankfully, Brotherhood plays incredibly well, taking everything that worked with II and adding in enough fresh elements and interesting mission types to be just as engaging. The most readily apparent change is that of the scenery, moving away from Venice and into the sprawling city of Rome. Its a far larger environment, that feels more alive than ever thanks in part to the expanded town building system which now encompasses the whole of the city, allowing you to renovate shops and tunnels to provide income, more areas to purchase items, and fast travel across the map. It also makes it easier to feel invested in the city as you see it build up around you with each new renovation. Its a huge world to explore, yet every inch of it is packed with an enormous amount of things to do, leaving little idle space and a never ending stream of missions the vast majority of which are surprisingly fleshed out and enjoyable.As the name implies, Brotherhood no longer sees you fighting alone but instead building up an army of assassins which you can then send on contracts and call in when you need aid. Its a tad underdeveloped in its current state, but it nonetheless greatly changes how you can approach an encounter, as often times calling in assassins which can pop out of anywhere is far less risky than attempting to get close to a target yourself. They also work as convenient distractions, and add a layer to encounters that feels especially needed when the combat is still trapped in a fairly dull design that despite numerous cool kill animations never became very fun and was best avoided whenever possible.Other minor tweaks in takedowns, platforming, and general movement add some noticeable refinement to the series core gameplay, though there are still moments when the camera will freak out or the free running system will send you jumping randomly completely in the wrong direction. Animations in particular continue to stick out to me as incredibly well done, with Ezio in particular moving with as much grace and fluidity as youd expect from an assassin. Lastly Jasper Kyds original score is utterly gorgeous and sets the mode strikingly well at every moment, as if his music is deeply tied into the world and speaking to you as you traverse it.Despite its narrative shortcomings, Assassins Creed Brotherhood is by no means the sloppily churned out annualized rubbish it very well could be, instead a brilliant successor to what I would consider an utter masterpiece, and a remarkably well crafted game on its own measures. If youve yet to touch the series this certainly isnt the place to jump in, but if you were left wanting more after II, Brotherhood will certainly satisfy and then some.
