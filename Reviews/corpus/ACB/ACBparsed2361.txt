Assassins Creed Brotherhood ACB should be considered a worthy expansion of Assassins Creed II, but it serves as a standalone game that continues where AC2 left off. The game continues the narrative saga, but quickly becomes tedious in its constant parkour maneuvers and climbing. However, ACB is the first of the series to offer a multiplayer mode which in itself becomes just as tedious. Still, ACB provides a crucial extension to the AC2s story line that again leaves fan hanging on for more. Essentially, ACB feels like a paid expansion to properly conclude AC2 and begins to really show the repetitive nature of the series.
