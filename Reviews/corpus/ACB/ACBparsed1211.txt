While the Assassins Creed series isnt exactly shining at the time that I write this, this game is, and likely always will be, my favorite Assassins Creed game and one of my favorite games of all time. It has a vast and realistic depiction of Rome, with details so accurate you can find some of the small alleys that really exist there ingame. It has complex characters and a charismatic lead who is questionable but sympathetic. It has side missions that actually engross you. It is essentially everything that AC2 was, but with a little more gameplay variety, and in Rome to boot. I strongly recommend this game.
