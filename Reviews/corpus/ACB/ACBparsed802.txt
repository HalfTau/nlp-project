AC Brotherhood is the 2nd game following the story of Ezio. After attrocities are committed against Ezio and his people, Ezio takes the fight to the Borgias in Rome and this time he wont make the same mistakes. ACB is typical in how the franchise provides a rich historical background of the events during that period of Rome and also provides its usual outstanding landscapes and architecture. ACB is basically a better version of AC2, training your own army of assassins and continuing the rich story. ACB will not disappoint if you liked the last game.9/10
