AC brotherhood was a great game! The story was great. The main Character was awesome, he had just the right amount of charm, seriousness, and humor. The gameplay was fun and it has just the right amound of difficulty to keep it from getting to frustrating. The ingame music was awesome and always made me feel submerged in the action. I absoulutly love the open world of AC brotherhood. There are plenty of weapons and gadgets to choose from. The only thing I disliked was the Keyboard and mouse controls, after playing AC 4 the controls in AC brotherhood kinda get on your nerves after awhile.
