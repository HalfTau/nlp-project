Do not buy this game. They dont mention that you have to have a uPlay account and uPlay as third party software, which Im pretty sure theyre required to mention. Still havent gotten to play it because of stupid fracking uPlay, as even after I got an account, my uPlay just stopped working. Ubisoft are a terrible, persistent company with relatively good games, but no game is worth letting them try to make uPlay a thing.ProsIs otherwise a great game that I played years ago on Xbox.ConsUPLAY UPLAY UPLAY UPLAYDo not buy until they stop doing this kind of crap.
