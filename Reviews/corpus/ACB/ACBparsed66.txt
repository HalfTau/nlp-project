After i had played through this game after years i had beaten Assassins Creed 2,honestly i cant say anything but repetitive and repetitive.Assassins Creed Brotherhood lacks in the mission area, it needs to be more open.In many cases i failed the mission because i stepped over the mission space limit which is very frustrating.Missions are basically the same with little variations, of course there are the flying missions, cannons, tanks etc.but they only come once and you are back in the same tail, climb, dont get caught, maybe kill some guards, assassinate and escape Then you can explore the open world which is repetitive too, buy stores and weapons, invest, climb to tower and get the area unlocked from the mist and collect collectibles.And even in the flying, tank, etc missions i was frustrated because they were riddled with bugs. I couldnt control my flying and i tried fixing it for an hour. Then found out that the problem was because of my GSync monitor, turned the GSync and it worked.One thing i found to be fun is to recruit assassins, put them on contracts, level them up and call them for help.But then i realized that even that is just kinda waste of time. You just do the contracts for the money, then you just buy more stores, more contracts, more stores etc.Maybe buy some new weapons which doesnt feel to impact the game very much.Combat is made very easy because of the counter attack, so thats that. Cool first, but just boring after couple hours.Characters are just plain boring and have not much characteristics, the only character which i found to be funny is Bartolomeo dAlviano. Italian accent makes you skip the cutscenes in the long run.VerdictGraphics 7Soundtrack 8Voiceacting 6Story 6Characters 6Combat 6
