Brotherhood is perhaps my favorite installment in the AC series. An expansive, openworld enviornment allows the player to prance about and complete various tasks in any order they desire without any linear elements. The default controls are a bit strange, but can be easily binded to a custom configuration.A unique quality of this game is the ability to relieve notoriety when being pursuded by enemies. This mechanic is not common in other thirdperson openworld games and proves to be quite useful.All in all, Im not crazy about Brotherhood, but it was definitely worth the buy. I would rate it 8/10.
