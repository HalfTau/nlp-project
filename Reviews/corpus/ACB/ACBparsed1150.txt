Pretty good game overall. There is definetly a ton of things to do in Unity. I havent grinded this hard since got damned skyrim. That 100 is a pain in theto get and hell Im still trying. My only complaint thus far is that not all features of the game are in effect yet which is a little dissapointing. Oh well guess Ill just keep grinding until then. But what kinda irks me is how long it takes to find players for certain coop missions and the fact that the clan or brotherhood system kinda sucks as far as communicating with members, or rarely even being able to invite even the online members so you can complete the club objectives. I wish there was a much better form of communication between club members, otherwise whats the damn point of even having the feature of the game if you cant talk to people. Its like coop with  AI. And lastly there is NO VOIP or even type chat. Really?! again whats the point of even having a multiplayer feature if you cant tell the retard ing up your coop mission to get it together or be able to kick their stupid asses. This game needs a few tweaks and Ubisoft needs to kick in into gear quite a bit for the multplayer and coop features. But as far as singleplayer goes, Unity surpasses the previous games and for that reason I am content. For now.
