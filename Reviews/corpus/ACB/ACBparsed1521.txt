Very much of the same as AC2 but with a lot more of the same plus the brotherhood you get is kind of helpful. Lots of side quests and economy managing.Not that great for keyboard and mouse uses four keys alternating not including the movements and camera on the mouse. There was a lot of fustrating parts where you are climbing when you mean to run.Best mechanic is the companion leveling system.I recommend this game for AC fans. If you already played AC2 this is pretty much the same.
