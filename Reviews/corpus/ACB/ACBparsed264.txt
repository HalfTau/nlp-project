Not much different from AC II. Just some additional outfits, weapons and things like that. The story is not so good, but has its moments. AC Brotherhood looks more like a big DLC from AC II, since the map is so much tinier. The biggest problem, was the gameplay, who decreased a lot by giving Ezio the killing spree ability, that when you kill someone, you just have to press one button to kill other, and another and another. This made the game insanely easy. But i loved how they gave Leonardo more space in the story to appear and make big and importante things to help the brotherhood. The game is good, but its not even close to be as good as AC II or AC I.
