This is the third game in the Assassins Creed series this time you pick Desmonds story where it was left in Assassins Creed II by reliving Ezios memories in Roma. This time you will be in one city carrying out quests all over Roma which is huge, by the way.Great additions/improvements for this game lets start with The combat system was improved, giving you the opportunity to see Ezios fighting abilities giving an improved and rewarding experience, in other words was improved 4 or 5 times compared to the previous games in the series. Fast traveling is included as well, of course its a big city, it will be really annoying to be running and running to travel from point A to point B and even though you can do it, youve the option to save minutes or even hours of travel. Lots and lots of content which will keep you busy the main and side quest have an optional way to complete them in order to have full synchronization if you want to complete the game 100. and such much more dont really want to spoil it for you...Unlike the previous games, this game have a multiplayer mode a really fun and interesting one when you find people to play it, because sometimes you can be waiting around 10 or 15 mins for people to join. I had fun hours playing multiplayer which have several modes were in most of them is not how many people you kill, but the way you get the kills, the more sneaker is the way you do it, the more points you get.In the end, I had a blast playing both single and multiplayer modes!! This is a good installment and recommended by me if you like the Assassins Creed series!...
