A very good game for the series but I wouldnt go out of my way to pay alot of money for it. Its pretty much just an expansion to creed 2. The storyline is meh but the game pay is fantastic! The city of rome is beauiful and there is so many wonderful things that you can do. I just wish the story had been btr and longer. Still, you should play it but dont pay too much for it.
