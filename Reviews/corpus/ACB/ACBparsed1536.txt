Ok! Assassins Creed Brotherhood review!This game is the second of 3 in following the story of Ezio Auditore. Its a few years after AC2, and so theres a few of the same characters and a bunch of new ones. Theres even a few flashback missions that take place in Firenze. I was in it for the story for the most part, so I tried to beat the story missions as in order as possible. The combat is pretty much identical to AC2 but with much cleaner mechanics. I didnt play around with the weapons much and mostly just stuck with the hidden blades. The combos are always satisfying when they connect especially when landing an execution chain on multiple enemies.As usual, the voice acting and dialogue is excellent as AC goes . The cutscenes and scenery in general is awesome, with great attentions to detail in reconstructing the textures and landscapes. It really feels like being in the renaissance! The maps were very detailed and well put together so you rarely take the same paths twice, if ever. The ability to call and ride horses instantly everywhere makes getting around on roads and sidewalks a breeze no matter how many npcs are walking around.Theres still a lot of repetition in mission events, go here, go there, stab someone, run away, hide etc. That aside, its definitely a game series worth playing and Im gonna get on AC Revelations tonight!Assassins Creed Brotherhood Prof Points 8.2741
