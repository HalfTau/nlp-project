Continuing the saga of roofrunning stabby goodness we have ACBrotherhood.The game continues to grow in interesting ways with much more diversity in how you deal with missions courtesy of your new group of minime assassins able to do your job for you. Got a guy on the rooftops in your path and no time to sneak up on him? Let your peeps handle it. Need a distraction? No problem, theyre good. Need every guard in sight to take a nap? Theyve got you covered.Again Ubisoft manages to expand the mission options and gameplay filling another game chock full of interesting characters and new gameplay. Its not just another expansion, it truly is a continuation and evolution of the series.The now mandatory multiplayer is also quite intriguing but lets face it, thats not what you buy an AC game for, thats just a bonus.
