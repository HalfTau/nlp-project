This is the sequel of AC2. It really ties up Ezios story. Now our world is set in Rome, and what a feat to our eyes it is. 1500s Rome is depicted to every detail and you can spend ours just admiring it and exploring it. The main story is not that large, but this time you got a cornucopia of side missions wich are very important to understand the plot.there are3 major glitches in the game that happened to me due to me playing on 1440p  144hz with Gsync. The first is flying Davincis Flying machine wich did not steer, the second is before attacking Cesar Borgia the checkpoint didnt trigger, and the last one is before you get the aple at the end also not triggering the checkpoint. After researching i found that setting the resolution to 1080p plus enabling VSync solves the problem, then after those checkpoints and/or mission triggers or is done you just put your sets as they were.All in all an amazing game, a really follow up to Ezios saga and the graphics are still stunning. Time to go to AC Revelations roadtoorigins
