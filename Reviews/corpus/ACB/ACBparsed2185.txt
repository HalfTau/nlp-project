Graphics are much improved, seems like the antialasing and textures really stands out, the AI also seem smarter and more aggressive. Also, most missions take place in the same city its huge though compared to previous AC where you would travel between cities. The story begins where ACII ended and it gets better, another mind blowing ending, Im officially hooked into the AC series.
