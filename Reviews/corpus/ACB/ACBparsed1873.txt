Its pretty good, the gameplay is fun as hell. Even if youre used to it on a console like I was and are just coming back to it because you enjoyed it the first time, the controls are really quite easy to pick up with the parkour element being a simple combination of the left mouse button and the space bar. I mean come on.Also, the multiplayer, a few words, if you wanna actually find a game, dont try and play at like 5 in the morning or something, because, it probably wont work, if you wind up in a 1/6 lobby, leave and try again, if the lobby you end up in has more than 2 players waiting, stay there. The multiplayer is very much NOT dead and still has one of the nicest multiplayer gameplay experiences I have ever played.
