Why the hell Im writing review backwards... Oh whatever...ACBro, as the title dictates, its about the Creed Brotherhood and its restoration after the collapse.As always, new series in AC is a level up in terms of gameplay sidequest and many more.For the story, in Ancestor it tells about the village that have been reduced to Ash, and there isnt any choice for Ezio to do so he travel to Rome to pursuit his archenemy and while at that try to revive the brotherhood.Many arsenal of weapon that can be built by Leonardo Davinci will help you in the way to assassinate enemy. The battle become more fluctuative too so it will not be as easy as the previous game.In terms of all aspect, I think ACBro is the best AC that have been made, the story is still makes sense and the gameplay is not over excessive.Definitely a must play game!!
