AC B...What can I say?Its the second chapter in the Eziotrilogy. Moving around the Rome is actually pretty fun, and if you feel like learning something, the Animus Database has some interesting facts and knowledge of history.The new Assassin Recruiting mechanic was really fun, and it helps in some situations a lot.The game itself plays just like AC2, but the plot isnt actually as compelling, although still pretty good.The end of the game was hectic as  and I loved it the most in the game.Theres not enough Da Vinci, though. Thats a minus, but otherwise the game was very fun!
