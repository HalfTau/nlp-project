Great continuation of the series.Like any other AC game, some of the missions can get boring, and a bit of the same over and over.But the story, voice acting and nonlinear pacing helps for any play style.The ending is a real cliff hanger but really sets you up for the other installment, and continues the tradition of a great storyline.If youre into the AC story, this part is necessary.
