Imagine the last Assassins Creed game, then add in a buttload of collectables. Thats what this game is. Its just like Halo though, to be honest, I dont like that entire series all over again. They release the EXACT same game without changing ANYTHING or adding in ANYTHING creative and expect you to pay 60 at or even before release.
