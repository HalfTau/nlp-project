It is like spiderman but with masons,romans  and assassinsStory is decent except copernico side missions and da vinci side missions were really interesting but in the end I felt like nothing much was accomplished except getting new weaponsCharacters are rememberable unlike new AC crap they release every yearGraphics are still pretty goodYou can go yolo with your army of mercenaries or assassins and kill every borgia guard without stealth in some missions which is funIdea of pimping your city is nice It gives you good amount of cash, investing in shops might make you really rich If the risk factor is high Controls might give you cancer at timesSome episodes requires playing through 30 times to succeed like the early cannon mission but there are more examples like that Tailing missions are painful  and there are a lot of themEdit ending is disgusting and the  devs are jew,mason lovers as expected
