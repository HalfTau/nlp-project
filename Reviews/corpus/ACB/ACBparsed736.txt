While difficult to judge today, but in my opinion, Assassins Creed Brotherhood is the best AC game of all for both nostagic and gameplay wise.For starters, this is a direct sequel to AC2, another worthy title. So if you like Ezio and Italy, then youll love playing as a mature version of his in rome, fighting the Boria and the pope, who is a templar grande master. It also has a great story, lots of side mission and some dlc as well as great characters, who all make an appears. Even Desmond gets in the spotlight.Brotherhood gives two major aspect to the series, multiplayers and an assassin recuitement system that really works. This makes the very revolutionary that would change the franshies forever.
