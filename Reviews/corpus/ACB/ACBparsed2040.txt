// This game is just wounderfull, everything is good with it. Buy it now! // 31st of December 13I have decided to remake this review since, originally, I just wrote it because I saw a negative review of this game. So here goes!Assassins Creed Brotherhood takes place just where the second game ends, making it a direct sequel. In this game you still relive the memories of your ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. In the real world however, things change a bit. Desmond and the crew have moved the entire operation to Monteriggioni, the town that Ezios family had earlier lived in. This means that you can, at any given time, exit out of the Animus and wander around in the real world. This is a nice edition, but is sadly not that well made as there are little to none things to do.The gameplay of this installment has been improved from the previous games. The fighting is well made and you will feel a sense of progression as enemies will be easier to defeat as your skill goes up. Also combos have been introduced, making fighting 2 enemies will not feel as rubish anymore.But fighting is only have the game, of cource the climbing has been improved. This is not as noticable though, as it was good in the older games aswell.This game features alot of quests, aside from the main storyline, that are well fitted into the story and helps you get a better understanding on how Ezio was as a person. The most well made once were the once featuring no one else that your friend, Leonardo da Vinci. He is back with long, well made mission for you to complete. But not only that, he also sells you items that will spice up the gameplay, giving you tons of new options on how to do thing.Generaly speaking this game is a masterpiece in the Assassins Creed series. The story is great, you will come to care about the characters, the gameplay mechanics are improved, still same stunning visuals as the last game. Basically a worthy sequel that was not made to cash in on the Assassins Creed name.
