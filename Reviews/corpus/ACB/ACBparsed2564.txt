One of the best games game series Ive ever played. And since HalfLife and Max Payne are quite inactive at the moment, Im willing to pay Ubisoft almost anything for the Collectors edition of every new release from the AC series. Yes, its THAT good.I wont spend precious time writing information you already read in million reviews, Ill put it simply  go buy it. Now. You wont regret it.Oh, and one more thing  if you havent played the first two parts before, you should at least the second one which is equally outstanding and read the plot of the first one somewhere.
