This game fixed the crappy lockon from AC2. When you lock on an NPC, or PC in multiplayer, it actually LOCKS. This was the only gripe I had with AC2s gameplay and its been remedied.You might have noticed that Ive logged almost 500 hours in this game. The continuing story is great but it doesnt have THAT much replay value. No, that time was mostly spent in Wanted mode multiplayer MP. And what a multiplayer it was/is. Ive never played anything like it. This games MP changed my view on something. I once read a review of Mass Effect 3 in which the writer stated that he loved ME3 multiplayer but didnt care about the story at all. I was somehow annoyed by this. Even if you hated the ending I didnt how can you play a Mass Effect game at all without caring about the story?! That games world building was on an epic scale! But then I started playing ACBs MP. And I understood. I actually started because I saw my brother playing Wanted mode and I thought it looked cool. I was still on AC2 storyline at the time so I skipped Story Mode at first and went straight to MP. I logged a cool hundred hours of that before completing AC2 and moving into ACB. I played one hundred hours of this games MP before even touching its single player story.Anyway, the MP player base is still active to this day but you wont find me there. A Ubisoft bug wiped my XP progress and skill unlocks on my MP profile one day so Id have to start from the bottom. This doesnt appeal to me one bit. Silver lining though, this gave me the impetus to uninstall this game and move on to the rest of my library.TLDR If you get a chance, try to play some MP Wanted mode. Theres nothing else like it out there. I like it more than Revelations Wanted mode, for that matter. Honorable Death? Pshaw.
