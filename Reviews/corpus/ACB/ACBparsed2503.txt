Assassins Creed Brotherhood is the sequel of Assassins Creed II.Best way to describe it is to simply say that this game is even more interesting and awesome from the previous one.The story continues with the same main character from Assassins Creed II.This time everything is placed around the Rome of 1500 with a complete design of how all city designes used to be.The games storyline is as interesting as ever, with more great surprises and revealed infrmation.Very well designed graphics with details and great animations.A lot more RPG elements and a great quantity of extra features and new weapons.Just like Assassins Creed II,you will not get bored of the game.Either by choosing to follow only the main quests or by going freeroam or by doing some of teh many sidequests you can just choose whatever you like.The game is really awesome!Found some bugs but this was a minor to what i experienced by playing this.Cant wait for Assassins Creed Revelations.Recommended!
