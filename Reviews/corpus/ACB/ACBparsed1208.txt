It isnt Assassins Creed Brotherhood, its more Assassins Creed 2, and that is not a bad thing. The main problem is that the story is perhaps not as enthralling as its predecessor, but if youve played through Assassins Creed 2, the entire situation is given a little more context. If you found some annoying problems with the movement or combat in Assassins Creed 2, they will probably still be present, so be warned. The resource management minigame is an interesting distraction, and there is some satisfaction to be had in seeing your hired assassins become more skillful.
