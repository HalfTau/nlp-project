If youve played Assassins Creed 1 or 2, youll feel at home in Brotherhood. This game feels more like an expansion pack to Assassins Creed 2 than an entire new game though. Theres reused character models and animations galore. And unlike an expansion, you start back at ground zero with all your equipment burning so you have to reearn it.Similarities aside, Rome is a cool city, and calling in fellow assassins to help fight is when the game gets good. Dont bother trying to fully grasp the storyline, just know that the bad guys are taking over and its up to you and your merry band of Assassins to stop them.I grabbed it on a steam sale for 4.99 and it was worth it for the gameplay and overarcing Assassins Creed storyline.Pros Merry band of assassins makes bigger fights easy. Owning shops and landmarks makes moneymaking simple. Stab everything, youre an assassin.Cons Muddled story  the Borgias are a generic evil family and Ezio has a lot of opportunities to kill members of the family and doesnt do it. I feel like owning a shop or landmark should make me even more money. Aside from the merry band of assassins, there isnt much new in the game.Just Weird Horses galloping through crowds dont kill people. At the start of the game you lose your equipment and the game has you rebuying it. But you also lose your ability to jump when climbing....because you lost it? Because I know Ezio learned how to do it in Assassins Creed 2, but you have to relearn it in Assassins Creed Brotherhood.
