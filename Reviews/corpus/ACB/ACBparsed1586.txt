Brotherhood starts off immediately where the previous game left off. When I say this, I really mean you start in the exact spot, wearing the same gear you were at the end of the previous game. The story picks up right away and continues to entice.This game, while different in various ways, keeps the same essence of the last game. You explore Roma during the Borgia reign of the early 16th century. This allows for, like all the games, some splendid views and the ability to truly appreiciate the thought and effort put into the design of the city and surrounding areas plus the attention to detail that I have come to enjoy and appreiciate.There is a lot to do in this game. The added Economics allows for lots of money to be made and spent in Roma. This just builds on the ability in the previous game to earn and spend money and puts that to work on a grander scale.The added abilities, weapons, and use of the syncing percentage really shine in this game. I found myself using the crossbow alot more than I thought I would and not just out of neccesity but actual enjoyment. Leveling up you own assassins within your guild and using them in various ways allowed for more interesting encounters with enemies and missions. Having missions have an optional objectives/constraints to get a sync percentage made had me retrying missions all the time to achieve that percentage. It made the replay value, for even the first time through, appealing and challenging.Overall, if you like the series and played the games up until this point, continue to do so. You wont be disappointed.
