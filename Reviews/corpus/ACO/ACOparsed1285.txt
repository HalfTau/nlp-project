Lots of minor changes to the core mechanics of this creed game, to where it doesnt really even feel like creed. The melee combat system is so chowdered I didnt use parry or counter once through the entire game after the tutorial. There are also tons of modern day influences like women can do anything men can do which is fine, but gets ridiculous after a bit. At one point, the main character, essentially viewed as a peasant/subhuman by the romans gives a DIRECT COMMAND to the EMPEROR OF ROME, and the EMPEROR OF ROME is just like yeah for sure! hahalolexdee.Assassins Creed used to push the boundaries of what was acceptable in videogames, but this just feels like a thinly veiled attempt at somehow politicizing videogames. Dont forget that on release the antipiracy assets they had in the game were actually TOPPING off peoples processors because they were so poorly optimized. I wish I had eight hands so I could give this game 14 thumbs down.
