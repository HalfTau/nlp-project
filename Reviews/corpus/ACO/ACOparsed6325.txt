This is going to be a mediocre review of the game from just 3 hours of gameplay.PERFORMANCE I found the game ran decently. I run a 1060 6gb and Im pulling a stable 30 fps. I can get as high as 60, but populated areas like towns and cities drop it to 3040. So I capped my fps at 30. This is most likely because my CPU isnt up to par with the recommended requirements.Sadly, changing the graphical settings does very little for the game. The little extra fps you get from making the game look like crap isnt worth the trade off at least on a medium rig like mine. It probably has more impact the worse your computer rig is.COMBAT One of the aspects I was most worried about was the combat. From the early gameplay it looked very clunky and looked like a combination of witcher 3 and dark souls combat which isnt a bad thing by any means. While the combat isnt smooth as butter it is actually fun and fairly responsive.CONTROLS The controls this time around a lot different, but I found that once you get use the new layout the controls are actually pretty smooth. ALT being the new button to parkour makes this feel a 1000 times better than earlier entries as now you dont climb onto things you dont want.STORY Cant say much since Im only 3 hours into the game, but I do like the new protagonist this time around.CONCLUSION Im actually surprised and glad that this game came out as well as it did. If youre a fan of Witcher 3s RPG elements and large open world this game might actually get you to enjoy an AC game. The controls are nicely done, combat feels fluid, a more mature, and possibly more likeable main protagonist, and the large open world and new RPG elements fit nicely into the game. I cant say much on the story itself as of yet.Also, I havent run into any glitches or CTDs as of yet.Ill probably update this as I progress further into the game, but so far Im enjoying the ride.
