If you buy this, be prepared. The first hour or so is slow. After that, you have to deal with a new stealth system, that is really hard to adjust to compared to past assassins creeds. No mini map makes it even harder. What you do get is a slow starting game with a decent story, and gameplay with many approaches and rewarding but challanging goals.
