One more masterpiece about Assassins.Still my favorite is Black Flag,but this game also nice,its different.Story is good,nice graphics,many side missions,different weapons,mounts,attires,big open world to explore and many other intersting things.Game was made thoroughly and properly.The only thingfights are sometimes tricky against some enemies,especially if you fight against higher level enemy it is almost impossible to win,so I recommend to finish as much side missions as you can before going to final stages of main storyline.I bought Deluxe version and got legendary weapon,mount and armor from the game start,but even if u buy standart version you will be able to get legendary items throughout the game by doing sidemissions.Game looks very good,with beautiful views and interesting history facts from Ancient Egypt.Definitely worth its price.Highly recommended.
