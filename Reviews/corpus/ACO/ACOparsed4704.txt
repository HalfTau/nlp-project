I have a 4k monitor, an AMD 8350, and a GTX 1080 superclocked.Welcome to 25FPS the Game.tried resolution both at 4k and 1920x1080 1080p and the frame rate literally stayed the same.Apparently this is a result of the Denuvo antipirating software?Once Ubisoft fixes this issue ill change my recommendation, but for now its just disappointing.
