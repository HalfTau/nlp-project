First, I 100 recommend you get this game. My 2nd personal favorite in the Assassins Creed series, and just all around a good game. The characters are relatable, sensible, and take a life of their own in the story. Specifically, Bayek is one of the strongest main characters to come out of this series.The story is great, if cliche at times. Plenty of side stories to experience too, if youre the kind of player to get caught up in that. I thought the story was over, and then after 64 hours, found there was still main quest content.Gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. Some people dislike this form of combat, but I find it a refreshing change from the spam Y to parry. In previous Assassin Creed games, you eventually find that low level enemies have become a joke no matter how many come your way. In this one, you have to have some skill to handle combat appropriately I was playing on hard mode so maybe that was contributing to it as well.Finally, the single dark spot in this game, being produced by Ubisoft. Performance has been a big issue for this game, and was recently pseudofixed for NVIDIA users. Hopefully the days of 94 usage of CPU are over.All in all, great game, tons of content, you just need a higher end PC for it.My specsGTX 980 4GBIntel I7 670016 GB of RAMRan it on very high with 50 FPS
