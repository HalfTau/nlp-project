So far Assassins Creed has moved around the periods of time and cultures, and this migration of time is something completely out of the blue, but expected.If to rate this AC, I would have to give it 7.5/10. The reason for that being  The cutscenes have not changed, this makes it seem like AC has become the new CoD. The combat so far seems okay, but the locking onto enemy mechanic is a bit sketchy, and poorly coded. The graphics, especially of such scenery and wildlife, are amazing. Some things may look like they are covered in glitter and just sparkle  like the hundreds of scorpions that you see in every cutscene . Story of course is amazing, even at the beginning.If to be fair, this is what Assassins Creed should have been after 1 and 2. Maybe this will save Ubisofts reputation, IF they actually dont ef it up... again, but thats a Yes from me, for the time being.
