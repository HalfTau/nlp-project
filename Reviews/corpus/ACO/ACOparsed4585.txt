The desert looks nice, but I already played this too many times.Another Assassins Creed moneymaker with new decarations, but the same storyline and game mechanics. If you find Far Cry 4 somehow different from Far Cry 3 except for being in Tibet, you are likely to enjoy Assassins Creed Origins too. If your are hoping that the series is going back to its origins AC, AC 2, AC Brotherhood bringing something new and exciting, the game does not worth your time.p.s. This is my first review on Steam, but the game had just too many undeserved positive reviewes.
