Great game. I played AC1, Black Flag and now Origins. This one is my favourite by far. Beautiful world, responsive controls and a big map.The only thing missing is a new game plus feature. After opening the whole map and completing the story theres not much one can do. Sure there are trials of the gods, but they are a cake walk. Clearing the entire map took around 95 hours. Witcher 3 took 125 hours.A little side note about the map. Sure its huge, but there are a lot of empty zones. And some with only one or two objectives.Ow yeah, since this is PC you better have a good CPU. This game is very demanding up to 70 cpu usage. No SLI support at the moment.My specsi7 5960xASUS 980 STRIX 2way SLI1440pVery High preset with resolution scaled down to 70 I get stable 60fps. Turning off SLI gave me a small boost, around 5fps.
