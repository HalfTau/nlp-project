When I first heard about assassins creed origins, I was confused I seen the trailer and thought to myself how good looking the game was but I was also disappointed that they changed the combat system we grew to love, I bought the game a couple days after its release, I told myself I would give it a go for 2 hours and if I didnt like it I would refund it. Now that I have had over 20 hours in the game my previous thoughts before purchasing this game have changed dramatically, this game is everything you could have possibly asked for, the combat system is great it feels smooth and is similar to other games I have played like The witcher 3 and For Honour. The story is also pretty good its nothing to get super excited for but it does a great job of keeping the player engaged and having fun constantly, matter of fact the side missions are even solid and actually feel new and refreshing unlike other gamesThe characters are original and so are the bosses, they all play out unique which keeps you engaged and constantly giving you enjoyment. so far I believe Im 2/3 into the game and it has already exceeded my expectations. The RPG element is great it reminds me of The Witcher 3 meets Far Cry meets Destiny, it really is that good, the game is definitely worth full buying price. Lastly people where complaining about the game using most of your CPU which wasnt really a issue for me as my graphics card GTX 1060 and my CPU i7 6700 are on par with each other which gives me a better experience, I played around with settings and figured out it was best to put the game on Dynamic Resolution at 60FPS this allowed me to constantly have a smooth experience throughout my play time and the game never frame rate dropped. That is all, definitely the best assassins creed out of all of them, FOR SURE!
