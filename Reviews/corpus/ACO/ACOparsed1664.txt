Right away, i have to comment on how beautiful this game is the wildlife, the colors, the people in this game all look fanstastic. That being said, if you were a fan of the old, take on everybody with my fists fighting style, get ready to be displeased with the new good luck taking on more than 3 men while archers are hiding from a distance shooting at you style. There is no, use as human shield option, or counter attack for fighting 5 or 6 people at once. You have a shield, and youd better get good with it. Im glad ubi tried to mix things up with this installment, but the fighting style just doesnt fit, and thats my favorite part of the old assassins creed.There are also bugs that completly hinder combat and seem to come out of nowhere, i give a 3.55. Going back to Black Flag.
