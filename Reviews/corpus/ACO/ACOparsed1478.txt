Spent an hour trying to get playable frames, no luck. CPU at 100 usage all the time with this game and no matter if i played at the lowest settings the fps was still garbage. The game looks really good but the optimization is terrible. Dont buy it unless you have a 10k PC.i5 7600k  4.2Ghz, 16 gb DDR4  3200Mhz RAM, GTX 960 4GB
