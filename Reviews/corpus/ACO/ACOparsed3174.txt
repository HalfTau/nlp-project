Assassins Creed Origins manages to live up to the expectation that the preview event gave me. I dubbed it near perfect after that event, and the final product does not disappoint. A few pacing issues late in the story caused things to drag a little bit, and the loot system doesnt remain intriguing after the first few hours, but finding a complaint beyond that is difficult. You can nitpick some of the graphical hiccups or complain about repetitive side quests, but even those manage to stay fun and interesting with all of the different styles of play. On a day with two other heavy hitting AAA games and an amazing TV show releasing simultaneously, your time and money are going to be precious commodities. With Game of the Year talks coming up, Assassins Creed Origins is a serious contender for the title in my book.
