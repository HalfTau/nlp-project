Best one since Black Flag!  This game is not without its flaws, it crashes to desktop randomly, but for the most part runs smooth.  Combat is actually fun and I will go out of my way for it instead of avoid it like I did in previous Assassins games.  I put a reshade on it which modifies some of the sharpness and adds a fake HDR effect which makes the game look near photo real in most areas.  Would recommend it to anyone, but if you can hold out for a month or two, that would always be the best option with these big open world games.
