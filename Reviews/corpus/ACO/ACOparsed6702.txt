Just sticks on splash screen, wont even go into the game. You know, the least I expect when I preorder a game for 99 is to have a functioning product on release day. Creative Assembly and even EA seem to get it right, but without fail there is always a major issue with Ubisoft products. I can accept a few bugs and glitches, but not failing to work on a system that blows the recommended specs out of the water and violates them. Ubisoft is like a drug addict sibling, you expect theyve turned things around only to end up disappointed again.
