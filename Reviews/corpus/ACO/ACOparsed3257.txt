Im not gonna lie. I was expecting the game to be a 50/50 because its ubisoft but when I heard it takes place in Egypt it caught my attention due to Im fascinated in egyption mythology and this game looks different. So I decided to buy it and I was like.....wow! The visuals in the game are amazing. It lives up to its name and hype.
