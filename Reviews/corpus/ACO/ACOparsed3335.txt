I have to admit, this time Ubisoft got it right. For the first time, I actually enjoyed everything about an Assassins Creed game for a long time. And I found myself doing side quests more often than trying to complete the story. The world is huge and full of detail too, which makes it look amazing. Theres a few bugs, but nothing I cant just ignore and keep playing.
