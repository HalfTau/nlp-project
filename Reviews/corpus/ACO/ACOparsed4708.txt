Honestly confused at the negative reviews railing about low frame rates, crashes and bugs. I have experienced none of those problems. I remain at a constant 60 FPS or higher on maxed out settings, it has never crashed on me, and Ive experienced no glitches. Ive also not seen my processors be overly taxed and I have the usual number of things running in the background while Im playing. I do have a laptop with a 1070 and a SSD, so maybe some people just dont have a good enough rig for the game or they just have bad luck.As for the game itself, I think its amazing. The design is absolutely gorgeous, huge open world that is a thrill to explore. The missions have so far been compelling with characters that are well fleshed out and interesting. The story is solid, the dialogue is as good as Id expect, and I am finding this game to be very addictive. The combat mechanics are a huge upgrade. One major complaint I have had with past AC titles is how repetitive and simplistic the combat controls were with the same combo over and over requiring very little effort. The combat mechanics here are more open, fluid, challenging. My favorite big add is the RPG elements that really up the addictive factor. I am a sucker for RPG character development, so it is to be expected, but this one is very well done.I havent played a great deal yet, but I love this game. Easily towards the top of my list from this year and recent years overall. If you like action RPG, and I guess have a good computer, definitely pick this one up. Highly recommend it.
