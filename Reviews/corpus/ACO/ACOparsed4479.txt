I dont know where to start. I usually dont review games, but here I felt like I had to. The long story short, dont purchase it. I would like to say that I am Asssassins Creed biggest fan in miles around. I have the whole line either on steam, or in Ubisoft app. And play constantly. So knowing that Origins was coming out, I was so hyped, i made backflips. Now...I have Intel core i77700 4.2 GHz GeForce GTX 1070 with 32 GB RAM. And the game...wont start. What kind of magic is that? I tried everything under the sun to make it start, played for an hour, crashed, and never seen the loading logo again. I have watter cooling and quite good one too. So untill Ubisoft patches the game for us, plebs, who dont have 15K computers, dont get it. I mean I already sold my car to get my PC, I cant sell my house too....can i?
