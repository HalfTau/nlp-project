Completely worth the 49.99 price. The graphics are amazing. The gameplay is amazing. The climbing system is amazing. The story is amazing. This feeling is amazing. This game is amazing. There might have been some clipping issues on the odd occasions, but a game this ambitious cant be expected to not have a few flaws. If I had a concern, it would be that playing this game was so exciting that I had to take breaks from playing it to calm down.
