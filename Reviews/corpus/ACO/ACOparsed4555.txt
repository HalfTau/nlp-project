I want to start off by saying I rarely write reviews because generally Im satisfied with the games I have and how they run but I just wasted 60 on a game that runs like crap.I saw all the reviews that said not to buy it because it doesnt run on their PC and that it crashes. It never crashed for me however it the graphics looked like crap, my computer did stutter with this game, and I couldnt stand playing through another second of the game when I expected something totally different.This game feels like a rip off, Ubisoft put so much antipiracy crap into it that it takes a huge tole on the computer.Every other game runs on my PC with ultra high graphics and without problems and no stutters and extraordinarly high frame rates. the only way I was able to get to 60fps on this game was by turning my setting way down. Not only that but I have far above the recommended settings so this once again feels like being ripped off by ubisoft. I hope they fix this problem in the future and if they do then I will change my review and my view on Ubisoft but I probably wont play another game with their logo on it for a while out of shear frustration and fear of not getting what I paid for.Id like to see this problem fixed because I dont feel like this is what ubisoft intended and I have really liked ubisoft in the past but I guess well see.To anyone thinking of buying this game, Id suggest waiting until you see reviews saying that this problem has been fixed rather than just assuming youll be different the way I did. I wish I would have spent my money on shadow of war or wolfenstein instead.
