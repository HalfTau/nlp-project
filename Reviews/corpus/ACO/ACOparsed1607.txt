good game, decent story but interesting, the open world is huge and egypt is so ing beautiful... the rpg kind of style is good as well  because its not fully rpg game like witcher or dark souls  gameplay good and the free events every week and so, and items that ubisoft gives r good as well  kinda... why? well keep reading and ull see..AND NOW THE BUT SECTIONthere r some outfits for bayek, outfits for the mount and some weapons that u have to buy heelix or something like that uplay coins, with real money in order to get them and THAT SUCKS... i mean, WE PAY FULL PRIZE MAIN GAME and we cant get all the outfits, except by GIVING MORE MONEY TO UBISOFT... BECAUSE THEY CANT COME OUT WITH SOME GOOD IDEAS, THROUGH EVENTS ETC TO MAKE THESE ITEMS ACCEPTABLE FOR EVERYONE, AND KEEP US PLAYING THE GAME FOR SOME REASON AFTER WE FINISH IT, AND FOR MANY HOURS!!! UBISOFT SAID NO  THAT, IF U WANT THE RARE ONES, U NEED TO PAY 510 EUROS FOR 2 ITEMS OR 20 EUROS FOR 4 ITEMS JUST FOR LOOKING AT THEM IN THE GAME, AND THATS IT, BUT DONT WORRY WE WILL GIVE 12  AS A GIFT THROUGH SOME EVENTS  WITCH R 3 BOSS FIGHTS EASIER THAN THE PINWHELL FROM DS1 EVEN ON HARD MODE...! i havent buy season pass yet until all the dlcs out, even the deluxe edition sucks, pure garbage that pack... ONLY 1 cool but meeh  ill not spoil mision, 1 mount 1 outfit i thing 1 or 2 wepons and a shield, but for 10 euros doesnt worth it...well, the game after all is still good, got the platinum as well because why not? P i dont know if it worth to pay for it full prize like 60 or 50 euros but the game gave me almost 100 almost hours in only 1 run without any extra dlc, but as i said, u cant get the all the rare items except u pay extra so... the decision is yours...about perfformance it runs good even on a i3 core but with a good graphic card... for example i tested ac unity and origins on both i3 cors the lowest i could find and ac unity was unplayble even on low settings, but origins was giving 30 fps on midium settings and smouth gameplay with some rare frame drops...p.s. i know i speak potato english, tried my best to write this review...
