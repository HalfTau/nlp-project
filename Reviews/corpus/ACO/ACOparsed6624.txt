Great game! Really immersive and engaging. Runs really well! Im beginning to like Bayek very much! And that is only in the first 2ish hours Ive played so far!This is a brief review, will update/change as I play the game further!Make sure to verify files the first time before you play, just in case.Also, if you want to go in spoiler free, beware of YouTube, at least right now. Those Templar Youtubers are spoiling everything left and right!And remember We work in the dark to not spoil Origins for the players, we are Assassins!EDIT Well, time for an update! The game is still great, I think my 66 hours of playtime account very well for that. Thats 66 hours in a week and a couple of days since its release.NO SPOILERS  The ending is a bit fastpaced, but thats ok. This game is my favorite Assassins Creed game of all time and is both a great entry point for beginners and a great game for fans of the series to add to their collection! If your computer can run it, then go ahead  take a Leap of Faith!P.S. Bayek is the best character since Ezio, Edward, and Shay...if not the best. For me hes the best protagonist in the entire franchise. Second is Ezio.P.P.S. Immerse yourself in the jawdropping world of Egypt. Its a welldeveloped world and feels much better than the previous games Paris and London.Enjoy!
