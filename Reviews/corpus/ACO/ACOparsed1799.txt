At first, i was impressed by the beautiful egyptian cities and nature in 4K with GsyncAfter 20hours i liked the game, but the characters are a bit lame, the story lacks humour and emotion, they took lots of things from Witcher but forgot some.After 40hours the missions are so repetitive and stupid, like rescuing the 10.th guy from a castle, carry him out, then suddenly he can walk and doing this all for the 10.th time...Also the girlfriend in the game sucks, i much prefer the two from Witcher Also most women in the game look really ugly. Never a pleasure to look at them.The things people on the street say are very limited, after the 10.th time in the 10.th city, it feels really stupid hearing the same 3 sentences all the time in all cities.The story never gets along, its always kill this guy, then that guy, never comes a feeling of satisfaction and achievement or at least fun!I prefer Assasins Creed Black Flag.
