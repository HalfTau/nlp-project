I have an i7 4770K from 2012 and the game runs at a solid 60fps for me with no performance issues.Obviously the game was just released and requires optimization. Optimization is a difficult process. But dont review a game poorly because your random assortment of parts is running it slightly worse than others at launch.This is why I dont read steam reviews anymore. Seems like the majority of the people hate games either for very stupid reasons or because their rigs either a dont meet even minimum requirements or b they ignore developers saying theyll be putting out regular patches as they figure out what is causing performance issues.Now, for the actual review of the game I have played every Assassins Creed game so far. Yes, including spinoffs.Origins is the first time since Assassins Creed II that I felt genuine wonder and excitement while playing the game. They have effectively completely revamped gameplay and added so much content compared to other releases in the series that its almost ridiculous.The only criticism I have is that the modern day is too short. I love the laptop in the modern day with the information that updates regularly while playing, but I feel they could have done much more beyond that. Spoilers, but as it stands it seems like Alexandrias modern day section which is mentioned at the end of the modern day will be accessible in either the upcoming expansions or the sequel. This may have been because of deadlines or it may have been an intentional decision, but it makes the modern day feel complete. That being said, Im quite interested in seeing where the story with William and Layla ends up going.Im also wondering if Sofia Rikkin will show up in the games played by her actress from the movie.
