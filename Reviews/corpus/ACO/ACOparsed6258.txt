Ive been suffering for about 34 hours now with what I think is a health bug my health does not refill beyond the 1st bar as Im playing on hard while it doesnt add much of a challenge health is still pretty important I think that goes without saying apart from this bug what I think is a bug because if its not supposed to refill then someone slap that game designer who decided that the game has been pretty fun actually its new combat system is a nice touch compared to the old smack one button and defeat a 100 hundred people without ever getting touched and the world seems massive shame I cant explore a lot of it straight away because of the level recomended areas, enemies wreck face when you go in underleveled obviously. Honestly went in to the game not expecting much but have been pleaently suprised defo worth a pick up if youre looking for a new RPG to play.
