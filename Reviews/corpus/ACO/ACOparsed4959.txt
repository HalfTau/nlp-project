wow! What are these pips complaining about? Ive seen too many nagative reviews with their corresponding PC Specs that have troubles running this game. why?I have a 5 year old PC, well, the gpu is a bit new its rx470 and I am running this game so smooth on max setting. And you complain with your 7th gen cpu plus 1080? dang! Give me your PC and I will fix it for you! lolMe Specsi7 3770k  RX470 4g  G.Skill 16g  OS Win 8.1
