A huge number of revamped game systems really set this game apart from the olderCreed games, but the world is the real star of the game and the eagle. Egypt feels alive, well designed and meticulously researched. For a series that has always done cities well, this game is a cut above. If youre on the fence, but worried that it will just be more of the same, buy it. It has enough new things to be fresh, and feels closer to something like The Witcher than to the soulless open world collectem ups thatCreed games were becoming on their yearly release conveyorbelt.
