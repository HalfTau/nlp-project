Played it for 5 hours so far on PC.System SpecsIntel Core i7 7700k Water cooled16Gb RAMGTX 1080ti Dual SLIGame installed in SSD.Here are my notes on the gamePerforms great No fps drops, although I have a very powerful systemWorld is COLOSSAL! Lots of empty desert though, but with some really cool paranormal features  Graphical options are good and plenty, with even a menu to check CPU and GPU usage which is impressiveAnimations look decent. Not as good as the previous 3 gamesNot a big fan of the combat, but its definitely not as bad as it looked on YoutubeOccasional texture popin in distant mountainsNot the hippo ridden world Youtube made it out to be. You will very rarely be attacked by predators unless you are actively seeking them. In 5 hours I only had to kill 1 Crocodile, and that was part of a side questIve seen better textures, but you rarely look at them close enough to notice their quality. Artistic style as a whole is very pleasing to look at. Only complain is the orange sandstorms...Bayek is a serious character, but doesnt mind playing hide and seek with kids, or cracking a couple of jokes, hes quite relatableModern world animus crap is back... You play as some lady with a nice Can we just have a game set in ancient Egypt please?HUD can be disabled in the games menu. I suggest you set it to minimal after your first couple of hours. This disables the tagging of enemies crap XRay vision, a.k.a. CHEATING , except for assassination targets, and most HUD features like ammo, equipped weapon, health bar and compass. Makes the game much more immersive and enjoyableVoice acting is great. No more British accents. Impressive how they got the kids to do their lines so wellAcceptable lip sync honestly. Its not that bad. Fallout 4 was way worse, if you need comparisonControls are very different from previous games. For instance, Shift is now bound to the new block mechanic instead of sprint. Jump is bound to Left Alt. Thankfully, all of these are easily switched with a good key rebind menuSide quests are no longer boring, but theyre still not quite on par with The Witcher 3s. Though I havent seen them allParkour seems feels more fluid and you dont accidentally run up walls like before. Though it doesnt look as good I think. I ended up spending most of my time on the ground, and honestly, thats more realisticThe cover system from the past two games seems to be goneYour pet eagle Senu is an awesome little drone, obviously inspired by Takkars owl companion in Far Cry PrimalThe game gave me a notification about the ingame Store, which I closed, ignored, and it never bothered me again. Its not intrusiveDid not have to grind yet, to proceed in the game. Not going after collectibles and such. All I do is the side quests and the main quests, and Im leveling up at a steady pace, allowing me to continue the storyCleopatra is not as busty as I hopedGood game overall. I am enjoying it.8/10
