Its pretty good! Comparing with the previous series, the Assassins Creed Origins has a more free and open world, and the weapons variety is also a good idea, especially when fighting with different people, there are more choices for the players to select and diffierent ways of fighting leads to different joys. However, the levels limit is a problem that makes me feel not so comfortable. Maybe the developers just want the players not to propel the progress of playing so quickly, so the levels limit is used to slow down the speed of playing. Players cant assassinate the targets who are 3 grades higher than them, and this law makes me sometimes uncomfortable when trying to finish some tasks.
