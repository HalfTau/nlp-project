Ubisoft just took the good elements of other rpgs, and used it to revamp AC. Bravo Ubisoft, bravo. I have a soft spot for open world rpgs and Origins is killing it.The only issuethus far for me is the fps. Frames drop straight to 3040 in high density areas. Could have gotten tips from CD Projekt Red about optimisation.
