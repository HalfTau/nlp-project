i love this Assasins game nice storyline acting is on spot with funny moments in it.Openworld wih nice sceenery and hidden secrets ,you can go whereever you look.Nice soundtrack,the game just makes me to login again to dicover more secrets from egypt and onfolting the storyline.only 1 thing  i found 2 bugs in mssion but nothing game breaking just reset mission and compleet it.and fps isnt realy stablebut the game wont stutter ya wont notice it unless you have a fps reader on.i give this game 8/10
