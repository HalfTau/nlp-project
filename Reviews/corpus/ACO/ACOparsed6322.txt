Very Poorly optimized even with a 1070 and 24gb RAM!EDIT After going through the gforce recomended settings as well as some tedious testing I was able to run the game smoothly with some frame drops. This game is a evil on your CPU and requires at least an I7 in my opinion. The game is not perfectly optimized but with a decent computer you should not have too many problems. Although once I was able to play the game, Truthfully its extreemly fun and is definately worth your money.
