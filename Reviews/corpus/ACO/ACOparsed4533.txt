Assassins Creed Origins is a great game. One of the best in the series. It drags on for long hours, knows how to take the soul plot and is extremely bored. But there is simply too much in it, and a lot is not always good. In some places, the project suffers from controversial decisions, in places  from an overabundance of content and figures, and somewhere simply because of technical roughness. Yes, and artificially delay the passage at the expense of a system of levels  the idea is still stupid.But if all the gameservices are the same as Origins with stories, atmosphere, breakout, and worked out worlds, then the future of a single regime is no longer so scary. Love this game
