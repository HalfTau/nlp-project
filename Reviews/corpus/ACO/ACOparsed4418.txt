Im getting 37 frames per second on average with 65 CPU usage on very high graphics settings.SpecsGTX 1050 TI.i54570  3.2GHz8GB DDR3 RAM.Installed on SSD.I dont know if they fixed something, but Im not having any issues playing so far. Ill update my review, but otherwise, the game is gorgeous and immersive. I only had to sign into uPlay once on startup and it was quick to start up and get me right into the game.Dont heed everyones criticism on Ubisoft. Some may be accurate and not at fault for their performance issues, but others might be getting the wrong impression just because its Ubisoft DRM which has a justified bad reputation, I know.EDITAfter playing for a few more hours, Ive still found there to be little to no performance bottlenecks, even in larger fights. There may be a jitter here and there but thats to be expected when running a budget GPU. Pressing F1 should show you the performance profiler if you want to assert the issue more indepth.
