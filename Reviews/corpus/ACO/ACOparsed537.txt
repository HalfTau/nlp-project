I dont review often but I gotta say this game nails open world. The map is huge, theres lots to do and 50 hours in I just finished the main story with a lot of the map undiscovered.Im not having the same preformance issues others are. Game plays smooth 95 of the time, some cut scenes late in the game stutter a bit. Story is kind of dull but the ending makes up for it.Only regret I have is that I should have bought the season pass when it was on sale. UbiSoft can be hit or miss and I gambled with just the base game. If I could do it over again I would have purchased the season pass or Gold edition when it was on sale.All in all Great Investment in entertainment.
