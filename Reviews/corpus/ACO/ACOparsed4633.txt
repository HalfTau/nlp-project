i7 3770k, GTX 1070 8GB VRAM, 16GB RAM.My PC meets the recommended requirements stated by Ubisoft.The game is constantely crashing to desktop without warning or error codes, before the crashing I was getting 5090 FPS on very high settings.  I tried setting the game to lower settings and it was still crashing, I also tried most of the suposed fixes that are online and they didnt work either.  I reinstalled, redownloaded and validated game files multiple times and still it was crashing.At this time I do not recommend this game to anyone, even if they meet the Recommended Requirements.I have requested a refund from Steam, hopefully if enough people request refunds Ubisoft will start to take these issues more seriously.
