I played AC Origins start to finish completing most of the side quests and collectables. I enjoyed every minute of what I played. This game does a good job of breaking the old AC mold and its for the best. The combat has been changed to a hit box system and was rarely aggravatingmostly because I was bad haha. The story was great however I didnt like the ending but thats just me otherwise I would consider the game a gem in the series that I actually like more then brotherhoodmy previous favourite each side quest feels like Im doing something important or relevant, where it be helping someone with a debt or getting someone married it all feels real. As for the collectables it dose the seem like a chore and more like Im working towards something bigger. And lastly I will visit he different skins/outfits, personally I didnt use many of them and stuck with the same horse and outfit for most of the game but thats just because I liked the look of those ones the best. The others looked good and polished but I personally didnt like their style. And theres only 1 skill that I didnt like and thats the chariot, it dose t control well and its a bit janky tbh. Lastly the bugs, which I didnt find many of and when I did it was more of a funny moment or something like that. All in all the game is good and I would recommend picking it up solid 9.5/10
