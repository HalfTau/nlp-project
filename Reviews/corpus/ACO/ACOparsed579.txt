Ahhhhh it feels good to be back. What a game! So if you are new to the series dont worry. This is like a whole different game with the name Assassins Creed. Which isnt a bad thing. You can start off the series with this and then replay the other games some other time. Okay so this game is something fresh like I said. Its so cool to see the birth of the brotherhood and how it all started. This game looks absolutely amazing and its packed with stuff. This game will keep you busy for hours. Yes this game is a witcher cut out but with a different story. But I mean this game is so good because its almost like the Witcher 3. The characters are amazing. The only problem I have with them are some of the main villians are forgetable which I can understand in a way as they werent the focus of the game. The story is something fresh and new. Game is fairly well optimized. The only problem I have with the game is the customization. And the micro transactions. But if you grind hard at the game you can get amazing gear without paying a cent. The modern day isnt good. But its better then the 3 previous AC games.Well done Ubi9/10
