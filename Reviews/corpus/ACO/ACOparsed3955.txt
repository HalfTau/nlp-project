While the game itself IS great, the DLC and Season pass in combletly useless. If at some point we can actually use weapons in the arena, id kinda understand why one would want some of the weapons from a tactical standpoint but you can easly clear the entire game with any predator bow alone. The outfits are also useless because its a single player game and nothing beats TOWLEMAN. None of the current pack give any actual new content what so ever. I would love to spend some more cash so that they keep makeing content but untill they actually give us something worth ANYTHING, i dont feel like getting scammed. The worst part is that the Season pass contains next to nothing of all the stuff thats avalable in the store. Everything is overpriced and youre even expected to spend their currency on stuff you unlock tru ACHIEVEMENTS. Heres your prize now you get to buy this... yeah.
