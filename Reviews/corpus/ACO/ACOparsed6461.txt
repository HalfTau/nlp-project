TLDR Reccomended.The goodBayek is the greatest character since Ezio.Egypt is large and offers a lot to do.Combat is refreshing albiet slightly awkward.Photo mode every game needs a photo mode tbh.Tons of sidequests and challenges.Outposts to capture gives me a Metal Gear Solid V feel.Small details such as when you cover your mouth Bayek sounds more muffled.Literal eagle vision.The mehSidequests can be repetitive.Animations feel clunky.Combat is fresh however at the same time is very out of place and feels way to cartoonish.Parkour is mediocre Unity had the best parkour and ever since that game the parkour has been getting worse.Lip syncing can be terrible at times.Outfits all look the same and look very meh.Movement system is very awkward there is no sprint button, you control Bayek with an analog stick or by simply holding W.RPG elements are wierdly implemented enemies can now take four arrows to the head before getting close to death.Audio effects sound bad Hidden blade sound effect from AC1  2 was great, however in Origins it sounds quite bad.The badMain story is a revenge story again. Also doesnt feel like a origin story at all.Aya and the ending If you have played it you will understand.No social stealth.Optimization.UI looks cluttered.Overall score 8.3/10
