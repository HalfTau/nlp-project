Gameplay, environment, levelling, ability to carry 9 tonnes of weapons and sidequests are all great. What isnt great is the lack of context,  theres no way to look up who a character is or what something should mean to you. Occasionally youll see a reference to something or your character will mention a name out loud but its meaningless without a way to check it in context, the old Codex is simply nowhere to be found and I cant for the life of me figure out why. Somebody mentioned the special tour feature, but thats a separate system, nothing to do with having a simple log of information in the system as per the previous games and any othe game of this type. Weirdest choice ever, to build something so magnificent and then throw meaning to the wolves as if all this art, history and monumental effort was merely to create a pissy combat FPS? I dont get it. anyway 10/10 for the vastness and all the beautiful artwork. 0/10 for the idiot who said yeah just leave the codex out hey.
