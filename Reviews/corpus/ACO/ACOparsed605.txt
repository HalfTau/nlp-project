I really want to recommend this game. The good everything thats great about the AC series with some annoyances ironed out, beautiful scenery, worlds most okayest story. But seriously, the optimisation on this for PC is absolutely terrible. I have a relatively good computer GTX 1080, 6700K, but even at 1080p on high not ultra settings I get some pretty significant stuttering when first loading the game. Ive tested with multiple other games, ensured up to date drivers etc. and its definitely the game. Such a shame, because despite all that Ive actually been really enjoying it.
