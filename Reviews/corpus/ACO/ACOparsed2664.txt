If you have ever played and enjoyed the assasins creed series, I highly recommend Origins.  My favorites so far have been the original start to the series and black flag, many of the others have lost their luster with me, seeming a carbon copy of the previous version. Different locations,  same gameplay. Origins has taken care of that in a big way!!!!  From the story line which is excellently written, graphics are top notch, upgradeable weapons, different tier of weapons, hunting and crafting set very similar to farcry series but a little more grindy. Main quests in this game make perfect sense, following the storyline. This has been my first review of any game Ive played on steam or otherwise. First i was a little skeptical of the new release, and then discovered one of my friends had multiple hours in the game and decided to give it a try!!  glad I did, a little over 46 hours in and still wanting more hunting and more side quests, only still lvl 25ish I believe in game and no rush to hurry to the end. I am still looking forward to being able to kill the Phylakes that are after me, and youll understand this should you play also!!!!!!  Happy gaming, and hope this review helps....
