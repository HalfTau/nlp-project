Despite the hate about the Denuvo and VM protect controversy surrounding this game, it still performs alright.Its a fun game, lots of exploring and not as much handholding as in the earlier games. Combat improved since the last games. Massive open world Bayeks character really like him for some reason, he seems more human than the likes Ezio, Frye Twins and Arno. Lots of things to do No collectibles like in the earlier games, You do quests and get loot and XP. Arena and Hippodrome Two fun side activites if you are short for cash. Music Microtransactions to make the game easier for you. Even playing on highest difficulty the game still isnt that hard... Some glitches and bugs, not like unity, a game meant to be buggy couldnt even be that bad 30 Hours in and I love the game at the moment, have heard people say that the story gets weak nearing the end, but havent finished the main story yet so Ill have to wait and see.Running a GTX 780, i5 4670k and 16 GBs of ram, havent really encountered any big performance issues, some small FPS drops drops of 510 fps in cities at times but otherwise the game is running at 60 FPS or above, keep in mind that I am playing on High settings, not ultra.
