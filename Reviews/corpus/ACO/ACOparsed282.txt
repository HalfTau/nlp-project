The Good Side Of all AC games i played before, Origins is the most unique and refreshing game i ever played. The no HUD idea is brilliant as you wont need to constantly look for the objective or if any NPCs are around you. You simply roam the map and appreciate the beauty of the game. Theres no dull moment while you go to another location, too many stuffs to do, that sometimes i juggle the side missions and main missions. As much as i want to say more things about this game, you should try it, youll never regret it The Bad Side Because of the DRM  VMProtect makes this game unplayable for any below quadcore processors. By the time of this writing, Im using a i3 6100  GTX 1060 6gb. This combo is what i used to play games like The Division, PUBG, etc, but i struggle at Origins because the game keeps pinning  up mg CPU to 100. Thats not a a good sign since the game should run smooth on custom settings. If you plan to get this game, either you tweak down the settings or upgrade your CPU/GPU. It will help in the long run since this type of game will be a norm in near future.
