For the first time, Iam giving a positive review for AC Origins.The Game initially had some issues, which are not fixed yet such as Screen Stuttering, CPU Usage exceeding to 100 usage making it to restart the PC entirely.Need to work on the Fixed Screen issues. Even High Graphic Video CXards are unable to run the Game.Game Experience is Very Good with GOOD STORY and Graphics.
