The gameplay and story are fun, was really enjoying the game. However I also expected a functional game when I spent 88AUS on something. Ive had 3 different quests fail because carriages randomly flew into the air, crashed and died. Or ran into a wall, glitched, and just bugged out. On top of that, loading video cutsecnes which happens a lot literally took 5 minutes a screen On an almost new, good computer. In other words, as fun as it was to play, it was just too broken for me to actually enjoy. Maybe I should just get past that, but for 88 I shouldnt have to, would pay 20 for what I experienced.
