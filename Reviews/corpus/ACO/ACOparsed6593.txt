16.11.2017  Updated ReviewI have repurchased the product as a patch came out which was meant to have changed the games performance. Overall  the game runs far smoother than it originall did. Sometimes the sound is loud and speech low, sometimes the other way round. Whats suprising is that the videos still stutter, which is a shame.But in terms of gameplay, the combat and running is smooth. Yes changing from shift to alt to free run takes time getting used to , but its actually not bad, as you can remap if you really want to.Day 1 Buy review.Awaiting a Refund27.10.2017  Approved already And heres whyEither this game has been released way too early, or the game is simply poorly Optimized. Yes I have only played 16 minutes, because thats exactly how long it took for me to realize this game is unplayable and  unacceptable in its current state.Even the videos that are meant to tell the story, stutter.I cant even say anything about story  because I cant get to it.Even the game menu is slow and lagging. In case you are wondering about specsI7  4770 KGTX 1070.32GB RAMBought Shadow of War no less than 2 weeks ago, and there are no such graphical issues, no lag.The performance of this game is simply not created for the PC at this time.I recommend not buying this product, or simply waiting until Ubisoft fix all the performance issues. Trully saddened, as I had hoped to come back to Assasins Creed since Black Flag Updated since review aboveRefund has been approved  but I recommend only playing games that work, and you feel the money spent is well worth spending. I wish I could be one of the guys who gave a thumbs up and could be playing it right now  but maybe in a few months/years once the game has been patched up.
