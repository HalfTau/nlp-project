Im only 8 hours into the new assassins creed an so far its brilliant. The game is better optimized than any other AC game and runs really well so far i have had no crashes and no bugs or glitchs at all.Im running a i7 7700k,Aorus gaming 7 board,16Gb ram an a 1080ti at 1440p on maximum everything and it runs so smooth im very impressed with how amazing the game looks and feels the graphics really are outstanding.
