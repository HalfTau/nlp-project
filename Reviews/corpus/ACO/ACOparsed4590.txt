I dont know if its a good game or not based on my gameplay, because it didt last long. But its an rpg, and I think people who like rpgs would probably enjoy it. That being said my I7 6700HQ, gtx 1060 6gb, 16gb ram rig barely got above 4448 fps on High settings, not ultra but high! Yes it gets back to 60fps when thers nothing to do and im standing still like a statue, but thats just stupid. Sometimes it drops to 30 fps and gets back to 56ish which just detacts from the overall experience. So for the saftey of my computer i have decided to refund this unoptimezed filth aka PUBG Origins!
