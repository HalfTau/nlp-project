What I would expect out of a AAA title. Lively open world, lots to do, great rpg elements, and the combat is challenging. Definitely an improvement over the past. Havent had any proformance issues or encountered any bugs that has turned me away. I dont care much about the story in games but this one is interesting. Worth a play
