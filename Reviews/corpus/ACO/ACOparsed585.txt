The story is good , but at the end I feel that is rushed.Graphics look good but not as good as AC Unity.Gameplay and level system is good and bad at the same time , I like that you need level and upgrades to kill enemies with to much level , but at the same time its just grind of secondary missions to get that level just to beat enemies from main story because if you dont do secondary missions you will not get money , exp , items to craft your items and you will be in main story dead.You can play with 2 characters  Bayek and Aya.Some sidequests are good and the story behind them are nice too , but some are just bad.They are a lot of sidequests , events , new sidequests with almost every patch , you need a lot of hours to complete the normal map , with the new 2 DLCs coming out , i think that you need a lot of hours for them too.Naval battles are back even if they are small , not so many like in ACIV and Rogue.Senu Eagle Eye is more important here than in any others games , with her you can see chests , enemies , hidden areas,etc. I like that the eagle is more upgraded here than Far Cry Primal.DayNight circle is just amazing , if you want to rush camps in day or to wait for night to kill them when they are sleeping is your choice. This feels that you are an assassin and choose when you want to destroy your target.Photomode is something new to AC and its just good and you need this because they are so many things that are so beautiful and you want to make a photo of them. You can see what others players photo in the game and on the map sometimes you can see artworks from the Ubisoft.Crafting system is simple and easy , get the materials required to craft that weapon,armor,etc and just click to craft the item you want.Skill system is easy like crafting , you can go hybrid , warrior , bow or assassin , in my opinion go hybrid be a little assassin , more of a warrior and deal some damage with the bow.I like that we have daily missions from Reda , but they are bad and good at the same time , if you like to grind for items and exp you would like it , but if you are bored of this , this daily mission from Reda its just to get free items everyday if you dont want to pay for them.Mirajes are interesting and weird , but i like them , they are giving you a weird feeling when you see one.Soundtrack is good , the main theme is always good in AC games.Combat system is kinda meh and kinda good , dodging sometimes can  you up because the character doesnt want to dodge or its dodging in a bad direction.No quest for destroying Ptolemy Statue , you just destroying them for exp , in The Witcher 3 is something similar like this , but you receive a quest for doing this , here you are doing this for nothing without any reason or something...Bad assassinations if an enemy is eating or reading at the table , there is no animation if you kill someone , you just touch him with hidden blade , you dont put your hand at his mouth for no screaming or alert the other guards.Camera positions in fightning , sometimes camera is to close to you and you cant see the enemies and sometimes is fine , like when you are fightning with a elephant , the most dangerous enemy in this game the camera is to close to you when you are running and you cant see the elephant. They really need to work on this in the next game. This elephant is just an example , but when you fight in arena or in freeroam with many enemies the camera can  you and lose your fight.Sidequests that are set and dont know what you did in main story or how your character looks like.Ex Bayek is telling to a young boy that his hair is shaved , but my Bayek has hair , of course this is because Aya will shave Bayek in main story , but this doesnt mean that others sidequest should be like this , people are speaking about the enemies from the list , still they are dead because i killed them or even Bayek is speaking about them , but they are dead. I hate sidequests that are like this because they will ruining your freeroam or pleasure to explore the world.When you see a miraje your camera position goes awful , its not smooth and sometimes you cant see that miraje because you run with your horse and just because you are close to a mirage the camera position is moving.Camera positions when talking to an NPC from AC 1 , i just hate them , in the next AC just make good cutscenes like in The Witcher 3 , learn from CD PROJEKT RED Ubisoft , please no more camera positions.Pack items that cost real money if you want them or grind for coins to get heka chests from Reda and gambling to get them. Why no side quests to get those items like with Final Fantasy sidequest , that sidequest was more interesting than some sidequests that are in this game.Parkour in this game is simple and looks bad and good at the same time , I feel that in AC Unity the parkour was more interesting and I know that in that game sometimes the parkour was annoying but here doesnt feel that im playing AC. Its just pressing alt and thats it , no good moves , if you jump from a high distance just press alt to roll to get less damage. Its a good system to climb rocks , houses , etc , but it should be more interesting in my opinion.Graphic quality can sometimes look bad , really bad.Glitches,bugs,crashes that are bad as in others AC games , NPCs stuck in carriages , mission objective that is in the ground and you need to restart the game , the game doesnt count how many times you did Trial of The Gods,etc. They are fixing bugs and glitches with every patch and this is good , i hope that after DLC 2 everything is fixed.A.I enemies are bad , if you release prisoners from camp and enemies are walking by the cages wide open they are not saying anything , like why are the cages empty with no prisoners or something like this.Sometimes if they are 2 enemies close to each other and you kill one the other one is like ah hes dead but i dont give alarm or to panic or something , none response from him.Sidequests repeated with different objective that are all the time in camps , most of them are like this someone is at the camp and you need to rescue him , someone stole my horse you need to get it back , you need to kill that captain because is threatening the village and even if they are not like this , you still need to go at x camp to battle,release,find information,etc. Its like AC 1.The most annoying thing in sidequests is that if you raid a camp in your freeroam time and you choose a sidequest close to you , that will tell you to go to that camp that you already raided and do x objective.Ex I was going to one sidequest and i saw a camp close to me and i completed the camp , all the money,all soldiers dead,etc and after i get to the sidequest i get the mission to go to that camp that i already completed to release a crocodile , but when i arrived theire there was no enemies at all because they are killed by me...Optimization sucks with 4 DRM in the game Steam/Uplay/Denuvo and VMProtect. I hope that they will remove Denuvo and VMProtect in future. People are complaining about this from the first day when this game was released , remove the ing DENUVO.In the end i like the game and its good even with this problems and i hope that the next Assassins Creed will be better and hope for a new one in Japan/China , its time to be a Samurai Assassin.
