I dont think I have ever written a review before but for this game I felt I had too. If you are a fan of the AC games this one will blow you away. Visually it is the most beautiful one the made and the map is truly a giant, the devs really out did themselves. The combat is totally different and has a decent learning curve at first but once I got used to it, I loved it. Travelling by boat is awesome and the controls are pretty easy to control. I had one crash in over 30 hours of gameplay. Im not sure what people are complaining about when it comes to bugs, maybe I am super lucky but havnt experienced any. And as far as FPS...I am running this on an older computer, i7 3770 3.5GHZ, 16G ram and GTX 950 . Yeah I had to tweak some of the options but been getting around 30  40 fps. No stuttering or anything. For me it was so well worth the prepurchase and I am supper happy with the game. It can only get better from here.
