Im a really big fan of Egyptian mythology and of the assassins creed franchise and so far the game is good but If a decent optimization patch doesnt come in the next 2 weeks, I will probably refund it and wait for a sale. I dont want to give this game a thumbs up nor a thumbs down, so ill leave it on down for now until the devs realise they need to fix this D
