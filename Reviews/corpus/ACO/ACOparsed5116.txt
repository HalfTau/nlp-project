One of the most beautiful games Ive played since Witcher 3. A lot of exploration, side quests, main quests and other activities to take part in. Combat can be a little clunky starting off in the game, but upon levelling up and unlocking perks, it gets a lot better. This is up on my list of favourite AC games. Nothing will ever beat AC2, haha
