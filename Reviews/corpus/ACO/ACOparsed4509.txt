Game Runs Great in my i5 6600k running at 4.0Ghz, 1060 gtx. No issues the common cpu usage yes....... but the game runs smooth as all hell! Also considering its my first time back since black flag its not too bad at all, very nicely done so far!!!No support to ubisoft for numerous reasons, but atleast some of there games are pretty solidRecent Need for Speed wasnt bad kinda felt alittle like undergound Ghost recon Wildlands i thought was a decent ghost recon game just my opinion..
