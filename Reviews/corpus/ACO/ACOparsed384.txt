this game is garbage. new combat system leaves miles for improvement. animations have seemingly gotten worse. framerate dips into the 20s when in big cities even when settings are on medium or low. characters are extremely dull.If you want a beautiful and massive open world that is constantly brought down by terrible gameplay, terrible story designers, and terrible optimization, then this is your game, my friend.
