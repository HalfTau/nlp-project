ProsGreat setting with large open world area Egypt 1st C BCImpressive graphics, sound and ambience.Diverse landscapes.Interesting minor characters.Lots of accurate and interesting Egyptian culture and religion.Fun gameplay. Really enjoyed exploring the sizeable map.ConsProtagonist personally unendearing / unrelatable  revenge kill revenge kill revenge kill revenge.Depiction of oversized weapons and the ability to swing these massive things singlehandedly with ease.Major Historical errors Medjay were Nubians / African  not Arabic. The Hyksos Semites introduced chariots to Egypt  not Hittites IndoEuropeans. No mention of the major Jewish community in Egypt at the time far in excess of the greek community. Tombs with incorrect names etc etc.Some graphical glitches and bugs.High processor use  managed 3050 fps on max settings with 5 year old video card.
