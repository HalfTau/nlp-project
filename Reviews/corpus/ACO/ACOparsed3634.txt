Ive played 2 hours already and I only god damn passed the intro. Definitely worth 80 dollars play time is amazing, graphics is amazing story is imersive just overall a great game. Only problem is uses up a wholeton of CPU making my keyboard colours studder but can somehow maintain a steady 60 in game
