The game is good and campaign is entertaining. I like how side quests are now fun and needed however, it is optimized poorly and with a decent graphics card only 30fps on low. IF you have better than reccommended you can only play low. Also the ending of the game is too fast and unexpected, the campaign isnt very long and theres not much to do after completion. I thought free roam on ships or something like build your own camp and you can take NPCs on raids with you like a little side part to after the story. for example assassins creed black flag has the fleet, on this game something like making your own camp. Or picking a Area and upgrading a small army so Siwa wont be a 15 area you can make it stronger.
