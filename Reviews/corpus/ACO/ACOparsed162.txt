This should actuaqlly be the firts assasins creed game i played but as soon as i try to start the game it crashes instantly i tried asking th support for help and they did acrually answer but their answer didnt halp sad thing is that im not the only person with this problem and they didnt fix it so while i actuallly think the game is great i cant play it so i sadly have to write  a bad rewiew and im loosing trust in ubisoft even more.
