after completed main story, discovered all locations, do all the side missions, i give this game a7/10Not a good game. But not a bad game. Its a decent game.Do i like it? yeahDo i love it? naahDo i like the characters? mehDo i like the story? it got moments but at the end is just MEHDo i like the combat system? hell yeah!Do i like the world? hell yeah!Do i like the locations? yyyeeahhhhwrhfdj..no.. kindda.. some of it...BUT its really a game that you need to check it out if you are a AC long fan since the first game. And probably stepping in the right direction after what happened with AC Unity i skipped that one LoLbut seriously, ubisoft need to stop doing AC for like 5 or 8 years and come back with fresh and new ideas.my advice dont buy the deluxe or gold or premium or whatever editions cuz you will going to get a better loots in the game. seriously, No means no no!
