Well, for me this game is huge disappointment.I heard a lot of people praising this game as a freh start with an interisting story, good storytelling and memorable characters. To me this game has none of these.The game is still full of boring and repetitive quests. The immersion into the story is constantly destroyed by boring main and sidequests so that i couldnt even enjoy the good quests because they felt like they didnt really belong to the same game.The story is still very one dimensional, the main characters take side with cleopatra but the game fails to explain to me why she is the better choice for Egypt instead of her brother.Sure, the world is huge and beautiful but the regions dont feel connected in any way when you walk over a hilltop it always feels totaly random what awaits you on the other side.I get the feeling that the authors dont know anymore how to finish or even continue the story in the present. To me the historical storyline is the means to finish the storyline in the present. The game doesnt deliver, again.The birth of the brotherhood is presented in the most dilettantish way ever possible i couldnt really believe what just happened in the game when it happened.I didnt enjoy the fighting mechanic, i used bows most of the time simply to avoid it.The story is one of revenge for maybe 90 of the game and suddenly near the end the game literally spams the word creed once every few minutes without ever having mentioned it before. Its like they noticed at the end hey, this is supposed to be an origin story for assassins creedThis game fails to be the origin.
