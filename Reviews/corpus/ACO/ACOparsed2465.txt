If you were a fan of assassin creed black flag you will love this, i would also recommend this to player that want to play a game where every now and again they just stop an go damn this is beautiful an stop to take a picture as it was a very nice touch in my opinion or stop to admire the architecture as the series really does have that going for it. Amongst all the other things i could write about and go into detail on story, resource gathering ect a lot of other people have already covered it in their own reviews, ill just let the game speak for itself dont pass up the opportunity to play this game.
