After several years of assassin creeds franchise, I dislike Unity and Syndicate. but this game is completely astoning and amazing, beautiful graphic some minor bug and glitch that not borther much. the characters are amazing, especially Bayek of Siwa, who is my second favorite characters than Ezio and Edward Kenway. he has motivation, strong dialouges, strong characteristic, light heart, sense of justice and not a complete doucebag at all. Egypt is beautiful and very look realistic graphic that for a person like me idont know much about Egypt is feel like it. Amazing soundtracks, great voice actors and actresses, beautiful graphic, and great change of gameplay system that I knew from previous game.
