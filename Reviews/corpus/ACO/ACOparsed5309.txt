There a some minor technical quirks with this game like the high load on the cpu which can happen on some systems. Apart from that this is a really great game with tons of things to do. If youre on the fence buying it because you heard/read its completely broken dont. it has some minor problems but except that it is an excellent game. If you like witcher 3 feel free to grab this.  interesting story and nice side quests good graphics and character design huge open world with tons of stuff to do fighting remapped control to witcher 3 layout multiple types of bows, melee weapons and tools performance with 70fps good for open world fps counter and cpu load metrics/ microtransactions doesnt feel like you miss something so ok animal variety seems limited would have liked some hunting skills photos opting out in the menu should deactivate this feature completely vm protect  denuvo although i understand why they were added alibi crafting possible to upgrade your equipment but crafting arrows and tools would be nice not much ingredient variety new weapons usually only a few stat differences, legendary does not feel special would have been good if the main questline would level with your characterweirdhad the issue that soon after starting the game the cpu would spike from usual temperatues on my rig I74790, GTX 1080 TI in games of 75 C to 100 C and 100 CPU load. After a little tinkering changed the maximum processor state in the advanced power settings to 99 and now the CPU is constantly at 75 C  to 78 C and the games runs very nice with 70 fps. The load is still high but at least the cores are not melting down.
