I never write reviews, but this game deserves it. Ubisoft, you have completely ed up. I have a pretty freaking robust system Core i7 7700k, gtx 1080ti, 32 gb ram etc. Like, my rig is complete overkill, yet why is it that I can BARELY run the game at a steady 30fps at lowest settings, nevermind 60 fps on ultra. I switched over to pc for an optimized experience, but it seems like EVERY ubisoft game I play Tomb raider, south park, far cry, assassins creed They all run like The sad part is you have great IPs that are executed terribly. Your drm policies are ing your customer service is ing and your pc optimization is ing If you want to play a ubisoft game, play it on consoles. Atleast then you wont have AS MANY bugs as you will on the pc. I forced myself to try and give this game a chance and ended up playing more like trying everything I could think of to try and make the game playable moving back and forth between desktop commands and thegame 6.5 hours of it. Now steam wont even give me my money back for this game. Waste of time and money. Like I said, if you wanna play a ubisoft game, either buy it for console or ing pirate thatbecause atleast when you pirate the ing game which I absolutely disagree with and dont actually condone you dont have to deal with ubisofts drm layer cake of performance halting t. You guys will never be getting my money again.
