Still terribly optimised. Have no idea how this game has very positive reviews, unless other users are just turning a blind eye to the constant stuttering in frames. Tried all sorts of graphic settings configirations but to no evail, so im just going to have to give up. Im sure the games fun if you can run it, but i hope you have a 98 core CPU.gtx 1080i5  3570k8gb ramSSD
