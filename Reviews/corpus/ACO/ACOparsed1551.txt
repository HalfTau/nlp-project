Dont get me wrong, I love AC like no other series, but good lord this game is a poor mans version of the Witcher 3. The world feels lifeless and dead, and I have no investment in the people or characters. The sidequests were repeatative and the parkcore and stealth gameplay atributes took a step back in my opinion. I actually liked the combat of AC Syndicate and Unity one of the few things I liked but they changed it. The main story was interesting but meh, revenge based AC games have gotten...old. The sad thing is the wasted potential of this game. It could have been alot better.There is a silver lining however. After the 2 AC titles horrifically failed, this one at least tried to copy an amazing game Witcher 3 and improve itself. Ubisoft still needs to work on its world development a lot and refine the gameplay mechanics, but I think they took a step towards reviving the franchies.So final verdictif its your first Assassins Creed game, play it. Itll be an enjoyable 50 hours or so especially without the knowledge of better past AC games.if your a longtime fan... play it to discover the origins of the Assassin order, but dont expect anything too special.
