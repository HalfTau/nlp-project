After completing the story and most of the game itself, ive come to the conclusion that this game.. is ing great. The game is super aesthetic and everything just goes perfectly together, the music and atmosphere is absolutely breathtaking. The story is amazing and has a lot of historical accuracies and really brings back Assassins Creed. I havent bought any AC games in a while because i thought the series had sort of died, but this game really got my childhood favourite game series back into my heart.Thank you Ubisoft. Thank you.
