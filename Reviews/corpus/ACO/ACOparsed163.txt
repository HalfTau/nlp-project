After finishing Witcher 3 ,  i couldnt find a single game to give me anything close to its experience , but i am feeling a little bit suprised with AC Origins , Since i only care about a witcher 3 like experience , my feedback will be compared to witcher 3 ,This game graphics at times beats witcher 3, but voice acting and faces are less quality than witcher , a positive thing which others may not like it , that the fact this game will force you to do side quests so you can level up to meet main quests level requirments , but over all a wonderful experience , the combat is really nice , and people who like bows , will obviously love this game.
