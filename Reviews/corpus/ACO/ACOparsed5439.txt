Ive played almost 12 hours now. Dont really know why anyone would give a bad rating, ya it might have been a bit buggy at launch I still havent experinced any bugs but people need to chill on the bad ratings. If you like skyrim and witcher and would like to throw some parkour into the mix this game is worth a shot. Ya its not going to be as good as those games but if your not playing this game to find bad things about it youre going to have allot of fun like I am.
