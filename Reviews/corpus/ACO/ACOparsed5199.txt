This is a GOOD Game. But sadly, due to the drm Vmprotect, its litarally ruining the performance of this game. Im getting 100 usage on my cpu i74790k. Im struggling to get a stable on 60fps on ultra and barely getting 50fps in cities which mind you, I should be getting 60 easy because of my specs. gtx 1070, i74790k, 16 gb. If they fix this issue, Ill change my review.EDIT The 100 usage is not because of the DRM. Ubisoft has cleared this up. The 100 usage is a bug that ubisoft will eventully fix. As of todays patch, the performance is much better now. Its not that great but its more enjoyable now
