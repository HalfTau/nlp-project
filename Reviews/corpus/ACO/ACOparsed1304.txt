dont get me wrong this game plays well and looks great. i would have recomended this game if it wasnt for game breaking tech issues. Mostly becasue i have never seen a game that maxes out my cpu to the point where my computer has to shut the game off in order to prevent damage after only 30min of game play. appently its linked to the anti pirating software in this game butman ruined a perfectly good game. wait and see if they fix this. if not dont get it, your pc integrety is more important than this game.
