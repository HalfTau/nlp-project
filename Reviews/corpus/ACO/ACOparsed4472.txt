At first I really liked this game. The visuals are nice and the gameplay is functional. However the game keeps wanting me to buy in game currency with real money. Ive declined it and tried to ignore it multiple times. The game keeps getting less rewarding with the loot you get, the in game market sells basically nothing at all, and I think this is another system in place to try and get me to purchase loot with real money on the ubisoft market.I wish I didnt buy this, I regret this purchase so much that I wish I spent this money on several indie games on steam instead. Like I said, the game is designed in such a way where the quality gets worse the more you play so that youre incentivized to buy more/better loot with real money.STAY AWAY
