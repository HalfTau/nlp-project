I like the game. The problem I have with it is some of the graphic and audio bugs. Seems like they said Put it out and we will patch it later. They should take a page out of Bungies playbook and hold release until the day one bugs are fixed on the PC. This game I am sure will be better in a month after some patches. I would wait until then. Additionally black friday and other holiday deals will be going on and you probably be a able to get this game on sale.
