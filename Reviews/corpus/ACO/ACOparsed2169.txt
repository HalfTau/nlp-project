graphics 11/10fun 9/10but this is the type of game where they dreamed too big.. the game has quiet a bit of bugs. The fighting feels uncomfortable still. Its a step in the right direction but the parry system is awkward, and the dash/dodge move doesnt move you in a better spot. I wanted to be able to dodge then attack from behind but its so hard to do with the controls it has. You usually end up doing some random stuff and getting lucky. The rest of it I can forgive but the fights needed the polish still. Highly recommend this, but they could easily improve upon this game imo.
