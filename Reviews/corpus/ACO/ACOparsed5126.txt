YESSSSS.I am a fan of the franchise though Im a late bloomer from Black Flag. So far, this game hasnt dissappointed me one bit. It does take some time to get familiar with the new, however, but you are rewarded with a rich world to explore. I tend to be one of those systematic types who looks in every nook and cranny for goodies. There are lots of nooks and crannys too. I have been in mourning ever since I finished Witcher, and just havent been able to get into Elder Scrolls like I hoped I would. So far, I have been able to enjoy this AC Origins though. I know, I know, I cant explain it, but somehow its keeping me engaged. There is a decent story unfolding, but its no witcher 3 in terms of dialog. Much more of a grind than previous AC games, but I somehow am totally ok with that. Its fair and thats all I care about. The abilities points are starting to make sense to me, though I was a bit confused at first where to start. Regenerate, Parry, Triple Dodge, and Poison.I bought the season pass and am looking forward to some of the additional DLC. I must give this a 5 out of 5 so far for overall experience. Im playing on a GTX980M i7 laptop and I have not noticed any issues at all. If youre on the fence about this game, dont be. update later
