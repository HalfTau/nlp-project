This might be the best game of 2017 imo and I played Nier Automata, BotW, Horizon Zero Dawn and Cuphead. Ive nearly sunk 20 hours into it and I feel like Ive barely tasted what this gargantuan recreation of Ancient Egypt has to offer me. I took ancient history in High School and we studied Egypt and I can confidently say that I have learned vastly more playing this than I ever did in that class no I didnt fail, I got a B.Even if it isnt the GOTY it is undoubtedly the most underrated game of the year due to so many brushing it aside because Ubisoft sucks. Even going through the negative steam reviews I can see a clear trend where peoples opinions of this game are tainted by Ubisofts previous mistakes. I have no doubt that if another dev had made this it would sit at overwhemingly positive.Please give this game a shot It will show Ubi what we want and encourage them to enter a new golden age.
