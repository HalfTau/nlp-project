I am an Assassins Creed fan since it first came out in 2007 and I was highly disappointed when titles like Rogue and Unity came out. Ubisoft seems like they felt the same when they took the 1 year break to make this game because I think it has the best chance to top AC2 I did not finish the story yet, Im taking my time to enjoy completing the map.What is nice is the fact that it takes the RPG path and its a whole different game from the rest of the series, most people say that its a Witcher 3 copy, so how is that a bad thing? Witcher 3 was legendary, we need more games like that.The map is more alive hallucinations, multiple sidequest, sandstorm etc, good job Ubisoft, youve finally made a complete game.
