Been playing this game for a few hours now and I genuinely find this game amazing, the scenery is beautiful and as always Assassins Creed has created a game that ties in with history which is one thing I love the revamped combat system is fantastic, and the stealthaspect of this game is much improved over previous versions afterall you have a bird that tags enemies for you. The storyline is really good and there were some bits that genuinely threw my jaw onto the floor. The ability to upgrade Bayeks abilities into three different branches, the ability to upgrade weapons/armor at the start of the game, his bracers, stealth weapon etc are a real compliment to the RPGaspect of the game. Ive encountered one bug in the last 11 hours of playing this game and it was more of an annoyance although it desynchronized me than anything really bad. Main issues and I find myself saying this alot with Ubisoft if you dont have the best of PCs, do not buy this game, or at least buy it on a console as CPU usage on my i7 6700K is consistantly around 6070 Id hate to imagine what its like on a more budget PC.
