I bought this on the steam sale thinking i would just refund it an hour in but boy was I wrong. Having not really liked too many games that came out in 2017, I felt that it was one of the most disappointing years in gaming in a while so i figured id give AC origins a shot, and it has been my favorite game of 2017 by far. The world is massive, all of it is beautiful, the stealth feels fun and challenging in a good way and feels incredibly satisfying. The combat is fun, when mastered, but takes some time to get good at. The climbing unlike previous entries in the series feels natural and does what you want it to ,most of the time. While i have encountered some bugs through out the game none have been gamebreaking. The game is also pretty graphically demanding i was averaging around 50fps on high settingsProsmassive beautiful worldfun combatinteresting story and side questsConsgraphically demandingcpu intensive because of DRMMy specsRyzen 5 1600 base clockGIGABYTE GTX 1060 3gb OC8 gigs of DDR4 ramWindows 10
