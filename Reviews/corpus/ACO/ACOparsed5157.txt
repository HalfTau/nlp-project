TLDRGame itself is fantastic, but cant reccomend because of Ubisofts choice to use both Denuvo  VMProtect which is crippling performance, as well as the persistant and annoying audio issues.Actual ReviewOk so firstly, I LOVE this game, the actual game itself is brilliant and I dont think they could have improved it much more.Theyve kept the stuff that worked from the previous games, threw out what didnt work and introduced a lot of new mechanics that allow for a much greater dimension of freedom and choosing how you play.The game is a little more RPGish now, similiar to the witcher with the gear and combat systems, though in a VERY good way.BUT, the reason I cannot reccomend it right now is for two reasons.Firstly, Denuvo  VMProtect are BOTH being used in this game to prevent it being cracked, but this has the downside of maxing out most peoples CPUs and crippling performance.Even at a high resolution I am currently CPU bottlenecked where there is absolutely no reason for it to be. This is entirely because of Ubisofts anticonsumer practices regarding DRM.Seriously, Uplay  Steam  Denuvo  VMProtect, wtfAnd secondly, the audio bugs. Right now I have to restart the game 34 times before I can play it. Sometimes it just kills my audio devices and I have to disable and reenable them to make them work.And sometimes it has an awful crackling the whole time. Not to mention the fact that the entire game is so damn quiet its ridiculous.In regards to microtransactions, yes they are there, but not in any intrusive way.I havent felt the need to use them once as everything can be bought through normal play.If the audio bugs are fixed, and DenuvoVMProtect are removed then this would be a 100 reccomendation from me. The game itself is brilliant, its just being held back by anticonsumer practices.
