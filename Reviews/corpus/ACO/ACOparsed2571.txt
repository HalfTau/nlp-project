This game is marred by poor performance, unability to even load texture on objects leads to freezes every other second and its not even certain it will load then. I have had problems that it wont even load the world at all, leaving me with a black screen, or it wont progress with a cutscene for a minute or so leaving me walking around confused what the heck to do. I have an ok computer which has been able to play anything else released this year without problem, but this port is just bad.I will request a refund and you will stay away until the developers fix these problems.
