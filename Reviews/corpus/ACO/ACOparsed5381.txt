This game just look amazing! Graphics get a 10/10 and it runs just amazing on my pc so performance wise 10/10. The story is really strong and keeps you interested so the story gets 10/10. The only real negative thing I have to say about this game is that the new RPG style of assassins creed... Im not really feeling the new RPG style. I really liked the older games mechanics better. I also thought the combat wasnt as nice and fluid as some of the other games. Overall id give this game a 8/10 rating just because the only thing i wasnt fond of was the playing mechanics but otherwise the game was amazing and id reccommend it to other people.
