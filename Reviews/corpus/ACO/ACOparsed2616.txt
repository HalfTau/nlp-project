I cannot recommend this game until they fix whatever is causing peoples processors to tank. There is absolutely 0 reason that this game should push your CPU usage to 90100, im not saying its whatever DRM theyre using, but clearly something ridiculous is going on, there is absolutely 0 reason for this game to push my CPU into even the high 80s let alone 90s to 100, if a console can run this just fine than the problem clearly lies with ubisofts optimization of the game or some other issue that is specifically computer related. If this issue gets fixed I will change my review but as is I cant play this game without worrying about frying my cpu.will wait to see if any optimization improvements release but yeah there is no way i can play this game at the temps it pushes my CPU too and the fact that it pushes them so far is a little ridiculous.I would like to thank ADankPineApple for reminding me to post my specs.CPU i58400 kaby lakeCooler Corsair 240mm liquid coolantGPU nvidia 970 gtxMobo z370 chipset, gigabyte
