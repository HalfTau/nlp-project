Its pretty, but thats about it. They dumbed down the climbing to the point where you just run at a wall and stick to it like magic. Combat is horrible as well. Their new systems hast taken any form of skill out and just replaced it with glitchy dodges and clicky swings. The story was also horrible, lacking any kind of flow... Just sort of jumped around and didnt make sense and towards the end they just threw quality out the window... I have never seen such lazy writing in a game before. The final problem is the horrible lvling system. Vast sections of the game are locked behind lvl limits and it takes HOURS to level up. It took me several days of hard core grinding to get to lvl 40.I also found many bugs through out the play through, crashed three times and got regular 30 FPS drops with a I7 6700k CPU and a GTX 1080Ti video card.I dont recommend this game, maybe if it was 20 but not worth the 60. I would be getting a refund if I could. Assassins Creed is dead, they are just milking it now.
