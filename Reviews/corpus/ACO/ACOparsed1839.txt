I have played for some time. Not much, but all I needed. This game have preformance issues. Some AI is not loading and people is walking around without faces and meaning with life. Sometimes they spawn into action but most of the time they are just floating around. Dont get me wrong. I like this game and I highly recomend it. But the game crashed on me while aiming on a croc.
