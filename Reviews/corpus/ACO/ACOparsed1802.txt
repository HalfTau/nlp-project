Like the Graghics their hot.. But Gamewise it really needs polishing.Think all  Armaments are too Large.The Game still stutters... all over the place.Now there are scenes that the whole screen starts Pixel boxing..Hope they fix that ..it really sucks when ya fighting or running.Do i recommend bying this game?No Honestly. Untill they fix all the Bugs.And what really pisses me off u have to start STEAM to Play,then  Uplay has to open up..So were helping steam and Uplay at the same time... Why ???Should not have to log on steam or anywhere else to play a SOLO game !!!!!!!!!There all in for the   the horemones.
