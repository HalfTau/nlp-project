Crashed once just loading a cutscene and Ive already encountered the annoying buzzing sound glitch everyone is talking about several times in just 15 minutes of gameplay. Aside from that I dont like the combat at all and the game kinda looks and feels like a cartoon, I feel like there was more improvement from AC1 to 2 than this series has had in the past 8 years. Had high hopes when I saw this was getting rave reviews aside from performance issues, but this game is definitely not for me. Might have given it more of a chance if it wasnt for the sound issues and time limit on steam refunds.
