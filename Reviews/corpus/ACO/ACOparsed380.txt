Lovley grafix and concept, but so poorly done anyone could put this game together... Guess thats just Ubisoft for ya. Standard Ubisoftall over the game, like huge glitches and bugs. the story is so unclear I dont even know if ive finished it EVEN though I had so sit there for like 10 years watching the credits.I wish I could recommend this game, because I love ancient Egypt and all that, but its REALLY NOT worth the cash plie it costs.Every time I played it, I was constantly thinking to my self this game cant be finished! its so unrefined it makes me sickfor a triple a title, this lets you down so badly, youll propably never get up again.Ubisoft. For real. Get yo god damn sheet together.and please stop with all your damn DLCs and Season Passes for Christ sake!
