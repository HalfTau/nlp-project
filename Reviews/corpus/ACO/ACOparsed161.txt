I simply cant get enough of this lovely game. This game has climbed my playtime list faster than light. I bought it on winter sale a month back around 26 december and i already got over 100 hours. Bayeks story is amazing and this huge game provides us with the whole ancient Egypt for our feet. Reccomended at the highest, As also the egyptian history fascinates me very much.
