This is one of the best ubisoft games Ive ever played. Yes it is a little buggy and there is drm protection. But once we get past that. This is a masterpiece. Here are the pros and cons from my perspective.Pros1. Egypt this set up for an assassins creed game is one of the greatest thing they did. Its not boring to just explore the map.2. Senu The eagle vision in this game is different. It is literally eagle vision. And its fun3. New combat the combat in origins is completely different from the combat in previous assassins creed games. Yes in the beginning it is confusing. But once i got the hang of, I started loving it.4. Sync points the sync towers that we needed to climb up to, to uncover the map does not exist. The sync points are just for fast travel in this game.5. RPG style skill tree Skill tree is more immersive.Cons1. Weapon changes there are abilities that can be purchased to carry 2 melee weapons and 2 bows. But when you switch between them during combat, the animation is wonky.Yep there it is. If youre a fan of the franchise, dont wait. Or else........ Maybe wait for sale.
