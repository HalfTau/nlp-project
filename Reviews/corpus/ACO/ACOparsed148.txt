I was at about 60 of what they said my computer could handle and I was having framerate issues. I had to set it way down. Also the combat system is pretty rough. It doesnt flow at all. Its very jumpy like dark souls if you jumped back instead of rolling. It really took me out of it. I uninstalled it and downloaded black flag again. I know the old system was too easy but it feels like im playing a completely different game. Not starting with assassinate makes it annoying and I miss eagle vision. Being able to identify enemies around you and having to send a bird into the air to tag enemies are very different things
