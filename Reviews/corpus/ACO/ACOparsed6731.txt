I am simply amazed by this game. I am a History Major from Northern Kentucky University and I want to say that this game hits alot of ancient egypt on the head. From starting in Upper Eygpt to going to lower Eygpt. This game is beautiful and amazing. Alot of time and love was poured into this game. The game play is really smooth and the crafting in this game is really awesome. I also love the hunting aspect of the game as well. This is a must have for any Assassins creed fan!!! BUY IT TODAY!!!! Also want to say that I am not a proponent of buying a game on the day of release but with this title, I am happy that I actually did!!!! o yea, MAP IS HUGE!!! !
