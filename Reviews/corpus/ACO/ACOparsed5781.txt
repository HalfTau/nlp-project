Game start off a bit confusing, but real fast you learn most of the gameplay. The story is not strict, so you can do it when you want. The side quest are very fun, and there are many diffrent things you can do to progress.Only bad thing, is that some times the sound bugs out. But its a minor thing, and nothing that will change the gameplay or experience.I recomend this to anyone who wants to play!
