I would say Assassins Creed Origins is one of the best of the series. The world is beautiful, that what you can expect from Assassins Creed team. New combat system is fun and challenging while the stealth system isnt removed. So you can play in your style hold your weapon then running through entrance, or stealthy crouch in a bush and kill each enemy silently. Hunting and crafting is somewhat fun and annoying. Fun part is hunting variety of animals. Annoying part is you need a lot of materials to upgrade equipment for attack damage, help, tools slot. Story is quite good, or I would say its better than I expected. Like its name, the game tell us an origin of the brotherhood.If youre a fan of this series, I think youll love this game too. Try it!
