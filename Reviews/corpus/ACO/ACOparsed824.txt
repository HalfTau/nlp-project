Ive been a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise since the very first one. Ive played and beaten all of them except for the mobile or handheld games. Yes, the franchise has had its ups and downs looking at you Unity... but it still remains one of my favorite IPs to play. This game was a huuuuge departure from the Assassins Creed formula, but it was a well developed one. For someone who has played these games for years, it was a breath of fresh air. The story was impactful, well written, and not overly convoluted like some of the earlier ones. I found myself imersed in the game world for every minute I played and it made me enjoy a time in history I didnt really know about or cared to know. The RPG elements are amazing and the combat is fast and fluid. Side missions and collectibles were vaired and addictive to hunt down and complete.The one downside is getting it to work on your PC. Its a beast to run, but if you can optimize and tweak the settings, it is worth it. The first couple hours I played, I put up with screen tears, stuttering framerates and down right hilariously frustrating lag and my PC is no joke, but I kept adjusting the settings and finding out what was causing the issues. Eventually, all was right and I was able to enjoy a solid installment in the Assassins Creed franchise. One that has cracked my top three games in the series and a game that I will not soon forget.
