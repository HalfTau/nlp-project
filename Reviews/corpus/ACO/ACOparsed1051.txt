Stunning game, the story is good, sustainable side mission make me want do more side mission instead main mission.I love with the new combat system rather than do parry dance that make you untouchedLike the other comments, you can pet catsJust a few legendary armors that you can obtain free / buy with coinsThere are many lands which is still empty. I hope ubisoft adding lots of quests and more places like The Witcher 3 didHOPEI cant imagine if you add multiplayer in this game xD Like beating the boss together, make your own camp so other players can raid each other.
