To avoid your CPU going to 100 you need 6 physical cores and above.Thats the only reason players experienced bad fps.4 physical cpus and below will do 100.And we cant do anything about it as long as Ubi patch them up.Still the game is good.Finished the main story line by lvl 34.and for goodness sake. The side quest is so many! and feels like it is part of the main story line.environment is awesome and beautiful.GOTY contender.wait im not a fanboy of AC series but this game is awesome that I can see it will get GOTYEdit 12 nov 2017best AC ever made IMO. performance from my mid end i7 6700k 1070 40fps60fps /limit to 6040 fps on busy area like kroko/memphis/alexandria.if you will compare it to AC II. that have the better story but a sequel like this is good and connected to the lore so it wont hurt you.and about the content. there is too much in this game that will give you tons of gameplay hours.Im lvl 38 with 80 hours  still not unlocked the half part of the map.
