Thanks to this game I upgraded my PC, so a price of this game is for me 500USD cumulatively . AND IT WAS A RIGHT DECISION, Im totaly satisfied. So thanks a lot UBISOFT again .I can say I was really surprised by graphics, rich  live world, options how to solve missions and  finaly a good story. A little bit more I expected from The End, because I played 60hours as Bayek and great final was just with Aya, but it was only one thing to complain regarding to story. And maybe not so many assassins around . All other were great and I know I will spend in this game many hours more . PS The first time when it is possible get STEAM achievement from Assassins game. PERFECT .This is one of my favorite games.
