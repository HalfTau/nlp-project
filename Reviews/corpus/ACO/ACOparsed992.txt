Good game. I like it, however the cpu usage runs very high.i5 4690kgtx 97016gbssdedit I am still very much dissapointed in the cpu usage in this game. I have many open world games and none run with this kind of fps instability not even witcher 3 nearly maxed. I cannot get over this and not being able to sustain a stable 60fps is taking away from the experience of what is otherwise an excellent open world game.
