That one year break was worth the wait. The game world is so rich with contents and so beautiful. Its a feast for every Assassins Creed Fan and no doubt that the Ubisoft team did a very hard work. The new combat system feels so satisfying after every boss battle. Some gamers and fans feel that the series is loosing its identity by moving into RPG style and more focused on combat and not on stealth. But NO, the game gives the freedom for the player to choose on which style they want to play the game. This  game is one of the best Assassins Creed Game.
