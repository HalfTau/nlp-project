Im 6 hours into this, and I wanted to write a review. I am not a big fan of solo player games, they for some reason dont hold my interest very long. I also hate the clunky combat usually assoiciated with this genre, EI, the witcher 3 great game, but IMO, very very clunky combat. I think they have done a great job minimizing the clunk feel of combat in this game, I would say it is a 85 improvement from other games, combat it way more fluid, and it is actually fun. There is a neat feature in the game where other players screenshots show up on your map, making the world feel occupied by other players, while not having to deal with other players. I was not hyped at all for this game, but our of shear boredom with the current games I am playing decided to give this franchise another shot, and truthfully, I am glad I did. I would recommend this game for sure, and I would recommend getting the package that includes the season pass if you can swing it I personally did not buy that package, as I wasnt sure I was going to like the game, but now I am going to buy the season pass for sure.The game looks amazing and runs great, although some of the cut scene interaction with  npcs looks like they couldve put a bit more polish on them. This may be the first game where the actual game play looks better than some of the cut scenes. Thats my only critique so far. Lots of loot to collect, crafting and upgrading is fun you can take lvl 1 items all the way to max level, which I think is great.
