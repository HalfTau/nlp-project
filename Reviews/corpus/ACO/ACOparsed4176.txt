Surprisingly good game, up there with AssCreed 2 in terms of quality and reviving the series. The game shamelessly rips off successful game design ideas from other games, and benefits from it immensely.AssCreed doesnt feel like a cakewalk any more, difficulty settings and a change of combat system means you can no longer take down an entire crowd of enemies by simply spamming counterattacks, multiple soldiers WILL take you down if you arent careful. Stealth is therefore a necessary survival mechanic rather than an optional selfrestriction.Writing seems solid so far, Bayek is neither a brooding edgelord like Shay I make my own luck Cormac or a onedimensional wiseguy like Ezio or that the MC from Unity who was only trying to get laid.Visuals are nice, colours are really vibrant and the different environments do feel different.Side activities dont feel contrived and repetitive at least so far. Sidequests make sense from a writing perspective, collectibles are more involved than simply find 100 feathers hidden around the city
