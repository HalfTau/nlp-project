A lot of people have been having crashes and other problems at the launch but having just completed the game it worked fine for me the entire time, maybe one or two glitches.The story is absolutely incredible, the RPG elements are just the right touch, and the revamped combat system is an improvement. The graphics are beautiful and the recreated world of Ancient Egypt is vast, detailed, and expansive.Conquer the unforgiving landscape and its predators, rob ancient tombs and caravans, and show off your skills in the chariot races and gladitorial games. But above all, write the creed that starts the Assassin Order and stay in the shadows...
