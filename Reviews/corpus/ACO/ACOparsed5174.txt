Just wow. Ive never really been an assassins creed fan I only really got into AC1, AC2, and black flag. I couldnt really get into the rest of them, but this game has my full attention. Its simply amazing the graphics, the rpg like atmosphere, and the side quests with there own little stories. I dont normally recommend games, but this game is a gem. GET IT!
