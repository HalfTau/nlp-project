This Game....This Game...ammm there isnt anything really wrong with it. its a good game the combat is good the overall gameplay and quests are good the story is mehh at most bayeks story is nice but laylas/current world is boring because you dont even spand 1 hour in it, it really is lacking. but while the gameplay is good it isnt really ground breaking i feel like its more a stepa huge one! in the right direction.
