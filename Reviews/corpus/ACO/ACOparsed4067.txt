1080 sc gtx 16gb ram 8core processor and a ssd. Now tell me why I cant get a consistent fps from a AAA game? I should be able to run this smooth on very highultra but even when I drop it down to low settings the fps is all over the place very inconsistent. My drivers are updated and Im not seeing that much cpu usage. Will change my review if I can ever figure this out.
