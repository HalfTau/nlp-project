Honestly I havent really played that much yet. But Im trying to figure what your peoples probblem is with microtransactions, dont buy them if you dont want them. Or are you just so autistic that you let basic cop. tricks get in your head. The game looks sick af, runs perfectly. Also what thedo you expect when you try to run a 2k17 game on your pathetic 1988 PC rigs. Rather than buying a game buy better parts, you idiots.As for the game the first hour was amazing, I didnt even notice it pas. And thats what Im looking for in a game!Solid 9/10
