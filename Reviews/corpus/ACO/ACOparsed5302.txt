AMD fx8350 4.2 ghzgtx 108016 gb ramIm getting 95100 cpu usage from having only this game running. forget about having chrome or spotify on in the background. I get 60 frames when out in the open world nad then drop to 40 in the city. Dont buy this game until ubisoft says they are fixing performance issues.the game though, if it does get performance fixes would be really nice. I like how its a real single player game like the older assassins creeds
