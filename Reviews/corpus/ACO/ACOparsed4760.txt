Review so sarI56600k oced 4.4GHzGTX 1070 FTW16GB RamDespite the high CPU issues this game has, I really hve to give Ubisoft some credit here. This game plays well, the mechanics feel solid, though I will admit, I wasnt too thrilled about the switch to the dark souls like fighting style, but it has grown on me so far. The further I get, the more unlocks I get, it starts feeling more polished. The climbing is a lot smoother than in previous games, and you can climb pretty much everything your little assassin heart desires. One thing I was scared of, was my fear of games getting far too repetitive. But this game does a good job of making side quests feel bigger, and not just some boring old fetch quest even though in reality they are. The game looks great, I wouldnt call it mind blowing or change the game graphics, but the details are amazing when you find yourself in tombs or in cities. Ubisoft has won me back so far with this game after falling out of love with the franchise after Black Flag. So far so good.
