This game is really interesting, has a lot to offer, and over all an exploding adventure!!!! I absolutely love every element given, espeically the choice of having a horse to ride, and even being able to gain animal companions. The new combat skills are really enticing as well. I especially love that you dont need to sneak everywhere in order to complete objectives, its a more hands on interaction and you can choose how to play! 100 reccomend!
