I dont generally enjoy rpgs, or like em enough to stick with em, but this one I have so far.   Its mix of beautiful graphics, well done scenes, interesting quests, mechanics give it that it factor that I am really enjoying.  im 42 hrs in and only lvl 37.  not sure if ill continue after 40 but its beey really enjoyable so farI really like that you can be super stealthy or be rambo.  the scenes of people talking look so amazing.  theres no annoying features like weapon degredation and they auto pathing and teleporting is super nice.  the skills mean something and are rewarding.its not all perfect but theres so much good it doesnt matter.i have also played previous AC games on PC and didnt stick with them, this is worth a try if you are at all curious.
