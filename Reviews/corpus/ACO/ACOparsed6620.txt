Well...to avoid spoilers I will not divulge any further. Those who are dedicated to this series will know when I say that this addition to the Assassins Creed franchise has brought about something new and refreshing to the name, It is the beginning of it all and the ending will have true Assassins Creed fans jumping off their seats. Despite what varied opinions have flown about in my truest opinion this game is on par with the likes of the Altair and Ezio saga. A giant leap in the right direction for Ubisoft. I felt like I had back in 2007 when I first got my hands on a copy of Assassins Creed and I must admit my love waned at the end of AC3. Now I find it has been reignited with Bayek and Aya. Thank you Ubisoft for this enticingly brilliant tale and the vast world you have bestowed upon us.Bayek and Aya Amunet, you are in our hearts among the greats. Were it not for your efforts our creed would not have lived on through those who followed. Altair ibn la Ahad, Ezio Auditore da Firenze and Desmond Miles, to name but a few, salute you. Requeiscat in pace,    alukhuat tahiat lak
