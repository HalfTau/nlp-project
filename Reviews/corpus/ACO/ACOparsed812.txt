This game is really great for those who enjoy vast openworld RPGs and not necessarily the AC franchise. It seems that the series took a turn from mere stealth focus to a more Witcherlike experience that focuses on building your character and much more diverse sidequests aside from the main storyline. Hadnt played the games since Black Flag and decided to gave Unity a try. It was really disappointing for many reasons so I kind of gave up on the series. Then I tried Origins about a month after it came out and it was definitely worth it. Really nice combat system that doesnt rely on counter attacks. You actually need to dodge. Great visuals A huge ing world to explore Plenty of sidequests, locations to complete Many customization options bows, swords, axes, spears, outfits, mounts etc. Storylines not too bad Cool soundtrackI thought it was a pretty cool game. Its not a must play or anything but it would be okay to buy it on sales if youre a fan of the older AC games. Im glad Ubisoft took their time and came up with something good this time.
