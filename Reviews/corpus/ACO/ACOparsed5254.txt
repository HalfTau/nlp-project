I cant recommend it yet. Its the first game that makes my computer shutdown from overheating. And I get, with similar graphical settings, constant 60fps in Destiny 2 and Witcher 3...Anyway, from what I read, its the multi layered DRM sinks your CPU.From what I played so far, it looks to be a fantastic game. I hope they patch it soon.
