Already one of my top favorite AC games. The Graphics are even better than I expected. On a GTX 1070, this game runs like a monster. The only issue I have had is the sound. The voices are not present in my cut scenes. This maybe my fault or maybe it is a bug of sorts. The Parkour is very similar to AC3 and AC4. The combat takes a bit to get use to. It is very similar to the Witcher 3. In any case, I am glued to this game!!! !
