I just got the news last night and wanted to test out my CPU....I can confurm that Origins is out of its mind by consuming 65 on average and went as high as 75 of my cpu power. I bought two games in the last 2 weeks, Origins and Destiny 2....the highest destiny 2  was at 8 5 on average. my cpu Intel i76850k  3.6GHz ......please fix this!!!
