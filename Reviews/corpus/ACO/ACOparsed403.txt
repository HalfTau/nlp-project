This game looks absolutely stunning! Having a rich environment to explore and many quests to complete that are sometimes a bit repetitive makes this game a joy to play. The combat system is different from the usual AC games, which take a little to get used to, but at the same time, it makes the fights feel more personal. The items system is OK, I would personally prefer more depth to it.The game is worth it if your goals in life include riding camels, sliding from the top of pyramids and seeing the Sphinx with a nose!
