This game is truly amazing.When I first heard that Ubisoft was taking a break, and having a longer development cycle on the next AC game, I knew it was good news. This game is a complete genre switch for AC, into a more complete RPG style game. Its absolutely the best in the series. In fact, if you havent played the other ones, dont bother. Play this one.
