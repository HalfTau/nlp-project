I bet the first thing you did when you pass that tutorial session is go to the Great Pyrimd of Giza and climb to the top get a eagle view in a jaw droping awe and slide down go into the prymid and expore and loot the goods like a curious kitten, I know you all, your all the same, as do I, even I know much about the ancient Egyptian lore I tell you I still cant resist the temptation of doing that.
