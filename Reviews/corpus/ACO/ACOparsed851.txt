With 50 hours into this game and the main story completed, I feel fairly confident posting a review. I have played the Assassins Creed games since brotherhood, and I have to say, this is one of the best ones. Ubisoft have completely reinvented the combat system, which although took some getting used to, I have to say... I like it. The graphics are stunning and although the story may not be Amazing, it is a good game. One of my problems was performance. I let Geforce experience adjust my graphics settings when I first entered, as I always do, but with this game I was getting 4530 fps in cities, rarely getting 60, only in deserts. After this I adjusted the settings as much as possible, but this was on medium, yes medium settings. This was disappointing, as I dont have a bad pc, I have a GTX 1060 6gb and a i56500, with 8 gb RAM. I looked at CPU usage and it was constantly being maxed out, with my graphics card only getting to around 70 percent. This should not happen, so I searched high and low for a solution, even messaging Ubiosft themselves, to no avail. I eventually told myself to stop focusing on performance so much and just enjoy the game.Although the fps drops and stutters did annoy me, I trudged through. I began to embrace the game for what it was, a good game. I did think that the performance issues were annoying, and I also believe that they could have maybe explored outside the animus a bit more, as it seemed a bit wasted. But overall, it was a good game.
