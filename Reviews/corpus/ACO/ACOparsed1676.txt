Good storyAMAZING graphicsTons on contenet atleast about 35 hours or more for story and than much more stuff to doOverall a great game and definitely worth buyingBut before you buy it make sure you can run it since this is one of the most demanding games ever, on my 7700k and 1080ti rig i only get about 6585 fps in cities like Alexandria and 100 fps in desert like areas on 1440p all ultra.
