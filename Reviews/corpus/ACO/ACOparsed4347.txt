Enjoyable game with an interesting story. That said Ive played this far 30 hours with a number of audio issues, such as missing footsteps and no dialogue in cutscenes. Were a week in and the lack of fix is extremely disapointing.Finally theres my main general complaint with Ubisoft games. This game is just another copy/paste job. Animations are the same as that from Far Cry and Ghost Recon, as is the UI and game mechanics.Did I enjoy? Yes. Would I have bought the game in hindsight? No.
