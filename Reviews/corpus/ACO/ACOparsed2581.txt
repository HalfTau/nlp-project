A good AC game, a good game, good performance. i7 4770  1060 3GB 5060 fpsReally interesting story, not a big challenge overall, enemies are pretty dumb but still funny to play, and it lasts.I just dont get the animus story, I started to play with AC II and the whole story could make sense, but In this game outside the animus theres a random girl that built the best animus machine in a cave and has to wake up randomly from Bayek memories just to bother you for like 50 seconds Doing annoying stuff like take pills or kill some guys that want to kill you and then you can go back to Bayek. I think they could remove the animus thing and no one would complain at all.
