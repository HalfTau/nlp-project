This is by far my favorite Assassins Creed game other than Black Flag  Ive played 21.3 Hrs and thats only touching 2 of the main quest lines.... There is plenty to do in this game! Great combat, looting and crafting system is awesome, some challanges when figuring out the best way to take on a mission or fort.I sat and waited to buy this game from all  the reviews i read about it using 100 CPU due to the DRM and Venuo or whatever its called. Until finally i was like screw it ill just try it for myself... and im glad i trusted my instinct.Now there are plenty reviews listed below that they have far better machines than mine. However my rig handles this game no problem  sure there are a few frame drops in town but this game is soooooo massive! Thats expected to happen, but i havent had any issues other than a few really weird crashes during a quest.my specs and i run on high/ very highCPU Ryzen 1400RAM 24GBsGPU Radeon RX480.If you are looking for a game to casually jump in do some quests, get some loot, and slice some peeps, I would recommend this game.
