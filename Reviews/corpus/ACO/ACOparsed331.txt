Played the game and completed all Steam Achievements for this. Ubisoft this time really created a gem  sidemissions have more depth than I initially expected, combat is enjoyable.Graphics are INSANELY good  last time I made so many screenshots was on Witcher 3.If you have enjoyed AC series so far then dont miss this one out.
