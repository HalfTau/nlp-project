This doesnt have the same feel as other assassins creed games. Dont get me wrong though, this game is hella fun but just not what I expected to see from the franchise. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone looking for the usual assassins creed experience, however, if you like games like The Witcher, Fable and other RPGs, this game is a must have. 7.5/10
