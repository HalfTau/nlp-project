This game looks good, graphics seems beautiful. But if you dont own an i7 , you wont be able to run this game. Youll get a 100 of cpu usage at ALL TIMES, even in the main menu when nothing is loaded. Also, the game never really use my GPU, it stays around 40 usage.So anything under an i7? Stay away from it. If you do have one however, go ahead give it a shot, you might be able to run it properly.
