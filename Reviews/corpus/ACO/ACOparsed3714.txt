Game is not finished. Game freezes randomly, followed by fps drops. Combat is unfinished, if you lock onto a target you lose vision around your character making it impossible to avoid attacks from any other side except the front. Parkour and Climbing dont feel as smoth as in previous games. Quests are dull and repetetive  feels more like an MMO than an RPG  The towns feel empty  npcs who are meant to form crowds of people walk around by themselves and follow a specific path, usually one after the other  Guards spot you instantly when you get within 30 or so meters of them without crouching i will update this review at some point
