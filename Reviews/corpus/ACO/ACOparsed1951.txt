Its a big beautiful game, one of the best if not THE best additions to the AC lineup.HoweverDRM, another move to try and stop piracy has our cpus breaking their necks with incredibly high utilization and fairly low gpu utilization.  7700k sees spikes to 80c under water, Prime 95 only gets it to 82c.  Thats a lame reason to see choppy fps and high temps Ubi. Cracks will be made eventually, youre just screwing the paying player by layering yet another DRM on top of the initial.  Plz stahp.Aside from that, I can still recommend it. Even at 100 cpu usage I rarely experience stuttering, and by limiting the fps youll notice a decent enough drop in utilization to be content with some nasty temps. Its huge, its very, very detailed, and it has a tinge of The Witcher 3.
