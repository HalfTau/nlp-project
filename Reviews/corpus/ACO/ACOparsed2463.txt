Loved the second game and then the third put me off and I stopped playing the franchsie. This might just pull me back in. Not perfect, but its a really fun game with some excellent moments. The combat is fun, the stealth is good, you feel like a badass without being overpowered. The only real negative is that they made Bayek get a haircut and lose his beard.
