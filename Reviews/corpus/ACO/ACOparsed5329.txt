After about an hour of messing with the games settings, I had to request a refund. I cant sustain even 30 fps, and the stutter is terrible. Seems to be a common issue. Im running a GTX 1060 gb and an i57600 and the CPU simply cant handle it. Its no slouch either, despite being an i5. Stay away from this game if you arent running a top of the line CPU.
