This game would be worth it alone for the visual tour de force it is.Im not easily impressed and my jaw have been hitting the floor again and again. Tons of unique locations, extremely detailed, believable world, completely and utterly immersive.Not sure but this could possibly be the largest singleplayer game made in recent time? Not only that but they manage to make so many memorable locations despite taking place only in Egypt.The game is extremely grindy, it just is, unless of course you want to open your wallet and buy the microtransactions.Just because of how massive, detailed and immersive the world is Im giving this game a recommendation, its just interesting world to hang out in, seeing what ancient Egypt couldve been like is really something you wont get to experience probably ever again.
