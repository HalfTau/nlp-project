This game is a really nice balance in my opinion between the old assassins creed and the new rpg element. and the story is pretty good. it is a generic assassins creed story but a good one, keeps it very intersting. If your a long time fan of this series i think you will enjoy it. miles better than unity. one thing i do not like is that again just like good ol goobisoft the game doesnt run well even for the low recemonded specs. Dont get me wrong it looks good for low/medium settings but well it could be better. FYI my specs are a i36100/gtx 950 ftw/8gb 2400 ram/sandisk ssd/h110m micro atx/500 wat evga psu.
