So Ive played around 8 hours so far and Im loving the game and I think thatI have a GTX 1070 and my cpu is an i77700k and I play the game absolutely fine with everything set to ultra. The game does not stutter, I have not crashed a single time and I havent even encountered any bugs yet like those negative reviewers claim to have witnessed.The story is really interesting, the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is challenging and fun.The things you do dont really feel like they serve no purpose everything you do feels rewarding.
