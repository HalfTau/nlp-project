So, when I bought this game I found several things interesting.1. Open world2. Loads of side quests3. Deplorable water4. Built with previous games suggestions from players to adhere to the favored playstyle.5. Good graphics Ive seen better, from cheaper games though with picky details.What I didnt like is how I over estimated Ubisoft s ability to continue the path that A.C., had dominated and lead ahead of many other games... if I wanted to play a game that nearly matched the gaming aspect of Far Cry, I would of simply gone and bought the newest far cry. Perhaps Im not far enough in the story line to where I get my own guild to send out assassins to murder and kill, and loot on missions to support the guild... maybe thats not in the game. For the time being I cant recommend the game, but if it sways my mind, I will change my review. I had hoped for more, from such an expensive game.
