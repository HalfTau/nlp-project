Too much of a grind. The AC games are dead if they continue down this path. aka grind fests just to get a higher level. This is no more an assassins game as Call of Duty is a third person stealth game. It is also poorly optimized. Runs at a solid 30 fps on medium preset on an overclocked GTX 1080. Waste of 59,99
