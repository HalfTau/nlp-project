The bestCreed since black flag.  My personal favorite due to the world building and character development of Bayek. Even after completing the story, this is the only AC that ive wanted to 100 complete.  Probably due to its RPG nature and MMO styple daily quests with loot.  Using money for loot crates with in game currency will get you legendary weapons and some of the helix store outfits if youre real lucky.In fact, i love this AC so much I bought the season pass. Ive never done that for a game let alone any AC game.  Its that good.
