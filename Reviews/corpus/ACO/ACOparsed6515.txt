This is an update after having spent around 70 hrs in game. As I had stated in my original first impressions review, the game is very similar to The Witcher 3. A LOT similar actually. The only thing different is the lack of fantasy material monsters, magic and the setting. So to make things easy, if you liked TW3, you will like this one too.Things I likedSkills. On this scale is a new treat for the AC franchise Syndicate had some too but not on this scale, and makes the game more detailed.Setting. Beautifully crafted ancient Egypt. I love that era of Egypt, so blended with AC makes it a huge plus.Underwater. Finally its here and it works well unlike the jaggy controls of Black Flag.Open world. It is vast and I mean VAST!Things I didnt likeCombat Too linear.Equipment. Too similar to one another and the huge variety makes it tiresome.Microtransactions. Why do they even bother putting those in?!? Why the hell do I have to pay 60 EUR for a game and then pay extra to get the fancy equipment with Helix points. Enough is enough. The game does well without these.If I remember anything else I will update.Of course I recommend the game as Im a huge fan of the series since the very first.
