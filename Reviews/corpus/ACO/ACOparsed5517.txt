Terrible performance, boring combat and the usual launch bugs. Feels more like a beta than a market ready game.Still no performance patch.Overall Steam reviews are dominated by PC gamers that feel 30FPS is acceptable on high end PCs. Meta Critic seems to be flooded with UBISOFTs own reviews. I can only imagain this is down to the mobile generation who dont know any better.Voted for in the Steam awards 2017 as Worst Console Port.
