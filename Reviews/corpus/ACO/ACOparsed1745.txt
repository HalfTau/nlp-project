.  This game is for people who are fans of the series who got tired of this series.  It is a MAJOR improvement from syndicate and only falters ONE time.  Because the way they improved it was good.  Game Mechanics, story, collectables were all good.  did all of the optional quests and cleared all the locations so they did an INCREDABLE job with this game.  its good that Ubisoft isnt making this a game a year production model.  I would have liked to have switched between Bayak and Aya, but read the spoilers on why this was needed for the game.The reason for my not so super score had to do with the last battle .
