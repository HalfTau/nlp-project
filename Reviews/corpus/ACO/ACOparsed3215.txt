Best AC game since Black Flag, with arguably even more to do. As with any AC game, repetition can and will set in if you aim to do everythng, but theres still enough variety and quality in the content here that youll have a good time with whatever amount of time you spend with the game. And as for quality, it seems that taking a year off of the franchise was worthwhile, since this was the only AC game with actual decent optimization Ive played, aside from Rogue. And compared to every previous AC game, this one is extremely polished. Aside from a handful of crashes, I only ever ran into a few very minor bugs in my time with the game. Worth noting that some have reported extremely high CPU load, potentially due to DRM, but I did not experience this issue in my nearly 90 hours playing the game, and I played it to near 100 completion. Like Black Flag, its a very different take on the AC franchise, so it may appeal to you even if you dont care for many of the previous games in the series. However, it still has a lot of what made the series popular to begin with as well.
