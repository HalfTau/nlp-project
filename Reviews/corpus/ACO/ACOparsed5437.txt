mandatory side quests and terrible combat. this game strayed too afar away from what i loved in assassins creed. mistrtransactions ruined the entire game as they were built into the system from the ground up. i just dont see where the extra year they took went. nobody wants 1v1 in assassins creed. what happened to the 12 on 1 epic fights and getting to use the hidden blade to fight? i just dont like the direction they went with this and sad to see microtransactions in a single player game for in game money that can be gotten with a cheat engine. 3/10 egypt tour simulator
