Consider this review in comparison to the other AC games. This is the worst of the series besides the first game, IMO. Very generic, none of the extra goodies, like glyph riddles, companions to call in, a compelling storyline, leonardos contraptions, pirateship warfare, or any good answers to the main, mysterious storyline, except telling that this is the origin of the creed. It completely consists of going from point A to B, block, parry, strike. repeat. It is a huge map/game, so unfortunately when the content is so generic, beinbg huge doesnt make it better, only more repetitive, and very boring. Disappointing that this is the return after two years. I will make sure to read many more reviews before buying another Assassins creed game.
