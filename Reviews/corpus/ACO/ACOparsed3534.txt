Assassins Creed Origins is an amazing game with beautiful graphics, great new combat system, giant open world with so many activities, looting/upgrading/different weapon types, and so much more that it really differs from so many other AC games. Origins is a huge step above Syndicate and delivers a massive world with many sidequests and lootable items and really relies on the player to take advantage of the area around them and adapt to it. The story is alright and the graphics are absolutely great in some many ways!More of an open world game with so much to do compared to a huge empty world of citizens and little activities like the other gamesLots of quests that arent that similarRanking system/Skill treesDifferent weapon types for different play stylesDifferent types of loots with different debuffs, with different levelsAbility to upgrade specific pieces of equipment health, melee damage, etc.Beautiful game overall, many locations are absolutely breathtakingPhoto modeNew combat system that is really fun and suits the current time periodHud is really good lookingTombsBayek can seamlessly climb on almost any surface even when it looks impossible to climb, making it less annoying to have to run around an entire building just to find the one way upA hopeful better start to the present timelineSomewhat hunting aspectReadded underwater exploration and naval warfareLots of attention to detailChariot racingGladiator fightingLots of Greek  Roman culture throughout the gameSeveral high level/tough enemies that add a great challenge throughout the mapDesert hallucinationsAble to fight the GodsSteam achievements!Reequpping hair/beard will be unequipt everytime you die or relaunch the game which is annoying afSeveral hidden button shortcuts to change looks/abilties that are never mentionedIf you finish Diocoles misson before ending the main story everytime you boot up the game again Bayek will say I wonder how Diocoles is doing?UplayUplay notifications are annoyingMicrostranstationsQuite the performance issuesYou can burn theout of/execute allies and they just walk it offHitbox issues with several enemiesFelt that the Ancient Civilization tombs just had really cryptic and odd meaning behind them and wish they were in the story moreOverall tombs werent that entertaining, would have wish they could of have made them like an hour long exploration that would be amazing the entire timeWish there were less side quests popping up near the end of the gameCertain allies will lie on the ground for awhile and wont get up for minutes regarding to questsOrigins is a much better game than Syndicate with a beautiful and vibrant, living open world game. The story is as what you would expect from an Assassins Creed but isnt overall that bad. Theres ton of sidequests and activities to due as well as a new leveling system and tons of different equipment to use. However there is a lot about this game that could have been slightly tweaked or altered to make better but overall the game is amazing and I think Ubisoft should take time to create more of their games like this instead of pooping one out every year. Quality of quantity.
