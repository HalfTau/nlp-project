I bought this game for a good story experience, not a grindy RPG. This game feels like work more than it does a good time. You are given the typical go here help this person shenanigans until you grind and waste enough time to deem yourself worthy of killing the next boss. So cliche, nothing new or exciting. A lot of the map buildings, objects etc. and pathing for the camel and villagers seemed very unpolished. It looks as if someone with next to no experience just threw some objects here and there, the villages didnt feel immersive at all. The only good thing this game has going for it is the animations, but you dont need to buy the game to view those, just watch them on youtube and save your money.
