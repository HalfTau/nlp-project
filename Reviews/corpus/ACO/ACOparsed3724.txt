This is a good game. This is the first AC game I thoroughly enjoyed since AC black flag. Of course there are lots of rough edges, glitches, frame drops, story bits that makes no sense, voice acting that is plainly bad. But there are also moments of genuine excitement after getting through some of the frustratingly difficult fights on Hard and the feel of actual connections to characters that were wellwritten. Bottom line, this is a worthwhile game.
