I had major apprehensions about Origins. I hadnt played a game in the AC series for a number of years, despite loving the earlier entries. But it seems that my fears were simply not necessary. Origins is a wonderfully crafted experience, brimming with culture, vision and clever design choices. Ubisoft realised that a map full of dumb markers means nothing without a land you actually want to explore, to see yourself, and just play around with. Sure, the game is a little too big, at the time of writing Im almost 35 hours into a game that I cant see ending before I see the hit 60 hour point...Couple of bad points Combat against low level enemies becomes hilariously simple. This game is CRUSHING on CPU usage. A quad core is the bare minimum to play this, bring all your threads.Oh, and you have to deal with the atrocity that is uPlay, but its worth it. For real though, shut down when I close the game. What are you doing?
