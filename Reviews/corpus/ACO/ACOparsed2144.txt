Very good game, I havent gotten the recent assassins creeds since black flag and I honestly think this could be a saving grace for the Assassins Creed series. Its got older themes, a great story, a likable main character, and very great atmostpheric world to explore. Some say the RPG elements they implemented kind of strayed from the assassins creed general concept, which sometimes comes apparent when there are high level enemies you cant kill yet, but you can also try to level up to get to the point you CAN kill them easier, or drag out a fight and kill them with skill and precise dodging and attacking. The dodge mechanic isnt as forgiving as say the dodge from Dark Souls, but other than that the combat mechanics and overpower abilities are fun and easy to get used to. I believe that this is a great assassins creed game at its core and the way you can get more abilities and just that there is more to the world with the tombs and loot spots makes it enjoyable when you get bored of either story or side missions.I give this a 8.5/10 for possible bugs and some things that kind of take you out of the story, for example, there are many missions where there are incapacitated allies or rescue targets where you have to carry them out of a camp, and then when you set them on the ground it obviously prompts the cutscene of the oh thanks you saved me but instead of them sitting there catching their breath or tending their wound they get up like nothing happened. But thats just a small gripe that I had with the game and I did find some glitches but they were mostly happenstance.
