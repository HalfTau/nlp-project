Ive played every other AC game and this one feels special. The combat system is fluid and amazing, the map is bonkers huge, and unlike previous titles where the gameworld exists but doesnt really have a purpose, NPC caravans with supplies and animals to hunt fill up the vast majority of it. Its a fluid and fun experience and its the first time in YEARS where Im excited to see where Ubisoft will take us all to next.
