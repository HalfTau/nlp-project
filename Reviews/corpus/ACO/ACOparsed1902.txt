should be called Assassins Creed Loading Screen simulator.Dear Ubisoft 1 The game is refunded so your reply means nothing. and 2 I was able to launch the game and play it. it was in the game that i was faced with around 15 seconds of loading in order to enjoy 3 seconds of playing time. for clarifacation it would do 15 seconds of loading every 3 seconds. So your reply make even less sence nor does it save you a customer.P.S. maybe the issue is with the games Denuvo DRM and VMProtect DRM not working in sync corectly. but that cant be the issue after all you spent millions of dollars on Denuvo so clearly that cant be the issue.
