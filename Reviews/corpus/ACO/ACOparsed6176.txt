BE WARNED, AFTER THE END OF CHAPTER 2 THE GAMES MAIN STORY IS BASICALLY OVER. Chapter 3 is just 3 laughingly easy boss fights.I am redoing my review now that I am almost finished with the game. The game isnt as bad as I mentioned in my original review. It is an O.K. game, however, it is fairly clear that this game is unfinished. The main story has so many plot holes, such as, a part where your are searching for the killer of a little girl when in the next mission you have a description of two people involved when that description was never revealed to you. Also, when you find out who the main target is, your character and his wife say, we trusted him, but this character was never in the story and we never even seen his face before that moment. Side quests also lack cut scenes so no emotion is conveyed to the player and you wont really care about the task or NPCs your helping. Basically it feels like your just doing things for no reason. The game could have been a great game but we were given this unfinished product. It is WORTH BUYING ON SALE, BUT NOT AT FULL PRICE, I should have waited.
