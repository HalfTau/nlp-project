Assassins Creed Origins is a fun and significantly different in a good way game from its predecessors, but Ubisofts implementation of antipiracy measures is causing my pc which has a gtx 1080 and an i5 7600k with 16gb of RAM to struggle in running Assassins Creed Origins at a consistent 1080p 60fps on ultra high settings.On ultra high settings, in towns, during the daytime, I can range anywhere from 30fps to 60fps, but at night I get a steady 60fps. This is an annoyance for those, like myself, who prefer to game at a consistent framerate.If it wasnt for the implementation of antipiracy technology, I wouldve easily recommended this game, but, in its current state, I can not.
