As a long time fan of Assassins Creed I can say they are back, The franchise I always loved is back. They did an EXCELENT job once more. Its funny why I am enjoying the game too much. The things main thing I always comlained previous installments did not have Black Flag to Syndicate, Origins lack it as well lack of present time history so far in ACO. I always depicted games without Desmond as just a try to show an ancient civilization and fights assasinations. Do not get me wrong, they did make a great job in that most of the times, but I felt like they were ONLY giving me that, and that is not why I falled in love with the franchise in the first place. What are they doing with Origins? Showing an ancient civilization and giving action, BUT OH GOD THEY ARE DOING IT RIGHT!! I can only say I am enjoying this game so much. And the Bayek history is amazing so far, they are doing everything right. Ubisoft, you made me fall in love with Assasins Creed again. Take gaps more often, please.
