At first I was hesitant to purchase the game because I was worried it would run as poorly as all of the reviews described, but after a driver update I found it run crystal smooth at absolute max settings. That beings said, I have a GTX 1080 8gb gpu, i77700k cpu, and 16gb of ram, so this may not be the case for everyone.As for the game itself, I have no idea why anyone would expect anything different than exactly what it is. It it introduces new aspects to the Assassins Creed series but keeps the general feel that you would expect to retain. The map is definitely refreshing, the buildings dont seem so easy to climb and the combat seems slightly more involved than past games in the series.
