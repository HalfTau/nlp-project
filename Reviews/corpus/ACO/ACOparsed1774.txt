Well, I was going to give this game an overwhelmingly positive recommendation until the latest update which was released today. The game already had one major shortcoming  its graphical performance. And the latest update has multiplied that problem tenfold. Using a rig that can run most games at high or ultra settings, I have only been able to run this game at medium/high on most sliders. I am about 95 complete with the game...logged on today to tidy up the remainder, and my game wont run at anything higher than 25 FPS.Yeah, so I am assuming that a fix will come out for that, but due to its unfortunate timing, I have to go with a thumbs down on this one until Ubisoft gets the kinks worked out.Quick final note  pretty much everything else about the game is awesome. Could probably use a few more unique assassination animations to spice things up every now and again, and maybe a few more tools, but the world is incredible and the story is pretty decent as well.
