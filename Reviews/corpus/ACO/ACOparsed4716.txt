Disclaimer I was not a fan of previous AC games, I didnt hate them but was on the fence every time I played. I have never been drawn to the series. I decided to give ACO a chance as I liked that it now includes loot based itemization and levelling.ACO features a lot to do, but with a poor control/combat system and a boring story so far as I have played it. I dont believe Ill put much more time into this game and if I do, I may end up changing my review.I would say that if you havent been a fan of the AC series so far, dont bother with this one.Pros Good graphics typical Ubisoft graphics Beautiful surroundings, great atmosphere Ton of quests/things to doCons Clunky controls, tried both Xbox controller and M/KB. Both are clunky and have their own drawbacks. Combat. I am a fan of Dark Souls combat, Witcher 3 combat I can stand. The combat in ACO is a mish mash of both, but fails to do either well. Terrible and/or annoying AI. Ive run face first into enemies before without even triggering them to see me. Enemies will chase you forever on horseback and are frustrating to take down as theyll run away shooting you with arrows. On the flip side, if you just kite enemies forever it feels like you can never die as health regenerates in combat, which leads to long drawn out, boring fights. Boring story that goes nowhere fast. Just seems insulting to be asked to play hide and seek with kids. Poor frames, running on 980ti, i77700k, 32gb DDR4 ram, m2 ssd Overwhelming amount of quests at some points that usually cause me to shut off the game.
