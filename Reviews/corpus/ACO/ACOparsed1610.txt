I have been really enjoying this game so far! Ptolemaic Egypt is a good setting for the return of the Assassins Creed series!! I havent gotten all that far in the story  most of my time has been spent exploring, hunting, climbing things, and doing side quests. I havent had any major problems a couple of frame drops, but nothing that makes me want to rage quit! The level system is fine with me... but I do have to question why the Hidden Blade is so ineffective against higher level enemies. A knife to the throat IS STILL a knife to the throat!? !
