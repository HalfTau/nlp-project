This one surprised me, but the suprise is quite welcome. This is the first Assassins Creed Ive thoroughly enjoyed since the original they definitely upped their game on this one. good story, absolutely gorgeous world, and combat that doesnt make you want to pull your hair out. Still a little buggy though, but otherwise an incredible edition to a series that had felt like it might be petering out in quality.
