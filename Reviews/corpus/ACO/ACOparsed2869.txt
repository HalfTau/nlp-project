If you are thinking on get this game, just wait.The game looks and feel very nice, nice setting, nice work, however, the engine or the greedy developers just rushed to release a very very bad port on PC.Tried on 2 systems7700K / 8700K 5ghz 16gb ram 3400 mhz 1080 SLIThe game usually run amok and one or two of your cores will go 100, other will top around 9095.It wasnt a streamlined exprerience, but it was doable. Sli support is absent, and if you dont explicity disable your 2 gpu it makes the game worse.Now patch 1.05 was the final insult to me. Stuttering all over.About performance, no matter what you do, i tried to lowering the graphics to very low and resolution to 768p and still the engine cant break 100fps, clearly showing its probably very bugged or limited by Ubisoft DRM VM that encapsulate the game. Seriously, when you go to this kind of action to stop piracy, making an otherwise probably nice product into a crap, there is nothing more to say. Ubisoft should completely drop off releasing titles on PC if they cant trust us or simply dont care enough to release such poor pathetic excuse of a game.Unity was another horrible port, but was fixed very fast. With AC Origins, i cant even see SLI working, and at 1440p or 4K its a must for a decent experience.
