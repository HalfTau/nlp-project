I wanted to play Assassins Creed and be able to use my hidden blade and assassinate targets.Instead I am doing choirs for people find this person, grab this scroll, break someone out of jailI should be able to Assassinate someone not be flipped around like a rag doll becasue of a level wall.Am I suppose to just keep grinding for some dopamine rush.Serously though their are 10! levels of crafting the hidden blade the amount of iron and bronze that needs to be crafted to maxout the hidden blade is beyond ridiculous.Theres another huge aspect in this game that Im not noticing in reviews aswell and that is the presence of P2W.They have what they call helliox points where you can spend real money just to progress faster. It feels weird to have this in an Assassins Creed game. Im guesing Ubisoft purposely made it a grinding type of game and now they join a choir of AAA game publishers trying to milk whales.Ubisoft might aswell adopted the banner of pride and accomplishment like another publisher.
