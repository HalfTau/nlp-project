So i was waiting for a patch that could fix my audio problems. And it arrived with something better the ability to pet kittens. Thoroughly satisfied. Who needs sound, anyway? The Obsidian special.Also maces are trash against quick enemies in hardest difficulty like the reskinned doggos from the witcher 3 they will tear you a new one. I give it a Mummies Alive! The Game/10.
