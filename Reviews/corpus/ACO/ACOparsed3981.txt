This game takes cues from The Witcher 3, and Horizon Zero Dawn and combines them with the AC universe to deliver what is actually a really really good RPG. While there are plenty of side quests to stumble upon, you arent worn down by them because they themselves can lead to the bigger picture and drop you back on the trail of a target you were getting around to completing anyway. A definite must for any RPG fan, even if you bounced off previous AC titles like I did.
