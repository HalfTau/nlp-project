First impressions reviewProsRuns perfectly, getting solid 60 fps at all times on high settingsCombat and movement is smoother than everThe new combat system makes the older AC games look like a jokeThe game is actually slightly challenging for onceGraphics are beautiful like actually incredibleAnimations are extremely smooth and well doneProtagonist looks coolHavent come across any bugs or glitches yetActionRPG elements are very welcomeAdding an actual eagle to scout out areas is definitely better than the previous eagle visionController support even for PS4 controllerGreat attention to detail Blood washing off in water, arrows jiggling in quiver etc.Photo ModeConsI have no clue whats going on in the storyProtagonist seems boring personalitywiseStory seems to be generic ubisoft avenge dead family garbageMinor fps drops in very crowded areas Fixed as of patch 1.03Weird static audio at launch sometimes, resulting in having to restart the game started happening after 1.03Played on EVGA GTX 1070 SC, i5 6600k 4.5ghz, 16gb RAM
