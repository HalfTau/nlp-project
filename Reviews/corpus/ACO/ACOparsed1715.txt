Some Pros and ConsPros Great great storyline Lots of eastereggs The attention to details is amazing The way the story managed to take me back to the same thrills of playing the original AC is just perfect The amount of choice option you have is enormous, not just in how to approach to the mission way but also in the gear and how will I look and which weapons Ill use way which was a HUGE plus for me  The game made me want to complete it all, for example after I finished the main story in GTA 5 there is not much to do in the game.. kinda all you can do is either download mods and mess around or just make a huge mess by killing everyone, which can be nice but gets old pretty quick. Not in this game, here after finishing the main story you have lots of wrok to actually complete the game for instance uncover the whole map, or sychronizing all the watch towers.Cons If your PC is not strong enough you simply cant run the game on high settings I have a not so cheap setting and my game crushed once and couldnt pass 35 fps in cities though looking on the sky made it run in 100 fps D I suppose for some people the idea of doing side missions to get to the minimum level to start your main quest may be disturbing , for me it felt right, the idea of You need to get better to win more easilyOVERALL score 9/10 , if it hadnt made my pc work so hard to run the game on high quality I would have gave it a 10/10
