I love this game. I really do  the story is immersive, Ubisofts rendering of ancient Egypt is beautiful, the RPG aspect brings fresh life to the series, and the Trials of the Gods and the missions where you avenge fallen players make the game really fun to play... if you could play it at at least 60 FPS.I have a GTX 1080 Ti, an i73770K overclocked to 4.5 GHz, and 16 GB of RAM, yet Im lucky if I can achieve an average of 42 FPS.Seriously? 42?!? ?Cmon Ubisoft, what gives! When I first heard Origins was coming, I went out and bought a 550 4K TV, my 1080 Ti, and preordered the Gold Edition of Origins for 100... After spending that much money, I would at least hope I could achieve 60 FPS at 1080p. Yet here we are. My 3770K is maxed out on all four cores, bottlenecking my GPU and causing horrible stuttering, especialy during combat.Ive read that the games DRM protection is the culprit here, making the game a mess for anyone who isnt running on 8 cores. That, or this game is just poorly optimized. Right now, my only choices are to continue playing with the game in its current state Ew!, get a refund from Ubisoft and put my money elsewhere Meaning I have effectively wasted 90 hours of my life, or go out and spend about 600800 on an 8 core CPU, a new motherboard, and at least 16GB of DDR4 RAM.Please, just fix the damn game!
