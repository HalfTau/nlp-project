First of all i need to say that the game is amazing i love every change made since the older assassins creed titles the graphics are baeutiful and deep teh game play is really nice but this all suffers at the hand of the FPS i have a Strix r9 390x and i do get this is a cpu intensive game but my cpu is up to par and shouldnt face so many issues my frames drop to 2 and then back to 70 ven on low this is the case this is even the result on ultra i dont get it is this because of my gpu since its not Nvidia????? here is hoping i get some way to fix it or that they roll out a update and fix the issues since i have seen other face the same issues if not an amazing game expereince will be lost to something like this
