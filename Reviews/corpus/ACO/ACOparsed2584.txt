We are Medjay No More.... We are ASSASSINS! !Assassins Creed Origins decided to take the AC Series to some height in the hopes of rebuilding the charisma of the franchise and fortunately, it took the series to an height youd ever expect to see it scale after we saw what happened to AC Unity and maybe Syndicate too in a way. AC Origins has brought out the best you could ever get from AC. From the classic horses to the ship battles, we are taken to ancient EGYPT and with all the elements that the devs have decided to put in, I can say everything has worked out pretty cool and indeed, AC Origins has emerged as one of the Best of the series after the Ezio Trilogy.The Game is pretty well optimized and there are no gliches or bugs of any kind as per my knowledge and experience.. The game never ceases to amaze us with its features and given that the enemies are less forgiving, it means they ARE FREAKING STRONG! The game mainly emphasizes on the player taking up the side quests before attempting the main story in order to level up, gain new abilities and weapons of all sorts before facing the main baddies. But, the side quests dont, in any way, make the gameplay cringeworthy, all seem connected in some way or the other and all are quite unique. Story is amazing! Avoiding spoilers here, so do check out the game.Vittoria Agili Assassini! !
