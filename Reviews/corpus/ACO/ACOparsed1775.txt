RX 480 4gb, i5 3570s cpu, 16gb ram and i still cant get it to run at a decent nor steady FPS. The game in its current version 1.1.0 still has performance issues. I tried all settings and i found the low settings to be the most stable of them all. But what would be the point of playing it on low? and i feel it shouldnt be like this. Therefore, i ended up getting a refund. DO NOT BUY ! AT ITS CURRENT VERSION. WAIT SOME TIME TO SEE IF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED  TRY TO CATCH IT AT A DEEP SALE.
