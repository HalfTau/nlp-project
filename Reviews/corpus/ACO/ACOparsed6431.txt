The only reason Im rating this negative is due to technical issues. This looks like an awesome game, however I am running into what many other people have been experiencing Poor PC optimization/performance, and some terrible audio quality. I ended up refunding the game for now, however once the optimization and audio bugs are fixed, I will most likely be purchasing this game again.
