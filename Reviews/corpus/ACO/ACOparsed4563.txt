Man Ubisoft, stop stealing our money and for once fix ur games! It feels like this game is still in beta. God, after 52 hours into the game im stuck in a bugged mision i cant get out of it nor complete it. Man this is fustrating, i much as i enjoyed the game this bugged just killed it for me. The mission is to defend Caesar, go fix the danm mission i cant play the game cause i cant get rid of the mission.
