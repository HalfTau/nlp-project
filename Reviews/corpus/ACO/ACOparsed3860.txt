This Review is a breif description of my enjoyment i had with this game nothing todo with anything else.When i started playing this game i didnt really understand why i was doing what i was. It took about an hour till there was a mission that explained everything and why im on this long quest. About 15 hours in to the game i really started to like it and enjoyed every second that i played, i felt like i was fighting towards a noble cause. When i got to the last quest i was so exited to see how everything tied into the AC universe and why we have never heard of these charcters before. At the final cut scene i went from quite enjoying this game to loving it, Ash and his team have done a fantastic job.
