One of the better AC games Ive played. It takes about an hour or two to get settled into the game world, but it opens up and becomes really fun to explore. This game offers a ton of loot in the way of microtransactions and some of the costume packs are really nice looking. None of it is required to have a great experience and I would argue that the legenadry weapons make the game too easy with how OP they are.One thing to consider is that this game can become repetitive, so I reccomend playing it at a slower pace. An hour or two at time was my sweet spot. If I played for longer than that in one session then it became stale. I found it way more fun to clear a zone by doing all the side quests and finding the hidden treasures before attempting to advance the campaign. Just a suggestion, though.
