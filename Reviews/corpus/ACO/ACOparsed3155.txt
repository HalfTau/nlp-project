this is the first time they dare to change new things with their preciousACseries with high risk so i give it a tryfinally .... they have a looting system in AC game, althought i still want to see more legendary weapons with unique skills explore very big map kinda like farcry with a lot point of interest appear as ?  and the most interesting is  they show you the great Atmosphere  architecture of accient Egypt ..... seriously when the last time you play any 3D game  related about accient Egypt ?!   well..  this is your time some peoples can feel  Repetitive with combat system ....... but when you  level 40  need to use your trick  stealbowheadshot or tool skills  to deal with enemies high 3 level than you are really fun   intense too cause they can easy kill uso  the process of explore the big map will worth the money especially u have time soundtrack background not epic  emotionnal enough ...    but musicenvironment in game is fit  with  the accient era
