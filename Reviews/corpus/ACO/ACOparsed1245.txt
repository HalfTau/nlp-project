Let me start off by addressing the characters, you play as Bayek of Siwa and at some point in the story you play as his wife , Aya , you also get to meet with Cleopatra and a lot of other people during side missions.The RPG system for AC is a great function that they added to the franchise and it definately sets it apart from the other AC games just because of the RPG and leveling sytem it has.There are a lot of community events that allow you to progress your character even further, by unlocking skins etc.The skill tree has a wide variety of skills to choose fromPros  Great graphics , Great story , the protagonist is a very lovable character , Great gameplay mechanics , lots of skills to choose from in the skilltree and the skins are just amazing.cons TBH I didnt really see anything bad about this game xDI would highly recommend this game to people who have loved the AC franchise up until now, and even to people who havent played any AC games yet.
