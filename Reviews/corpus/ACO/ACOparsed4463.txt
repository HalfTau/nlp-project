Combat is way to clunky on PC to be enjoyable. Especially when you make a game almost 70 about combat. Way to hard and complicated to switch inbetween targets and your targets will very oftenly move around you and just annoy you. If the combat would have been in a batman Arkham style or Shadow Of War What I bought with the refund money then I would reccomend this game whole heartedly. But for now, combat is way to hard to use. This wouldnt be a big turn off if the combat wasnt such a god damn big part of the game
