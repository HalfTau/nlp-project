Looks amazing, feels amazing to play it, there are lots of different activities and sidequests, and we can be real timetravellers again after a very very long time.For the first playtrough I didnt enjoy the main storyline. Hoping that this is just because there were so many characters and I may have not always followed who is who, and also because of the first god Anubis I started to rush for XP to be able to kill him, I decided to start a second playtrough in hard mode, but again during the second playtrough the main storyline wasnt for me that much enjoyable. The sea battle for me was very boring, every time I wished to get over it ASAP in Black Flag I loved it very much, here it was more like a torture and the main storyline has severel sea battles. There were things I couldnt logically follow, for example why can I enter the very last ISU temple after I am done with the stargazing locations? It would be logical, that the activation of all other ISU temples will open the path to the very final ISU temple.The attempt to create a bond between AC Origins and AC II was nice. I loved to see explained the origins of a few Assassin customs finger branding etc., but very confusing why Amunets mumy was in AC Origins in the desert, and in AC II her shrine with a mummy in Basilica di San Marco in Venice, Italy.I dont think I count as a very good player, but even in hard mode killing the strongest war elephant needed ca. 9 attempts, I missed the real challenge. The gods Anubis and Sobek did I encounter till this review are compared to the war elephants very easy to kill.Even so it is a great game, will play it again in the next years, but wont love it so much as AC II or AC Black Flag I need to mention here Far Cry Primal, that was the very last Ubisoft game which was extremly great, would play it for the 14th time again. It was more like an AC game than a Far Cry game, it has a great timetravel feeling, great and simple story, clear purpose, lots of feelings, beautiful enverionment, creates real addiction.All sidequest are very enjoyable, loved them much more than the main story and luckily there are lots of them  Furthermore this game really gives the player the real open world feeling, beeing able to climb basically anything, remembers me of my first open world game Gothic 3.
