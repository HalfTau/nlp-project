Optimization? Never heard of that. What is it?Ok, jokes aside.. There is no optimization. Running this on Intel core I77700HQ and GTX 1070. On Ultra High, the FPS never goes above 30 and on Very Low, FPS never goes above 40.Ubisoft is notorious for a lack of optimization in their PC games and this one is definitely one of their worst. It seems Ubisoft never learns.The graphics are amazing and the combat is good. Its a fresh break away from the usual formula of Assassins Creed.However, I cannot recommend this game until Ubisoft properly optimize the game.
