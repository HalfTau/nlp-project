I have been playing this game for 25 hours and loving it. There is a lot of bad reviews related to performance issues but I have no idea what they are this game runs perfectly on my system in 4k, no less. This is the game I always wanted Assassins Creed to be. It is truly a mix between Assassins Creed and Witcher 3, but in a good way. And it looks absolutely amazing.
