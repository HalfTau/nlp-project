When i heard that ac was taking a year of i got kind of sad because i love ac. Black flag was my first ac and i love it i dont like 2. I bought this game on black friday 2017 and its worth it. Its beatiful to look at and very fun to explore. The combat is good and the stealth is good to. The bows are finally back and the air shoot is soooo satisfying. The hunting is sadly watered down. You can get soft and hard leather and one type of hide. The best hunting was ac 3, 4 and rouge. Overall it feels like a combo of the witcher 3 and ac. The tombs are awesome and you should use the photo mode. The story is good so far but combat vs higher level guys can be frustrating and the game can be xp grindy but not to much. The modern day is old school and interesting. It can give you some info on carachters and stuff. Id give it 8 or 9 right now.
