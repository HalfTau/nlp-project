I bought the Deluxe edition for 60. Id have thought for such a big price itd include everything. NOPE! Another 40 if you want all the gear. Whats that? Future DLC? ANOTHER 35 for a season pass. In the older games you could acquire maps for hidden items/secret areas etc... Now you have to pay real money for them on top of everything else. so youre looking at spending well over 130 if you want the whole game.I cant recommend a game where the producers show such disregard to their customers. They are clearly just seeing how much more money they can squeeze out from you after having already charged an above average price for the game.Gameplay wise its ok. Nothing special, story line seems like it has potential, The combat controls took a bit of getting used to, but they work well. Ive had a load of technical issues, mainly screen tearing and bugs. Ive had to restart the game 3 times now because of the bugs in it.If this goes on sale in the future and you can get everything in one bundle for under 30 Id say go for it. As it is now, stay clear, Its not a complete game youre buying for 60.
