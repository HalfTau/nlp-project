So ever since I played The Witcher series most games became boring and bland. Not many games could even be compared to The Witcher 3 because of how much there really was in that game. But when I play ACO I feel that need to advernture again. With how large the map is and having interesting side quest I find my self straying away from the main quest more and more. Yes, there are parts of this game that dont meet the expectation I had, but a majority of this game does. The only part in this game that I can even consider bad is the start. Only because I didnt understand why I was trying to hunt the Snake, but once you figure that out the game smoothly pulls you into the story.One really amazing thing about this game is the side quest. If you dont do many side quest and focus mainly on the main story you can miss so many unique characters. I found myself liking some side characters more then main ones most the time. Also throughout my playthrough so far I have been overleveled by 23 levels at a time.This game isnt perfect obviously and nowhere near, but if you are a fan of AC or The Witcher 3 I strongly recommend this game to you. The game is by far the best AC to date with how much content there is and the game can bring back The Witcher 3 feeling some of you might miss. This game is also not as good as TW3 but it is very similar in ways that is why I compare the two so much/PROSRefreshing combat that is exciting and difficult.Great Character design and plot.The world looks amazing.Picture mode is fun to use.the new freerunning is strange at first but very smooth once you get used to it.YOU GET A CAMEL!New eagle vision and loot system that refreshes gameplay.You dont have to go to sync towersBut you shouldThe game overall isnt too easy like all previous AC gamesCombat,Missions,MoneyYou actually have to craft to become stronger like in the witcher 3 unlike most games with crafting were it is mostly optional.Hunting is fun too.DONT HAVE TO HUNT FOR DUMB COLLECTABLES ANYMORE./CONSSome weapons are way better then others        UnbalencedLacks quite a few RPG elements For example controlling dialogue and companions.Stealth was downgraded a littleCant Hide in crowds anymoreIf you are someone who hasnt played Assassins Creed in a long while. This is the AC that will bring you back.
