An AC game that plays more like an RPG with a massive incredibly detailed world and a revamped, for the better, combat and movement system. Its AC refined into culmination of all thats been good about past AC games for the player to enjoy.. Microtransactions exist but they arent pushed upon you and are there as more of a time saver to help level you up faster.. But you dont have to use them. There is enough good story telling and writing/quest design to keep you interested and busy during The grind... At lauch its plagued with audio bugs and performance issues where it doesnt seem reasonable for them to be with a slightly odd use of modern language in a story set so many years ago that might take some people out of the immersion.. But its fun, kinda fresh, with interesting story and well developed main characters with a very beautiful and detailed world to experience.
