I just finished the last Main story quest, so i feel its time I finally made a review on this game. Please note this is my first realreviewPROSThe game is really fun, I really enjoyed the rpg style compared to the classic AC Styel. The story is great! a lot better than the previouse AC Games. Mechanics are ok, at fist combat was a little wonky but you get used to it.The amount of quest and side activities is insane! I spent hours doing these.I love the amount of gear you can get, really appreciate that customabilty was a thing in this game.The game enviorment looks great on PC, the colors on buildings really make the game less bland since it takes place in a desert.The movement is pretty smooth. I love the classis parkour style of AC instead of all the useless gear they implanted in other games.Bayek is a lovable charcter and I really attached to him. I really think this is important for rpg games.Again, the STORY was so rich and charcter development for Bayek was done well.CONSMost of the time i felt that being sneaky was a bit boring. But that could just be meCombat is fun, but when on main roads you just get constant enemies spawining in.Getting the materials to craft gear was a huge pain, mostly because most of the materials are held by enemies.The AI look really bland an boring, almost life less the enviorment makes up for thisThe infamouse texture glitches  not as bad as other AC Games.The MEHVoice acting for AI was OK, cant really complain, for main Characters I thought it was pretty good.Although there are a lot of side quest, some of them do get repetitive, Escort this, steal that..I wish there was more variety.With this said I think AC Origins is one of the best AC games and for sure better than the previouse 3. I do hope you fons this review helpful and I also hope you give this game a chance.
