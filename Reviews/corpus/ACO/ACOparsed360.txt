First of all, this game is incredible.Ubisoft have made a game more similar to The Witcher but still holding its own.The history is amazing and the landscape is breathtaking.ProsThe musicThe gameplayThe storyThe settingThe mythology and visionsPretty much everythingConsId say the only cons were some accents were British for no particular reasonThe combat can get repetitive and easy towards the end you can increase the difficulty and add level scaling but the thrill of stealth kills is still great.I wasnt a huge fan of the ship battles but maybe thats just me.Layla was actually a pretty cool character too, I enjoyed playing as her and the amount of time you play as her is just right imoAll in all a great game and if you enjoy open world RPGs youll probably enjoy ACO, definitely worth a go
