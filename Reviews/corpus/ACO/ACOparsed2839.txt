Have completed all the AC games other than Unity and Rogue, and some spinoff Chronicles titles, and thought the franchise was doomed. I am pleased to have been proven wrong. The story is decent, and side quests are no longer fetch this, liberate that, save a fourth, stab a fifth. They can even span multiple regions  I helped out some kids in Giza might be some other region, I dont remember, and then sent them to Memphis. A few hours later I ventured into Memphis to continue the main quest, and found myself face to face with the kids I helped, and they remembered me even giving me a nickname! I just felt obliged to help them again at that point, so I did another side quest. Im not a completionist, but I have a feeling that Ill be doing a lot more of these side quests, just because theyre so memorable and entertaining.Also, quite a few snobby brats are complaining that this wont run on their insane 7.0GHz, 1024GB RAM, with an SLI setup of a dozen GTX1080s. I can run this on Very High at 60fps on an i76700K, 16GB RAM, XFX RX480 and everything looks amazing. But then again, Im not gaming on a 4k 144hz 60inch TV, so I might be missing out.Either way, still worth checking out, in the past 25 hours or so, I have etc. this list is getting too long, but I can occasionally add to it if people are interested.
