Amazing job they did with this new Assassins Creed, i praise the graphics, the new combat system, the secondary... what i really miss is a more deep story. Ubisoft you need to hire a decent story wise writer, just take a peak to Naughty Dogs or CDProject Red and do what theyre doing bild your game around a great story. Anyway ACO worth any penny spent on it.
