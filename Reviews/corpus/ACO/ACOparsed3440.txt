I have really negative feelings about Ubisoft but honestly this AC is pretty good so far. has FOV slider controls runs smooth seems stable in terms of crashes story is more engaging than some of the previous titles new loot system is welcome but wish it was expanded in depth and breadthYeah, there are loot boxes, etc but all the cash shop seems out of the way so not a big deal.  If you passed on the last couple AC then this one might be worth your attention.UPDATE post finishHonestly, still pretty good.  I did a ton of exploring and side quests but at a certain point alot of it just became too repetitive and I just wrapped up the main quest chain.  I enjoyed the story, the overall atmosphere and how it sets the stage for the future.The main con is that Ubisoft is still trying to understand how to create a open world game.  Each time they get better but more variety is still needed in equipment, skills, etc given the scope of the game.  Also, they need to improve on how to make points of interest, etc tie into the larger game mechanism in some way to avoid the fatigue of so many points of interest in such a large game world.All that said, while I would still pick Black Flag as my favorite AC game this is pretty easily the second in the list.
