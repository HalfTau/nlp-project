Ive really tried to like this game, I really have. But theres some massive technical issues that keep me from enjoying the game, the most predominant of which is the Input Lag. God Damn this ing Input Lag. Ill take my hands fully off the keyboard and mouse at times but Bayek is still running off whichever way he pleases. Combined with the camera lagging behind where youre looking as if someone figured out how to invert mouse acceleration into deceleration and top this off with massive drops in framerate for no other reason than the game rendering in everything within a country mile and you get an absolutely annoying game to play.Let me be clear, I spent 70 Dollars on this game during the Winter Sale and the Gold Version at that. It is not worth my money as it stands. Its not worth your money if you end up with results similar to mine. I hit the Recommended Stats neatly, with an AMD FX8350, 4x the required RAM and a GTX 780 Ti. There shouldnt be anything wrong with my experience minus a hiccup here and there, not a constant stream of spluttering and coughing.EDIT I have since deduced the cause of the input lag and eliminated it. Now the only problem is an apparent lack of optimization. Every time I walk more than 100 feet in one direction the framerate grinds from 60 or 75 right down to 10 or 15, the only reason I can understand this happening is if the game is programmed to load in large chunks at a time rather than a constant stream. Mind you, Im playing on effectively Medium.
