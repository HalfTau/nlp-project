Total Crap!The graphics is good but just like other ubisoft games its unoptimized atleast for me. I have the Recommended Hardware FX 8350 OC at 4.5Ghz and RX  480 8GB and 16 GB of Ram and on High Preset 1080p I dont get stable 60 fps.Atleast ubisoft should optimize it for the Recommended Hardware that they mention but what can we expect from ubishit games always dissappointing.
