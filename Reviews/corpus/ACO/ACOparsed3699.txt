The game are well developed some smal bugs but not more then that. Its diffrent from the old game which is weird and interesting. But for me, the game are not fun as the old games. Sneak, kill, sneak, kill. That is what makes assassins creed for what it is. That is the reason why Assassinss Creed Origins gets a bad review from me. Not a fully and well done one, but short one.We all have our opinions! I know that many liked this game, and I understand why!5/10
