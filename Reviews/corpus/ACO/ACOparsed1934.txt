Got it because it looks like they changed up the formula. They did slightly, and it held my attention for a bit, but they kept the boring, mundane, repetitive missions. And now instead of just letting you wreck everybody, they added a level system. This seems like a nice change of pace at first, until you realize that now youre forced to do the side quest BS in order to have a high enough level to do the main quest missions. In addition, the real world side story is atrociously written and voice acted. 1 for calling back to the earlier AC games however, you only experience these callbacks by optionally reading content but 100 for execution. The game suffers from being unable to make you care about any distinct portion of it the main characters had a lot of potential, but they really bungled it hardcore. How do you make anything Cleopatra/Caesar uninteresting? It baffles me, especially when the same company made AC1 and the AC2 trilogy. Solid 3/10.
