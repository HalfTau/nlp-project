Fantastic game, tonnes of things to do. Not the average slow silent killing assassin.To date, Ive played about 85 hours and still have several quests to complete. In addition, there are random quest events which add much enjoyment to the experience of the game. The main quest was involving from a story building perspective but felt more like a guide to different parts of the map which opened you to more and more side quests. I finished the main quest and was left feeling not quite as thrilled or satisfied as last games, but only in the sense that it didnt feel final. good thing? bad thing? Or was that intentional, revenge is never enough. I dont know only Bayek could answer that one.Graphics are what you would expect from the likes of Ubisoft and dont disappoint.Game mechanics are fluid and enjoyable. Unlike past games where youre attempting to jump off a roof and end up falling to your death, or accidentally climbing something. Also worth noting there isnt much need for roof jumping like past versions. This is mainly because the map is large and expansive with few buildings far and inbetween.To me, the main character Bayek is one of the more aggressive combative assassin and less of a silent stealthy killer. Also worth noting hes one of the few assassins that doesnt get his hands burned when sliding down ropes. Truly a badass.I also enjoyed they attempted to add a bit of the naval ship battles like in black flag. To me that one of the most enjoyable part of black flag and its nice to see it incorporated again however brief.All in all a great game in the genre I would definitely recommend it.
