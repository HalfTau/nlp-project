The game is great. Im very biased since I spent a good deal of time in Egypt and I love that country. Being able to ride camels and see the pyramids again is super cool. The new systems are hard to get used to for a long time assassins creed fan but I dont think thats a bad thing just different. I do not recommend this for anyone with a quad core cpu I would say still probably not. It is so hungry.This is my sixth update to the review. The game maxed out my quad core 4670k pretty much all the time. After todays 1.04 patch the game really does play much better. I have a great after market cooler on my cpu so im not seeing to much heat on any of the cores but if you have stock cooler I would be very cautious.The ingame benchmark is totally lying about gpu usage and I think this may be part of the the games performance problems the ingame benchmark monitor says it is using 5765 gpu BUT using open hardware monitor reveals that it is actually maxing out the gpu to 99 usage. I Get over 600 Fps in the menus and 78 fps avg in game with some drops to 55ish. The stuttering/freezing/hitching has pretty much resolved itself with this patch. With vsync on im getting stable fps on default settings  with adaptive resolution on performance is much worse, with fps limit 60 the game runs at 78 fps? And 124 in the menus.In closing I think it is a great game filled with interesting characters a great protagonist new and more complex combat. A truly Majestic world to  explore.....basically I do LOve it. But there is some huge problems with how the games uses your rig If they could just find a way to shave 15 off the cpu cores I would give it 10 out of 10, but as it stands I feel like it is a bad port playing at 30fps does not help performance and in fact makes it much worse. Im sure more patchs will follow but this is the last time I will ever buy a Ubi game at launch.My rigi54670k Oc 4.00Msi gtx 1080 gaming x with 8 gigs of gddr5x Vramwhich the game doesnt use more then a third 1963 boost clockMsi z87 motherboard16 gigs of sniper Ram at 1866samsung ssd.here is a very technical description of how the game is running on my system MSI Z87GD65 GAMING MS7845 /mainboard     Nuvoton NCT6779D /lpc/nct6779d     CPU VCore           0.88     0.88    0.888 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/0     Voltage 2         1.016    1.016    1.024 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/1     AVCC                3.36    3.344    3.376 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/2     3VCC                3.36    3.344    3.376 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/3     Voltage 5         1.112    1.112    1.112 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/4     Voltage 6         0.848    0.848    0.856 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/5     Voltage 7         1.056    1.056    1.064 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/6     3VSB               3.408    3.392    3.408 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/7     VBAT               3.312    3.312    3.312 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/8     VTT                1.008        1    1.008 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/9     Voltage 11        1.208    1.208    1.216 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/10     Voltage 13        1.008        1    1.008 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/12     Voltage 14        0.744    0.736    0.744 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/13     Voltage 15        1.152    1.152     1.16 /lpc/nct6779d/voltage/14     CPU Core            44.5     44.5       59 /lpc/nct6779d/temperature/0     Temperature 2        37       32       37 /lpc/nct6779d/temperature/2     Temperature 3        23       23       23 /lpc/nct6779d/temperature/3     Temperature 4        15       15       15 /lpc/nct6779d/temperature/4     Temperature 6        40       35       40 /lpc/nct6779d/temperature/6 Intel Core i54670K /intelcpu/0   Bus Speed        99.9999  99.9969  101.473 /intelcpu/0/clock/0   CPU Core 1         4000  3999.87  4058.93 /intelcpu/0/clock/1   CPU Core 2         4000  3999.87  4058.93 /intelcpu/0/clock/2   CPU Core 3         4000  3999.87  4058.93 /intelcpu/0/clock/3   CPU Core 4         4000  3999.87  4058.93 /intelcpu/0/clock/4   CPU Core 1           44       44       60 /intelcpu/0/temperature/0   CPU Core 2           44       44       58 /intelcpu/0/temperature/1   CPU Core 3           44       44       56 /intelcpu/0/temperature/2   CPU Core 4           41       41       56 /intelcpu/0/temperature/3   CPU Package           44       44       60 /intelcpu/0/temperature/4   CPU Total         4.6875   4.6875      100 /intelcpu/0/load/0   CPU Core 1        9.375    9.375      100 /intelcpu/0/load/1   CPU Core 2        9.375    9.375      100 /intelcpu/0/load/2   CPU Core 3            0        0      100 /intelcpu/0/load/3   CPU Core 4            0        0      100 /intelcpu/0/load/4   CPU Package      8.05245  8.05245  49.9864 /intelcpu/0/power/0   CPU Cores        3.44745  3.44745  42.6347 /intelcpu/0/power/1   CPU Graphics           0        0        0 /intelcpu/0/power/2   CPU DRAM          4.0022  3.95343  7.82912 /intelcpu/0/power/3 Generic Memory /ram   Memory           19.6295  19.6295  41.4559 /ram/load/0   Used Memory      3.12998  3.12998  6.61025 /ram/data/0   Available Memory   12.8153  9.33502  12.8153 /ram/data/1 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 /nvidiagpu/0   GPU Core            1683     1683   1961.5 /nvidiagpu/0/clock/0   GPU Memory        5005.8   5005.8   5005.8 /nvidiagpu/0/clock/1   GPU Shader          3366     3366     3923 /nvidiagpu/0/clock/2   GPU Core              54       51       66 /nvidiagpu/0/temperature/0   GPU Core               0        0       99 /nvidiagpu/0/load/0   GPU Memory Controller         0        0       52 /nvidiagpu/0/load/1   GPU Video Engine         0        0        0 /nvidiagpu/0/load/2   GPU Memory       3.54695  3.53932  43.8387 /nvidiagpu/0/load/3   GPU                  870        0      917 /nvidiagpu/0/fan/0   GPU Fan               34        0       37 /nvidiagpu/0/control/0   GPU Memory Free   7901.43  4600.73  7902.06 /nvidiagpu/0/smalldata/1   GPU Memory Used   290.566  289.941  3591.27 /nvidiagpu/0/smalldata/2   GPU Memory Total      8192     8192     8192 /nvidiagpu/0/smalldata/3
