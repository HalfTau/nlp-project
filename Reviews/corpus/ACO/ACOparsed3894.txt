Back on track!I was quite skeptical of Origins when it was announced. Ive always argued against Egypt as a setting for AC, not thinking it would be especially original or interesting. I didnt think Id like Bayek, and I was sure the gameplay would be as lackluster as Unity or Syndicate.I was 100 wrong. Taking multiple ques from the Witcher 3, Origins delivers a sprawling recreation of Ptolemic Egypt, in a sweet spot of history where Egypt is already an ancient, mysterious land, as that ancient kingdom begins falling apart. A new empire rises in Rome, and a Hidden empire in the form of the early Assassin Brotherhood you spend the game creating.The combat is great, if a little easy. The amount of sidequests is staggering, from helping everyday folks to racing in the Hippodrome or fighting in the Colliseum. But the exploration is where this game shines. Riding out in the middle of the desert with no civilization in sight. Wandering the wilds to find an old tomb. Travelling along the Nile, only to be attacked by crocodiles.Assassins Creed Origins is among the best this series has to offer. An easy 8.5/10.
