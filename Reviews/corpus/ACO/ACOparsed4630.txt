I am a new player in the assasins creed universe. And i defenitly feel the relationship with the witcher series that have played. But i feel this as a plus. Better to have stolen good then to invent poorly.The game feels like a journey and exploring is fun, and visually magnificent. Things are not 100 perfect and bugfree but i havent encountered any deal brakers so far, and feeling the money ive spend on it well worth it.At time of wrinting i have 18 hours in the game, and i feel this game is gonna carry me through the dark winter days.i actually regret i havent bought the gold version for access to the dlc and looking forward to the end game content. Exploring all things to do will take many more hours.
