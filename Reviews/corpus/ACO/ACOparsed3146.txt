Yea this is some T.I have GTX 1080,AND AFTER every update MY FPS DROPS.When game first released,I was getting 100fps,then after first or second update,I was down to avergae 70,now after this update,Im down to average of 50 fps.What the  are they doing to cause performance issues after every update BUT claim in these patch notes that it fixed performance issues.Ubisoft is a fN joke!
