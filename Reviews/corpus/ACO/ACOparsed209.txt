The twoyear hiatus paid off wonderfully! The graphics are still do not rival Unity but Origins makes up for it by offering a huge beautiful open world. The views, landscapes, settlements everything is simply breathtaking! Certain landmarks like the Pyramid of Giza or Alexanders Tomb will totally make your heart melt!  Theyve also captured the essence of the crumbling Egyptian empire so well. AND THE ROMANS!3 Dont even get me started on the Romans.The gameplay has drastically changed from the rest of the entries, which is a great thing seeing how stupidly easy the older games were. Ive never been fond of Ubisofts map clearing system but this games makes doing it so much fun! Hunting animals for loot, clearing up outposts either by total stealth or total savagery...these are just a few of the things you can do in this game.This entry blends in some of that Dark Souls feel mixed with a bit of MGS V  The Witcher 3, on that note, Id totally recommend this game even if you dont know jackshit about Assassins Creed lore! This newly styled AC is better than all the previous games combined.I forgot to mention, Ive played this for well over 60 hours and made 40 progression into the game so theres a on of stuff to do. Totally worth the full price tag!
