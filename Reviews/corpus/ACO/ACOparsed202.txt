MY PC SPECSi7 7700k  4.2ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC16GB DDR4 RAMMSI Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON, MainboardInstalled on an SSD with 256GB.Runs Smooth at 80100 FPS even on Citys with Settings Maxed out to Ultra on a 144hz Monitor  1080pIn Alexandria to around 70 FPS.A game that is nothing short of a masterpiece, with new innovations and mechanics that make this a standout game in the franchise and arguably one of the best of the year. Without a doubt, the world is the most technically and graphically advanced of any open world game ever and that says a lot with Horizon Zero Dawn at one point having that title. Combat and skills work intuitively to carve a unique experience and leaves the choice with the player whether they want to be a jack of all trades or a stealthy assassin.The story is incredible but has its fair share of flaws that I think could have made it even better but this series is definitely heading in the right direction. In terms of level design, it is no doubt that Ubisoft are masters of that aspect with what is a experience that mixes and matches that best elements of past franchises e.g. tree climbing, underwater exploration and even naval combat.Ultimately this game is a standout in the series and definitely one of the best games of the last couple of years building on what was the previous two iterations of the series which were wholly disappointing. Nevertheless I think there is a room to improve in terms of the combat and skill tree which can be taken refined in the next instalment as well as developing on this new AC formula.I know it probably sounds like im just a pure assassins creed fanboy, but im not really... I just like good video games especially rpgs, action games, and stealth. And this game is the perfect blend of all of them. In my opinion it is a masterpiece and a must play. A masterpiece in mechanics and gameplay set a in a world of beauty and intrigue. It doesnt get much better than this.10/10 GOTYProsGreat voice actingExcellent use of the ancient Egyptian settingEnjoyable new RPG focused combat / gameplay elementsMemorable characters / engaging storySuperb soundscapeSuperior graphics esp in ultraExcellent variety in missions with excellent side questsConsPoorer gpu performance for AMD usersDRM heats the CPU hard
