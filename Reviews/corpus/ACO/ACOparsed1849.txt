AC Origins is one of the best games Ive ever played. Its the purrrrrfect synthysis of an open world RPG and an Action based killem all game.Endless quests are available, huge open world zones for random exploration and a DeNiles worth of bad guys to kill in every imaginable way.If you dont buy this game, it will be like sand stuck in you craw, and irritate you till your mummy buys it for you.
