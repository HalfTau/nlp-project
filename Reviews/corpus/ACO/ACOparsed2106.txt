Not a fan of the gameplay for an Assassin creed game since when did it turn from a stealth and gank game to a god of war esk game play. That said if your looking for a Ryse son of rome style game its fantastic 10/10 but if your looking for an Assassins Creed game go reload or buy Black Flag 3/10 for the story i want to play.
