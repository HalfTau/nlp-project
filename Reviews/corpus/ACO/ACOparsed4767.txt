I have a little above the minimum specs and the game runs at 75 CPU and it heats up to 70 degrees celcius, have everything set to medium, the game looks beautiful and the story is really interesting, suggest you pick it up, ofc waiting for an optimization is fine too as still i can hear the pc struggle.
