A stunning, beautifully detailed game that is a joy to play. Running at 4K on my 1070 is a thing of beauty and really justifies my purchases.Though I havent progressed through the game too much yet, I can tell that it will keep unveiling itself in exciting ways as the journey continues.The only thing thats lacking in this game are the combat controls. Personally, I find it feels unfinished and clunky. Its not as much fun or fluid to take out attackers as it has been in previous AC games. I find it really halts the gameplay and find myself trying to avoid combat altogether because its more laborious than fun.Otherwise, worth the purchase.
