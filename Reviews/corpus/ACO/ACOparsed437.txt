I have to say, when i first got this game, it was with great concern, because one of the major changes to the game engine has been to combat, making it a more action rpg style akin to Witcher 3 or DarkSouls, two games I could never get into.Boy was I surprised, as a long time fan of the franchise check my library I have them all, completed, I was blown away with not only the game world massive, the world effectssand storms feel real!, but also the game play itself, combat is fluid, switching between equipped weapons is intuitive and feels natural even in the middle of a melee. The variety of events, quests and locations in the world means it rarely feels like youre repeating anything, each feeling to some degree unique and bringing its own challenges and approaches.While the skill system is broken into 3 areas, I found that I tended to spread fairly evenly through the trees, possibly due to previous game mechanics being stuck in my head and play style, but this didnt detract from it at all, and each Skill Point spent or saved was an agonising choice.The story of Bayek, while not as engaging as that of Ezio or Edward, is still very immersive, even from the starting sequence, you feel drawn into his life, his world, his experience. Hes a likable character, while still holding that dark side we have come to see in recent AC titles.I completed the main storyline in about 60 hours, and am on a second play through yay for the return of Save Slots where I am not leaving a zone until I have cleared everything, locations, events, side quests etc, and have barely touched the main Story, only clearing the first tier of targets, with a massive 45 hours playtime logged.The balance between gearing through looting and crafting is perfect, keeping the elements of both styles seperated, yet at the same time, united, moving towards a better geared and more effective Bayek The Hidden One. The mounts are fun, hnalde reasonably well and each has its own perks hinted at by the flavor text, but theyre subtle and dont effect game play immensely. The outfits are nice, wel handled and allow you to look how you want within reason.My one gripe with the game is that several main quests towards the end of the story, switch out Bayek for a 2nd character trying not to spoiler here, which left me feeling like Id worked hard to get my Bayek up to his best possible gear for my play style and skills, only to have it all made useless by being given another character to do vital content with, one that cant even change weapons.All in all, Id give this game a 9.7 out of 10, losing 0.3 points for the switch in later content, and for a few minor bugs I encountered.Cant wait for The Hidden Ones to drop later today fingers crossed Ubisoft and Steam
