Great game. Visually stunning in many places, though not quite up to par with Witcher 3 you do see the notorious AC low res textures in some places. The elements that ubisoft have added in from their other games eg, similar combat to For Honor, hunting systems from Far Cry do all add a much needed layer of monotony breakers that the previous AC games lacked. Just, JUST, enough to keep it all from going stale. I have so many AC games I dont know why I kept buying them but this is finally one that I feel like I want to keep playing over and over and get it all done.The bottom line is, this game is fun. The story still lacks some degree of immersion and gravity... Im just not at all encapsulated by it  perhaps even a little confused by the disjointed presentation. I find myself doing the quests because theyre just an excuse to keep traveling the gorgeous landscapes, and because they will lead me to more combat.I dont think Ive ever said this about an AC game, but Origins is definitely worth getting at full price, or a minor discount.I think this game IS CPU intensive for some reason. I tried boosting my GPU clocks GTX 1080 G1, and it did close to nothing for performance. I OCed my processor i5, 7600k from 3.8ghz to 4.6ghz. Saw an immediate and remarkable improvement in performance playing on 1440p Ultra, areas that gave me 30 FPS became magically smooth at 5070fps. I dont know if thats just me, but the difference the processor made in this game was like night and day.
