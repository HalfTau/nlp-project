LOVED this game at firt, but I cant reccomend it. Wait on this one please. I dont know much about PCs, but my CPU usage shoots up to 100 I have an i7 and all other games I have I play on Ultra settings and they seem to only take up 14. Theyre not older games either so I am very sad. I want to play this, but I dont know if its hurting my PC. Seems like a big waste of money right now.
