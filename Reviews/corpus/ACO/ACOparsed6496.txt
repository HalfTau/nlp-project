Tried with I5 3.5Ghz and an R9 260 Gaming 4GB graphics card. Updated drivers and still got the unsupported driver message. Blocky Gold image obstructing screen. This game was horribly optimized for PC, and everything im reading online from other users is that it kills CPUs made by intel, especially i5s, some i7 users having trouble. Also runs like trash on AMD graphics cards, Geforce gets the win here.I wouldnt buy this until there are a tonne of fixes, i guess i should have expected this from Ubisoft, but still, they should have learned from their past failures.
