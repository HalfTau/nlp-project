I have sank so many hours into this game and im still no where near completing the game. This game has defenetily revived the assassins creed franchise. Its full of life and things to do. I always get distracted by these little things and its just an overall amazing game. The new combat system is by far my favorite thing it is really smooth and amazing. It was worth pre ordering this game for sure cant wait for the DLC.
