updated the game so far has been very good.... However I hate U play.warning you are running an unsupported video driver please update......... etc. Message box in the top corner the whole time i play the game, which so far has run totally fine and smoothly with no issues.whilst i appreciate the warning and notifaction, it is totally annoying running around with the box constantly on show with seemingly no way to close the box that i can find. youd think simply crossing it off with the x would do the trick but the cursor goes underneath the box and i cant close it. shift tab out and then shift tab back doesnt work either, and i cant find any options in the menus to close notifications.WHY???? why have messages on the screen that do not close automatically and gives no obvious options of closing it? it is spoiling my play through as it obstructs my xp bar and level and is an obvious feature on the screen i cant ignore.
