This assassins creed game has got to be one of the best made. It has a long gripping story line, but along side that there are also over 60 side quests that you can complete to raise your characters level so you can progress to new areas of Egypt and fight more powerful enemies. The variety of different weapons and outfits that you can buy and find around the map is vast and each one is different to the others. The different types of swords and bows mean you can try many different fighting styles to find your preferred weapons to take into battle. The combat system gives the player a lot of control over the character and doesnt just involve clicking the mouse, you have to be tactical by dodging enemy swings, braking their shields and deciding whether to use heavy or light attacks based on the situation.Overall I would highly recommend this game to people as it is definitely worth the money. The story line is gripping and it has hours of gameplay to keep you entertained. If you are looking for a game that is entertaining, has hours of gameplay and virtual cats in, then assassins creed origins is the game for you.
