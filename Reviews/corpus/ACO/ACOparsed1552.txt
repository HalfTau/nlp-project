This is the most engrossing, phenomenally indepth AC game since AC2 and Brotherhood. The others are good I love Black Flag!, but Origins is absolutely the epitome of the series since the aforementioned installments. If you LIKE AC, you will LOVE Origins! Fluid controls and movement, state of the art special effects and a deep, personal tale of vengeance and spiritual evolution make this the crowning achievement in the series. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.... and Im very picky.
