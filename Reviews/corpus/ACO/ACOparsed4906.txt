I have an I54690 K 3.5Gh, 8GB RAM and a GTX 970 with updated driver for AC Origins, this game is perfectly playable for me, even before the Day1 Patch.I dont really understand what all the fuss is about.Yes I have been to Alexandria, no I didnt get extreme FPS drops, and the only things that I have adjusted to medium quality is clutter, the rest of the graphics are set to High, Very High and some that go there are Ultra High. But you should wait and see now Ubi is fucking with the graphics downgrade evry path that the LOD looks like skyrim and the draw distance is shorter than your nose.Love the overhaul done to the looting and fighting system, and with the huge map horses/camels are a very welcome addition.Dont believe everything you read, and remember, you can refund the game within two hours of playtime if it doesnt work for you. That may be the only reliable way of finding out how/if it runs for YOU.
