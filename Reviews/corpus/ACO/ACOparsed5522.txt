After putting in a few hours, this game has exceeded my expectations and disproven my worries. The game is fresh and just what the series needed after lots of the AC games suffered from repetition and overall just being rushed out.Taking part in ancient egypt, the game takes you back to the start of the creed and you take the role of Bayek, Medjay of Siwa. Along with this revamp in story, the game has also been changed for the better in areas such as combat, which feels fresh and like it actually takes skill and thought in comparison to old games, where the concept was to spam the attack button, with it being more indepth due to new variations of weapons and abilities that we can play around with.For the first time since Black Flag, i have felt like i actually care for the characters due to inclusions of more backstory containing details of their life and struggles. Furthermore, though i am not near finishing the story, it has kept me gripped and interested and i feel as if the year off for the team has really gone far in the development of the story and characters.In conclusion i think that this will go down as one of if not the best AC games made, and for anybody contemplating their purchase, i strongly recommend it. 9/10
