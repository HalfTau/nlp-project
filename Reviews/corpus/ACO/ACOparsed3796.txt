so this is gonna be a short reviewstory the story of ACO was not developed properly its lacking that emotion and passion that you would expect from a story like this... it seems the writers couldnt be bothered, were rushed or forced to develop with this storylinegameplay the gameplay is decent a few issues with framerate but not too bad....environment to be honest the envoironment was rushed bigtime i thought this was strange untill i saw how big the map was itself.combat the combat system in origins did get worse i was looking forward to it as there was a improvement from syndicate but sadly in origins its worse....AI  again with combat there was a massive improvement with syndicate but in this one the ai is rubbish.... some examples are the big enemies using the same attack over and over and the population that doesnt react to a charriot running them over.animation  now with every sequal to a game that is released there will be copied animation and origins is no different however there are a few new animations and some rebuilts which doesnt make it too bad. as for animation glitches there were a few but mostly unnoticeableconclusion the game was rushed and the story needed more work but it could of been a great game.... you can believe the storyline will work but the method of designing and implementing it was terrible....note to director the game needs more time add another year to the next game if you want it to succeed...rank 4/10personal note i would not buy and would return it if it wasnt because of the uplay intergration
