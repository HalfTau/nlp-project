This game is amazing. It is gorgeous and well written. I have spent so much time just exploring and doing side things like hunting and taking down forts that I am currently 15 levels above the suggested level for the main quest I am on. I just slid down the side of a pyramid and freed a very important person because I was in the right place at the right time. I got amazing gear from doing that and now I look dope as hell. I would highly suggest this game. I spent 6 ing hours huntingto upgrade my armor more. hippos.
