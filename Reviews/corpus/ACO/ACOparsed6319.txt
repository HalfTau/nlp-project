Great comeback from AC franchise, so far for me everything is top notch. Solid 60 fps on ultra. Combat fantastic, smooth. The bow talent that lets you control arrow, well.. Its not going to break a game, its going to make it funnier, you dont need to see the target, just bend the arrow like in the movie! haha loving it and wont stop till i do everying in the game. Totally recommend, for new gamers and old ones.
