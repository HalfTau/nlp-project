TLDR It is worth a buy.GraphicsEnvironmentNPCsStoryActivities/ Combat Kind of hit/miss. Its fun, but you eventually learn that theres not much variation to it.Im really in the middle with it, its not bad, but definitely not good./ Repetitive Where The Witcher 3 had side quests that vastly varied and locations that differed immensely, AC Origins only has a handful. Some of the side quests are fun, but it does start to lack later on and you learn the general routine./ Egypt Egypt was really cool at first and it is beautiful without a doubt! The only thing is, its a desert. It is a desert that is done extremely well, but it is still a desert. This might be / to some and it was for me because although the game is beautiful, I couldnt help to feel and want more variations but the main cities are breathtaking.Overall, it really is excellent and I dont regret spending any money on it. However, after completing the first DLC The Hidden Ones, I dont feel compelled to finish up any other side quests or buy the second DLC unless it is heavily discounted in a year or so.Lastly, the game manages to push my i74770k 4.3ghz to 100 a lot of the time. Pairing my i7 with a GTX 1080 and at 1440p max settings I can keep a fairly solid 60fps, but there are some drops in the big cities.
