Audio does not work for certain people, the first game Ive ever had an audio issue with.So by all means roll the dice and see if it works for you.Their solution is to ask you to provide a laundry list of your setups details so they can maybe provide a fix. How about updating your drivers, enabling/disabling devices, deep diving into sound settings to play a game change things randomly to see what works.Do I look like QA to you?
