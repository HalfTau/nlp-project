Early in the game one of the characters talk about how oppressive and cruel soldiers are acting towards the population.He is saying this while calmly smashing his camel at crowds of civiliansI faught for the little guy though, I brutally murdered that camel after the cut scene ended.We never spoke of this again after10/10 would commit animal cruelty for the sake of random NPCs againOh yeah, and the game is pretty awesome too
