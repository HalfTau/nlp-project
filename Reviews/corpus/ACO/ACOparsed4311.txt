Cant believe this si Ubisoft game. 9.5/10 for me and clear candidate for game of the year. Also probably the best AC game released so far. Even better than Brotherhood and 2, in my opinion. Not even talking about beautiful graphics and amazing setting. Chowder for eyes! I clearly remeber I was wondering how great woudl it be if Witcher 3 had parkour mechanics like Assissins Creed. And it seems I wasnt alone in this little dream of mine. I didnt have many chances to say this, but  GREAT JOB, UBISOFT! You overachieved!
