Great game that runs smooth no real bugs other then some studders in a cinematic.Lots of content to keep you busy and the new combat system feels pretty good.Plus you get to ride a camel run You  O and get your own organic drone with features !! !If you have any love for a good open world third person game with stealth then go for it !
