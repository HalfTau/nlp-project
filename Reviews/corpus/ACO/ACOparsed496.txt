Bayek is a king! Great and interesting characterisation, I actually cared about what drives him on his path. The story is a tale of vengeance and something of a prequel to the franchise... the dialogue is authentic and sharp.The game itself is technically awesome  a massive open world with heaps to do. There are some parts of the map that are quite large and empty but you will only really encounter those if you deviate away from the path the main story and sidequests are sherpaing you along. The attention to detail in world building and also Egyptian mythology you can tell was painstakingly crafted. Combat is tight, you have a large array of different weapons at your disposal. Horse/camel back combat is legit! Gorgeous graphics to top it off. Wasnt expecting it to be this good  taking a year off paid off IMO. For the game itself Id give it a solid 8. 1 for Ubis HDR debut on PC which is a technically brilliant example of HDR at its best.Some choice quotes from BayekThere is more than one type of linen?? ?quotgiving is MY JOB!I was....... guarding your rear9/10.
