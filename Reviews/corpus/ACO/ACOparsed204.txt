My New PC is still slugish to play this on low graphics R92904GB Graphics 16GB Ram. Controls are broken, This is really bad designed game, seem to be made for kids or console players. not adults. Nothing like Assasin Creed Title. This is horrible game, clunky, crap UI. Hard to target enemys, not recommended wasted 2 hours. Getting ar refund now.
