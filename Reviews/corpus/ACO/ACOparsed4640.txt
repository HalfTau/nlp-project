10/10! This game blew me away. The developers differed a lot from the previous Assassins Creed games and it turned out great. The skill tree perfectly fits the game and it doesnt feel like an MMO or RPG in any way. The panoramas the game offers are incredible. One thing that really impressed me was the water physics. It just feels so good and natural when swimming or controlling a boat. I found the Follow road feature really useful and it works great 99 of the time. The only thing I didnt enjoy is how far from your mission objective you are sometimes spawned. Once I had to kill some bandits who had a camp 700 metres away from the city. I spent a good 3 minutes just travelling with my camel just to get there, and when I failed the mission objective, I was spawned in a random village, which also happened to be a restricted zone, 500 metres away! Overall, the game is awesome and Im having a really good time playing it. Totally recommend checking it out.
