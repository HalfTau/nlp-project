SO GOOD! Its feels different than the other AC games. The combat is what I always look at and in AC Origins, its unique and makes you think before hand. The parkour is bit a different whereas you have to also think. The surroundings are beautiful and its just so full of life. I never feel bored and I have something to do. The side quests and the story are just really interesting. By far the best AC game for me!
