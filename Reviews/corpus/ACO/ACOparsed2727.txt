Absolutely hated the gameplay for the first half hour that I played, and the fact that the audio issue with 7.1 surround sound headsets was still around.But alas, i cooled my head and gave this game a second try. And I am absolutely loving it. I have loved what they have done with the game and the changes they have made to the fighting style. I am glad that Ubi took a year off the AC franchise to put a little more time into this one.
