To sum my feelings on it, its an OK game but doesnt compare to the original even remotely.So why do I say that?It has truly beautiful graphics. As usual, they are just stunningly jaw dropping and surprisingly realistic. And I honestly enjoy the ability to take flight and look around me from an areal view in a different way than just jumping from things.The setting in ancient Egypt is novel and fascinating with a great deal of potential.That being said, so far for my play time there has been little to no exposition on just WHY I am where I am and WHAT I am supposed to be doing other than running around running from things and being attacked. There should have been much more of an introduction to explain the start of any story. I feel like Im running around just killing things just because. What happened that Bayek is on the run and part of the assassins? Other than the short blurb they released before the game released. Its a serious lack of storytelling with a huge assumption that youve played the game before, and read all the books associated with it. A foolish assumption that brings the game down.What a pity. Great potential that I have yet to feel realized. Reluctantly, I give it a yes to try but Id wait till the price goes down.
