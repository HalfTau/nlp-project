Assassins Creed Comeback!A lot new things applied to this gameJust imagine Assassins Creed combine with Withcer 3, Watch dogs 2, Black flags, Tomb raider, Dark soul, Far cry, and etc.Pros Huge world Map Variative Weapons RPG system some people did not like it Beautiful world, every city is different from the others Love the Side Mission, every side mission have diff story but at the end we just doin same jobCons Main Story is really really standard Cleopatra n J.Caesar Story really help it Hit Combo attack not much variation Suck Assassinate animation Can not run sprint, horse / camel can not sprint too we need wait a sec to get full speedWorth to buy? Yes from meI think Ubisoft need stop this AC series, its enough! make this the last one.Even there is a lot demand with this game series wait till 3 or 5 years again with new fresh idea.
