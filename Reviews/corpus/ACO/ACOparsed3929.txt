Arguably the best AC since Black Flag.Some thoughts/comments belowTechIm was running the game smoothly around 35 frames average, with very few  brief drops on my rather old PC AMD FX8370, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 970.I did encounter the welldocumented Audio bug with Logitech Gaming Headsets G430 in my case, but the simple workaround was to load into my save, unplug the headset for 10 seconds and continue playing with full audio afterwards. A bit of a hassle, but no dealbreaker for me.Gameplay  designI approve of the added RPGstyle leveling system and skilltreeThe new combat system was refreshingly different and enjoyable, but didnt quite play as smoothly as I had hoped. While I appreciate the change of pace and the fact that groups of enemies now actually can be a danger, many other games do a better job of making you feel like a skilled fighter through animations and battle flow Shadow Wars, Arkham series, Witcher 3An absolutely gorgeous and massive open world. Cant remember when I last enjoyed simply exploring an open world as much as I did in AC Origins. Oh the vistas...StoryOkay story. Nothing that will blow your mind, but it kept me going until the very end, which is something not all games manage to do these days.At random points throughout the story I felt like I mustve missed something, as characters appeared that Bayek either seemed to know and/or had a history with that I didnt know about. Other people have reported this as well, so I guess it isnt just me but maybe a narrative flaw in the way certain characters are introduced.
