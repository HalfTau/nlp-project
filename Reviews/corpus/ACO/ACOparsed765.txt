This is NEW, its DIFFERENT.I am glad to see that ubisoft is finnally making major changes to give this old ip a new life. You can tell when playing that this game learnt a lot from Witcher, Dark Souls and other famous combat rpgs.There are many other little changes that when you discover you would say wow they even thought of this, which I think show that ubisoft is really paying a lot of effort in this.The only thing I feel odd is the prologue and the final scense. I had no clue how the story started, and the way they introduce the two main characters changes in the end is too abrupt.It would be my best game in the year if only they did better in story telling. Still, this is a good game.
