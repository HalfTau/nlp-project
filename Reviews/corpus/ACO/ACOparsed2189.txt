I am a fairly big fan of the AC franchise, however.. even I will admit that Unity and a few of their other games were a couple of bumbling fails.. more so unity than the others.But this one, ACO, this made it feel as though it was taken back to the roots of the original AC game. It does explain some things subtly which is nice, but the attacks, the controls, the over all atomsphere screams back to the roots. If I had to recommend any ACO game to get back into playing this series, this is the one!The way the landscape is decorated there are a lot of breath taking sights, the way way combat is makes it a little bit of a challenge here and there and I will even admit, I miss the rope dart but oh well. You can beat the game quickly if you desire or you can take your time and drift on towards doing every side quest that you see to gain experience.
