So far very disappoinred. My partner bought me the Gold Edition for christmas a while ago, and I come to download the game click play and the will not even open, it gets to attempting to coonnect to Uplay, then nothing. To be honest I do not see why I should spend hours looking into fixing my game, I am not far from asking for a refund, responsibility clearly has not been taken by Ubisoft even 2 months after release. If this game does eventually work it would have to really grab me for me to recommend this game, but I doubt it.Not happy Ubisoft.
