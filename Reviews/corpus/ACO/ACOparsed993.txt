Even though I only played the game a few minutes I could already tell that it is a great game.Its such a shame Ubisoft had to  up yet another possible masterpiece.VMProtect and Denuvo cause 100 CPU and GPU use for me constantly and I have a decent setup.I ran the game on Medium mostly with a MSI GTX 1060 Gaming X, 16 GB DDR4 RAM and a 5th Gen i5, but I constantly got frame drops and at times loading when just trying to move around in the open environment.I had to refund this game, which really sucks... I looked so forward to it, but poor performance was just too much.
