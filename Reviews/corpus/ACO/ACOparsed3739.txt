I should have listened to the other reviews. I havent even played an hour because I refuse to brick my pc over this game. Theres no reason on earth that this game should run my cpu at 98100 EVEN IN MENUS. If you have a PS4 or an Xbox One, then just get this game for console if you consider it a musthave title. Gods know I should have.
