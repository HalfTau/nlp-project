Great game!Wonderful exploring and full of environmental storytelling.The buildings are showing lots of details and the sculptures, paintings and even some people are uncensored.The world is fully logical with the composition of its districts and support roads. Almost all other open world games fail at this point, especially the ones from companies lacking european backgroundThe plot so far is average, but is presented very well.
