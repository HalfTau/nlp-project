As a long time fan of the Assassins Creed franchise  who was growing tired after III, Unity, and Syndicate  I am extremely pleased with Origins. The full 2 year break between Syndicate and Origins has proven to be a great move by Ubisoft as the entire game has recieved a massive facelift. Yes, this is still an AC game, but you can tell Ubisoft took cues from The Witcher 3 in making sure to flesh out areas and really make the game enjoyable.If you like Assassins Creed, and are on the fence about this, please just get Origins. You will NOT be disappointed. I really hope Ubisoft can deliver another game like this, and if that means taking 2 years between releases, so be it.
