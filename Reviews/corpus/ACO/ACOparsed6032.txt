If youre a fan of the series or egyptain history lover pick this up, but if youre looking and you arent one of those two this new game this isnt for you. I wasnt a big fan of the assassins creed except for black flag, but it didnt get me with the combat, story, or not being able to kill random people on the side of the road for no good reason. Actually I like an open world game where you can kill any bystander.
