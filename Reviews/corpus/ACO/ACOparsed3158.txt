I really enjoyed this game.  Maybe it was the time between games.  Im not sure but the past 3 or 4 AC games ahve been a little staleto me.  Even though this included less stealthy assassin techniques than the previous ones, I think the environment and historical significance was really good.  Also, the person in the animus meant something which is more than can be said since Desmond.  Definitely worth a look.
