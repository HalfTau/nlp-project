A worthy successor and return to form after some rocky games in Syndicate  Unity. Less of an emphasis on stealth, although moreso because of the more engaging combat system than anything else. Story is lacking in the way it lacks in most open world, goyourownpace games where it feels hard to get attached to many of the side characters. That said they are memorable, and Aya is fantastic.
