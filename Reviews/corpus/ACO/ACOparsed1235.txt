GoodStory features more of the First Civilisation/Desmond Miles related stuff than the last couple of games, feels like its part of the overall story rather than just being an independant game with a meaningless abstergo agentEnvironment is beautifulCan climb on way more surfaces than any other AC gameBadCombat ing sucks. Dodging doesnt work properly most of the time since the enemies seem to teleport toward you when attacking so you dodge and they still hit you, blocking with your shield doesnt work on most enemies and only specific types of attacks, and you have to unlock it in the first place. Im supposed to be a master warrior that protects the pharoah and I cant ing block with a shield without unlocking it? Give me a break. Theres no parrying or cinematic chain kills like in previous games, the combat is just mindlessly mashing quick and long attack. Yawn. Also the Smoke bomb after attacking perk doesnt work either, half the time you attack, press Y to drop the smoke bomb then nothing happens. Also on Nightmare mode you can die in 1 hit because after being hit once, theres usually no opportunity to dodge, parry, or do anything to respond which isnt hard because its difficult its hard because its a frustrating mechanic that isnt consistent.Guards are dumb asto a point where stealth is just too easy and requires little thoughtGame is really buggy. Mostly bugs with ragdolls/map glitching out etc but one time a quest bugged for me so every time a cutscene happened, Bayek kept repeating Hmm, should I wait till night and attack the bandit in his camp over and over again Which is dialogue from a quest I hadnt finished yet.The perks you unlock suck and are mostly just there to make it take longer to unlock the better ones.tldr Story wise the game is great but its ultimately one step forward two steps back. They shoved too many RPG elements into the game and ruined the combat.
