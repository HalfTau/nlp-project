First things first, Ubisoft enabled VmProtect A feature that Denuvoearlier this year. Go google it, theres plenty of proof floating around that VmProtect is called whenever moving around in the game, causing massive CPU usage.Its 2017. Ignore people that use Uplay as a negative remark in a review. They should know this by now and at the most, its annoying because its another launcher, there is little wrong with Uplay as a games library. Its backup/restore is a lot easier than Steams. Steam still doesnt have a Point to location function for games. Why is no one ing about that?Ubisoft have once again copypastad one of their former games on to this Ghost Recon Wildlands. That being said, it is not a bad game. The controls for PC keyboard/M are weird. Gone are the days of High/Low profile. Alt is to jump ?? There is no sprint function unless I missed it in the controls. Combat is trying to be like Witcher 3/Dark Souls. Plenty of times youll find yourself strafing at the speed of light and missing baddies. RPG similar to Ghost Recon Wildland, also similar to Witcher 3. Still has towers. Now has the Farcry bird. Voice acting is pretty decent from some of the characters. One dude literally sounds like he has cancer.Is this game worth the full price? Yes and No. Yes because its a fresh AC experience. im waiting to find the point of the game where it actually becomes Assassins Creed and not Final Solution Murder Everyone.No because of anticonsumer practices in the form of protecting Denuvo/Origins with VmProtect and tanking a lot of peoples CPUs. Also the sound can some times be a bit tinny. Not your Character Bayek, but other side characters and people he interacts with.
