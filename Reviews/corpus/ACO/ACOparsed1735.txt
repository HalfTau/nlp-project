7.5/10Overall, Assassins Creed Origins is fun and probably the second best game in the series behind Black Flag for me but for one glaring, ravenous, flaw that Im surprised isnt getting more people up in arms.  Probably because they were able to cheat sufficiently before the nerf bat hit to ease the pain.It has better combat than Black Flag, a more detailed and interesting world, the story is on par, if not better, and theres lots of things to do. However, whereas Black Flag was a complete game and had better exploration with sailing and naval combat you could spend hours enjoying you could experience to its fullest in a reasonable amount of time, Assassins Creed Origins is held back by a punishing and intrusive monetization system loot boxes and RL cash whereby players can either 1 cheat 2 kill lions for weeks on end in one of two locations ingame or 3 pay lots of RL cash to earn all legendary items and max out your character.I would have given the game a 9 or 9.5 out of 10 if not for these shenanigans. As it stands, the constant nerfs to the glitches that allow people to advance at a reasonable pace to force them instead to pony up RL cash, after theyve paid full price for the game, should have people up in arms. This is a way more punishing monetization system than Shadow of War, which had people frothing at the mouth. As it stands, while I still recommend the game, this will be the last Ubisoft product I will pay full price for until they acknowledge that the lootboxes coupled with abyssmal nonglitched xp and money gain is an attrocious situation and do something to fix it.ProsAmazing graphicsSolid, if wonky on occasion, combatInteresting story and protagonistsLots of gear variety in weapon loadout and outfits  lots of customization, you can build Bayak how you wantLots to see and doBetter parkour system than preUnity / Syndicate AC games, but worse than those twoSome naval combat, but its pretty limited in scope compared to Rogue or Black FlagSenu, good girlConsPay to advance at its worst, Ive never seen a system this punishing that wasnt straight up pay to win, it is almost tipping the scale in that direction if you want to have any real sense of progression post40 youre either going to be cheating, spending RL cash, or you have the patience of a saint to grind out one of two locations, oh wait... both just got nerfed in the latest patch.... guess your choices are now to cheat if you can find a new glitch or spend cash, sucks to be you if you patchedStill pretty reliant upon the fetch quests, but at least theres some attempt at tying them to story and narration, although a lot of the side quests dont really feel meaningful or alter the world in any perceptible way.Story feels.... incomplete.Some weird bugs that can cause crashes, but nothing gamebreaking so far for me.Allinall, AC Origins did a lot right and I certainly recommend it to fans of the series, but Id wait to get it on sale to punish Ubisoft for punishing their fans with the crap xp and money earning rates.
