Cannot recommend this game at the moment. It has several issues.The sound is very low. Youll need good speakers and turn on the highest volume to hearThis has an already reported CPU glitch. For those who have fps issues the problem is not the GPU, its the CPU. It reaches 100 of usage most of the time. But my 1050ti is about 8085 most of the time. This means bottlenecking. Until this glitch is solved those who dont have an i7 wont get stable 60fps. It doesnt really change anything with low or medium preset.All cutscenes sttuter.Some known Ubi bugs, like deers floating andlol.Besides that, the game looks very good graphically and the gameplay is ok. When the performance and sound issues get fixed Ill recommend this game.
