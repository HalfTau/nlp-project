Should you buy this game? The answer is yes, its really ing fun. A sure shot GotY contender.Breathtaking graphics, a true AAA title in the year 2017. Optimization is okay, some areas are better than others, I have a 1080ti and an i77700k and in some areas of Alexandria my fps will drop from stable 60 to about 50 which makes no sense as Im playing at 1080p Ultra settings, my rig should rightfully murder the game. The less dense areas however are smooth as butter and beautiful.Revamped combat system that feels so damn satisfying I cannot possibly explain it. If you liked The Witcher 3s combat system youll see that Ubisoft drew plenty of inspiration from it.The RPG elements of the game feel great, getting new gear is satisfying, discovering new weapon types and how they play in combat is a thrill. Upgrading your gear makes it stronger and it ALSO AFFECTS ITS APPEARANCE. I absolutely cannot stand games that have all equipment looking the same.The story is compelling and intense as far as Ive gotten, thats all Ill say to avoid spoiling. After quite a long time I find myself growing attached to our assassin, Bayek.Ill update this review more as I play.My Only Complaint The sound in the game seems a little wonky, sometimes the music will just not play and it seems kind of awkward because Im not sure whether its intentional or a glitch or what. It only affects the background music, all other sound works perfectly. Hopefully the Day 1 patch will smooth this stuff out. Still waiting on that patch
