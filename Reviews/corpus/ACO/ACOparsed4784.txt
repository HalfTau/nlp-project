In no way am I going to defend Ubisoft or Uplay, or even this game series. Its incredibly hit and miss with all three of them, this one is somewhere in the middle of all of that. Acceptable but nothing too shocking. At least from what Ive seen so far.I didnt make this review to really talk about the game though, I made this review to talk to the people making the other reviews.My computer is FAR from top of the line and I can play this on High with a smooth 70 FPS. If you cant with better specs than mine, it isnt the game, it is you. Youre either bottlenecking your own equipment or youve ed something up.Git gud at computers and stop ing about it on steam reviews.
