Kind of hard to recommend at full price, its perhaps a step up in many ways but I feel also a step down in many others.The transition into full open world means theres aton of collectibles, grinding, and upgrading. The outposts are generic we all know them from Far Cry and Ghost Recon, and that you need a bird to find your grindings. It also makes all nonmain characters look generic and they have no personality. Your mount is mandatory for a lot of traveling and theres an incredible amount of downtime between playing the game and travelling to your location. The only way to unlock fasttravel points is to synchronize with viewpoints which were all familiar with, except they feel all the more tedious and mandatory now. Its the first thing I go for whenever I enter a new area..Speaking of the autotravel on a mount, it completely ignores NPCs, so you frequently just waltz over them or get into combat by accident because you pass near an enemy fort.Im not at all that interested in the story, either. Unfortunately.That all said, Im still having an OK time, I am only hitting yes on the recommend because its not a bad game at all, its just not strikingly excellent either. Nothing particularily has blown me away, but Im not super deep into the game yet either.Im also surprised theyre still keeping up with all of this Animus nonsense, I thought nobody cared for it ever since Desmonds part in it ended. Oh well. They still insist on bringing me out of the world every 2 hours or so and completely break any minor immersion I might have experienced.Theres also no quit game entirely button. You have to exit to the menu, and then quit the game.
