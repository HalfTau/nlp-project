Its still Assassins Creed but it feels more like a RPG game, side quests are more interesting and have more depth, more enemies can attack you at the same time, theres no minimap, the game is overall harder and thats good. World is huge and interesting.So... you play as a badass, you have a mount, the map is filled with question marks, there are side quests with cutscenes, theres an inventory... Its Assassins Creed Witcher 3. I like it.
