ACO has really exceeded my expectations. Im not a devoted player of the Assassins Creed series, only dabbling in the early games, but Origins is much more of an openworld RPG and offers a really amazing mix of gameplay elements. The world is absolutely beautiful, blending Ptolemaic and Alexandrian archietcture and cultures into a rich world that is ripe for exploration.The voice acting and character development is good and does a good job of alluding to the culture of the era without being overly appropriating or inaccessible.There are plenty of opportunities for wow moments as well as humor and memorable spontaneous moments. Im also encouraged with out Ubisoft is supporting weekly events with the Trials of the Gods, which are a fun way to add value for players who have already explored most of the games content.I have personally completed less than half the game at this point, but am full expecting to get 100 hours of total value from this title which I would classify as really worth purchasing!
