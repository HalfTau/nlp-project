Posting this because there seem to be a lot of negative reviews complaining about performance for me, it only experiences an occassional stutter when I am in the most densely decorated areas of the map on max settings. Certainly not enough to say I do not recommend this game. My biggest visual complaint is about characters/gear clipping  your sword is constantly going through your robe, and when you move bodies, you put your arm right through their robe. Feels like this should have gotten some more attention before release.This feels like a return to the story structure of the first Assassins Creed game  you hunt down important targets, stabbing your way through their underlings to weaken their defenses before you deliver the final blow and get to hear their reasoning. There are a lot of side quests available that give you the option to take the most aggressive approach, but on Hard difficulty combat feels like you are being punished for messing up the stealth at first which I like, you are an assassin, after all. Later on, skill tree lets you be more aggressive as the game steps up difficulty with more skillful enemies that can dodge your attacks, break your defenses, set you on fire, headshot you while you are sprinting/dodging.Thoroughly enjoying the game this far, and at nearly 40 hours in, still have not finished the story.
