Im disappointed.I loved Assassins Creed III, and most reviews say this game is better, if not the best AC. I also enjoy playing stealthy in games, and I love story driven games. Sounds like I should like this game, but after only playing about an hour I refunded. The game really wasnt what I hoped for. I could barely get 60fps at medium quality and I have SLI 980 32gb ram 4790k i7. The game also just wasnt fun. Unlike AC3, where you started as a child, then a young man, then adult, this game you go straight into fighting someone and I feel like there was no deveopment with the character. Overall Im sad to say that I did not enjoy this game one bit. Guess Ill have to wait till next AC.
