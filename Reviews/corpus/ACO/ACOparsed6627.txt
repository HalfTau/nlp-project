Assassins Creed Shadow of MemphisYoure on the fence about this game.The last ones were pretty samey, if not just not fun. Every iteration felt more ubisoft than the last Towers, collectathons, superfluous present day story setupsThis one looks fresh. Maybe.Big pluses I found. The first hour or so had no real tutorial. Assassins Creed 3 had a 15 hour tutorial. Big improvement. Youre left very much to your own devices interms of progression. The skill tree looks alright.Eh stuff, enemys are leveled to soft gate you towards certain areas. There are weapon drops and upgrades. The game just starts. You get a brief flashback to your village burning down or something, its not really explained who you are or what a Maji is Desert wizards? and then all of a sudden youve killed one of the primary story targets and youre riding back into town after a year.I may have skipped a cutscene. Maybe not. There wasnt any presentday techno nonsense to ruin things so that was a big plus. But what was there really didnt hook me.Returned it because it was a maybe purchase that didnt stick me, and it ran like a man caught in a rip. Breaking the surface of 30fps, before dropping down into the low 20s. If you can get a consistent 4550 on high some of the more opulent settings, I bet it looks great.Dont do drugs.
