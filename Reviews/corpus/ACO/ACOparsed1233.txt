highly recommended.i you are into stealth games like watchdogs 2, i would suggest trying this game out.the story is somewhat hard to understand to be honest because of the name of the characters.i just came for the action, stunts leveling system and stealth killing.add the amazing sceneries and and attention to small details, this game is out of the best i have ever played.
