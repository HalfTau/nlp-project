I treat this game purely as an exploration game.The story is llnear as per usual.The combat is simple.The grind for better weapons and levels is mundane.However after all said and done , theres something cool about climbing the piramids or even traversing the desert on your loyal mount.The game lacks variety and imo is way too simple, however that might be just me  I lost myself in exploration and by the time I did real missions I was way overleveld.Its fun , but for a AAA title it lacks substance , same as every other assasins creed game.Best buy on a special sale... Imo its not innovative enaugh to warrant the full price.They created a huge world, but theres no point to build sucha huge world if theres nothing to do in it. For me that has always been the problem with Assasins creed games.Some of the issues were resolved and some new issues were added. Tho in the grand scheme of things it doesnt change the score that much.
