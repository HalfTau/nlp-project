I havent played any other AC games, so keep that in mind for this review. But in my opinion it is a really good game.If you enjoy open world singleplayer games, i recommend getting this one.Pros Beautiful world its also huge Cool fighting mechanics similar to Witcher 3 Skill trees  crafting Stealth gameplay Camel mountCons Some weird bugs I got stuck inside a boat while swimming, couldnt get out, so had to restart Microtransactions optional, but I still dont like it
