The graphic is amazing on ultra setting!But however there are few bugs, mainly the characters being stuck.I feel the developers kinda rushed it toward the end.  Esp the part when u start to encounter julius caisar and the main story line is pretty much finished.In comparisons with the beginning of the game, the game reall feel rushed toward the end, it no longer feel as smooth and epic
