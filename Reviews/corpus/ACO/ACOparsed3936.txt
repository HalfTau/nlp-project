Now obviously the game just came out, but the fact that you released suchis astounding. I hope that you fix the million wonky  the game has to offer. The way of steering carts is moronic. The stealth aspect has been made near useless. When a warning fire is lit, they are on guard permanently, even if they havent seen you for 25 minutes. There will be a que that you are hidden again, but then a npc walks around a corner, points a bow straight at your hiding spot that has you completely out of vision. Then that whole damage aspect is different from any other assassins creed game that exists. There may have been higher levels in other games, but in this one, if you sneak up and slit their throat, they just go ow now you die. Do they have throats of steel? I get the level system, but if you sneak attack someone in a fatal spot, they should die. If the other assassin creed games didnt do this, i wouldnt be so salty, but why change a system that has worked for 5 games. Parkour is wonkey in this one and hardly needed to get around which is boring.Witcher 3 has three problems with the gameplay that i could count. so far, this game has made me lose count.As it is a new release, i am hoping that there will be some updates to fix many of these issues, but these issues should have been fixed with beta testing.I would not recommend the game until the wonkyis fixed.
