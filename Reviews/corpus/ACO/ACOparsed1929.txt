One of the best Assassins creed games! Pros Origins is up there with Black Flag in terms of enjoyability, storyline and gameplay. It is similar to The Witcher 3 in terms of combat, openworldness, and exploration.I am nearly 3/4 of the way through the main story with nearly 40 hours on record. I highly advise doing the side quests as most of them are really interesting and have good backstories, and are not just side quests you do for XP rewards. There is probably another 4060 hours worth of content for me to discover and explore.One of the largest open world games out there, although most of it is desert.The graphics are great, though distant and near textures have started to look blurry after the last update. I love the area around Cyrene Kyrenaika, and Alexandria. Mixtures of Roman, Greek, and Egyptian architecture.Bayek is one of the best characters in the series, also Aya is great when you get the option to play as her.Random events, like the Trial of the Gods and avenging fallen players are quite interesting.Predator bow ability  OP Cons I enjoy the slight RPG elements, but the game stops once you hit level 40 and becomes incredibly easy after that Im sure future DLC might increase the level capThe present day scifi storyline that ties into the game this time around doesnt really make as much sense as it did in Black Flag. Abstergo IndustriesReal resource hog, I get around 80100 CPU usage and 6080 GPU usage on mediumhigh settings. I would expect a 2017 title to be properly optimized for a wide range of hardware. Like Witcher 3Overall 9/10  Might bump this up to 10/10 when they fix the performance issues.
