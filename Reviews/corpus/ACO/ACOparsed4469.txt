So far, so good. I have yet to encounter any of the DRM related performance issues plaguing other users, though I do not doubt that they are present. I have encountered several pathing bugs and other minor glitches however see screenshot and I hope Ubisoft fix these quick.Otherwise, looks like a return to form for Assassins Creed  looking forward to playing more.EDITAfter having finished the lacklustre story, I can safely say that Assassins Creed Origins is worth your time  story aside. Theres tons to do, and a massive world to explore, which is this games greatest accomplishment fully realizing the Ancient world from Alexandria to Giza, to Memphis, to the deserts. This is the games strength. Other aspects of the game can get pretty grindy and repetitive.Note also that there are rumours going around that the game has been downgraded graphically in the latest update, so be warned.
