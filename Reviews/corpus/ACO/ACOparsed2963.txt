This is basically the game that should have had Aya as the protagonist but Ubisoft thought adding a vengeful male protagonist would be safer.Although this is a change to the AC formulae, its still very much the same as other AC games, dont be fooled. One big difference is that you have to level up to manage surviving each new mission, which is tedious and boring. Theres such a huge gap between playing most main missions since the game expects you to level up between every mission. To a casual gamer, this would probably put them off the story, sonsidering it took me an hour between each main mission to prepare myself.Combat is actually satisfying, but not complex. Its a step forward, but from what was advertised, I thought this game would be a larger Breath Of The Wild with amazing graphics. It has the graphics, but the gameplay is just average, since you have to spend many hours grinding just to unlock the cool upgrades, of which I never felt the need to use in the end. Even the different rarity weapons felt bland, with legendary weapons being more common than youd think and not as effective as youd think.Graphically speaking, this game is as pretty as the real locations its based on, but that awe is ruined by glitchy AI, a lack of varied activities available in comparison to the large map size and the fact that theres no reason to experiment with the environment. Theres just not a lot to do. Climbing and the standard AC mechanics work for the most part, but the best part of this game has to be the wildlife. Nature is an enemy in this game, which I love. Sandstorms, Hippos and even vultures can be deadly, offering new ways to fight or evade, with worthwhile loot to acquire upon killing.Overall, this game was not for me. Why do I have a lot of hours do you ask? Well... I tried to get the achievements but just couldnt be bothered in the end. Also, Im glad I traded a TF2 hat on the market to aford this game.
