UPDATE 16/01/2018Still nothing to combat constant game crashes, 530mins, they would focus on game content updates then fixing game breaking alpha crashes in their unfinished AAA title.The game has zero optimisation, though in my case i use AMD and these  developers clearly never tested their game using AMD hardware. With a Ryzen 1700, Rx570, 16GB ram, x370 motherboard this game continually crashes within 520 minutes its unplayable. I can attain max graphics between 4560 fps yet the game still constantly crashes. Despite the update, The game stll continuously crashes.Dont bother going to ubisoft either because they couldnt care less, You just recieve the same standard responses, asif youre 80 years old and have never used a computer before. Oh and you wont be refunded. Happy Gaming.Still Ubisoft has not released anything in anyway to help combat this, it is pure lazyness by the company who have clearly made this game specifically for Intel. SURLEY if they had GAMETESTS on AMD PCS they would ing know, BUT NO. Ubisoft decided to release and unfinished broken ing game to steal peoples money. IS LEGAL. OF COURSE IT IS.
