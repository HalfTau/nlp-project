For me this game is alright, but still not as good as AC II in my opionion, the story in this game isnt really the strong point, it is more of a meh and feels kinda fast for me, upon the first 5 hours of the game i reached level 10 LV 40 Max. But the gameplay and is what i enjoyed more. In this large land of Egypt there is many enemy camps to fight, random animals, random famable houses i burn down for fun and alot of nice veiws of the Egyptain landscape you could see in my proflie screen shot. But secondary quests. With the introduction of other types of bows and and a skill that you could somehow control an arrow, killing targets feels very easy, May not be as good as AC2 or AC3 but people would still enjoy it
