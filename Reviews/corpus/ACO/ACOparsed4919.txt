Theres a lot of issues that others describes better than me. I ran into some of them. I fixed my freezing problem by verifying integrity files, it downloaded 2Go it was gone.Otherwise this game is amazing, I love the depiction of this old Egypt in a very vivid and realistic environment, graphics are very good, theres a lot of stuff to do. Maybe the story is a little shallow, and I think Ubi should abandon the present days part that I find annoying and uninteresting, since a lot of episodes.Definetly recommend, thats a great evolution since Syndicate, they learned from the witcher that is clear.
