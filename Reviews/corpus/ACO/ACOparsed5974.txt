Six hours in, and feel like Ive just scratched the surface. Starts little slow, feeling almost like a different series, but after the first hour really kicks off as a pure  polished epic AC experience. Loving it so far. Massive world, runs like a dream with almost all settings maxed Core i7 860  GTX980.
