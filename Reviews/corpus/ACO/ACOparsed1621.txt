I expected the world of ACO and it... honestly delivered and then some.This is probably the first time since TW3 that my massive amount of hype prerelease for a game has ever been fulfilled.I havent ever truly been excited for an AC game, Black Flag was likely the last one I was genuinely hype for just because I love the age of pirates.How fitting then that that same team gets to do the next setting I was stoked for ancient Egypt.And it delivered in spades its beautiful and extremely fun to explore, it has memorable and relatable characters, the combat system is a bit better than past games but it definitely needs more kill animation variety, loot variety is great... love the visual design of everything, and best of all the ubisoft open world bloat has been reduced dramatically and replaced with a million side quests with stories so now I have a legit reason to want to go everywhere.Of course, its not perfect back to the loot... it has great visual variety, sure, but it lacks a lot in attributes and elemental affixes to make it actually rewarding, a lot of characters and sidequests are memorable and a lot feel like they had a great idea but then forgot what they were writing about and promptly dropped them before they could get any real resolution... comes with the territory of having so many questsand obviously not having the level of skill that TW3 writers have I suppose, and the postrelease content, aside from the generally great patches, leave a lot to be desired... it feels like they half baked everything so far outfits miss physics interaction or effects that youd think they would have... same thing with the mounts, or the fact that the FF15 event is just so amazingly LAZYquest length and the 4 legged chocobo camel mutant what the hell compared to the Square counterpart, the trials of the gods all basically being copied and pasted, and the packs are ridiculously over priced.Overall though, it was a lot better than I expected and I can forgive the faults based on the ambition of the game alone.Im just a little wary about the expansions theyll be releasing if their current offerings are any indication of quality control.
