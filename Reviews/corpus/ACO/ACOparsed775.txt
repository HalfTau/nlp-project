Best game in the series yet, and I absolutely loved Black flag. But even that had a bit of fatigue nearing the end of the main story, let alone side quests.I find myself continuously coming back over and over to finish all the side quests and collectibles. Just being in this world is great fun. Combat is greatly improved over previous titles. Graphics are fantastic, map is huge, but quick travel is easy. The levelling system i felt worked really well even though I didnt really notice too much difference between the weapon types.Get this game if you have ever enjoyed a previous assassins creed game. This is basically skyrim/fallout, but with epic combat, good graphics and interesting quests.
