You now what? I like the game, the Ac series has been kinda repetetive but this game was fine. The story was good, gameplay intresting kept me at least playing the game having loads of fun. Some side quests felt kinda meh. The level system was intresting and I did face a bit harder difficulties sometimes and the harder modes felt challenging.All in all I recommend the game, at least pick it up if it is on sale.
