Stupid beatemup game that cannot be properly stealthed through like the original ones. Also, your success in these stupid combat missions is mostly based on your level and gear rather than your actual skill. If you liked the original AC games, this is not like those. Also cpu performance is horrible. 2x980ti sli isnt enough to run this game with i7 2600k. Also, the game is mostly about riding a damn camel.
