Assassins Creed in a BOXThis is a collection of all the best, the previous games has to offer, and then adding a TON more to it.9.8/10I would give it 10/10 if they changed a few things, but thats only my personal liking.ConsControls are fine, but after a long time my left hand starting to get cramps after the c and alt button layout. fixed by control mappingIve been stuck in a few rocks, layers and small tings and only way to get me out was exiting the game and restart.fixed by jumping and later unlock for shield bash ProsEverything else!!!!
