First of all I skipped the last game  Assassins Creed Syndicate. I liked the gameplay but the setting was nothing for me. It was just to modern and not my cup of tea. But thats a personal thing. Otherwise i played every single title of this series and liked all of them. Only Unity was kinda ... you know. Im talking about the desaster on release. Since the beginning my wish was I want an Assassins Creed way back in time! And here we have it guys. So ... yea i was kind of hyped for Origins. Was I disappointed? No, by no means. Rather completely surprised. Assassins Creed Origins is keeping the good stuff from the old games and takes something new and fresh. With a slight inspiration from The Witcher III  Wild Hunt. Is this bad? No. Inspiration isnt bad at all. And Origins is not a copy of The Witcher III. Played the german version btw.Ill complete this review when im done with Assassins Creed Origins. I cant say more at the moment. Ive enjoyed it so far! I did not encountered a single gamebreaking bug after more than 10 hours of playtime.
