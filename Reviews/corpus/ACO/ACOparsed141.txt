I was gonna get crazy to get that Overheated achievement, then I find I can just let Bayak run in the the black and white desert. By the way, why on earth would Ubi put two empty areas in the game? I spent almost half an hr to explore cuz I thought they cant be that Fxxxing bored to do this and there must be something hidden...
