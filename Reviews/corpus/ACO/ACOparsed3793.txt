One of the best games in the Assassins Creed franchise. The environmental design looks fantastic and the music sets the tone in the setting of ancient Egypt. Its always fascinating when you discover a location or landmark for the first time and have the urge to take a screenshot or take in the surroundings. Scaling the pyramids in Giza, exploring tombs and travelling the desert sands with a camel or horse are just some of the adventurous options you have, which also provides you with an immersive experience. There were certain aspects which I wasnt too fond of such as the new combat system, however others may prefer the For Honor style combat mechanism. Whilst the open world design and large map size is impressive, completing tasks felt a bit repetitive such as finding loot, killing an animal or killing certain targets. Nevertheless, I recommend this to fans of the franchise.
