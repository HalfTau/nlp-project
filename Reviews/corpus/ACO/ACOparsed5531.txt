I dont even know where to start with this review. The last time I was this charmed and blown away by a game was when I played The Witcher 3, and that should say something. Seriously, it doesnt even matter if you care about the AC franchise or not  if you are someone who wants immersion, ambience, detailed environments, an incredible soundtrack and a solid story then you should try this and not even think twice about it. Combat may take some getting used to but seriously, that should not stop you from dipping into this experience. This is one of those games that stops you in your tracks you just want to stand still, take your 33939262th screenie, and marvel at the entire picture in front of you. 10/10, I cant recommend it enough.Sidenote I studied Egyptian Language and Culture at uni, and I 100 approve of the historical accuracy in the environments I have been seeing Im leaving the story aside when I say that, its obviously still a fictional game.Edit, after 90 hours and a completionist playthrough I mostly stand by all of the above  ambiance in this game is equal to none and I especially love the addition of endless stretches of desert, just for the sake of having them. The sole reason I cant give this game a 10/10, is because of the ending and rather thin writing on Ubisofts end. The events happening are great, amazing even, but the way they transpire is in my opinion a bit poor. Though if you are a big Ayafanboi, you will probably love it.Overall, still a 9/10, and for me the GOTY.
