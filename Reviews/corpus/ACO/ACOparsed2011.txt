Utterly amazing. Personally my favourite Assassins Creed game since 2. Egypt really stands out as the best environment the team have made, I think so anyway.Never seems to bore me, love the location/setting and environment, characters are great and unique, the landmarks... oh my god, such awesomeness. Its hard to top standing on top of the Giza Pyramids overlooking Egypt as far as the eye can see.Highly recommended. Cant wait for the DLCs.
