I was excited for the new game, with more time spent rather than attemtping to dish out another game quickly.The game mechanics are great, with a better focus on stealth with the foliage mechanic brought back.Fighting isnt just spamming E and left clicking like it was back in 3, 4, and rogue also more dependent on enemy knowhow and camera movements, unlike earler games.But despite that, I found nowhere near as much fun as I had with other games. Instead of starting out with Bayek where he is first introduced to the enemy and going on a rampage, we start out just on the rampage, with his earlier life sprinkled in around. The combat mechanic started out focusing on enemy movements, but it has turned into a dodgeoneveryattack and spamming attack.The naval missions are great I like that they brough it back, but its like it was in ac3, where it was mission based. What makes AC3 better than this game You can replay naval missions in that, but not this.The missions are extremely repetitive Go to point A, listen to sad story, go to point B and kill everything there, then go back to point A and get some currency that becomes worthless in endgame.Ubisoft wanted to avoid the repetitive missions you had in earlier games, like stalk this character or assassinate this guy stealthly. Instead, they ended up just copying and pasting the missions from games like Skyrim.The outfits seem to only appeal to a certain audience, that isnt me. I dont really like the outfits too much, but its probably just me.Do I recommend it? Probably not. It just gets to repetitive.
