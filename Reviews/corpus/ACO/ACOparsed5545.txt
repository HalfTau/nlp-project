As soon as you move on, or when you feel you get all the hotkeys and what not, turn off HUD completley, and be prepared to drool so bad youll short circuit your keyboard.Must be played on hard.Must be played with ZERO aim assist.Do not use the shotgun bowPose extra limitations on yourself so as to not break immersionGOTY.
