After playing this game for a short time...I think it looks great, graphics are amazingThe gameplay is goodThe quest are interestingThe progression is good, skills can fit your styleThe Optimisation is the WORST ive seen in any game, not many games can make my cpu i54670 work so hard that my fps is 301080p max settings in the city my gpu is a gtx1070 and is only at 50 load most of time, HELLO BOTTLENECK. Oh I guess Ill have to upgrade my cpu at this point. If you are sensitive to 30fps and it is game breaking for you and your hardware is a little outdated like mine, dont even bother buying.Id recommend for anyone with a great pc or anyone who can handle 30fps at times
