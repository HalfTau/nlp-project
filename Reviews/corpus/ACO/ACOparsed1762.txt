Its alright. Honestly it mostly just feels like ubisoft mashed farcry into assassins creed and called it done. Its without a doubt a visually stunning game and the world is huge but lets face it the main story line takes up about 30 and the rest is side quests and item collections. The Egypt story isnt bad, definately better than the last few. I think theyve given up on the modern day story. The whole thing was a bit dissapointing really.
