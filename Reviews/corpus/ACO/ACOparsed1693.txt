Never gonna trust Ubisoft again. They failing me every ing year. Played from AC2 to Syndicate. They are never gonna surprass AC2 and Brotherhood even they worked for 2 ing years on this game. Boring, stupid characters, same mechanics all over again. oh god i remember when ubisoft were doing good job on this series. They failed again. Everybody will remember Ezio, Altair, Edward Kenny but not this. Played this game about 20 hours but now cant remember even his name.
