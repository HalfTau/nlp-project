Been playing for over a dozen hours and barely touched any story. The world is massive and beautiful, might be the best Ive ever played in a game. Side quests have a decent amount of depth and some of them get really intriguing. Progression is amazing, combat is challenging and makes stealth rewarding. Horse and movement mechanics are also especially good, probably the best Ive played in a game.PC port is pretty good but there is room for improvement, especially on the CPU end of things. Also think the games story starts off a bit shaky thanks to some poor pacing and cutting up of narrative. Thankfully, they spare no time throwing you into the world and this is a massive step up from games like AC3 that held your hand for hours.Buy it if you can, this is probably the best Assassins Creed from a gameplay perspective and its slowly becoming one of my favourite experiences with the series.
