I really wanted to like this game but it has sooo much missing. It lacks an overall direction, the dialogue is ridiculously boring and feels super procedural, and the combat system is pretty counter intuitive and sort of terrible. Parrying makes zero sense and they dont clue you in on when parrying will work or when it wontMost notably the changing of controls is incredibly stupid.
