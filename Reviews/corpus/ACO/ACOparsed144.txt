Excellent game, from the traielrs, i was expecting another crappy ubisoft game, but after playing this, I am just in love with all the new mechanics, the game almost makes you feel like your playing skyrim at the same time. The fighting isnt button mashing anymore, and there are soooooo many epic nonscripted moments. Would recommend as a good first game for new assasins creed players
