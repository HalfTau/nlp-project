Our new Assassins Creed game takes us to Ancient Egypt, lets have a look then...First of all Ancient Egypt is really good choice to be a gaming ambiance, and I can say that Ubisoft did well at handling this ambiance. There are negative and positive points that Ill talk aboutPositive Ones As I say, great atmosphere. Too many details of gameplay, for example when you walk with a torch to flamable objects, they burn, when you hold your arrow to a torch, arrow will set on fire, when you walk someplace low, Bayek will crouch automatically, when you walk through a water, only your legs will get wet. When I give these examples and read them, I can say that it is not a big deal actually, but when youre in game it effects much, and you can feel yourself in the game much. Not at all of them but great face expressions at cinematics. Beautiful graphics.I can say many more but I am trying to write it shortly. I know it is not.Negative Ones Repeated side quests, and the game has too many side quests Empty Question Marks, there is nothing in them, I discovered all in Egypt. Trash side boss fights. Ubisoft thought boosting the health and damage of the boss will be a good and hard boss fight. Luckily I had a sword that has 620 DMG Assassination of the Order Members werent good enough, press the button and done. Previous game Syndicate was better at this, you could choose options of going to the target, different places to assassinate and so on... Ubisoft tried to make the game unfinishable, when you beat all arena bosses That means pass the 3 stage every one of them has 3 rounds before you go to the boss. They all the same and boring., same bosses come again in elite section, kill them again if youre not bored yet.Thats a long summary of my thoughts.My rating to this game is 7.4/10Worth to buy and play.
