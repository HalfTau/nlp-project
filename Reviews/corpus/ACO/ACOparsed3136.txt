What do you get when you take a beloved franchise with solid mechanics, like Assassins Creed, and mix it with the open world RPG qualities of a game like Witcher 3? You get AC Origins, which is a barnburning return to the series. From top to bottom, this game will satisfy in almost every capacity. Top marks go to the characters and story writing which are both strong. Bayek and Aya are completely charming, believable and sympathetic, and theres no doubt that the setting makes for an amazing journey into the past of the Brotherhood to show how they came to be, a pivotal moment for the franchise which we hadnt experienced before outside of journal entries. The things which slightly tarnish the experience combat is different, and I personally missed the more rhythmic counter system...as well as some of the weirdness that still happens with climbing and horse rriding arent glaring enough flaws to steer anyone away. The MTX items on offer are purely fluff time savers not even close to necessary and the world is rich with rewards of its own just from playing the game. For me, I would put this up as the quintessential Assasins Creed experience, topping Black Flag and Ezios adventures.
