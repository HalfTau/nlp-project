Storyline and gameplay is well created and thought out, however, theres a MAJOR underlying issue with this game.The most common explaination I can find revolves around Ubisofts use of dual layers of DRM which puts excess stress on CPUs. However, Ubisoft claims its because its a topend product, but and dont get me wrong, its beautiful and detailed on max its not crazy demanding on my GTX 1080 with it topping out at 59 load on ultra settings what it defaulted to.My system is well within specs 3570k4.2,16 gig 1866mhz,gtx 1080 but will not run efficiently on ANY setting including minimum/bare bones. If the game worked consistently and didnt crash and lag frequently to the point input lag, seriously? !, I would recommend it. Until such time, avoid it.
