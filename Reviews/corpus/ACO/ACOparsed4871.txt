Refunded until its patched for performance/bugs.Issues I had big frame hitches the crackly audio bug that made everything quiet as heck and sound like my speakers were broken LOD rendering of models is crazy, you can have an NPC from the distance come up to you and stand right next to you for several seconds before the high detail model is loaded. The first mission is following a dude on a camel, that dude on a camel UNLOADED so it was the low LOD model when I was like 10ft behind him lol then reaching the first checkpoint in the first mission softlocked the gameSo I refunded because it basically performs poorly, has experience ruining bugs, and literally doesnt work by being soft locked. Ill try it again in a few months when its half the price.
