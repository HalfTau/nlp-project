This is... a surprise.Ubi honestly did an amazing job with the extra time in development. The new combat system makes gameplay even better, albeit it is a bit difficult to master if youre used to the old AC combat system.Parkour elements feel better. There was even less random jumping around and whatnot compared to previous games.The story feels more intriguing, and I would not be surprised to see Bayek and Amunet return in future AC sequels akin to the Ezio trilogy.There are still bugs, one in particular is the phylakes bug, which makes it so the last 2 or so are nowhere to be found. I hope Ubi patches this in the future.All in all, this is what happens when you prioritize quality over quantity. Im more than happy to wait 2 years for a new AC game if this is what I can expect.
