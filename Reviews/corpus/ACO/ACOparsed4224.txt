AMAZING!!! been playing it non stop for the last week! great gameplay, huge world filled with side quests, random events, bosses, wildlife and an amazing amount of detail. great story and Bayek is a fantastic character , definitely an upgrade from old ACs. If you like RPGs, the Witcher 3, Horizon zero dawn or open world games it general. I highly recommend it!
