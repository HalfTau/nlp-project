This game is absolutely incredible. The storyline is rich and rewarding. Each side quest there are many on the map is unique and almost a mini mission in themselves. The ENORMOUS map is incredibly intricate both graphically and aesthetically and makes this an amazing world to explore think Black Flag sea scale but all land. The weapon rarities incentivizes exploring and side missions even more and is a welcome change. The combat in this game is the best in the series and more realistic. On hard difficulty, the AI is actually somewhat formidable and creates welcome challenges. Finally, in my opinion, the main character, Bayek challenges Ezio as one of the best assassins in the series.This to me is the best overall AC game in the entire series.
