It took me some time to think wether to recommend this game or not. The gameplay is satisfying and challenging enough, the visuals are amazing and theres a lot of character customization. I also loved how you could scout the terrain with your eagle, the weapons variety and the arena. I have played about 40 hours and have finished the main story.So, apart from Uplayrelated issues, why would i give it a thumbs down? There are quite a few reasonsFirst of all, the story and the characters are poorly written. I love history, Roman history especially since i am a Roman myself , and it feels ubisoft could have given a few more space to huge characters such as Cleopatra and Cesar. The plot is linear, predictable and boring kill five animalnamed guys, then other three then other two and then the last one ooo it is a pyramid. Seriously??. Bayek has a flat and incoherent personality which emerges especially during the side quests which are so poorly written that im sure my nine year cousin couldve done a better job. When i bought this game i was really hoping to get a story like the ones in the old ACs, and this was a huge letdown.Secondly, helix credits.Thirdly, i have had issues with my save files. Twice, i would load my game only to discover i was a few levels behind my last save. I lost several hours due to this and its reallyme.Overall, the game is good, writing is just terrible and the game still has a few bugs and stuff. It is fun, but i would recommend it only on sale. Also, if youre reading reviews to decide if you want to buy the AC Origins and you havent played The Witcher 3 yet, heed my advice and play The Witcher 3 first it has everything this game has but it is soooo much better.
