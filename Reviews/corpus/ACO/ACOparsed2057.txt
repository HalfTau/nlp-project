Im a huge fan of the Assassins Creed series and, given the quality of some of their more recent, previous games, I was somewhat nervous about Origins. However, the extra time Ubisoft have taken to work on the game really shows and has reminded me of why I loved this series so much.  The combat mechanics have greatly improved, the graphics and attention to environmental detail is fantastic, and the setting and story are both engaging and exciting. I fully recommend this game, particularly to anyone who loved some of the old Assassins Creed games but has been frustrated by them recently. A definite return to form.
