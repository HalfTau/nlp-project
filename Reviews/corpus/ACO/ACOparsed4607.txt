 Combat greatly improved. Can actually be challenging I highly recommend playing Hard dufficulty Rare loot system brings excitement with unique weapons and armour. Enormous freeroam map, with awesome sights. Ancient Egypt is very interesting, great lore, full with curses, plagues and even mirages if you spend too long in the desert. Also exploring through the maze like pyramids themselves. Climbing/parkour is very smooth and fluent. VERY bad framerate/performance issues at times. Typical ingame purchases.TLDR Good enough to be GOTY
