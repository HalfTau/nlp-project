Hi ubisoft, my games performance is low on high endmore than reccomended hardware. If you could remove all the unneccessary junk code that would be great. I dont want to have to pirate this game and start over from the beginning just to get decent performance and a bugless game. I will leave this review as positive as my token of gratitude in advance because I have faith in ubisofts morality. All I ask in return is to have faith in the playerbase. If someone enjoys the game they will buy it.Thanks,The Tuna
