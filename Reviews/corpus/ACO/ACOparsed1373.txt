Have played all AC series except for Unity and I personally think this will definitely be one of my favourite game yet. Overall I think its a good game for my money. Enjoyed every minute of total 66 hours of my play time right from exploring Egypt and completing the main mission, its a joy playing this. Though there was slight lags here and there it did not impact the overall gameplay. Thanks Ubisoft to overhaul the game mechanics and make AC series even better then it was before. Looking forward for the future AC release.
