What a boring game. Ive barely played 30hs of it and Im already reminded of the reason I didnt finish the first AC game. This game consists in doing the same quests at different levels, over and over again. The controls and playability dont favor a very fluid movement, theyre somewhat clunky and your character doesnt always do what you intended.Combat is decent. Most enemies are dumber than Gothams police, but there are a few here and there that are kinda challenging. Still, if youre expecting combat difficulty on par with Dark Souls, youre not gonna get it here.Graphics are cool, and the world is pretty big and well designed. Theres some variety of equipment and weapons.All in all, I gotta keep my promise not to buy any more of these open world kinda games, as theyre all the same. SoM, MGS5, all of the AC titles, theyre all the same. To top it all, Assassins Creed Origins really underestimates its players, for example having its investigation areas be LITERALLY hold V  go to each marker that pops up  press E. You dont even have to search for anything. Really underwhelming.So one things for sure this game will NOT make you think. If you want to figure anything out by yourself, go play sudoku or something and save yourself a good chunk of change.Im uninstalling this game because Ive already lost my interest.
