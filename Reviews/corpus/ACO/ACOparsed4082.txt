I thought I had a pretty decent rig. I can run most games on at least the high settings, if not ultra. I was excited to play this game because from what Id seen, it was a refreshing take on the game with some key changes made to the gameplay. It looked like the extra year of dev time payed off.Sadly Ive had to refund this game because it was running poorly even with everything set to medium. Yes, I could have set everything lower and maybe had a decent framerate, but the game would look garbage and I cant be arsed with that. At the same time, running a game at sub60 FPS is just something I cant tolerate these days. The game may be good, but the performance problems Ive faced and the fact that Ive refunded it means I have to give it the thumbs down.My specsIts probably time for me to upgrade my graphics card, but until I can Ill have to leave this game unplayed.
