Game is remade from scratch. Its combat system is changed and became more realistic. But is has some cons. Like cant revover fast enough and cant make it faster with skill tree. Its skill tree is new thing and need to be develop more efficent tree. Graphics and visualision is perfect. Its first ubi game that has this kind of large freeworld and constantly random events shows up. Some pc systems have fps problem caused by DMV. I hope when the game gets cracked they will delete the DMV and we will get more fps. Game deserves to be bought. But dont buy Far Cry or Ghost Recon. They need to change their visions on other games. Im approving the game because until this game i always play it free. And this game deserves the money. If u clear a outpost it wont get cleared you can come back and kill soldiers everytime and its ridiculous. Why i did clear the outpost then? The story is so short it can be made longer but the game is from scratch game and it has too many absences. The old egyptian era is too empty and they did awesome work while fullyflied the game and the map. Weapon choices are too many and wide along passive skills. The best thing is that foggy buff effect on weapon and on shield. Unicorn is awesome tho. I WAS GOING TO GIVE BAD RECOMMEND FOR FINAL FANTASY ADVERTISING MISSION. DONT DO THAT IDIOTIC MOVE AGAIN UBISOFT!
