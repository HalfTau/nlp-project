Such a dissapointment.Ive waited so long for this game to redeem ubisoft after their awaful run with unity and syndicate.moving to a Dark souls type battle system was a horrible idea, and removed any shred of elegance and fluidity from the game.But with everything taken into account, the MOST heartbreaking problem is the averageatbest plot.Being in ancient egypt they could have made this game a masterpiece.NO character development, NO emotional triggers, NO ambition or drive, NO twists... nothing.Bayeks story is dull, and the abstergo/current time plot just doesnt cut it, not by a long shot.honestly, it is like a 6.0/10 movie.One beacon of light in this game is the breathtaking modeling and animation, the environment is outstanding, and you can see the heart and soul that the design team poured into the game in every blade of grass, honestly, kudos.This will probably be the last AC game ill spend my money on.
