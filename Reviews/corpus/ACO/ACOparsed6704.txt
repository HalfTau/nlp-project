I was looking forward to playing this game unfortunately I am experiencing the same Uplay issues everyone else is having, and I am unable to play the game at all... returning right now to buy wolfenstein. Shame.UPDATEShortly after writing this review I was able to access the game via the Uplay client and I love it! I feel like this game is the perfect blend between splinter celll and assassins creed, maybe some ghost recon mixed in there too. Anyway Im glad I was able to play this game!! 9/10! !
