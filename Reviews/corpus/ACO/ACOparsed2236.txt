Best AC so far, big world, lots of things to do, lots of exploring. And the world they made is a beauty!edit After you finished the game there is absolutly NOTHING to do, i.o.w. zero replay value. You cant replay missions and thats just a big question mark to Ubisoft, why the hell not? Still I had some many hours of fun and it is worth its money, but now I am left with a void. Oh well, time for something completely else...
