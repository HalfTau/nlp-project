Ill start this review with saying that with this assassins creed game your not getting burned over like more recent games by Ubisoft. AC originis is notably a lot different than your normal AC game most notably the controls are really the most different thing in this game from little things like being able to run all the time with only using the analogue and not pressing a button to big overhauls like the combat and that is huge. The combat has turned into a combat system that you actually have to pay attention to instead of just button mashing X all the time it handles more like a faster paced dark souls fight with locking on and blocking,  maybe circle strafing, ect but not quite as difficult. It does manage to feel fulfilling though especially if you play it smartly and defeat a very hard enemy. With all this the open world is still just like a AC game but better there is a ton of variety in the side quest and tons of stuff to do and although the map doesnt feel cluttered you are always within 300 meters of something to do like hunt some lions to get a better pouch or intercepted a convoy for some iron for crafting. My only problems with this game are its microtransactions and its performance. At times it can get slow and suffer frame rate drops and you will encounter a lot of bugs. The game has lost quite a bit of its identity with this game but I think it was necessary to make a different and really good game. Although it may be a more generic game its still Assassins Creed and if you have been very sour on the series lately I recommend trying this the extra year of development has really improved the game. I only ask that you do not buy any of the microtransactions.
