If you love AC series but found it getting boring lately like me, you will enjoy origins..Take AC style assasinations / story / parkour add in farcry primal eagle for mob tagging / secret locating and set it in a witcher 3 style open world of ? marks you have to uncover not just everything revelaed via synch, then make melee combat thats derived from darksouls but not as hard, and you got AC origins.You will be required to do some side quests for levels but honestly they are as well done as main story qs and all very varried and voice acted, its not a drag at all its quite refreshing from old AC forumla.AC2 24 hrs , AC black flag 24 hrs, AC origins already 25 hrs and not done. The content is there and if your a complitionist guy im not this game will take you a very long time I think.The story isnt special but its passable, the graphics are sick, the combat is fun and fresh overall its worth a play especialy if you get it on sale but even at full if your an AC fan this is a must play. If you do play I highly recomend predator bow and bow stuff in general for stealth or non stealth they just OP enjoy P
