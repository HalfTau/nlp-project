I preordered this game its so far I love it. Furthermore level 37 bayek I managed to take on the Anubis Trial of the gods and succeed it consisted of strafing and running but it was doable.  That being said I played for good solid probably 40 hours before dropping after finishing the storyline cuz I needed a break. But when the trial the gods came I was probably level 32 so I had to gain 5 more levels to even make the trial of the Gods manageable and I did that in less than 5  6 hours so even with a busy life floral this game is manageable he just have to be in the frame of mind to be able to drop it whenever or pick it up whenever. That being said it is a very very beautiful game and it is a far cry from the streets of syndicate in Victoria London where there are lots of buildings and everything to crime there is a fair bit of landscape still if you want to climb.
