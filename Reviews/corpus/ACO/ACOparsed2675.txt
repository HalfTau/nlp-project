Assassins Creed absolutely needed that year off. Genuinely enjoyable storyline, proper AC physics, and a vast open world with a variety of interactions that I personally didnt find to get stale or repetative through 39 hours of gameplay so far.The visuals in this game are truly stunning.I do find some hitching occasionally, but its not terrible.I dont think that Origins is as good as Black Flag, but I wasnt expecting it to be, so I was content.Persoanl opinion... I feel like I got my moneys worth. Huge improvment over Unity and Syndicate.
