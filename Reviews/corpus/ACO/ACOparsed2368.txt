Without question one of the best entries in the franchise, Assassins Creed Origins changes the typical Ubisoft forumla just enough to make it interesting again. Its not without its share of issues, though.Pros Amazing exploration Egypt is awesome Tons of stuff to do Looks great The controls feel really good Loot system is good, microtransactions are unobtrusive and not requiredCons Performance is all over the place Denuvo is cancer and probably contributing to said performance issues Combat is probably the worst its ever been Bayak is one of the weakest protagonists in the seriesFinal score 8/10
