AC games have been a long favorite of mine, though I pettered out at unity. I decided to give Ubisoft another chance and have been pleasently suprised.It is important to note, this is more of an RPG and not an Assassins Creed game. Gone are the awesome stealth kill abilities and focus on sneaking. GOne are running a business. Gone are the little cool details which made the AC games unique. This is sad and I have a feelinf AC will never actually be a stealth game ever again. You can just mindlessly hack and slash through this like eany other game. This does suck to see a game IP I have enjoyed in the past dumbed down for the masses. But this is the trend now. Stupid games for stupid people.However, if you approach this game as a hack and slash RPG, then you will find it fun and the areas that cater to a lower audinence are more easily tolerated, though never forgotten. There is little depth to the level system, all the skills do is basically more damage and nothing that helps you with stealth. So, go an enjoy the story, which has been fine so far and explore the very well done open world of Egypt.As long as you are not expecting to play an assassins Creed game, you will probably enjoy this. Also, playing in 4k at 60 FPS has been amazing. Kudos to the tech team at Ubi. Now if we can just get the gameplay people to re inject the previous depth of other AC games, this franachise may return in full force!
