The game is one of the best Ive played and I would say easily the best game came out in 2017. The combat is very satisfying, the RPG elements of the game are very well made, the story is very interesting and you want to know how it will continue, it never gets boring. Worth the price, if anyone is wondering to buy it or not, dont even think and get it!
