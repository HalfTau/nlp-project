Stabbed a lion so hard it fell through the ground. 7/10 would shatter the earth again.In all seriousness this game is a welcome addition to the AC universe. I think the addition of more RPG elements was a great idea and really makes you feel like you are gaining power. If you return to the starting area as a level 25 player the enemies practically disintegrate when you hit them.The spreading poison, and eagle spotting add to the game as well. I have mixed feelings about the crafting as on the one hand it helps you feel like you are growing in the game. On the other hand the requirement for the rare carbon crystals in high level crafting feels like it is trying to force you into buying gold instead of grinding for hours to get them all.The ability to keep any weapon you want and upgrade it to match your level is also welcome as you never outgrow one of your favorite weapons.That said there are still plenty of Ubiugs to go around in this game at release.The Berserk skill is useless now as you can no longer stealthily apply it. Using the skill now means it alerts everyone in the area, and the berserker enemy attacks you first.The lack of a proper countering method is alsoobvious when you encounter more than 3 enemies. Your options are to run away or change to a weapon that has a wide swing so you can hit multiple opponents at a time.Over all it is a good game but it is not worth 60. Buy this game for 40 or less. The deluxe edition is a joke that will only shorten your enjoyment of the game by skipping some of your playing time for money since it gives you rare weapons and starting cash.Full review below.
