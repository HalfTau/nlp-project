When i was a kid I wanted to explore, this game lets you do that,  its fun and thats all I want from a game.  Kinda makes me feel like indian jones a bit,  when im playing I wonder at times what im playing, its a bit whitcher, a bit obliviion a bit black flag,  over all the writing has me, im impressed with staff and thier imagination, after all imagination is what its all about. this is a game that all gamers should play
