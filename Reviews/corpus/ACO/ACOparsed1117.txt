This game is huge and very good looking, however i do have 2 major problems with it. The map has massive patches of desert entire regions with absolutely nothing in them. Yes, I do realize that is what Egypt is like irl, but considering the game is otherwise dense and filled with a variety of locations makes it feel like the developers wanted the size of the game map to be super large without actually doing the work to fill it up. If they would just remove those areas the game wouldnt be any worse for it and the map would still be very large. The second big problem is the leveling system with which many people have problems, so i wont go into much detail but overall it feels artificial. One way to fix it would be to have a larger variety of enemy types and have some be Higher level than others, but in the actual game all the enemies will be the same no matter where you go and difficulty will only be determined by location. Everything else about the game I love and I hope the next instalment is up to par.
