I totally loves this game probably one of the best Ive  played in the last few years. I genuinely dont know where to start but I gues Ill start with saying that the gameplay mechanincs are amazing just like the battle system, not flawless but still great.story wise its not the most impressive but still intreaging and makes you wanna continue playing. The games version of ancient Egypt is insanely detailed, historically accurate, huge and with a lot of things to do every where. But in my opinion so is the most impressive thing with this game its graphics and how stable it runs especially for being an Ubisoft game.The biggest down side to this game has to be the constant grinding to do the main story missions, but I loved that grinding since they somehow made it hella lot of fun. So honestly Id recommed this game to every one thats inte this kind of games.
