Ive played most of the Assassins Creed games and in general Im a huge fan. Every part has its own charm, some are better, some not that good but in general I really enjoy the series. Origins quickly became my favorite one along with Assasins Creed 2. Its a beautiful open world with so much to do, explore and doing side quests. So far I like and enjoy the story but as well like the large number of side quests available. Another reason why I enjoy this game more than other ones is the beautiful ancient Egypt era, personally I always enjoy ancient ages more than the modern eras or even medieval times. I dont have any performance issues, the game runs extremly smooth and I havent experienced any crashes or anything that affects my tasks on background. Also the deluxe version is absolutely worth the 10 extra  you got very nice outfit, mount, shield, 2 weapons and 3 ability points in return, which I find very well balanced for early game and later upgrade. I also find the general movement and climbing improved over the previous games.I am very pleased to recommend this game, no matter if you are new to the AC games or played previous ones.
