Apart from the usual bugs and horrible optimizations from Ubisoft, this is actually good. The combat is clunky, but its fun nonetheless, and we finally have memorable characters, a strong storyline and a protagonist who is actually lovable.And if all these dont work out for you, the game has some of the most amazing visuals in the recent times.
