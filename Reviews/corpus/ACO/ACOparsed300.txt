I would really love to play this game. I have over 2 hours logged but that is because I get stuck on the launch screen. I lauch, i get the origins picture on screen, then nothing. Eventually i open my task manager and it says the game is not respinding. I have no third party recording software or anything of the sprt installed and the game just wont launch. I have over the required specs, having a gtx1060, i7 7th gen, and 16 gigs of ram. I wish i could give a better review but until there is a patch i will not.
