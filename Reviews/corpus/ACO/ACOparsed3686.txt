This game has been great for 95 of the time I have played it. The other 5? Bugs, and constant crashes. Maybe its just my rig, but I play plenty of other games and have never had these problems. Fun when I can play it but too buggy for me to recommend to anyone. Wait for some patches and maybe keep an eye on it.For the game itself, the combat feels new and fresh for the series, a welcome change. Bayek isnt a special or interesting character IMo, but Aya, Cleopatra, and other characters more than make up for this in my opinion. Some interesting plot twists  so far anyway but nothin to write home about. I feel like this game is more an Action adventure side quest game than it is a stealth assassinate people type of game. Take that as you will.Sad I cant recommend it in its current state, because its a pretty decent game otherwise.
