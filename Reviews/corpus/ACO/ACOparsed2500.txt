Damn...This game is pure graphics porn. Think GTA V, but youre jacking camels instead of cars. You dont even have to have the latest and greatest GPU to run it, either. My 980 Ti averages 5560 fps 1440p with all of dat sweet, sweet eye candy maxed out.After eight hours Ive still barely touched the main story. Theres just so much to do in the form of side quests, exploring, hunting etc. I love the levelling systemin the beginning it gives you a strong sense of confidence as Bayek is oneshotting bandits and slicing up soldiers with ease. Its almost like the game is too easy then you accidently cross a border into a higher level region and he gets rekt by a hippo.Senu is the mutts nuts of in game companions. I reckon Ubi just wanted an excuse to show off their graphical artistry in the form of a literal birds eye view of the sceneryand oh, am I glad they did. Gone are the days when travelling to the next quest was just a mindless chore. Simply set your target on the map, tell your mount to head to it, and switch over to Senus view to enjoy the desert landscape.All in all, Grand Theft Camelas I shall henceforth refer to itis awesome. Buy it. You wont regret it. Seriously, its well worth it for Senu alone.10/10 would Camel again.
