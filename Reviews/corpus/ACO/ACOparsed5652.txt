The game was constantly crashing on my GTX 980 Ti regardless of the game settings, but I tried the game on a 1070 and it works great. 8 hours in, just left Siwa, having a ton of fun.From my experience so far, the microtransactions seem to be entirely optional  no pinch, no grind, etc. Ive found plenty of currency, weapons, and items just from looting. So, good job Ubisoft.Gameplay is solid, graphics are fantastic, and the voice acting is really good especially Bayek. There is a lot to do and its not feeling repetitive yet. Best of all the atmosphere/environment is really engaging and Im having a ton of fun just exploring.
