I dont write too many reviews, but I have to in this case. Ive played about 10 hours of the game as of this writing, and so far, this game is the best yet. It rivals Black flag My prior best AC game to date. The RPG elements are a nice touch, and the randomized loot system of getting weapons/shields with their own unique ratings and perks really wants one to search for every loot box in the area.The game hasnt really gotten grindy yet for me, and by the time Im done searching around the game prompts for the next area. It feels balanced. The enemies are hard, but not too so depending on your gaming experience, the difficulty seems to be about right. The exploration is augmented by the bird Senu, which you can control and scope the area from above. It helps make the world seem bigger than it already is.Another nice touch is the ondemand FPS counter and computer status. It provides the CPU  GPU usage, as well as your frames. I love this feature, and makes it much easier to tweak your settings. All games really should have this feature as part of the game.Im a bit biased as I was always enamoured by ancient Egypt, and this game really makes you feel you are there. Much to do, and the streets are alive with goingson. Seems more alive than Black Flag, which I thought some cities were pretty thought out.Ive been getting pretty good frames avg. 100 on the default settings the game placed for me I have a i7 4790k w/ GTX1070.I hope you find this review useful!
