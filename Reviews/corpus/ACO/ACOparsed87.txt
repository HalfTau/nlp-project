My favourite entry in the series,the engine and free running mechanics introduced in unity are slightly tuned but still great.The new combat and RPGlike leveling are fun, and keep the semirepetitive mapclearing i have always liked in assassins creed to remain fun and challenging.Graphics and performance were great on my system, i was able to run on max settings without any noticeable performance issues on a 1070  7700k 2560x1080.the main story probably takes about 2530 hours if you dont rush, i played for about 6070 hours and am pretty close to 100 bunch of side missions and a few tombs left. this is one of the best value games in the assassins creed series.id give the game a 9/10my only con is the sometimes annoying annimations in combat, which will make you fail a dodge or get detected for no reason, but this was never a big issue
