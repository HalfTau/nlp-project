The best AC game since Brotherhood in my opinion. Byak is the first protagonist in an AC game besides Altair and Ezio whom I actually remember his name haha. Envirments are beautiful. The story is pretty well written although it does feel a bit rushed at times Cleopatra meets you for two seconds and suddenly makes you her protector. The map is overwhelmingly huge but they still managed to polish every nook and cranny. If you havent played Assassins creed for awhile or ever, this a great place to pick it back up. Microtransactions are annoying but not really in your face. Solid 8/10.
