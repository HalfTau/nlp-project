I got to say this is the BEST assassins creed game well that and black flag, im so glad they held back a year to polish this game. Im very easy to please and i cant say anything bad about this game. Runs beautifully on my pc, graphics are mind blowing, game pl ay is fun, doesnt feel tedius like other instalments.Being an Ancient Egypt history buff, they sure do it justice, pure Architecture porn and loreThe RPG elements feel fresh but kinda poor comparing it to other RPGs, but the combat feels new compared to easy counter  guns blazing previous Asscreed games.while its not 10/10 perfect it was worth every  peso to me.
