Ive finised the original AC, AC2, AC2 Brotherhood and Revelations, I could not stand any AC game that came after those.AC Origins broke that trend. The new fight system is very reminiscent of the Witcher and Dark Souls style, you have to think on your feet to dodge, block and parry, quite enjoyable.The quests are interesting, there is still the usual fetch me this and find me that, but it doesnt bother me much.The best part of the game I would say is the ancient tombs exploration and the whole feel of Ptolemaic Egypt, the Nile, crocodiles and hippos, all bring that wild feel to the game.Yes, Bayek is a bit OP with his personal eagle drone, but I still find it very useful, so it doesnt bother me much.As usual Ubisoft did an excellent job on graphics, design and  aesthetics of the game. I heard of some performance issues but didnt experience anything unusal from a ubisoft game.In conclusion, if you miss the old AC, this game is for you.
