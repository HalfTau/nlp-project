Simply awesome. I really like the Egyptian setting, and the plot has been much easier to follow than previous games thus so far. On my current rig, it runs very smoothly consistently 60 FPS at medium high settings with minimal lag. From the diagnostics Ive run, it is much more GPU than CPU heavy, but my 3GB 1060 is working just fine at mediumhigh settings. Graphics in general are very well executed and often photoworthy. Map is huge and VERY explorable. Overall I couldnt be happier with the purchase. 8.9/10
