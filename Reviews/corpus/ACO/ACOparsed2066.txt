Ive played all the AC games except AC Brotherhood, and I didnt think I was going to enjoy this, and Im tired of playing the same things over and over again. I got tired of the lackluster protagonists since Ezio, and the collectibles were tiring chores.I can safely say this game is one of the best in the entire series. Not once did I get bored with this installment. The RPG elements really paid off on this goaround. The story is pretty solid as well. The game mechanics arent stupid.If youre an Assassins Creed fan, youll love this. If youre not, and not sure which AC game to play, definitely choose this one. AC2 and AC4 were very solid for its time, but Origins is a great allaround.
