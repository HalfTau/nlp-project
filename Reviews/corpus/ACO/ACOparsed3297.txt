This game is not like its predecessors. Its much better. Im glad Ubisoft took their time on this one and waited a year. With a vast, open world to explore and numerious side missions available for the player this game was worth the wait and leaves a lot for the player to do. I was so captivated by the environment that I didnt want to proceed with the story until I got bored of looking around.
