Gameplay and story is sick. All the side missions are awesome. Nothing wrong with the gameplay...But if you buy the season pass they DO NOT give you a couple to a few DLC packs. Instead they try to force you to buy them in different ways. Youy can earn the first civilization armor ingame but have to pay for the weapons and mount with helix points which you have to purchase with more money. They give you the outfit ingame to try and force you to buy the new dlc with more money. So why tf is there a season pass? Oh yeah only for the money. Ubisoft is extremely greedy. The game and story is sick like i said but behind the game is pure greed. Ubisoft is not for the community at all. Only for the money. Do not get this if you like to earn everything in assassins creed. Theres even a glitch in the achievments where you cannot get them all. So im stuck at 49/50 when i have the 50th completed...wtf...i gave these s a break when the game was first out and there were glitches left and right and because i understand what a developer goes through but that doesnt matter when all they want is money. Game is a HUGE money pit so be careful. I bought the season pass but that was a mistake and i will not be buying any NONseason pass DLCs.
