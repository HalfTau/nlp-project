Surprisingly a very good game. Minus a bug here or there  wouldnt be UBISOFT if it didnt have some of those. But no major game breaking ones.Felt a little betrayed by the last boss battle, but other than that. Great game play through. Lots of little things  you pick up as you go through the game that leads to other things weve already known about the assassins. Was kind of fun finding all those origins Thank you UBISOFT for restoring a little faith back into your game developement.
