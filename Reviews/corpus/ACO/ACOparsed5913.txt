I will start with this,  already review the game is boring but after finish it with almost 94 achievement 2 bugged out which I will talk about the good the game edited the fighting system which is cool so close to witcher 3 a lot of side story and quest which are fun if they are somehow related to the main story or add something. amazing viewminigames I call it the race, the arena and soon the trails in DLC all in all, if you want more of AC and love the black flag and what comes before you will love it.the bad things even after the fix 1.3 personal point of viewthe annoying things  some dialogs are boring, out of place and sometimes bugs out no sound which requires me to restart the game. you got overwhelmed by the abilities in hand if you max and often you will not use them. for me, AC main story end in the 3rd game still enjoy some Egyptian history and not so much direct contact with the main story the Assassins vs the Knights Templar.BUY IT  if you are a fan of AC and want improvement if you want a lot of gameplay 50 for 100 it, to pass if you hope for the main story and what happens outside the Animus
