Choosing to take the Assassins Creed style and flavor and overlay it with all the best elements of an RPG was something I was wary of but paid off beautifully. Couple that with dedication to the lore so far, absolutely breathtaking graphics and symbolism, and this is hands down my favorite Assassins Creed game. Top five favorite games of all time period, too, and Ive logged 160 hours on the Witcher 3.
