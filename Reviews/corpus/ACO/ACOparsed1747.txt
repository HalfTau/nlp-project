So i was actually enjoying this game but after loading it up to play again i noticed that it hadnt saved and i literally lost HOURS of gameplay....so i have lost all motivation to finish this game. if you pick it up youre warned that one day you might boot it up and realize it hadnt saved a single thing for hours
