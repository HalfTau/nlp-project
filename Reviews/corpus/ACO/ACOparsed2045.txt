This is the best game ive ever played! There is so much to explore and so much to do in the game! Its such a big map too that you can spend hours just exploring if you whant. The best is that its not only land you can explore but also under whater and in caves and pyramides. Mabye the game is taking alot of time because you need to hunt for animals etc to upgrade your armoure but it can be fun to do that too! I dont care if it cost 50 its so worth it! The grapics and fighting system are so ing amazing i played 38 hour in 2 days. Defently buy this game! You wont regret it!!! Mad props developers!!!!
