Not experiencing any of the performance issues alot of users here are, though I guess its largely dependant on your system. In my case, I get a stable 60FPS at 1920x1080 with these specs 256GB 850 EVO GTX 970 i7 7700kGame itself is pretty great, looks absolutely stunning, gameplay is streamlined and smooth and doesnt get stale quickly like other Assassins Creed titles.I actually like the new combat style, its nice that theyve diverged from the old parry and kill, batmanesque fighting. Your character now progresses in a meaningful way, with a skill point system much like any other RPG, points go in the direction of either Hunter bows, Fighter melee balls to the walls, Tool Dude Guy use traps and shiz.Story is engaging and seems well written and narrated, though Im not too deep into it yet. Cutscenes follow suite in visual style and actually tell a great story.Here are some negativesMicro transaction should not be in a 50 game. This isnt as big a deal as it sound, the things you can buy arent even important, and are mostly negligible. If you dont buy them, it wont take away from your enjoyment at all. Theres still something that pisses me off about it. This and the fact that they have so many ing versions, i.e Deluxe Edition, Gold Edition... etc. Classic ubisoft trying to grab as much cash as possible.There are also a few bugs, they arent so bad, but still I shouldnt notice several bugs in the first few hours of a game.Forcing uplay also sucks.. blah blah.. you get the idea, the usual crap that comes with ubishit games.Overall I think its important to realize that a fair amount of the negative reviews here are from people experiencing performance issues. If youre reading the reviews to figure out whether or not this is a good game it is... if it runs for you.Buy it, see if it runs okay, if it doesnt, refund.
