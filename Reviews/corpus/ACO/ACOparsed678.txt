Fixed the crashing issue so Ill give a proper review. This game is the savior of the Assassins Creed series. If Ubisoft continues to make their games as good as this, I think they have a good chance of reddeming themselves from the  show that they have been putting on the past few years.One suggestion to Ubisoft would be to stop using denuvo or any DRMs for that matter, its not helping with the optimisation of this game. Please make your games DRM free Ubisoft, the gamers would surely appreciate it.
