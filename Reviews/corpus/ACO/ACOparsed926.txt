Assassins Creed Origins is a good game, no doubt. The gameplay is very good and it looks absolutely stunning. But the optimization is horrible. I have a ryzen 3 1200 overclocked  3.8 ghz and a gtx 970, yet the game keeps stuttering and occasionally stops and loads for a few seconds at a time. It takes forever to load in surrounding characters and now when youre riding an animal. I definitely dont recommend this game until there is better optimization, which I expect knowing that the game is almost unplayable with the stutter, frame rate drops, and loading.
