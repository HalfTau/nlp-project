Havent played an AC game since the pirate one. Let me just say this game is amazing. Really like the feel of this game with the movement controls and what not. I have just finished the first zone completely and the story is very compelling and interesting so far. The combat is butter smooth and the weapons look cool too. You can play your way either with bows, dual swords, or spear/mace/sword and shield. The talent trees are well laid out and there are amazing camel mounts too. Mounted combat is fun for sure.This game plays like a typical ubisoft game with the AC style of missions, area discovery, and objects to pickup  so if you hate this kind of style dont get it. Would have prefered there to be no season pass, but what can you do. Almost every game these days have paid dlc or season pass t.Im not having any graphics issues on my end or low fps what so ever. Played 5 hrs straight and never went below 100 fps.gtx 1080i7 modern16 gb ram
