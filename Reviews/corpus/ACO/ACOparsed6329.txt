This game is amazing! Yeah, I know that its not like previous assassins creeds, but there remained the good part of it!It has borowed lots of RPG genre features from Witcher 3, some details form Rise of The Tomb Raider, but still we have the good old assassins creed! The graphics are decent, the map is giant and all the NPCs are more alive like ever before. I havent seen any bugs yet, but Ubisoft learned something after releasing Assassins Creed Unity and optimised it so u can play on ultra with 50fps on gtx 960.The gameplay is what attracts here the most, you always want to do something. But im sure that most of u will change a lot of key bindings because sometimes you get stuck between Alt and Space, and the sprint is also removed which is a good thing because the game change it automatically so u wont have to hold shift while getting form one point to another.I definetely recommand buying it, Im sure you wont regret it!
