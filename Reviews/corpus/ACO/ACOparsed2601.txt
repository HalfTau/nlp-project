Buy this Game!This is one of the best game experiences Ive ever had. The game stands out with one of the best open worlds Ive ever played in. The detail is incredible. The game gives you a ton to do. Im around 30 hours and Im only around the half of the story, with a lot of sidequests left. The battle system in my opinion is really fun, however gets a bit repetitve after time. Stealth is awesome. The personalisation is really cool with a ton of sweet looking weapons or clothing options. Overall a great experience.
