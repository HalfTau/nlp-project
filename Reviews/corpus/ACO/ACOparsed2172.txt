So I have basically just started playing but I am loving it. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and I just love the whole ancient Egyptian theme and the hiroglyphs everywhere. Its amazing.The only thing that really seems to irritate me about the game is that the controls are not the same as the previous games. Its not even similar so it takes a bit of getting used to.But otherwise I definitely recommend this game from what I have played so far.
