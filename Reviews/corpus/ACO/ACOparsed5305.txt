AC origins is the next installment in the assassins creed series the new combat is great and much more involved then simply waiting to press b over and over to kill 1000 enemies, this will be the standard for new ac games to come. The setting is amazing the characters are memorable and the open world is loaded with content. Not to mention the visuals are pretty damn good if you have upper mid range hardware although at the time of this review there are many well known performance isssues especially with I5 processors, all in all no game is perfect at the start just look at the witcher my favourite game of all time, even had issues for the first little while, provided ubisoft patches the issues this is definately a goty contender in my book.
