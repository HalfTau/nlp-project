DONT, just dont. Im sure by now everyone has seen all the reviews of the 100 CPU usage. I thought maybe there rigs where just outa date or not powerful enough. I have a 2017 razor blade and meet well above all the recomended specs, I was sure I would have no problems. I WAS WRONG. just loading the game up my CPU hits 100 I tried to play the game but only got maybe 30 min intil i decided it wasnt worth it. I was running at 100 the entire 30 min. THIS GAME WILL BREAK YOUR COMPUTER. I am not going to even touch it until they come out and say the proble has been fixed
