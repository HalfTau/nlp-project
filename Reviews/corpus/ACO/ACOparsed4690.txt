This game is a great entry into the series and has really set the standard of what I expect and hope to see in the future of Assassinss Creed.The map is absoutley masive populated with npcs that make the game feel alive. They all have tasks and jobs.The side missions are amazing. They add so much depth and content to the surounding world.Combat system is great. I do recomend playing on the highest diffuclty though. And combat never feals old with thenew RPG system.The story is so intresting and really makes you invest into the game.As for bugs, I only encountered 1 and that was on day one of the game.I have a GTX 960 and can get about 40 fps on meduim settings.This game is 10/10
