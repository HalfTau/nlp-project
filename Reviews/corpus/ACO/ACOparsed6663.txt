ThereareathousandHamletsinathousandpeopleseyes.I will not believe in the game reviewers any more. The assassins series are MacDonald, this will never change, and I prefer the healthy ones like DarkSouls or MetalGear series.PS I dont think the difficulty in this game is reasonablely hard, its hard just for BEING hard, like a clumsy imitator.
