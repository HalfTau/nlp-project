The scale and detail of the world is crazy. Really pulls you in. Gameplay is fun and immersive, combat is almost perfect in my opinion but needs a little refinement and polishing. Performance is great, hardly any bugs or none that really take away from the experience of the game. The new RPG elements improve the series tremendously, although I feel they couldve added a little more features that wouldve made the gameplay perfect. The only problem I have with this game, and almost every AC game besides the original AC, is the writing. I cant stand it. Its in awful, like a 10 year old girl wrote it or someshit. Sometimes its honestly cringeworthy. Sometimes it got so bad and dumb that I had to stop playing it. There are some decent scenes where the script and voice acting isnt completely terrible,but very few. Like jesus christ man. The few times I started to feel engaged in the story, one of the horribly writing side quests or next missions just killed it for me. It couldve been done so much better and in my opinion, the story couldve made this game of the year if they did write. The witcher 3 I felt lacked not a lot, but some gameplay depth, but its story made up for it. But I love the gameplay of Origins.So Id give the gameplay a 9.5and the Story like, a 4.Its a dope game but just coudlve been way doper ya feel.Jack J.
