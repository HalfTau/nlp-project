First of all, ignore users giving this game a bad review who write a book on here. They have 20  hours of playtime, and critique the game as if retouching the mona lisa. Lets get realistic, with that much time in it, they like it, they are just trying to sound smart while at the same time being hypacritical, the game is fun overall, the game is not shaped for one particular person, thats impossible.Its huge, full of things to do all the time, beautiful scenery and storyline.Perfect? Maybe not, some peopel on here give it a bad review because its not as perfect as the hope diamond, skip past those, its fun and enjoyable. Get it.
