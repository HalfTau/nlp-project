This is one of the greatest games that has come out in a very long time. The story is amazing. Even the side quests are a lot of fun. The map is enormous so it feels like Ill never get bored of it or run out of things to do. Absolutely beautiful environment. I dont want to spoil the story but Ill say its definitely worth playing. Its surprisingly historically accurate as well.
