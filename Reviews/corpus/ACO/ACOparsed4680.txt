I played the original Assassins Creed when it came out and it was one of my favorite games. After the boringly iterative and samey sequels I stopped playing any games from the franchise for a number of years. I picked up Origins on a whim after hearing positive things about the revamped combat system and I have to say Ive been completely blown away by just how much Ive loved playing the game.The combat is enjoyable and weapons feel weighty and satisfying. The new parry/dodge system is solid, although it is a little easy after you get the hang of different types of enemies.The main quest is good, although I was particularly impressed by the quality of a few side quests which I actually enjoyed more than the main questline.Overall, this is a suprisingly refreshing addition to the Assassins Creed franchise and gives me hope for the next AC game/upcoming DLC for Origins which is something I havent had in a very long time.
