Ubisoft has been dropping the ball for quite a while with their games, but I can safely say that Assassins Creed Origins is a sign that theyre improving! Pros/cons that I can think ofProsGraphics are gorgeous, as usualCombat is overhauled and more fleshed out this time aroundBayek the protagonist is likable and has a worthy causeThe setting is more than welcome in Egypt, which mixes the fascinating setting with Romans and GreeksThe locations are much less obvious lack of minimapThere is a lot to do and youll often get caught up in sidequests and exploringI have not experienced a single bug in all my time playing so farOptimization is pretty good running on GTX 970, AMD FX8350, and 20GB of RAMThe open world is absolutely MASSIVEGreat weapon varietyMicrotransactions are intrusive but they are 100 optional and are not PaytoWin in any wayConsThe music leaves much to be desired especially for an Assassins Creed gameThe ambient dialogue and voice acting in general seems less qualityStealth is a little bit gimped compared to previous gamesSome required segments in the game seem forced and will get tediousOverall, it is a really high quality game and arguably one of the better games in the series. Even if youre not a fan of the series, its worth getting into this one simply for the setting and gorgeous scenery alone.
