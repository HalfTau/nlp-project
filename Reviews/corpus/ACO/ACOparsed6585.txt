I get 4045 FPS on my desktop and 65 on my laptop. Specs at bottom.Deffinitly a thumbs up for me. I highly recomend this gameHere is why...The game is fun to play. I love the leveling system and the fact that you cant just tank around like youre indestructable.I absolutly aplaud the fact that you can automate the following of roads/your waypoint when youre mounted. Makes the game much more user friendly and gives you a chance to enjoy the surroundings.I think the voice acting is very good and the lip sync is actually well executed enough to focus on what their saying lol.The graphics are good, absolutly no studder and have not run into any kind of pay wall yet.I have no cons about the game yet and I almost believe that I wont find any for a long time.10/10 great job Ubisoft Montreal.
