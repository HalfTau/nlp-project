I would gladely recomend this game. It is way better then the more recent releases of AC, but yes, the game those have optimization problems. I have a GTX1070 and a i5 skylake, and have to run the game at around medium to high texture settings for decent FPS. However i still absoulutly love the game and how theyve done it. you have quests insted of missions which gives you the ability to hop out of a main quest to do a side guest you might find more interesting. Im going to recomend this game for everything you can do in it, but i think they shouldve ad some more kinds of shops and optimized the game a little better compared to what it has been.
