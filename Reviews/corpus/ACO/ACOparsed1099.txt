Ive read some of the comments before buying this game, and honestly, I still felt a bit uneasy. Due to the past AC games, which I did play, Ive always found them shallow and got fed up quite quickly. The huge worlds felt empty, lack of interesting things to do, lack of good story.AC Origins changed that. The game is much more engaging, the map is HUGE, you got more quests than what to with with and the world feels like a vibrant living world. I see some elements from other games have also been embedded in this game, which a very good step in the right direction.AC Origins is not a game bug/problem free, but it is an exceptional good game in which you will sink hours on end while enjoying gorgeous graphics and amazing action. I just hope Ubisoft learned its lesson.
