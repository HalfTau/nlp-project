Terribly optimized. Ubisht seems to have put VMProtect to protect Denuvo, and hogged a ton of CPU usage thanks to that. I have a i77700k OCd at 4.8GHz stable and a GTX 1080 OCd to 2100MHz but still cant maintain a stable 1080p60fps. Dont buy it, wait till they patch it.Edit January 2018Its a decent game. Still laggy af but the beauty of the game kinda makes it worth the purchase on sale.Gameplay Soso, a step up from previous ACs lackluster combat and weapon system. Stealth option are much more viable and enjoyable overall. Didnt do much swordplay aside from forced combats so wont comment much on that. Though theres too much  grinding, but can be skipped with trainers optionally.Story Not the best out of ACverse, but its alright. Interesting and cheesy enough to make it worth while.The world is expansive, beautiful, wellcrafted. Almost Every frame is a picture. Just that theres way too much clutters on UI, but if you turn off UI completely then it lacks specific features needed For example, theres always a giant Press  to call Senu when objective is nearby. Its completely unnecessary and should be optional, considering how quest log gave actual hint on how to find target. Yes, you can turn call senu off by turning hud to minimal, but then the quest log hint will also be gone.Ubisoft please make UI customizable.tldr6/10 for gameplaystory as is.8/10 if you want to enjoy the story and the beautifullycrafted world and willing to compromise to use trainers to soften the grind or skip it completely.
