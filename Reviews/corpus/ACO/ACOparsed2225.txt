Im writing this not cause I want to, but because I feel like I have to. VMProtect and Denuvo cause 100 CPU and GPU use for me constantly. Not only does this drastically undermine performance, it causes other programs on my computer to run strange such as my taskbar becoming multiple times its normal size. Ubisoft is once again taking a relatively enjoyable game Imo moreso than recent Assasins creeds like Unity/Syndicate or Black Flag and ruining it because of disgusting anticonsumerist practices. Until Ubi has the guts to fix their game, I recommend you look elsewhere.
