TLDR Spend your money on something else.I really had my hopes up for this one.As someone who has played every installment in the franchise, I was excited at the prospect of going back to the origins of the order in ancient Egypt. I remember playing the first game when it came out and thinking that this was a game with quite a bit of wonk, but the premise was interesting. Egypt seemed like a great way to expand upon some of the themes and ideas of the first AC made with the lessons learned from a decade of making these games.Alas, it was not to be.The new combat system is perhaps the worst part of the game. I see how the combat was supposed to be a huge leap forward. They were supposed to listen to the feedback. They were to take the riposte and wait for counter promtheavy part of the other games and make it infinately more interesting. Deep. Fun. It is neither of these things. The control scheme is unintuitive and the difficulty is mostly based on it being clumsy and poorly made.I see a lot of users make references to The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. It makes me question wether any of these people have actually played TW3 or are parroting pitch lines from Ubisoft. If they would have picked up Wild Hunts combat controls, perhaps it would be playable. Right now the overreliance on bumpers during combat accomplishes little else besides spreading carpal tunnel to the masses.I am used to letting AC games off easy, as they usually are fun. I loved fighting a bit, sneaking a bit and running around to my hearts content. Picking up weird stuff and building bases. They were my equivalent of a blockbuster action movie. They might have flaws, the story could be empty and all function over form, the characters flat as Denmark. Yet fun. ACO has all of these flaws, but takes out the parkour and makes the combat nearly unplayable. Add to this that it runs poorly, you may as well save your money.This is my biggest disappointment of the year.
