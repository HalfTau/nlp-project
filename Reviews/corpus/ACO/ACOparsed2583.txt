gone are the overpowered tactics of block and counter, but thats a good thingwhile i miss the way i could finish a battle with a quickdraw from my pistol or 4 that we had in black flags at least now i can clear out fortresses again without waking everyne upthe level system might not be everyones favorite, but at least we get a lot of cool looking weapons, and i wonder what they are made of, if i can carry 2 bows, a sword and great axe and still run as good as that time i woke up almost naked in the desert in game
