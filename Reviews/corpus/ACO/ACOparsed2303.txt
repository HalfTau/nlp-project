Well I played all of the previous Assassins Creed games and every one of them felt like you are playing the same game, not in a bad way, it had its continuity, like you picked up where you left of in the last game. But this game.. It had the feeling like something brand new. Maybe its because of the new combat style or the importance of looting and leveling. It feels more like a medieval fantasy RPG game than the rest of the Assassins Creed games. But that doesnt mean it lost its soul. No the soul of the creed is still there. Thats why I loved it. So different yet so familiar. Cant wait for the Season Pass content.
