So far no problems at all. Its been running smooth as silk and Ive been getting 90100 FPS on maxed out settingsrunning on i77700K delid at 5GHz, MSI 1080 Ti Lightning Z and 32GB RAM  3200MHz.The game itself is out of this world, the graphics are amazing and the response time is also great. The Egyptian world is very finely detailed and there are endless places to explore.So far Im hooked!
