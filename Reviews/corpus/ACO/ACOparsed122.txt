I have always been a fan of the Assassin creed Series. I have played every single one of them although not all of them to completion. After the Story of Ezio ended I had a hard time getting back into the series and after getting hyped for Unity and being let down by that game I had lost faith ibn the assassin creed series as a whole. I gave this game a chance because they changed the formula and it was a great change.The new combat system is amazing. Definetly not the best out there but the rpg elements added definetly made this game worthwile.Ubisoft made a great game by mixing elements from their own assassin creed elements, witcher 3 elements, etc. They tried to add all of the things that we liked out of all the games and managed to work it all together perfectly. I highly recommend this game to anyone and especially recommend it to assassin creed fans who have left the series due to the rinse and repeat aspect that the other games have had int the past. I am excited to see how they add to this new style of gameplay in future assassin creed games.
