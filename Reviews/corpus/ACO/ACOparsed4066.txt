EditAfter a break from the game, and an updatethat shouldnt have fixed anythingThe game seems to have come back to a staple cpu usage, still its at 80  but i can play it with a steady 60 fps at ultra so i got nothin more to complain about.thanks for the help provided by the support, thought nothing work.I spend an hour on a phone call with them to figure out what was wrong and it seemed to be nothin since i just had to wait.so my review is kinda just here for now, you can read it if you want, and thanks dev for responding.anywaysSo however good this games story is, i cant recommend it.what evers going on with all this, game crash and cpu load.the game is unplayable, i cant play the game anymore, because out of nowhere two days ago the 9th of november the game just decided to roof my cpu at a 100 and everything started laggin and whatnot.ofcourse im already in contact with support but all i get is update this and do that which has nothing close to an effect.im also seeying more and more people having problems with the game and i dont see a pattern, but all i can say is that if you want to buy it, its on you there is a chance that you can play it fine like i did the first week or that it just go apeon your cpu from day 1 or day 10.story is 7/10 and thats a 10 on the normal scala for assasins creed gamesthe open world is amazing i like it, still it lacks depth.combat is a hmm something to be worked on, its nice and smooth but has too many random elements when area and movement comes into play.engine, what ever that this game is build on, i like where its going from wildlands to this to maybe farcry 5.denouv and vrm not so much 1/10editSupport 10/10
