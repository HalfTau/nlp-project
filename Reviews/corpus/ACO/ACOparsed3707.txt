Im a big fan of AC Series,but not from those,who have all good things to say no matter what.For me,ACOrigins is a very good game,with a marvellous history and a beautifull graphic.This game gave me a lot of answersi make every AC game to the 100,and also gave me a lot of pleasure.But this title have a lot of troublesgame this big always have some troubles,but its nothing what can make you drive crazy AF.As 99 people i also have a problem with 100CPU usageim playing on a potato g2030 3ghzx,but the game works great pasing over game freezesCPU.Sometimes i had a bug where Bayek didt listen to my walking commands and when i press D so he can go to the right,he goes foreward or to the left and for a while he turn in the right direction.Sometimes enemy stuck in walls or towerswhen he came down using a ladder.You can repair this by leaving a location and returning back .On the start of the game i had a problem with useing bow and Senu because,there was millisecond freeze of the mouse pointer and pointer goes 5km in the wrong direction,this problem i solved by turning on framerate limiter.And finally,i have something to say about history of the events presented in the game.As far as i go trough the game,i was sucked by this whole mystery of Lyla and Bayek/Aya .Their histories are too shortLylas for shure.I was waiting for the appearing of the Cezar and a scene of murdering him as was said in previous games...feast for the eyes,BUT.... YouUbisoft gave us the perfect history where there is no satisfying ending.You, do here  something like the ending inthat game You cut the end of the game because there is no possibility to get rid of feelig where the hell is the rest of the game?!? !.Here in ACOrigins you also do somethig like that with histories of Lyla and Bayek .Aya had perfect ending,but i wanted something more after the ending,something like what Bayek do after Aya goes to Rome and do what she must do or The history of old Bayek...What with te staff and an apple?what with that histories from the tombs and the greater meanings?. Where the hell is story about what happened to Juno like in the previous games?!?! ?.All those questions are still remain unnoticable,but who knows....maybe patches...maybe dlc, i see a GREAT  potential to many histories based on this in game time of events  .So,though this entire problems and things that i think is missing ,the game is good as hell,and still i have 2030h of the game to make 100 .I give this game ... 9/10 .There is some things to do ,but they are cosmetic ,and im waiting for MANY of great Dlcs.
