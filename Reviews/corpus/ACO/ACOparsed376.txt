This is the best AAA game Ive played in a long while.I had a ton of fun exploring Egypt and actually learning a bit about the history as well.I would seriously recommend this game to anyone who wants an ultra refined assassins creed game with Far Cry elements sprinkled in! totally revamped assassins creed formula awesome RPG elements leveling, gear quality, damage...etc intriguing story dealing with a pyramid of animal themed bosses cool cast of characters gorgeous landscapes and scenery cool Egyptian history and themes detailed tombs and dungeons to explore huge map filled with interesting events  quests large variety of both melee and ranged weapons hunting to improve base gear set through crafting stealth can get you through 90 of the game microtransactions present and pushed here and there enemy variety is a bit slim the arena seems to purposely waste time between fights
