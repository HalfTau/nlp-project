Overall its a pretty solid game BUT its not a very good Assasins Creed. It improves upon its last 2 predecessors which isnt that hard to begin with but instead of stealth they put a lot more effort on the fighting mechanics. It introduces a lot of mechanics and they are fairly well done but many other games already did that better. The main character reminds me of Adrian Pierce with protagonist being so shallow and his main arch being the death of his son and the world itself is fairly empty. Its a step in the right direction and a decent game but its not an Assasins Creed.
