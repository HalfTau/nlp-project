This game was not in my bucket list, nor i was considering it to buy it in near future. Saw the reviews of game which was positive, So thought to give it a try.This is not the same Assassin creed Game which we are used to play. This is different from its predecessors, thats make this game unique and awesome. After the witcher 3 every single player games were doomed to me, But this is awesome.The protagonist of the game Bayek is so relatable, the world is so big and beautiful, most of the time you will just roam to see its beauty created by the developer.Side quest are awesome and have its own soul.I have 50 hours in game and i havent yet finished act 2 after which 3 more story act remains.I love the new mechanics of the game and how its play. There was some problems with the cpu usage, which is now fixed.At 1440p High setting am running this game around 80 to 90 fps in big cities in games and around 100 t0 120 in open areas of the map.There are also weekly challenges in game for the player who love to explore the game after the completion of the story.Overall its a great game for the assassin creed franchise and the gamers who love it.
