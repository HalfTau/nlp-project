there are many more types of weapons. Upgrading armor is not so grindy and I love the lore. I actually enjoy hearing the story. You can still assassinate people like always. One cool upgrade is having the bird to scout for you so you can see from above. It makes the game a little quicker to get through those retardied long quests. This is my favorite Assassins Creed so far. I just hate when they make you snap to the Animus all the time... Its stupid. Id give this game a solid 8/10, and thats only because it still has that damn console feeling because it was ported to the PC.
