AC Origins reminds me of AC2 in a few ways, it is a good game that looks pretty, has a new combat system, new progression system  and a sense of adventure. ACO is a good game IMO because of how ubisoft flexed its world building muscles to create one of the most interesting open worlds I have explored in any game. The Hidden Ones Dlc is pretty short though, but for 10 id say its worth getting because of how it ties up some plot threads. 9/10
