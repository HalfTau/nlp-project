A great game, fun to play with an engrossing story. Bayek and Aya are wonderful MCs. The story is powerful and moving, although by 2/3s of the way through, you can see exactly how it will end, and yet the ending still feels forced and sad and unfulfilling. However, Im definitely looking forward to the sequels. Heartily recommend.
