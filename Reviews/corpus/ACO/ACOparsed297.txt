Game is amazingly indepth and very different from the oter AC games. WHich doesnt constitute a bad thing, but however the combat has been completely changed and I preferred the previous style. This one is well and good, mind you, just differenet, but like previous stated, I preferred the old method. this method however fits the current AC genre.
