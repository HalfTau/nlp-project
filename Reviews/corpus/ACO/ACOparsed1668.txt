Wouldnt ever believe that one of the best games ever I play would be an Assassins Creed game, but here it goes this is one of the best games Ive come across in recent years. They really worked hard to revise and revive the whole AC formula and they succeeded big time here.Not only is the game simply gorgeous but also interesting to play thanks to it parkour, combat and interesting main and side quests. Even considering to get Season Pass. Alright, enough reading, go and buy it. Thank me later.
