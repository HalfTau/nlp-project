This is the best Assassins Creed since Black Flag. The world is beautiful, the characters look and act amazing and ancient Egypt is full of secrets.The game runs actually better than both Syndicate and Unity and youll get around 45 FPS with a GTX 1070, 16GB RAM and a Core i7 4770K on Ultra details 2560x1440.Black Flag is still my absolute favourite of the series. You just cannot beat hanging out on a pirate ship, battling the Royal Navy while listening to a thundering score composed by Brian Taylor.
