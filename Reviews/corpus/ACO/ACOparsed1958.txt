AC Origins brings refreshing changes to the franchise. The game is stunningly beautiful. The new combat system is a lot more engaging and requires you to think and plan your attacks whereas before you just spam attack and counter attacks. The new eagle vision is so much better and quests are interesting with lots of variety.
