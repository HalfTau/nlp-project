Grapics are amazing, really set you in Egypt and the photo mode setting allows you to appreciate the scenery further. The gameplay was way beyond my expectations from playing prior entries and i loved it, especially the use of the bow and arrows...what may be a con is that youre not really incentivised to play fully stealth as your arsenal screams go guns blazing but i was still able to play alot of it stealth and it really made me think my way through bandit camps as it is easier to get detected.But all in all, it was worth me paying full price for.
