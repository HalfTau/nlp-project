Absolutely fantastic game, I have already finished the story which was incredibly investing.People claim to be having lag in game, and I think they are tting I haveGTX 960 4GB GPUAMD FX8350 CPU  4.0 GHZ16GB RAM2TB Seagate Barracuda HDDI play on medium graphic settings which still looks astounding and have a constant 60 fps, except in large urban areas where I experienced fairly minor drops.The new combat system is incredible and extremely challenging against higher level enemies. The levelling is good however in the latter stages of the game the amount of skill points redeemable feels off in terms of pacing, and in the end becomes a huge grind just to get one additional thing on the skill tree.Stealth is fairly good however I felt there was a few things missing such as double assassinations, a button for hiding behind cover you still can but I prefer the reassurance I am definately covered and the fact guards can see you in grass even though it is massively obvious as usual XD.  I feel both mechanics are far harder but much more satisfying and the rpg elements are also very good, increasing health and damage really gives you an edge over the enemies. Another good thing is the fact they have made multiple saves and difficulties which is a really nice feature. Lastly I highly recommend this game, however currently the DLC is extremely overpriced based on the AAA price for the game itself.
