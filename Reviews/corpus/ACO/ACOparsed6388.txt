Seemed like an ok game compared to the previous Assassins Creed games Ubisoft has pooped out. However, the optimization was terrible. On mediumhigh settings, the game looked akin to a 2014 game and ran at 80ish FPS on my 1070, with constant dips down to even around 40 fps in certain areas. I enjoyed the combat, but when Im used to 144 fps on my 144hz monitor, 40 fps was unplayable for me. The optimization was just atrocious, so Im refunding it.Sucks because I was looking forward to playing this a lot.
