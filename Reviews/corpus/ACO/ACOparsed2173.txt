 it. This game is actually amazing, like genuinely. I mean yeah the DRM thing is a big in issue. But the game is too ing good to give a bad review. I am a big fan of assassins creed and they just did a damn fantastic job with this story and new mechanics. But seriously Ubisoft fix the double DRM, ing i9s struggle to maintain consisten fps.
