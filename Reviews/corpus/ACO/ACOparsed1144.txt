Howdy yall. This is my opinion and why I felt that this game is not worth a buy at retail price. Great graphics and immersive world. Leveling up is fun and feeling of progression is good  The biggest problem I had with the game that it felt like they focused on quantity more than quality. Unfortunately, most of the side quest are garbage. They basically tell you to go there Stab/find/save someone/something and I found this extremely repetitive and boring. There are some good side quest with an interesting plot but these are all too rare. Also, Im extremely dissapointed with how the main story turned out. They focused too much on the boring side quest. The main story feels way too short and youre just left at the end only wanting more. I know I only have 59 hours but I feel that Ive played enough and there arent any more experiences that the game has to offer. As an Assassins Creed game, It has lost most of its identity trying to become a RPG. I cant blame Ubi for trying someting different, but it kind of feels like a Witcher 3 wannabe with parkour and stealth thrown in to the mix.Note Ive never played a triple A title that is this badly optimized.
