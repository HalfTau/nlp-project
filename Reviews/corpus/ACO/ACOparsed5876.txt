WARNING I am not an AC fan so this review may offend or confuse AC fans. This review is from my POV which is a person who have just picked up the game to have something to play in single player.Edit I fixed the review because the game was fixed. I originally had problems with rendering, it wasnt from my computer or because I didnt meet the system requirements. Glad they fixed it.I highly recommend this game. The story is great, the time to play is great. Its not to much or too less grindy.Only problem now that I have the game fixed is that the free running is a little stuttery. It doesnt feel too much as the parkour around the past game as it used to feel like.Another thing I can critisize on is that it has a LITTLE similaritys to the dark souls franchise in combat.I also wish they had multiplayer not in the main story as they had in unity. Im not a huge AC guy so maybe I do have not the average review for an AC fan but still recommend the game after all my criticism.
