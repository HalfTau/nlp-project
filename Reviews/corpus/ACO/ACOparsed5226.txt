Please listen to this review,  I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY. Do not listen to the youtubers. Dont listen to Ubicentral or Fizhy. Do NOT BUY THIS GAME, at least for now. I was told about how this game is beautifully optimized and how i should for the love of god, buy assassins creed origins now. However noone ever told me about the anal rapage on my cpu thanks to DRM. I have a 980 ti, a 5820k, and 8gb of ddr4 ram, and i get absolutey slaughtered by inconsitent framerates, even on high settings. i cant play in Alexandria on very high or ultra settings. This games DRM just started dicking on my cpu. This was supposed to be my truimphant return to the series after not buying syndicate. Just when i made my way back i got destroyed. Please wait until ubisoft fixes this. Do not buy this game. I will update my review if it ever impoves.
