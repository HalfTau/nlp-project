Long review scrapped. New and improved review is shorter and easier to read. No semicolons this time.Combat, Parkour and Sneak have had major improvements compared to other AC games. AI is still dumb. Escort missions are awful.Hunting is fun at first. If you wont buy into microtransactions, be prepared to commit animal genocide.Lots to explore. Ruins are neat. Desert is bland.This game has a lot of content. Most of it is fetch quests. Seriously soul sucking fetch quests.I personally hate the desert on a fundamental level. The fetch quests were bad. I lost any interest I had in the story. I didnt care about any of the characters or places. It all just blended together after a while. Talk to someone, find their lost/stolen stuff, kill somebody. I still plan on finishing the main story, but I doubt Ill be taking on too many more side quests. If you love history/egypt/deserts and exploring, then you may enjoy this game. If you dont feel like doing other peoples chores, dont buy it.
