Finished the main story line in more or less 37 hours. Did some side quests to help level up on the way. I have tons of side quests to finish and tombs to explore! Huge content in ACO.Game has been optimized well with the recent patches. I bought this a day after release and could only get around 4060 FPS on medium. Now, I can get a steady 60 FPS on medium. I dont sport a beefy laptop either.
