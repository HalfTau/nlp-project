A good game but performance wise its horrendous.My settings are beyond low and it still struggles to keep up with the framrates despite having i7 core and a gtx 970.I even had to set down the resolution of the game and it still cant perform well and it crashes plenty of times.Otherwise a good game but yeah,  the performance.Wait till it gets patched or smth idk lol
