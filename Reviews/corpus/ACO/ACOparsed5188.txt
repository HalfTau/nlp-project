My specs blast the recommended specs aways, but still got the same CPU 100 load problems that lots of others have aswell. I love Assassins Creed and I am willing to pay for it, thats no problem, but the game should be working perfect then. I decided to refund the game, because for me its unplayable this way. Ultra high or low settings, it doesnt matter, I still get the same FPS and FPS drops.If Ubisoft does not fix this, then I wont buy a game from them ever again.
