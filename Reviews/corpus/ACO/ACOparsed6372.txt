Its a fresh look for this game series, more RPG with quests rather than a completley straight forward objective to objective game like previous titles.ProsGreat looking game world with environments that actually feel lived in animals roam around people live their lives etc.Huge gameworld to exploreTougher combat rather than the usual parry and hit gameplay of previous titlesTombs to loot who doesnt wanna be an ancient indiana jones?Better loot systemConsStuttering cutscenes hopefully a fix will be out soon, can never rely on a ubisoft game to be released without a bugOpen world means the usual assassins creed parkour is limited to major cities with the occasional rocks to climb, basically you get around more on a camel than on roof topsGeneral assassins creed feel not being there not much blending into the crowd etc.Now this is worth a buy if your a fan of assassins creed, you will notice some things from past games but you will have to keep playing. The beginning of the game feels abit tedious with the story just being set and you feel that you just want a hidden blade, but im sure as the game goes on things will improve. With 4.6 hours played just in the starting area doing side missions its clear to see that there is alot more still to come with a lot more map still to explore.
