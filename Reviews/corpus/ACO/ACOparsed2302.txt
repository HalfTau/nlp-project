Surprisingly good! Those 2 years break were perfect for Assassins Creed. This game is so much fun, there always something to do and it doesnt feel repetitive, the map is huge and full of details and all the secondary missions are quite interesting, reminds me of The Witcher 3.This is definitely one of the best AC games released to this date!
