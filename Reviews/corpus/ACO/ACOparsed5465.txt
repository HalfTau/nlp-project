I highly recommend against this game. THe new fighting sysyerm that they made is garbage. I dont want to have to lock onto and enemy everytime i want to pick a fight. The enemry archers have machine guns as bows and will gun you the  down in seconds. The parry system doesnt work, you will still die and this game is a ing coin flip to see if it will accually run. I am highly disappointed.
