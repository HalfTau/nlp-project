Alright so leaving the story out of this I can already say the gameplay is a massive improvement over all of the previous Assassins Creed Games. Usually when I am playing the free running is janky, but with this when im parkouring I have absolutely no issue in the slightest.The game certainly does need another patch or so just to iron out some minor bugs I noticed, for instance a Chariot slamming into a building at 75 MPH as if trying to time travel, but none of these games are so game breaking that I wouldnt recommend this game. If you like RPG games I would definitely recommend picking this one up, but as for if you like Assassins Creed games that would require I get further into the story first.So far though it looks quite promising!
