This game surprised me quite a lot. I really recommend playing it.I never bought an Assassins Creed game after the first one, because I was not that interested in the story/gameplay etc.I decided to pick it up because I am a massive fan of ancient Egypt history, and also because friends had told me that the gameplay had changed quite a lot. I was not disappointed.The story is alright, with pretty good characters. The graphics are gorgeous, and you really feel immersed in the places/landscapes you discover. The gameplay is a bit of classic Assassins Creed with a bit of Dark Souls easy mode controls when it comes to combat. The major selling point is obviously the vast map and the number of quests and things to do in it. The soundtrack could be better though.Id give it a solid 7/10.
