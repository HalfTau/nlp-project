Honestly the time they took off to reevaluate their gameplan for the series was well worth it. Being a long time fan since the first game, i love all the games. But starting with ac unity, it started to go down for me and syndicate was just boring for me. This game feels just as fun as the old game with a protagonist that is really easy to latch onto with clear motives. The story has great historical characters like Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. To say what I love about the game would take forever. But its the style of gameplay that makes it so fun. Its like a cross between the witcher 3 and assassins creed. The assassins creed gameplay is there with a new combat system that takes time to get used to but is fun.
