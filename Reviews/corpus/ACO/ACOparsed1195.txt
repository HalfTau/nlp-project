I must be doing something right, as Im getting an avergee of 50  60fps on high with my GTX 970, and Ive had very little in the way of performance issues. Maybe having an i7 is helping things along with the DRM layers that part does not make me happyPerformance related things aside, this has to be one of my favorite AC games yet. Im glad they stepped back from more recent time periods. As a kid, I love Ancient Egypt, so this is great fun for me to play. I think the story is great, and at times has me either laughing or someone is chopping onions nearby.I highly reccomend it, just make sure you have a strong PC going into it. Playing it on anything other than high settings at a minimum I feel you would be missing out on some pretty amazing graphics.
