Best AC entry since Black Flag. Very imersive world with great RPG elements, combat, and quests to go with it.One of best looking games graphically Ive seen this gen. Runs a solid 60fps on 219 Ultrawide 3440x1440 on a 1080Ti, Ultra High settigns. HUD and menus are supported natively. The Anvil engine is very processor hungry, utilizing all 6 cores of my 5930k plus the 6 hyperthreads.Kudos to Ubisoft Kiev for delivering an excellent PC version at launch.
