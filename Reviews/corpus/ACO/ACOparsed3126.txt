I dont leave reviews very often but I felt like I had to for this game. If you have been skipping out and not buying the AC series the last few games Like I have I would HIGHLY HIGHLY reccommend trying this game out. It is absolutely beautiful and I havent had this much fun playing an AC game since AC 2 with Ezio. The map is one of the biggest I have ever seen and the combat feels completely different. I am pretty far into the story but I just had to drop this review before I finished the game and forgot.for me it is a 9/10I loved the game the only complaint I have besides many bugs and glitches that occured was the fact that I got max armor and weapons fairly quickly, add to that if you pay to win you can have legendary items on the first day.
