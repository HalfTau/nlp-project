Likes Likeable and charismatic protagonists. Wonderful and stunning world design! Senu and the ability to feed/pet her. Fluid combat system. Hours of content after completing the main story. Substantial value for hunting and crafting. Thoughful skill tree/progressive system.Dislikes Very disappointing modern day story. No option to turn down dialogue volume. Forgettable antagonists. Repetitive naval combat. Phoxidas quickly becomes annoying to listen to. Lack of outfits or the ability to customize them.Nonetheless, the game is still very enjoyable and the world design alone held it above other similar titles.Is it the BEST AC GAME SO FAR? Unfortunately no, but its worth playing if youve been an AC fan since the first game.
