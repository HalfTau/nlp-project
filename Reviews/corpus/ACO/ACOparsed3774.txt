Havent played an assassins creed game since 3 and was very on and off about if I should buy this one, but I am glad I did the story is solid though nothing we havent seen before with your basic killers murder son need to get revenge story but the amount of content and side activities will keep you busy for a long time. Only real complaint is the cutscenes run at like 7 fps which is just awful but the game itself never really dipped for me.
