This is Assassins Creed 2.0, as Babys twice as awesome as anything released before Witcher 3. Rebecca CraneWhen developers learn from CD PROJEKT RED, this is what you get.Amazing game, about 30 hours in and most of the map still undiscovered. Interesting side missions, main missions and characters.Performance wise this game runs amazingly in most areas although cities can be quite heavy on hardware. After further playing, Ive noticed my frames increasing when playing at 1440p as apposed to 1080p... weird.Buy this game if you enjoyed Witcher 3 and love AC. If you thought the franchise was heading downhill, think again.
