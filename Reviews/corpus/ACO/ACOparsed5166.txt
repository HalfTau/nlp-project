Im not taking chance playing this game on my new computer.  This game DRM makes the CPU run at 100 all the time.  There is already report on youtube of peoples computer getting killed by this game.  Im asking for a refund right now.  The game looks fine but i dont want to take the chance.  Once i hear they remove that DRM causing the problem ill probably rebuy the game.
