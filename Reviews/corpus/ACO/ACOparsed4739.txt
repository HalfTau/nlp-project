Trust me, I saw the bad reviews and all about the bad performance of the game it runs on my rig from 75 fps average to 119 to min 43 fpsthat was only once when i had an fps drop, also check my screenshot if you dont believe megtx 1070 i7 4770K max settings. First 15 minutes in the game were incredible, and I wouldnt want to get out of the game but I had to. Translated, this game is gold dont listen to the negativist people, theyre just salty gamers or just dont reach the minimum requirements. The combat is too good, the eagle system is so cool, you can locate places on the map easily with the eagle, the story? Even better. Id say 9.5/10 WatchDogs 2 with Better Parkour and assassination
