Combat is more complex than the old combat system in previous AC games. Much more difficult, which is a good thing for me, because in the old games I used to get bored pressing one or two buttons just to counterattack. Havent finished yet, which is a suprise because I finished all AC games within 2 to 3 days. I got this when it released and its pretty long leveling up and all.
