To start off I have played every assasins creed game that has come out and when I was little I would always just run around and kill people and not listen to any of the story or anything and even that was fun but after a hard fall in the recent games that has come out I thought assasins creed was done for but this game has truelly blew me away I got it on sale and I would buy it for full price any time of the day the stunning graphics and story and gameplay just draw you in and does not let you out and in all truthfulness this has been the most fun I have ever had with a assasins creed game and I am proud to say that I played this game for 24 hours straight and passed out in my chair from lack of sleep and when I woke up I started playing right away again that is how good this game is.
