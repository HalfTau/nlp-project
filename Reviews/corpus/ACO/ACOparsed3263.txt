Incredibly detailed world, improved combat and stealthmore tools and ways to dispatch enemies, compelling story and overall just a breath of fresh air for a series that desperately needed it.This is a huge step on the right direction and, as a fan, im happy to say assassins creed is getting back on track, and im happy for that
