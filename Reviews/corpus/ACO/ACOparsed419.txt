Highly recommended!!! This is a must have game. So much content can bee seeked out often missed. This game has great new gameplay and fighting mechanics. The sounds and music are amazing! I have noticed some bugs with clipping environment or see through environment while underground but other than that this is a great game. The story is interesting, while lacking something still maintains my interest. Im glad they took more time to make another AC it was defintely worth the wait.
