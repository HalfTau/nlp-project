OK, 48 hours in. Main quest done. Its time for a review. I love Assassins Creed Origins. I have enjoyed it far more than Witcher 3 sacrilege, right?. Its so much more a game and so much less a movie.Theres an endless amount of stuff to do I havent done all side quests yet and have barely uncovered a fraction of the obligatory map marks...Utterly brilliant.
