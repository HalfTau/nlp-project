Oh boy, where do I start...First I should mention my love to the Witcher games and that I never really liked the Assassins Creed series. I bought this game, because I sought an experience close to the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, because I wanted to get that open world feeling again.And it was worth it. Ubisoft really surprised me there. The game is by no means perfect, bugs, shallow characters, sloppy combat at times and some annoying little things, not to forget that I was one of the people who had the Logitech Headset bug.But that game really did it to me. To all the people who miss Geralt the Witcher, Bayek the Medjay is a good choice.The god love a generous soul!
