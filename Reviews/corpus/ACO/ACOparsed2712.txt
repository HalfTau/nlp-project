A breathe of fresh air. Took many aspects of Skyrim and Witcher and applied it to AC. Despite the similiarities, it is not a bad thing. Definitely recommend picking this game up. Its a beautiful open world and really recaptures those early AC2 moments when I just stand over a tall building to stare at the landscape. 9/10 for me. The only issue I have with this game is that its still relatively buggy in certain areas. Id climb a half broken piller and my character would get stuck in a falling animation for a couple minutes and die. Besides that, this game is great.
