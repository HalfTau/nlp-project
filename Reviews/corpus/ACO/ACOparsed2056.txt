I cant recommend this game with the stage that it is in. My PC is optimized for the requirements of the game itself, but it takes it 2 minutes to load in one of up to twenty NPCs going about their day idly and it is hammering my more than capable system, despite saying my system is better than what it requires even at the lowest level, so some optimization is required from the Devs side.
