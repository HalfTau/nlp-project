I got a refund on steam for this game but recently bought it for xbox one. I dont have much experience at reviewing nor do I play. All I can say is that this game is worth it.I personally prefer to play it and other assassins creed games on a console. If your choice is a computer then you better answer the system requirements.This game is a 10/10.
