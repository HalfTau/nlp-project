This is the game you want!If i need to summarize this game as an Assassins Credd game, it is the game we wanted after Ezios story. It adds quality to the game we remembered thats for sure. Characters you encountered has a story. End they are very interesting for that kind of game. It is very similar to Witcher 3s system. Open World of this game is incredible. You dont want to close the game while you are in that world. Even little loot caves holds an story in their backgrounds.Fantastic!Fight system is exactly from souls series. EXACTLY. Im in love this game because of this. You feel your hits. You feel your crossbow and arrows. You feel how brutal your moves when finishing moves on the screen. Absolutely gorgeus.Animals are greatly detailed. I loved it.If you waited a long time for returning this series, this is the time! Dont miss it.Oyun harika olmus.Kisaca ozetlemem gerekirse bu Assassins Creed, Eziodan sonra serinin devam etmesini istedigimiz sekli.Kalitesine kalite katmis, karakterlere ozen gostermis, minik gorevlere hatta siradan bir loot magarasina bile derinlik verilmis.Gezmesi muthis keyifli. Optimizasyonu gayet yerinde. Oynadigima degecek bir Assasinss Creed ciksa da seriye donsem diyenlerdenseniz bu oyun, o oyun!
