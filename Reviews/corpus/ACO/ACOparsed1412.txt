Decided i fancied returning to AC after tbe poor game tgat was AC3. Purchased it on day of release and completed the story and various side quests. I can say this game is great and the mechanics fit well. Love the setting, graphics and gameplay. Although it doesnt seem as stealth dependant. You can decide to be an assassin or some kind of foot soldier thats my only flaw. Enjoyed all the way through regardless. Good fun too.
