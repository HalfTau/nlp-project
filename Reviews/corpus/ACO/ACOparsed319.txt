So after completing the game and doing a huge majority of exploring I have got to say this game is really amazing and gets better with every amount of meme that surges through me.It feels like The Witcher 3 Open World/Side Quests  Dark Souls Combat  MGSPhantom Pain Movement/Atmosphere had a baby mixed with some assassin creed stuff and this was the outcome.The entire Cities  Egypt in its self is amazing  breathtaking.The game is HUGE and discovering small things on the map are extremely fun however it does feel like their is actually a bit too many side quests that were added. The problem with this is after a while when you go back at a higher level the side quests dont offer much, but this is now fixed after they updated the game to allow enemy scaling.To break things down here are the pros/cons.Please keep in mind everyone is entitled to their own opinion however this is coming from a Assassin Creed Fan but I am going to point out everything I personally feel in the most neutral mindset while trying to not have my cat murder me.Plays like The Witcher 3 with a huge open world that has no loading screen aside from cinematicsCombat is fun and engaging and at some times it is very fast paced when you have reached level 40 along with additional levels to unlock other combat actionsCan be played as STEALTH or 420 GUNS BLAZIN or in this games case Bow  Sword??? whatever  its fun!Beautiful graphics especially on max settings which makes gameplay feel smootherSome key points that explain how the brotherhood aka The Creed started and how the original assassins came into play make the quest line more interestingThe action/cinematic game moments are insane especially in one certain quest where you try to light a beacon... No spoilerMounts  Mount combat is super fun More movementspeed  higher damageRange of weapons feel amazing and add a lot to gameplayLevel system is destiny like and add a really good concept to legendary weapons in lategameEach Tier or pathway you choose impacts the way you want to play the game Assassin,...Stealth Archer,Warrior,CQCAqua Motions Swimming/Sailing/etc... are really well tied and are seamlessWhen you are stuck in the ocean and you boat gets destroyed by crocodiles, typically AI come to you with their boats which was a QOL thingCombat is VERY clunky early game unless you smoked a few good ones ya feel?When you go stealth archer you stay stealth archer... For a whileYou can channel your inner sneakybeaky CSGO Russian Stealth Strats but they eventually will find you and it ruins the whole stealth partChariots sometimes dont let you quick swap between bowtomelee and you end up dyingYou cant venture into certain areas early because some AI didnt skip leg day/arm dayYou need to access Way Points/Synchronization Points inorder to use Senu Flying Chicken Companion to scout early makes gameplay hard earlySome Locations areto big and if you miss a chest or enemy then you cant 100 that locationPlease note, I played with a wireless xBox one elite controller as I do with all TPP games PLUS I like eating while gamingBecome VERY fluid at hightier/maxrank ProgressiveFeel smoothe/engagingMount combat is satisfyingStealth works well when you actually tryAI/Enemys dont wait for you to be free to fight, they gang up on you and end you like Logan Paul did to his careerThe mounts Camel  Horse  Final Fantasy Event Mount all are uniqueYou can swap easily combat between KB to Controlla and feel like a gangstaYOUR CHARACTER AUTO RUNS BAYBEEEE no more slow walking unless  you wannaLike all AC games you eventually hold a climb button to climb certain points  becomes hella annoyingHard to Pivot/Quick turn with chariots and mounts along with no way to speed move or make them go faster, like I even made horse noises and nuttinIf you quick drop from ledges you could get stuck and their is no way to get of them unless you choose to let it goAmazing, very bright and very sandy, such Egypt, much wow.The map design is well done, 2 years well spentHorses/Characters are very realisticTHIS AC HAS BLOOD!!! Previous games like syndicate had nothing, this one has really good textures.Hair/Facial animations work amazing when they do!Trees near outside sandhideouts sometime look blurry but thats probably because I forgot to put on my glasses when I was at that location!?!?Wish they would add a better AA, maxed one is kinda lameWell written story, goes through typical superhero cycleAt some points its very dark and the amount of things happening are outstandingSide quests tie well into main story plot lineSome side quests are AMAZING, having their own cinematic and have real keymoments which make them very memorableForgettable story because of sheer size of map area along with the option to adventure and flip the bird to the main storyMost people tend to explore and due eventually you forget certain things until you go back to the main quest lineAya Bayeks wife had more impact plot than him and he da main character OMEGAlul POGChampCringe at a few momentsFor every 5 side quests, their would be typically 12 good ones, just like finding a GF in real life! Haha, just kiddin we all live in a basement... Right? Guys...Works like butter for me personallyVery smooth at certain areasCombat had few dips but only when their was 30 AI doing their own thangAfter a few minutes after the initial start up the game would stop stuttering and be seamlessVM  Denuvo  SERIOUSLY?!?!? This right here is anticonsumer, if you dont have a High End/Top Tier CPU or pretty much overall PC, then be careful because this is a hit and miss. Basically ontop of their antipirating process which is Denuvo, VM addeds virtual fake spaghetti code that bogs down performance. This was unnecessary, look at TW3, this game woulda been more loved without this crap PLUS you have uPlay running in the background.uPlay is used for cloud storage Which was a option to use steam but it doesnt matter as I use both but may be inconvenient for othersCPU hog, didnt check my CPU but many others reported having 100 CPU usage but for me personally didnt bother me muchStutter in certain areas last for 30sec  1 minute but goes away shortly, probably the VM/Denuvo but kinda screws up the momentum/gameplayMy PC SpecsCPU Intel i77770k UNLOCKED 4.2GHzGPU EVGA GTX 1070 SuperClocked Gaming Black Edition 8Gb VRAMRAM CORSAIR Vengeance 32Gb DDR4 3200MhzPSU EVGA SuperNova 650W G2 80 Plus Gold Cert.Motherboard ASUS Z270e GAMING MOTHERBOARDHDD Western Digital Caviar Blue 2TBSSD Kingston v400 240GB SataCASE Corsair Crystal Series RGB Tempered Glass 460x ATX MidTowerCOOLING be quiet! DARK ROCK PRO 3 Silentwings CPU CoolerAnyways, this game is really good. I personally loved it, after the disaster of Unity/Syndicate this is a good breath of fresh air. The story was well done with a few flaws, but anyways the new combat system is extremely fun when you start to progress which makes it feel like a actual RPG. The world is simply HUGE. This is a good time sync but if your busy with competitive games such as Overwatch/CSGO/PUBG/LoL/DOTA2 then you amy have a hard time fullyexploring this.The initial base game can however be done in 3040 hours with a few sidequests. Other than that, really, give this game a chance.Ill see if I can update this review in the near future but for now im to blazed to keep writing.Hope this review helped, I hoped I showed you guys dae wae?
