Cant comment anything on the game itself since I havent played much of it yet.But I do want to comment that the game launches fine and doesnt crash after installing the latest video card drivers.I think its unfair that people give negative reviews because they cannot think just a little and at least try to find a solution to the problem but instead they just yell how bad and cheating Ubisoft is.So I give a thumb up to the game for now, will probably update the review later.
