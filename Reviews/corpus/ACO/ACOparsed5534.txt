One you get past that HORRIBLE intro, the game becomes one of the finest editions of AC Ive played to date. The map is massive and the gameplay mechanics are solid. Dont be detered by that throwyouintochaoswithoutanyexplantion beginning sequence. Get past siwa and you will be rewarded with a challenging and expansive campaign.
