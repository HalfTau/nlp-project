This game is very taxing on your CPU so make sure you have a good one, other than that so far im having a great time, mind you Ive only played it for 3 hours, but the combat system is so smooth and it seems every single person has their own lines and personality. Lets just hope ubisoft doesnt start charging us for paid mods like bethesda.
