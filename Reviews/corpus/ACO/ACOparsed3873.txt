Its been while since launch and going back to Black Flag right after this one really made me think about Assassins Creed Origins as a whole. While it had a bit of a rough start with high CPU usage and a few minor bugs here and there its still a solid game. I was actually surprised how it turned out to be, I expected the game to be boring and unpolished like the two latest installments in their Assassins Creed franchise. So I got to playing and after just an hour of playing I felt like I had met my match, it was both interesting and capturing at the same time. Ive spent about 7080 hours in this game, meaning Ive cleared out the whole map and seen, well most of the secrets in it. The only things Ive ignored to do in the game is the Gladiator fight and Hippodrome races since Im not much for racing nor that style of fighting but I will eventually complete them as well. And after spending so much time in this game within such a short period, I gotta say that its a fun experience for both hardcore fans and new to the series. I dont regret picking this game up and I definitely got my hopes back for Ubisoft. I dont know what else to say about the game more than its awesome and if you have any doubts about the game, dont cause they did a really good job on this one!
