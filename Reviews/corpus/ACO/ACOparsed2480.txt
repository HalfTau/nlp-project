I am getting surgery in 2 weeks and require a 2 week liquid diet before the operation. Ive been planning for weeks to buy and play this game to help keep spirits up and within the 37 mins i played half of those being in the menu I experienced more than 10 terrible bugs. First being the tutorial enemy attacking me after a scripted event began and then shooting through the floor, All characters loading in as rounded models with no texture, a horse cart shooting through the air and my camel dropped through the world and i died. THIS HAPPENED IN THE SPAN OF ABOUT 20 MINS.  Not only this but i have a fairly lower high end computer and couldnt run this game at 60 let alone a solid 60 at any quality level. I was going to give this series one more chance and i am very sad to say that this is the worst new game experience ive ever had.
