starts out strong. the first half is really cool, despite the grinding. good atmosphere, great look. but it bogs down in the last third. the griding is just boring. the story loses focus to the point where you just dont care anymore. i wish there was a skip options for the Aya sequences that they cram down your throat.so many times i just wanted to kill her with a flaming sword, get a you lost the game screen and restart the sequence. that would have been gratifying.the naval combat is totally messed up. i finally did a rage quit/gamedelete in the last Aya sequence.and i beat all four legendary ships in Black Flag, its not a big part of the game, but theres no way around it. the controls are not clear at all.i miss the mission structure from earlier games like Black Flag, where there was a solid feeling that the story was progressing. the new combat is okay, sort of Dark Souls like, in a watered down wimpy sort of a way.this game will do  well with MMO lovers. theres fedexing, gathering, and other meaningless questing galore.i suppose its an improvement over the last few lackluster games in this series, but i wish i had bought it at 60 off, not full price.
