Recently started having perfomance issues with FPS and Stuttering due to CPU usages of nearly always 100, about 45 to 50 hours in, seemingly due to this DRM nonsense. Why cant the DRM be disabled for verified purchases, I dont really know much about the possibilty of that but itd be nice. Ill be waiting to continue playing this game as I cant afford to degrade my CPUs performance. Using task manager and the ingame CPU monitor, across all 4 cores 8 with Hyperthreading I am getting a continual 90 to 100 usage across the board. That is extremely taxing for the CPU during gaming sessions of even a couple hours and even worse if you play for 6 hours straight. Ive turned settings to the minimum along with resolution of 720p even with a resolution modifier of 50 effectively making the screen a muddy blurry mess and still it maxes out my CPU when framerate is uncapped and I only gain 20 extra fps from my original 70 fps at 1440p Ultra settings.There is a temporary fix and that is to limit your FPS to 30 or 45 fps in the settings. That has greatly reduced my CPU usage at 1440p Ultra settings to approx 50 to 75 max instead of a consistent 100. So somehow just capping framerate stops my CPU usage from going bonkers but reducing any and all settings doesnt? OK, cool story.Otherwise amazing game so far, intriguing story, fun missions and side activities all over make the world feel fairly full and real. I would definitely recommend Assassins Creed Origins once the DRM performance issues are sorted out. This installment is far better than the past couple bugridden games they released. Im 4550 hours into a 100 playthrough as very satisfied with most everything the game offers. Ive played the first 5 or 6 Assassins Creed games, and I do believe this one will be my favorite.Ill change my review once they solve the issue.My SpecsIntel Core i7 6700K  4.00GHzNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 4095MB EVGA476GB Samsung SSD 950 PRO 512GB16.0GB DualChannel Corsair DDR4  3200MHzASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.
