So far, I am loving the game. Enjoying the new combat controls. Stunning graphics, great storyline. Loads Fast. Using controllers for this game not mouse and keyboard. controller scheme is nicely laid out.I am glad that my pc is handling this game ok, was worried with some of the other reviews I have read. cpu I77700k does run average around 40 and spikes to 70 but is not causing any stuttering. I have ran my processor under bigger loads than this with no issues. Cpu temps stay fine, Custom water loop ensures that. Now Gpu Im only running this game with a 1060 overclocked to 2100Mhz. runs 60fps at 1080p/ 30fps in cities, Have seen it drop to 28fps a few times. I would say average fps for me is 45ish fps, Thats with the Graphics set to ultra. That does put my graphics card under 99 load during game play, Even then no stuttering. I am surprised at 30 fps game still seems to run smooth. waiting for Volta to drop All in all, loving this game even with a different combat system, excited to play more. The game play is a pleasant experience, along with the graphics. Now Im only a few hrs. in and I will update if my experience changes. Hoping this review helps others that may be on the fence after reading the negative reviews as I did. if my 1060 can do it......Motherboard  arous z270xCpu                  Intel I77700k Oc5ghzDDr4                G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 4x8Gb32Gb Oc 4000MhzGraphics Card  Gigabyte wind force 1060 Oc core 2100Mhz  Mem 8500mhzcontrollers       Ds4 and Steam controller  I do love my Ds4 controllerGaming Hdd    raid 0 3  5400rpm  1.5tb hdd Not worried about redundancySystem Disk    SAMSUNG 960 EVO M.2 250GB NVMe PCIExpress 3.0Extra Comments  I would like to see the game use less cpu, Only game to date to use this much. I have read the reviews and am not worried about high cpu usage as I have built my system to handle the amount of heat that my cpu can generate. Only reason I would like to see a lower cpu usage is my pc is not just my gaming pc. it is a highly active media server, Web server, Cryptocurrency miner, Torrent server, And file server. Even with all the extra tasks running I have had no issues with the background programs or the game running. maybe one day Ill have my server and a separate gaming pc.
