I feel satisfied to say that I was able to play through a WHOLE AC game 100 percent since Black Flag. I completed everything with satisfaction even though you have to repeat objectives and areas many times. This is a wonderful recovery for ubisoft and I look foward to their games in the future. If you dont have atleast a GTX 1070 1060 or the AMD equivelent I wouldnt expect to max this out. Its also very CPU intensive but I get a smooth 60 besides Alexandria on a gtx 1070 sc and an i7 7700k.
