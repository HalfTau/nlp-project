Soo this game kinda feels like the people at Ubisoft sat and played through Dark Souls, Zelda botw and The Witcher 3 and tried to imitate all 3 in one game. and shockingly enough they did a decent job.Im only 6 hours in and soo far the story has been quality/engaging even the side quests are good which is what lets the older Assassins Creed games down with their rinse and repeat nature.The new combat system feels responsive alot like the Dark Souls Combat system where dodging,  parrying and blocking feel vital and different weapons actually feel like different weapons crazy i know! swinging a hammer or poking with a spear ect feels great im really hoping they stick with this combat system for future AC games.The parkour feels natural and easy, no longer does getting from AB feel like a chore and if you cant be arsed to run theres a auto run feature built into the mount which will take you to your destination with a single click!For me personally Ubisoft are one of my least favorite gaming companys they always seem to mess something up with every game theyve ever released so Assassins Creed Origins was a very nice surprise I hope we get more like this from them in the future.Good job ubisoft keep it up!
