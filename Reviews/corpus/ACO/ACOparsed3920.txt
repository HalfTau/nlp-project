What did we expect? A new reppetitive assassins creed game. What did we get? A whole new definition of what assassins creed truly means. The games rpg elements remind me of the Witcher 3 also a great game and provide a refreshing and new playstyle. We got what we loved in assassins creed 2. A story about vengeance! An interesting character and a whole new world to explore. The map is huge, although the desert areas in the south and west are practically empty. Yes there are microtransactions, but none of them are really necessary as there is plenty of content.
