Ive bought the gold edition and regretted it after the first mission Wait till this game is on special not worth the full price what a let down ive been a fan since the beginning and always loved the assassins creed series but im sooff with origins the game is broken and it looks like they just put anything in there and released it with no effort and the combat system is so painful and boring another broken game
