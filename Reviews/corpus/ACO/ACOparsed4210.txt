First of all to tell you the truth In the back of my head I was like Ill never buy this game since it has microtransactions. But my love of the assassin creed franchise got the best of me. especially AC II. What makes this game so good is this.Pros There is so much to do, I expect to finish this game with over 100 hours So many sidequests, most are pretty good with story. beautiful world. Very huge map,Better combat which is a hit or miss for some people.Graphics are just phenomenalSo many types of weaponsUpgrades are pretty valuable and good The story is good so farenemies are sometimes not predictable There are good laughs and serious moments variety of mounts, shields, swords, borderlands amount wowlots of different types of animals Hippo, lions, hyenas, crocodiles etc...Cons CPU uses is 60 percent for me which is okay thank god I didnt get 100 percent like other peopleGame needs to be a little bit more optimized at timesmicrotransactions shouldnt be in a single player game at all If I paid full pricelong journey at times through the desert, and sometimes music is absent when needed.fps spikes multiple timesbugs and glitches which are funny at timesLevels are a grind which is okay for me at timesIf you are like me and love AC, you have to buy this game, this is a buy. If the microtransactions are a turn off for you I dont blame you. But its a good purchase if you dont mind the microtransactions since most of it is cosmetic and not pay to win. The only reason why I bought this game was the amount of stuff you could do. This is the only game this year that I am willing to forgive microtransactions since this game is pretty huge and fun. Screw microtransactions for full paid games, there are ways to do it right. EA and activision.......This is an 8/10, I was conflicted with giving it a 7 instead since all the problems with piracy and microtransactions. Especiallly performace but the time I had with the game saved it with some saving grace.
