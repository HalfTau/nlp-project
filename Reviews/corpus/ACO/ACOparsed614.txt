A series whose overabundance of lackluster entries that almost killed the franchise receives yet another title not worth your time or your money.They looked at what was wrong with Assassins Creed, every boring fetch quest, every timewasting tower climbing section, every pointless collectible that adds nothing to the game and said What if the problem is that they are too close together and added at least 800m inbetween each and called it good.This game takes what worked in the previous Assassins Creed games and adds pointless bloat like microtransactions both cosmetic and not, zone levels like WoW, added an averageatbest loot system and hunting just so they could sell time savers and resource packs.Assassins Creed is dead Ubisoft, leave it be.
