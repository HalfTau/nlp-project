Assassins Creed Origins is one of the best games I have ever played. World is nicely alive. People work, sleep, talk Animals hunt, flee, sleep and even fight That eagle is very nice plenty of side quests and every side quest is interesting Huge map This ancient Egypt is very very beautiful I really like it the pyramids are awesome alot of tombs to discover its a very mysterious gameI HOPE THEY WILL  DO Assassins Creed Origins 2 OR SOMETHING D
