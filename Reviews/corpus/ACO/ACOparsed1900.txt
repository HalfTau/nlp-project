Its a pretty fun game, but Im not going to lie, there are some really dumb things about this game. It feels like it wasnt properly polished, like how you assissinate one guy basically three times ingame, in a cutscene, and in some bizare DMT induced world in which you use your trusty, magic feather of doom to kill.Otherwise, its a pretty good RPG gamewise. Graphics are B E A U T I F U L.
