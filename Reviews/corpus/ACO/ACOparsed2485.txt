Was a fun game. An insanely massive world with lots of missions. Hours fly by while playing this game. Unlike a lot of newer games, this one can be enjoyed without buying any packs, or forcing microtransactions. The option is there, but not needed. I never felt the urge to unlock anything faster than I did earning items/upgrades in game. Definately got my moneys worth playing this game.
