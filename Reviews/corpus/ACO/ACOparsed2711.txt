Assassins Creed Origins has so far exceeded all of my expectations, enough to say that it is certainly the best in the long series. Its as if Ubisoft has learned its quality not quantity and used the extra year off to make a more polished experience that feels good in just about every way. The world is massive and lively and beautifully crafted, the combat is fun and more skillful, and the story and quests interesting. The devil is in the details and this game has it!
