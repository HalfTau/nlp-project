I havent played any Assassins Creed games since Black Flag, but this one might be the best one I have played so far. The Ezio Trilogy can never be topped, but this one is almost like it in terms of goodness.ProsTHE MAP IS HUGE. Like ing huge.Combat system is refreshing and new to the series.Decent optimizationRPG aspects really change the game seriesHavent really ran into any bugs sound bug at the beginning of the game but a restart fixed itExploration is so much fun. Literally get off task when running around in the game.Extremely beautiful game.ConsNeeds an optimization patch. This game is heavy on usage.The climbing can either be weird or not depending on the person.Overall, I highly recommend this game anyone that is a fan of the series. This game takes the Assassins Creed series to a whole new level.
