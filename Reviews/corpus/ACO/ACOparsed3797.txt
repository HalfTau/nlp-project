Where to begin?I guess Ill start with the design. Everything about ACO is beautiful. The people, the wildlife, the atmosphere, even the sand. And dont get me started on the architecture... This may be my childhood obsession with ancient Egypt coming back a little bit, but this game is just gorgeous.As far as story goes, I havent felt this satisfied in a games story since GTA San Andreas. I might even be MORE satisfied with Origins. Very emotionally investing, I nearly cried several times during the story, but at the end.... I lost it. Beautiful story.I still have much of Egypt to explore and help, so Im sure Ill be sinking lots more hours into this game. And thats before the expansions release.As the first AC game Ive played I have all of them, just havent played them yet I give this a very solid 10/10
