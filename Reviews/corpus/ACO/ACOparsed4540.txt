Game hasnt even fixed the game audio still sounds like a tincan many people have the same problem, game crashes multiple times, several bugs occured when starting the campaign, graphichs dosnt even look the slightest of what they showed us, control are very clucky and slow. This game is just a expensive heavy downgrade from the other good AC games.0/10 /
