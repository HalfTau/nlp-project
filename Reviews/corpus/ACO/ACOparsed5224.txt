I am a very big fan of the assassins creed series. Ive played every sing game in this series, with this knowledge I can confidently say that this game was a step in the right direction. Even though it is not perfect, it is still great.Pros Visuals. The visuals in this game are breathtaking if your hardware can run it lol Gear. The gear in this game is beutifull Leveling system. Works well in the game I like the main character, unlike unity and sydicate, I cared about byak and his journeyCons Level Design. The quests have good story but usually end with the player going to a place with bandits and killing a buch of bandits.Side Quests. Now some side quests were great, and some where meaningless to me. Facial animations. not as bad as Mass Effect Andromeda, but could have been so much better.After putting 25 hours in this game, im still not done, I can confidently say that im not board in the game in anyway and look forward to my next gameing session and worry that I will finish everything and have nothing left to do.I recommend this game to anyone that loved the witcher 3 like I did, even though this game is no withcer 3, it is a great step for ubisoft regaining my trust as a developer, and I am happy with the time ive spent in this game.Final Verdict 8/10This game could have been a 10/10 for me, however ubisoft clearly is not used to makeing a good game lmao. I really hope that Ubisoft uses this game as a steping stone to create many more Assassins Creeds that shine as bright or brighter than the witcher 3.
