ProsWell optimized, great gameplay.Decent story compared to the other games in the series.Many things to do in the open world.Cool side quests.ConsA few bugs here and there.Social stealth is missing.Modern day story felt rushed and not as important as it should be.Cant replay missions, hopefully they add this trough an update.Defenetly the best in the series in terms of gameplay, but not in terms of story.Id give it a 9/10, very close to The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt witch is very dear to my heart.
