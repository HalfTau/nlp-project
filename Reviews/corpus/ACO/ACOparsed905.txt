Im typically not a huge fan of the Assassins Creed games. However I was absolutely blown away by ACO. My friends were raving about it so I decided to give it a try. The scenery is stunning throughout with beautiful graphics. The gameplay is very reminiscent of The Witcher 3 mixed with the old AC games. The soundtrack is great and actually feels immersive. If anyone else is a little hesitant on the AC games, Origins is a refreshing new take in the right direction. Id recommend this one. An easy 8.6/10 in my book.
