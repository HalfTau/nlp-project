I thought I would play on hard, since I play all games on the hardest mode, the world is cool and I spent most of my time doing every side thing I could find and I had a lot of fun doing it. I ran in to a couple max lvl fight zones and just peaked my head in to get stomped. I thought no big deal I will keep leveling up and come back and it would be fine.... well when I drop in at max lvl with maxed gear and I get stomped just as fast it makes the hole thing feel cheap cuzz it seams like there trying to make me buy attribute points to up my weapon damage ... witch is a thing nowI am really ok with most of the changes I am just not a fan of some of them like stripping combat at its highest level down to dodge or get clobbered when they dodge is buggy as hell and really smallThey could patch and fix a lot of it but at this point I will finish this play threw and then most likely not touch it again
