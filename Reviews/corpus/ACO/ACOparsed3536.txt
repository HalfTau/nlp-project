Having a hell of a time just slowly sailing through the content of Origins at my own pace between other games, such a fantastic experience with a massive open world, what a treat of a game so far I really couldnt be more happy about spending my money on it! Great voice acting, great fighting mechanics, so much to do in terms of sidequests and different types of explorations from dungeon diving to discovering long forgotten treasures...Origins has a beautiful world to explore with somewhat of a rich story that sends you to all four corners of Egypt, visiting historic landmarks, meeting well known names...I had to force myself to stop taking pictures all the time because I wasnt making any progress at all!This was the one time they stopped coughing out trashy AC games every 6 months that used recycled assets and actually spent some real time to make a huge, fresh new experience. Highly recommended!
