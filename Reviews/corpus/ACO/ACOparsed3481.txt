So if you still have a hankering to play an AC game, maybe you enjoyed it back in its glory days AC2 etc, definitley try this one out, you wont be disppointed.It seems the devs of this one decided to take it on a new path from its recent predecessors. The game is more RPG heavy, with a tighter focus on skills and weapon upgrading and management. They also took heavy inspiration from The Witcher 3, but in a good way. More spread out and varied questing, a longer more story rich campaign with interesting characters and excellent writing, and to honestly top it all off, wonderful world design, the game is a jewel of rpg period pieces.Ok so here is where it falls off. The grind is a bit much at times, you can tell they put it in the game to incentivize loot crates Yes they are in the game, no they arent annoying, its not Battlefront II or anything, but honestly its just a hassle getting basic items and gold to upgrade necessary components for your character. A large majority of the quests are also very boring filler quests to grind your level up, and you can tell for a majority of these, no effort was placed.All in all, an excellent entry into the AC franchise, bit grindy at points, gets my recommendation.
