I havent played an AC since Black Flag andwatched some Gameplay from Unity which seemed absolutely buggy and broken at the time.With Assassins Creed Origins it really feels like they brought back some innovation into the series.While there arent that many new features to the formula, the system of weapon loot as simple as it ishelps a lot, at least for me, since I am a loot since the old Diablo days.Bayek is an interesting character compared to that braindead moving pile of flesh from AC3.The amount of content in the game aswell as the worldmap are huge and full of activities!While I highly despise microtransactions in Soloplayer Games and games overall, you dont feel forcedto buy anything at all and the game itself will provide anything you need in high numbers.For me its a 89/10.
