ProsExcellent GraphicsImmersive WorldNaval Combat very few instancesFew Notable Story MomentsConsShallow WritingLack of LoreClunky CombatRepeatitiveBoring Supporting CharactersRushedSpoilersThe game is barely an origin story with many loose ends. Hidden blade has poor backstory while beaked hood is not given any explanation. Eagle Vison/Sense is not really explained.The Assassin insignia just comes into being as an afterthught in which the supposed founder Bayek has no part to play.Bayek is possibly the one individual who has come in contact with highest amount of Isu tech, Followed by Layla ofcourse yet he has nothing to say about it. He has no questions neither any sense of wonder after hearing the recordings unlike Ezio.The vault of Siwa which puts the events of the game in motion is possibly the single most useless thing in the game as it has nothing but an hologram of globe with random lights  just a message like narrator.Origins of the order of the ancients is left to happenstance in a tomb. The Hidden Ones DLC feels a part of the main games jus cut  provided later.There isnt much informaton about the old Kingdom of Egypt seeing as how most of the tombs  Pyramids from that era are connected to Isu vaults. The lack of information about their information regarding Those Who Came Before leaves a voidInspite of all the above things considered game is not a total loss.The world is beautifully created  highly immersive. I have completed most of the activities 98 in the game however they get tiresome fairly quickly.The pyramid exploration is very satisfying however the compensation for it leaves many things wanting.There are few moments where game really provides some note worthy experiences like death of Shadya or Hilarus quest or Papo?... Jump. However in terms of story, eye for detail is missing.Spoilers EndTo Summarise,The game is worth buying however if you are expecting the level of Witcher 3 or Skyrim, You will be disappointed.The game does touch upon the subject I mentioned above in its course however, the same is very brief  as such fails to provide any closure.I wont say  dont buy the game, would even recommend it. However i would advise to keep your expectations at minimum. Because you WILL feel a bit disappointed.The resource consumption is monsterous for this game so buy the game if you use some serious hardware
