I was a bit worried with so many complaining about performance. Im happy to say its not as bad as I thought it would be.Specs4770K  4.7GHz980ti16GB RAMLG 34 3440x1440I am running at highest settings with AA set to adaptive and a 45fps target. I get exactly that. If I set it to 60, I get to about 5758fps but no higher and sometimes drops to 45ish. So yeah, since refresh is 60hz and I have target set at 45fps, I see 30fps stable.As for the game. What can I say, its beautiful, mostly fun, huge, lots to do, etc...The map clearing design is way better than Black Flagthe only other AC title Ive played.I give it a 9/10.
