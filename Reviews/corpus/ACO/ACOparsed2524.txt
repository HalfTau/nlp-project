Probably the best AC in a long time. Amazing game. Great main storyline but also very nice sidequest lines. The new leveling system is very good. I was afraid that the main storyline would be to easy if I would do too many sidequests but I dont see that as a problem anymore.I did not finish the game yet but I already love it.
