This game isnt perfect but it comes pretty damn close. After a much needed 2 year break, I must say I havent enjoyed an Assassins Creed game this much since Brotherhood. Assassins Creed Origins is so fun, I can sink hours into it at a time without realising how much time has passed.The world map is absolutely huge, yet it doesnt get boring and isnt as repetitive as you might expect for a desert. The setting is amazing. Soundtrack is wonderful as usual with Assassins Creed. The combat is different, but I think I like the changes. The new photomode is incredibly fun to use.Absolutely recommended! !
