GoodAbsolutely gorgeous  easily one of the best looking games Ive ever played.Historical period and attention to detail  world is amazing to explore, it feels alive, authentic and organic.Story  full of intrigue and the main character is well written has actual emotions beyond being angry all the time, well done ubisoft.UI  minimalistic and has removed the minimap entirely, making you pay attention to whats around you. Helps immerse you in the game world.Combat  a welcome change of pace, positioning, attack type and sizing up your enemy matters. Gone are the days where you could snooze your way through a fight by just spamming counterkill. Makes you think before you enter a fight against multiple opponents.BadSide content  mostly uninspired and largely boring, fetch quests and kill quests done in a copy paste manner. Would have liked to have seen more meaningful interactions with the inhabitants of the world. With the exception of one side mission early on, nothing feels hand crafted or detailed when it comes to these missions. Only exceptions would really be chariot racing and arena fighting.Hand holding  game gives you hints, tips and tells you what to do waaaaay too often. Challenging puzzles would have been welcome in tombs, the tagging/wallseethrough ability shouldnt be there, so players can use their eyes.Crafting  I dont mind grinding for better gear, but it doesnt feel good to do it, in black flag hunting down ships for materials felt fun. Looting animals gets old fast. Really fast.Character facial animations  not bad per se but alot of characters mouths dont sync up with their voices correctly, Ive been seeing it alot and it detracts from the game a bit.RecommendedI would recommend it because despite its issues this is the most fun Ive had in an AC game in ages  its renewed my interest in history and I want to see the rest of Bayeks tale play out.
