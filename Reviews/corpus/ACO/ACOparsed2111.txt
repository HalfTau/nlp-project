Vastly improved gameplay with very lackluster storytelling. Some gems in there but most side quests follow the exact same routine with a bit of sugercoating to make it less obvious. Brilliant fighting, stealth and exploration throughout more than makes up for this. Exquisite graphics and landscape makes it so you can easily get distracted and spend 3 hours exploring a bunch of ruins you see in the distance. Would recommend playing on Hard difficulty, atleast till late game. Bit too easy on the lower difficulties and did not find hard that challenging till around level 30 probably helps you can pick a level quest to do.Crafting is a bit of a pain as requires to spend time just hunting animals or ambushing patrols for resources, to get an almost unnoticable difference in damage/health except hidden blade which is a must for stealth playthroughs. Spend alot of time doing this late game which gets a bit dull for the higher upgrades.Decent weapon variety but found I did not like playing with any of the 2h weapons except dual blades, and was not much variety with the 1h weapons. Starts off really cool but I ended up finding 2 decent weapon types that I used for 75 of the game.Main missions pretty dull and had no idea why I was doing half the things I was doing as I had completely forgotten the storyline by the time I got round to doing the next misson. From what I could remember, someone gets killed so seems a good excuse to murder 20 people with tenous connections to the actual murderer.Encountered few to no bugs if i found any, I do not remember so could not have been that bad. Only issue I had was I could not run any higher than 50fps even on Medium settings, yet strangley ran at a constant 50fps on ultra gtx1060, i57600.TLDRLooks awesome, plays well. Quests get boring but plenty of side things to do if you ever get bored of exploring.8/10
