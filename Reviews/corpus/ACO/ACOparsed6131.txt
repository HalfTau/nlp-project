After a while, again a really good assassins creed. Playing the game feels pretty good, with a beautiful play world and an interesting story. The only down for this game is the Performance. Ubisoft should really bring out some fix for it. But i dont really care if i have 40 fps. It still feels pretty good playing this game.
