GTX 970i7 3770kRuns fantastically, zero problems. Also has a kick a benchmark. Try it and return it if you have issues.I am the Original Assassins Creed fan! I watched the early alpha/prototype trailers 9 months before the first game came out. I was the HYPE man for the first game to my friends. I made ALL of them watch that sick a first trailer.I loved the AC games for a long long time but boy did i start to get bored with them recently. AC black flag was the first one I didnt buy day one and I didnt even finish it. Same Ubisoft open world BS that I just cant stand anymore. AC Unity I didnt buy for months, finally did, only played 6 hours. Syndicate I never bought and mearly watching gameplay would bore me.But AC orgins fixed the issues! It is my favorite AC to date now by far. Ubisoft did a really good job of stripping their open world BS that plagues all of their games. Now the game feels a lot like witcher 3  farcry which is fantastic.Its also fukn beautiful! This is the BEST looking open world game I have ever seen. The detail is jaw dropping, no joke. I cant remember the last time I played a game I frequently stopped what I was doing and just stared
