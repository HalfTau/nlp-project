Mixed feelings about this game.  This is my first in the Assains Creed series and I am impressed with two factors, the storlyine and details of the historical theme. The graphics are excellent and attention to detail in quite good.  Fight scenes are pretty cool, the combat mechanics are okay.What I do not like about the game is the superman like qualities of the hero.  Still much more to explore and learn.  Is it worth the , not really, but it seems all the games are overpriced nowadays.
