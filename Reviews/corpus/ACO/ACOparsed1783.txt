I played every Assassins  Creed game, from the first one till Syndicate, I loved the first one and when Assassins Creed became Open World it started to repeat it self, and becoming boring game after game! Changes needed, and here it comes!AC Origins is a new direction to an old and tired series! A change needed indeed! Ubisoft learned a lot from their mistakes and trying to do something right in this game, and they succeeded! What I love about this game is the really small details that you discover even after 50 hours in the gameAC Origins is a combination of RPG, action, stealth, it is an Assassins Creed game but does not feel that way anymore, the XP system is seen before in Far Cry games, but works pretty well here, the combat is much more difficult and needs more actions than pressing buttons, the graphics are so beautiful, unfortunatly, the game engine is as always CPU hungry and not very optimized, even on my i5 6600 and my GTX 1070, the fps drops to 35 some timesif you are a fan of AC games, you wont be disappointed by this! But remember, this is not a game for everyone, you may love or you may hate it, but no one can deny that this one of the best AC titles
