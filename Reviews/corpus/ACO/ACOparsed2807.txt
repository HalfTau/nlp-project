Big thumbs up for this one. After completing the main story and all 50 achievments, I have to say its one of the few games which enthralls you in the world, you want to be part of it.Some of what I did like huge world living world, the NPCs in the game are more living than in the previous pieces, having comments, reactng to environments, and the enemies arent also mindless drones on a preset walk routine achievements are though, but doable elephant battles ftw its the birth of the assassinsSome what I hated, but added an extra feeling fires snakes once I bumped into 3 of them in about a half meter radius, instant death   Aya sequences at least the land based ones, I honestly cant understand why she is using that crapola equipment and why it cant be upgraded somehow... Hippodrome races AI can be really nasty and also needed too much luck in my caseStill its awesome and for those who are already bored with medieval setting, this will be a nice change
