Met my expectations for a quality AC game.Downsides were the weird Animus wave which wasnt much of a clue as to whats where, but makes you feel like a bat.Didnt like the lack of minimap too much felt like AC1 all over again somehow, but the exploration is great.Location objectives let you know waht you need to get and doesnt leave you floundering and lost.Really like how they brought back the flash scenes after killing a key target. This time they even put in Bayeks story in there for you to discover. Not sure what to say about it yet other than its less tedious than hunting for Ezios repressed memories in Brotherhood
