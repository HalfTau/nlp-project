It breaks my heart to do this because they really did a great job on alot of things.  The scenery is absolutly stunning and is a work of art and the tons of side missions are amazing.But RPG element was poorly executed and the level system makes this game wayyy to easy once you level up a bit and that kinda ruins it for me.So therfore i must give a thumbs down.
