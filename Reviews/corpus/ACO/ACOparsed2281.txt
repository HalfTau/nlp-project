Contrary to popular opinion I liked Unity. Wasnt interested in Syndicate.This though, I saw a YouTube video of the environment and someone said the game world felt like Witcher 3 in Egypt and I was sold. Didnt have high expectations and boy was I wrong. The story, meh, the gameplay 10/10. Its incredibly fun, havent been able to put it down.
