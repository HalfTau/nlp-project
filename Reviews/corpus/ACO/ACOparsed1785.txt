This game is vast, way beyond its predecessors. Tons of activities and quests. The game itself is running smooth and less buggy. The only cons I have is its main missions were too little. Itd be nicer if it has at least 20ish main quests thus requiring more time to play. I spent around a week to finish the game with 47 hours playing a day, all side quests and locations were finished and explored. It was great and loads of fun! So, Im looking forward for the next DLC with the new gods and ancient mythical creatures!
