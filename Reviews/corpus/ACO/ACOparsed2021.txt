The game is truely gorgeous! Ubisoft really did a great job one this one recreating acient Egypts scenery and culture, as well as Greek and Romans in that period. Map size is enormous, vast, full of life and that added that value to the game in exploring aspect. Ive been enjoying it so far, it is one of the game that I really enjoy both story and gameplay.  Also, it is a plus if you are old school fan for the series who has played the first games, it tells the story about the first assassins and their creed which then links to AC 1 and 2 lore.Although there are lots of changes for old fans, there are more RPGlike elements such as character and quests level system. Most EXP comes from doing quests, and its almost impossible to continue the main quests if you are underleveled. I feel like these changes are not bad at all since the game is meant to be a fairly long open world game that players should spend time exploring it.
