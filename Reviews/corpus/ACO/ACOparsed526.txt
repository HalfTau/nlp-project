The game itself is solid. Likely the best AC in a number of years.Issue is performance, and Ubisofts unwillingness to correct the issues with the port. The game performs well below the levels that their own support guildlines says it should.At best this is a waitforapatchandhowitfixesit situation, but its not something that I could recommend in its current state.
