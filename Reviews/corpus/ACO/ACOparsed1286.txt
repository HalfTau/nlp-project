As a huge fan of the series who has felt a little let down over the last few installments I can honestly say Origins has been a massive step in the right direction, combat feels fresh and the RPG levelling system lends itseld so well to the experience. Would absolutley recommend picking up this game if you have loved AC in the past but felt it got too samey
