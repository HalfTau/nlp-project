So I decided to give this game a go since all the reviews are pretty good. Except that the game doesnt work. It keeps crashing on startup and Ubisoft answer is that I need to install it in my C drive. Well, all my other games work outside my C drive. I shouldnt have to turn off all my overlays or install it in a specific place to play, so I refunded it. Before you buy, just know, this game is plagued with crashing issues, but unfortunately, its one of those things that you dont realize until after you spent your money. Assassins Creed has been terrible for years, and to me, it still is.
