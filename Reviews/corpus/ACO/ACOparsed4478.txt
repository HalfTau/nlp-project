Great game, but no modern day story.Modern day story is the MAIN story. What happens inside the animus is so that Abstergo can find the Apple of Eden outside the animus.And in terms of gameplay it used to be 50 past and 50 present, now its 99.9/0.1 This is ridiculous.I do not recommend this game, its a disappointment.
