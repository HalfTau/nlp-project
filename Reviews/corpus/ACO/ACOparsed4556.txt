I never really found a want to play Assassins Creed games, Black Flag was the first one that got me hooked AC 3 on XBOX 360 was the first AC game i have played but i can say that AC Origins is by far the best game i have played in years, i can easily find myself playing lots more of this game.Flawless CombatVery Fluid, Accurate Parkour System Unlike the previous AC GamesAmazing Upgrade SystemWeapon Variety is InsaneAmazing Abilities in Ability TabAbsolutely Beautiful GameEnjoyable CutScenes and Story Every game i have played i skip cut scenes, always have. Except this oneIncredible Bow SystemCountless More Positives That I Cant ListReally any predator that can circle you that you cant kill in one hit is a pain because they attack at slightly different times so if youre in a circle of predators than because of the different attack times you have a very small window to attack as they keep staggering you like hippos or crocsThere are probably hundreds of positives i could list for this game and only like 2 negatives which is insanely good, and if you check my profile i dont have a lot of hours in most of my games because its really hard for me to enjoy a game but AC Origins hooked me during the first 10 minutes of gameplay. i can by far say this is the best game ever made. i cannot recommend this game enough so just buy it and see what i mean, i was so hesitant to buy it but my friends bribed me in to getting it and ive had an immense amount of fun playing the game. so please, just buy this game, you will see what i mean.
