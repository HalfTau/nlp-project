This game is super massive, insanely beautiful and fun as frack, the new more open gameplay is really just so much more fun imo, the world feels so alive.I love the new combat, and once you get the hang of things you can dodge and slash your way through anything so much more challenging and fun then in previous ACs.My favorite AC of all time so far.
