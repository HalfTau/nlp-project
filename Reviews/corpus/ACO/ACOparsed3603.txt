I havent finished the game yet, and as far as progress through the main story I havent gotten all that far yet either, but I can already recommend this game very very emphatially.ACO is essentially a return to what I loved about the AC franchise from the start. I fell in love with AC2, but unfortunately from that point on it seemed like the series lost its way. It wasnt so much about the basics anymore, and I lost interest because I played AC to, basically, be an assassin, not to rebuild towns or play some weird combination of AC and Civilization.ACO strips all that other crap away and goes back to what I loved about the games. The setting is gorgeous, the cities feel alive, the plot is just enough to keep the motivation there without being too much. Its basically about just being an assassin again, and while the missions can get a bit repetitive the scenary is more than enough to keep me going.So if you gave up on the AC franchise kind of like I did, give this one a shot. It might remind you why you liked it in the first place.
