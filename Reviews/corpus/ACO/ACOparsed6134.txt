They have really caught me back into this franchise! With a mixture of Witcher 3 and Skyrim gameplay, i am really in love with this game.I get to run the game on full graphics and it runs smooth as silk. There are however some bugs, but very rare though. Microtransactions are present, but the selection of things to buy is actually quite limited.Ancient Egypt is beautiful with full of life, detailes and colors. You can really get lost in this world. Visit real places and buildings, meet real world characters from history. This game is 10/10
