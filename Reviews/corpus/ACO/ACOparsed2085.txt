I have never been interested in Assassins Creed franchise until Ive seen someone playing Origins.  Then I was quickly convinced I must play this game myself, like right now, without any Steam discount.Now after 60 hours with the all main and side quests finished, I have no regret.Ancient Egypt of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar is exotic and not well explored in fantasy roleplaying games.  The game managed to create a breathing landscape of ruins, villages, and cities, with peasants to scholars to poets and actors where player character, Bayek, who is driven by his quest of revenge but also gives players the freedom to explore pretty much everything that is there.Because my main objective of playing AC Origins is historical tourism, I chose the Easy difficulty and it was quite a breeze, which I recommend everyone whos main interest is to explore the world.
