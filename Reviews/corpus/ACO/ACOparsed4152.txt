This is definitely an Assassins Creed worth getting. The fighting style could be touched up a bit but the story is spot on and the scenery of Egypt is truly amazing. I get carried away from doing the missions and just take a small ride on my horse around the Pyramids. The optimization on the other hand isnt the best, thats if you have a powerful enough rig to run it and it is not recommended to be played on regular laptops or desktops that dont have an extra kick to running a big game. My rig specs are on my profile On the other hand, if you do have a gaming rig then youre all set to go. The stealth mechanic is impressive but AI tend to see you when youre not in clear sight which I believe needs to get looked into but ie hiding in bushes works great!One thing that I enjoy but dislike is this game has partial multiplayer, let me explain. No, you cant invite or join your friends in Origins but you are able to take screenshots in game and share them on the map meaning just about anyone can search on the map where you took your screenshot and see it for themselves. Another thing I really like is when someone dies in the game, you are able to see their death marker and avenge them by killing the enemy that killed them. This is very creative from Ubisoft but I would have preferred coop or at least a freeroam only mode.But other than that, definitely get this game if youre a fan of Assassins Creed and stealthy games, when it comes to it. This is a must buy!
