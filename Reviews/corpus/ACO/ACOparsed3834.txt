Never wrote a review, cannot express how disappointed I am with the performance of the game.Had a steady 3055fps on max settings which isnt ideal but playable until I reached the Temple fight mission which is still early game where suddenly Im at a 815fps. Dropping it to the lowest graphic settings gets me to about 2030fps, which is unacceptable. Im running a GTX 970 with an i72600.Now. I cant even load my save game. Im stuck on a black loading screen where the icon animates on the bottom right. So I cant even get into the game, no matter what I try.Love the gameplay but I am fing appalled with how poor the quality of this port. Will never buy a UbiShi game ever again.
