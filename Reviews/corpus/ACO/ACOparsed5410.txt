Game itself is REALLY GOOD, it is about time AC had some challenge to the combat but I cant recommend it due to some really bad performace issues. IF you have a freaking BEAST!! of a rig then it might be worth the risk, if not WAIT.UPDATE I have locked frame rate to 30fps all gfx on HIGH and I am using a xbox controller, Normally this is somthing I could NEVER live with.....Buut on this game, its not so bad, far better performance and gfx than console version I have played ps4 pro because it does not move from 30fps anywhere  PS4 pro can almost drop to 20fps when stuff gets heavy, so if you can live with that its like playing the preimium console verson.
