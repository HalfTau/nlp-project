Great fun game. gameplay is great, story so far has been great.Its still gets a negative recomandation because the game freezes for a couple of seconds at a time about 30 times an hour. this makes the game practily unplayeble. for the record, this happens both on ultra settings aswel as on very low. googled it, people saying its the fault of the DRM
