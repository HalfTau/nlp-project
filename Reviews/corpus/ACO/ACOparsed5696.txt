This game is a step in the right direction but this franshise still needs to improve. This game is certainly not like the others which is a good thing and its why I recommend it however dont think its the best AC yet, its not.My advice would be to stick to alot of the stuff that made the AC franchise unique very parkour and stealth heavy and pair it with an amazing story. That would truly be the best AC. The story here is fine, it will keep you going but thats it, its mostly the gameplay and the exploring of egypt that interests me in playing the game which is enough for me personally but may not be so for you.To address the elephant in the room, yes this PC port is not the best, the preformance can for sure be better. Im using a i7 6700k, a 1080ti and on ultra I get around 73 at 1080p, hahahah no. Its ofcourse above 60 so its perfectly playable but way too low for a PC like this so i hope its patched.If you are an AC fan get it, there is enough here to interest you. If your not wait for a sale or for the next game. If this is the direction Ubi is now going in with this franchise it will only get better so lets hope
