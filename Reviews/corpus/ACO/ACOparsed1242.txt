Honestly, i WOULD like to give this game a positive review, but with things as they are now, I cant. The gameplay/story itself is great, but when a game overheats an Intel I7 4790K CPU with WATER COOLING then I just cant recommend it, can only play in 1/2 an hour bursts then gotta shut down so the whole thing cools down. Until this is resolved, its a thumbs down from me.
