Its been a while but i think i can finally enjoy an AC title once more, very impressed so far and kinda relieved at the same time. You wouldnt think thered be much spunk to a desert scene but youd be wrong, Ubisoft nailed this one, even performance is remarkably stable between 5560fps still rattled by unity but i took no chances and took the 11GB GPU route.Most notable changesHighlights on people and objects reworked, substituted by markers making it far easier on the eyes and no longer subtracts things from the scene like a hologramPlayer/enemy level system, this actually feels far more like a challenging rpg and less like an invincible tomb raider experience, prepare to get yourkicked alot.Battle system is brutal and unforgiving, you are no longer the usual batman dancing from foe to foe which depending on what you like may be a good or bad thing, personnally its been a breath of fresh air so far. Id say its a mix of AC/whitcher/Dark souls, dont expect to just dive into a group and yolo through, the enemy is fast and relentless, i once went for the typical stealth behind and assassinate only to have the guy turn around and throw me back, which made me think he adapted just finished shadow of war lol.Micro trans is optional, and like shadow of war it may seem grindy at times but youll get by without ever needing it.Ill mention again, game is visually stunning, photo mode adds an interesting flare when you see upon opening the map screenshots other peeps have taken along with a voting system. Make sure your PC can handle it, lowest settings are cool but some things are worth seeing.10hrs in and thats where im at, any changes ill add as i go, and if you happen to find my corpse lying by the nile, AVENGE ME!
