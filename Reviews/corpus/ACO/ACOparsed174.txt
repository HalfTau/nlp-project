Ive been a huge fan of the AC series, even went it went downhill, was kinda losing hope for the series, but this one, this one freaking awesome game restored all hope for me, had so much fun with it and still having, cant wait for more dlcs to get released!Even if youre unfamiliar with the franchise, but like openworld ancient times, stealth, partially RPG game with fun combat and a beautiful world to see, definitely get this.
