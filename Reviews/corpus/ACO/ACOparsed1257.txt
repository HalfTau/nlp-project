Ive always been a fan of the AC games although this is the first one that I played on PC coming from Xbox. I recently got a PC dont have the specs off the top of my head and have played multiple graphic intensive games and my PC has always held up. I have always been able to play on at least high settings most games ultra. This is the first game I have ever played where I have optimization issues. On high settings I get about 50 frames but its not very steady. I floats sometimes dropping to thirty or lower and sometimes going up to 70. The game is definitely playable.... but I feel like its not too much to ask to have a steady 60 FPS or higher. Now the game does look beautiful. So I thought maybe this is the most graphically intense game I have ever played which is just putting some strain on my GPU. Although I am forced to believe this is not the case because even after dropping settings to medium and even low the FPS is in the same exact range as high settings. Also after doing some research on steam/reddit I saw a number of other people are having this same exact problem. I really like the game, and it is playable therefore I want to keep playing it. Although I have to give it a thumbs down because if Ubisoft is going to sell us a game worth 60 dollars it should be a finished game which is totally optimized.
