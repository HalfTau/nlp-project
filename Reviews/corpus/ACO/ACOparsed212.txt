The world in game is amazing. However, very unfriendly to new players, especially who never played assassin creed series. No enough instructions and no tutorial when I first started to explore the world. Whats more, the unique challenges required my character to reach level 40. So, I cannot enjoy it. I guess the developers never realized many players do not have time to play very long to reach level 40. Why not just set the unique challenges to users current level. Now, I feel like the only difference between me and soneone who will be able to play the cracked one soon is that I paid for it. No respect. Last but not least, too many in game purchases now and incoming month I would say.
