This is a great game, the story is really good and it looks absolutely amazing. I had no problems with bugs, only one problem where the game couldnt launch but I fixed it by updating my video card through the update drivers option in the control panel. Id recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the series or anyone who is interested in ancient Egypt and ancient Rome.
