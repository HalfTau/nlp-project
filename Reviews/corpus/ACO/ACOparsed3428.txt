This game is better than I expected, it does run slow at times, but its not really noticable. You MUST meet minimum requirements and then some. If you do and like the old AC games I highly reccomend this as it gives a true stealth feel and has a lot to do, discover, not collect, and just complete overall in and out of missions/side quests.The protagonist is great, he feels lively and switches from a death machine to a father to children to a husband in a few minutes. Just play it if you liked the old ones and meet above minimum requirements.
