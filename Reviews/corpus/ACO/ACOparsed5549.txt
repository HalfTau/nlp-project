A fun, immersive, experience. Is your computer more than a year old? Does it have an AMD card? You might have issues. My rig is 2 years old, and I have an AMD card. I still manage to get 30 FPS consistently at high settings, but that is the highest.The game is not well optimized. But it is good fun. There are things in this game that make some parts of it easier than similar parts in previous parts of the series. People of high intellegence will see exploits and probably sigh at them. But, its fun.Fun. Same word over and over again. Thats because if you think too much, this game loses  that aspect. It is a simple game.7.5/1010/10 for atmosphere
