This game is enjoyable and sets itself apart from other games in the series. If you are a history buff you will enjoy this game or if you just want to go to a seemingly foreign world check this game out. During my play through I found it difficult to not try and accomplish everything the game offers so I did and I enjoyed every minute of it.
