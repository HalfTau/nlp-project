Kind of dissapointed I was able to pet cats but not dogs. But then I guess egyptians must be cat persons. Highly enjoyable game. The combat style was not my favourite on the series, but still, it was a very well achieved gameplay. Graphics and locations were astonishing. I finished the game and still want to finish exploring and completing the side quests. Kept up to my expectations. VERY superior to the last two games on the series. Getting a bit back to old school AC was definetely a good decision by Ubisoft.
