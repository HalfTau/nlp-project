This is a difficult game to form an opinion about for me. On one hand, Ive loved and played hours every day since its release. On the other hand, The performance and framerate has been awful unexpected as its been ported really well other than that. I dont know how much is to do with the whole DRM thing people have been talking about or how much is to do with its optimisation or lack therof, but running it on a GTX1080 at 4k, 1440p or 1080p at even low settings shouldnt net me a 40fps average, one that doesnt even change at lower resolutions.tldr very impressed with the gameplay, enjopying the story, but can hardly play with how it runs. If Ubisoft patches the performance, whatever is causing it, this would be my favourite of the series.I wouldnt recommend buying it until then.
