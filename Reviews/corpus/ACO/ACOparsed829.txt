By far the best installment to the franchise. The story rich envirenment, the beautiful graphics, the challenging combat, all great aspects of this beautiful tale of the origins of the brotherhood. Ubisoft has truely outdone themselves with Assassins Creed Origins, theyve set the bar higher then ever before for both open world games as well as rpgs. This game is a must have for any open world/ action RPG lover.I can proudly give this game a solid 20 out of 10
