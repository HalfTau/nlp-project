Okay, first Im a long time fan, played since Assassins Creed on Xbox 360. I have had many personal up and own with the series that is not needed to get into for this game. The story, combat and overall gameplay mechanics are very fun, new, abut Asassin Creed feel. This combat flows wonderfully while not feeling completely new or overhauled. I have 20 hours currently and have barely done the main story. There is a lot to do and feed lott grinders needs/feels while playing solo and not in a MMO or Weeb enviroment. I also enjoy learning to see how the Creed form to then go to the days of Altair with this prequel Knowledge all over again. All this said however, my PC a i77700K and AMD RX 480 cant even do 60 FPS on High 1080p consistantly, this is the most demanding and unoptimized game I have played since Player Unkknow Battlegrouns and its more optimized LOL. IT is fun and worth the money if you can tollerate low FPS 3050 with 60 only being in the desert. Ubisoft game finally having steam achivements is nice too! THis is also very similiar in design to Ghost Recond WIldlands except with Assassins Creed and actual loot.
