A lot of people give the AC series flak. This Game deserves non of it. This new title has reinvented the AC series, changing it from a counter button masher to a proper hack n slash which dirastically improve gameplay all the time, maintaining a gripping story line of a man and his Mrs. against the world. Strongly recommend this one, by far the best in the series gameplay wise yet.
