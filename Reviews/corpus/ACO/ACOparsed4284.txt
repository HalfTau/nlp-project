WARNING. THIS IS NOT A FULL REVIEW DUE TO MANY REASONS THAT I WILL EXPLAIN.I wish I could talk about the new mechanics such as the leveling and looting and combat, but I cant experience any of this due to the numerous issues performance wise. For those many players that have experienced the issues with sound, youre not alone. Cant hear dialogue in cutscenes, no sound for many other things such as walking, couldnt hear animals, everything is messed up. But hell, I could hear that goodsoundtrack. Assassins Creed has never failed to bring a wonderful soundtrack.I wish the sound was the only problem with the game. I can fix that by turning my headset off and switch to it playing from speakers, and all is well. But the largest issue I have with the game is the  performance. I constantly drop frames and have stutter issues. If it was because of my computer, thats fine, but its not. Its due to the DRM on top of a DRM to prevent piracy. Which theyve done a study and piracy doesnt actually affect sales So ubisoft has chosen to screw over paying customers in attempts to hold off the pirates for a little while. So...thanks for that.At this point I have issued a refund for my 60 for I shouldnt have to do troubleshooting to get the sound working. I shouldnt have to turn my graphics down to medium or low just so I can get a solid 60 frames. This is a AAA game and there is no reason for any of these issues. Its a solid not recommended from me until these problems get fixed. Only then when Ill repurchase this game and change this review.
