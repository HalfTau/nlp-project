Due to a sound bug, that means the game audio is either completely silent or covered in a loud crackling, this game is currently unplayable for me. This is a god damn shame, since I was exited to play it, and even waited 10 days to buy it, expecting that bugs like this would have been taken care off by now.I will continue to try and fix this, and hope for at fix from Ubisoft. But until that time comes, I cannot recommend this game.
