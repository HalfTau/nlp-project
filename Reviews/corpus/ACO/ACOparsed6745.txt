After finding workarounds for the bugs in the game, its a ubisoft game what did you expect? I can honestly say that this game is worth 60 dollars.Ubisoft reinvented the Assassins Creed Franchise with this game. The RPG elements are subtle and you cant just blow through the main story.8.5/10, 10/10 if patch fixes bugs so I dont have to find workaroundsEDIT Most bugs are fixed and the game is ing great.
