Best AC ever made. For the first time ever i felt that in combat skill mattered in this series. Still combat isnt perfect and feels a bit unresponsive. I liked that they removed minimap and you were engouraged to explore. Beautiful landscape with absolutely stunning details and huge world to explore. Nothing else you can ask for the money. I ran through the game with normal difficulty and mimimal gear and xp grinding and still it took over 30 hours to beat the main questline, rare thing in todays singleplayer games. Story was solid and left things to wait from future dlcs.
