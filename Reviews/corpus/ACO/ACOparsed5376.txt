This is one of the most amazing assassins creed games ive ever played after AC2 ,Brotherhood and Black Flag. Assassins creed Origins saved the series and the game had no issues or performance isssues for me and the story of Bayek Of Siwa is the best of all Loved Aya and Bayek and not to forget Khemu! and i would have loved to know more about cleopatra but its fine because discovery tour is on its way honestly i cant wait for the DLCs expansions to drop totally worth buying Good Job AC team you guys nailed it!Pros1.New setting2.Egypt is one beautiful land of wonders and mystries3.story is just im speechless its AMAZING4.The game was well optimized for PC for me it worked well 1080p 60 at Ultra High Preset with a GTX10605.Speechless xDNo en CONS BABY!
