I absolutely love this game! The gameplay is great, the landscape is beautiful and the story so far has been great!!! I have played just about every Assassins Creed game that has been on console or PC and this is starting to become my favorite right after Black Flag. I enjoy the changes even though it took a little time getting used to but it was well worth it. I am going to take my time with this game and enjoy every aspect of it and updating my graphics card helped show me more of what I was missing.
