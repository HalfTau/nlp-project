World is beautiful, graphics is great, BUT!IThe main story and quests are completely boring. Some side quest are more interesting and have deep meaning, than main quest. In general, I can divide quests on four categories1 Kill the guy in some stupid mask usually it takes a couple minutes to find him and 510 seconds to kill him2 Steal a horse one headshot, horserider is dead and you have the horse3 Save some idiot from the army camp stealthish missions4 Scroll puzzles. Another way to explore the game world. It is nice, but not what you expect from ACIIARMY CAMPS! Playing the game you may have the feeling that 5070 of the whole map is army camp. Fortunately, enemies are stupid which is tipical for whole Assassins Creed franchise. Cannot say that new fight system changed the gameplay. Now instead of the segmented health bar, all enemies have one, continious bar.IIIThere is no strong character in the game, those whose story is normally told and interesting. The motivation of the enemies is simply ridiculous. The villains are just empty. Just imagine... You are presented to the next villain in the mask, which must be killed, and you like well... ok, find, kill, sounds simple AND IT IS ACTUALLY SIMPLE. Some videos after the murder can simply be skipped, because they do not bring anything new into the story. Moreover, a few s in masks will be presented to you, but you will not kill them. Its just that at some point your wife tells you I killed them.... Well... OK...Overall, the game is simulation of horse riding across the map, parkour that became less attractive and hunting. And again THE MAIN QUEST IS THE WORST ONE I EVER PLAYED! I would say, Minecraft is more exciting, than the story of Bayek.
