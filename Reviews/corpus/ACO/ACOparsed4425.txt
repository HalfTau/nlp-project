And I thought all AC games were garbage except AC4, and then I played this gem.  Absolutely beautiful, immersive and extense game this is.The combat, improved from the bad implemented previous Batman AK style to a more fair and competitive style like Dark Souls scheme.Missions!  the variety of these makes this game non repetitive!  Like a GTA style!Currently I play it locked at 45 fps unable to reach 60 fps stable, at Ultra settings with my rig i7 4790k 4GHz, 16 GB Ram and 1080Ti strix OC Gaming edition but thats not necessary for me since the game is pretty stable and beautiful in the graphics department.The story Well paced, more interesting than AC4!Cons  the chopped images at every cutscene, but maybe will be fixed with a patch.
