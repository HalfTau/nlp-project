Currently, as I play, the most infuriating thing is ittermitent crashes every 3040 minutes. After the 4th crash, I had to call it quits for the night, and I will likely have to wait for Ubisoft to have its first round of crash bug fixes. Im running an AMD 8 Core CPU, and have 16Gb RAM and a 1070.The reason its infuriating is because the story is extremely captivating, and theyve done a great job of story telling while mixing it into the open world around you. The map is gargantuan, btw. It feels even bigger or as big as Ghost Recon Wildlands.In fact, this game, in many ways, feels like the AC version of Ghost Recon Wildlands all the assassination missions and gear loadout options and skill points are just like GRWL, which is totes fine, but then I noticed that theyre just using ACized versions of the exact same graphic style and animation for the UI to show the user that the target is now dead. Cmon Ubisoft, I know youre formulaic in your games, but thats an all new L A Z Y   L O W.  ...For future games, Ubisoft, please dont cut THAT many corners its okay for your open world games to have some differences in the gameplay experience right down to the UX.I very much so recommend this game for the gameplay and story and experience overall. I dont recommend buying it if you have anything AMD based until theyve patched that crap.
