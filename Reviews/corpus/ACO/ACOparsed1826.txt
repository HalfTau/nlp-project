My favourite Assassins Creed game to date DI have gotten so many more play hours of enjoyment out of Origins than any other AC game!!I loved how they turned Origins more into an RPG game, rather than keeping the gameplay linear.The map is huuuuuge and the landscape is an absolute beauty to look at, as well as the varying fight styles!!Im excited for the future DLCs
