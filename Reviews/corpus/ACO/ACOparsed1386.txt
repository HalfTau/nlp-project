I just wanted to make it more public/visible that if your computer is running with a CPU without SSE 4.2 support, then the game will not run. This includes AMD Phenom processors what my machine has. I have an AMD 270X GPU and generally speaking my cmputer is capable of running 2017 games but this game requires a CPU with SSE 4.2 support. So if you have a CPU without SSE 4.2 support, this game will not work for you, and you will need to upgrade.
