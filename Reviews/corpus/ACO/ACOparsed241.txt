I know its a little late for this review, but after 75 hours of gameplay, I think it is time for one.Assassins Creed Origins sets you into one of the most beautiful but also highly demanding gaming worlds ever! Egypt and its locales are rendered with extreme care for detail and voice acted well to. You dont just play the game, but you live it!PROS Amazing visuals Best all time water appearance and water physics in gaming IMO Well rendered cutscenes Superb Voice acting Good story makes a better impact if you play the related side quests as well Not a copy of The Witcher 3, but rather is a product that is inspired by it Photo Mode and limited time events! Pretty fun combat IMO Amazing weather effects wish that it rains sometimes, althought it would be unrealisticCONS Okayish arrow physics Hardly memorable soundtrack I know this might be controversial. But I could only recollect about 2 to 3 soundtracks at best Random bugs and glitches Bad interaction scenes Performance issues aplenty Random FPS drops coupled with nearly a 100 CPU usage Repetitive sidequest gameplay But the way it is done is fantastic. A few side quests are memorable and I enjoyed playing them. But others, not so muchSo overall, I found Assassins Creed Origins to be a pleasant experience, even though I had these issues as stated above. It certainly is an improvement from the standard rinse and repeat formula that Ubisoft have been putting into these games before!
