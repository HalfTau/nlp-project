Played some more of this on the weekend. It is a magnificent game. Combat is fun, music is excellent, and graphics are beautiful with amazing atmospheric effects. Lots of very interesting places and caves to explore. I am enjoying the storylines and side quests.Ive encountered three bugs so far Had to unplug my Thrustmaster HOTAS to be able to use the mouse in the game. It sticks in the centre of the screen if I have them plugged in. Had a buzzing sound with framerate freezes and missing speech. Fixed this by disabling all audio playback devices except for my Sound Blaster Z card. Sometimes animals glitch and get stuck in rocks and other landscape objects. Ive also seen NPCs glitch and get stuck in the geometry.Later editAlmost 70 hours into this game and I am still enjoying every minute of playing it and look forward to loading it up every day. If there was ever any doubt Ubisoft is one of the masters of the open world game then this should be the prime example of open world done right. A stunning achievement.
