Ive always loved the Ac series and this one is no different. I have not really played any of the ACs since revelations and it does not let down! it really does feel like the old AC games. For me the previous versions just didnt look very good so I didnt buy them. if you have any doubts about this game just buy it, its that good! The visuals are fantastic! photo mode is great, becuase there so many great places to take pictures at! story line for me was great for the most part, the side quest can get repetitive but for the most part the are very well done. Combat is very well balanced I feel. Hopefully the DLc to this game can add a little more to the end game but thats about all I can say! Hopefully We get to go back to rome in the next game! play the damn game!
