What can i say its a mixed bag.Pros Good gfx Good sound Pretty intressting fightsCons 4 Layers ! of drm Steam, Uplay, WMP  Denuvo that combined seem to tank performance Very CPU intensive likely due to the aboveAll in all  Can i recommend it? If you like to game with high fps definatly no but if 60ish is good enough with pretty darn highend hardware then sure you might like the game.Personally with 7700k, 1080ti, 64gb ram, game installed on an 1tb 960 pro running 3440x1440 100hz gsync display 65ish fps aint ok due to the games insane cpu loads and i personally suspect the 4 layers of drm is responcible. I simply expected more FPS with such hardware and ACO in its current state wont deliver.So untill that CPU hogging title is patched i cant recommend it if you care about having a high fps.UPDATE Ubi have fixed some of the CPU issues in the first patch, all in all its a favourable outcome now.
