I find this game tolerable. Its pretty, the mechanics arent great but ok, howerver the visit the store spam is annyoing. I paid full price for the game and I dont want to buy anything else for this game. I AM DONE! I dont want any microtransactions and I dont want to visit the ing store! Ill change my review when they stop spamming me in game to buy more things for the game!
