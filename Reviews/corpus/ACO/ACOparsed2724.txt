Beautiful open world with many sites to discover. Much fewer bugs or problems than in Unity.Main story is a little short, but the dlcs are yet to come, so Im really looking forward to some more hours of gameplay.Different weapon effects as rpg element and three skilltrees, maxlevel 40 and some more levelups for all of the skills. To get all of them takes a lot of additional time or needs an investment in skillpoints.Im still missing a contribution to the main story of the real world, but I didnt expect much from that after the last games.
