Honestly, wow! This game came back great, so happy to see the new approach of the Assassins Creed. The Game adds a fantastic new loot system and also gives us a new customizable system where we can unlock outfits and choose how our assassin looks. Not to mention the amazing graphics absolutely breath taking scenery. This Assassins Creed game also doesnt hold your hand like all of the other Assassins Creed games do, with the dull combat system, enemies will show no mercy if you step out of line. Incredible game and I would recommend it to anyone even thinking about getting it or any fans to other Assassins Creed games.
