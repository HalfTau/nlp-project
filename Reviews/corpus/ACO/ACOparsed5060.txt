The Game of the Year, the game fulfil all my expectations and more, the map is huge, alot of things to do, and beside this the graphic and the beauty of the world is something exceptional.altough still there is stuff to be fixed. i had an audio problem of buzzing in game, and freezing. still with these problem its dont take away my fun and i continue playing the game.Recommended! just waiting for a patch to fix the lunch problems.
