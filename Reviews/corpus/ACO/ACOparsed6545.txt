Witcher 3 in Ancient Egypt with a touch of MGSV. Performance is ok, havent experienced any crashes, just minor bugs here and there, considering its the first day, its in a great shape. I got around 5060 fps on average on ultra settings, with an overclocked 1080 FTW, guess pptimization could be better but definitely not a big issue.After 6 straight hours, I can confirm that gameplay is solid, AC should have gone total open world sooner but better late than never. Compared to Witcher, stealth, parkouring and archery aspect definitely adds additional levels of fun. The combat system is definitely an improvement over previous AC games, combined with RPG progression, it makes the game more complete.The map is really huge, great job on the rural areas, but Alexandria was a bit let down, I dont know why but this major city feels too organized and not authentic enough. Second Update 15hr in, my experience is improved as the story developed into something more interesting, lots of dramatic moments and good enough twists. Also played the first naval mission, man does water look amazing in this game, best Ive ever seen.Game crushed for the first time for me but it happened during interacting with this new screenshot feature, during gameplay, havent experienced any slowdown or bug.I also see that the next major installment will definitely take place in Italy as Rome is heavily involved in the game and they already modeled lots of pieces  units etc. It will be either during the civil war of the first triumvirate or the second. Good job so far, Ubisoft, keep it coming.
