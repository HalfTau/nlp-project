For all these people saying the game is garbage blah blah blah...its not the game, its your PC. You need a stronger processor to run this game, at least an i7. Anyone trying to run this game on anything less will run into issues. I have a i7700K and im using about 7080 of my processors power while running this game. STOP BLAMING UBI AND SAYING THE GAME IS TRASH. YOUR PROCESSOR IS TRASH. GET WITH THE TIMES.
