I enjoyed it a bit but too be honest i could never get lost in the open world ubisoft created, a large portion of the map is pretty damn empty or just an empty ruin only there for you to waste time collecting useless loot. I had hoped taking a year off would have brought some inovation but as soon as i played the reused sailing/naval system i knew that wasnt going to happen. Honestly this is like the broke mans Witcher 3 but i think even that might be to much of a compliment. So dissappointing Ubisoft.
