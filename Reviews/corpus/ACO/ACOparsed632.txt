boring. not immersive. terrible combat. To be fair i am comparing this to the other assasins creed games which i loved other than syndicate because of its narrative, aside from that i disliked how they changed the combat mechanics, before you used to have so many combos and advanced moves you could do but they took that away for a simpler and in my opinion very boring combat playstyle... i loved assasins creed but im afraid this game just didnt do it for me.
