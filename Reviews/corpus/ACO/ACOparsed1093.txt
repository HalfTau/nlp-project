Ever since the lastest update that changed some of the icon, and added yellow checkmarks/circles around things youve done. I havent been able to play for more than a few minutes before getting stuck in a endless menu loop that wont close. Restarted from last Checkpoint/Restarted the game. If i Uninstall, it will stay that way. Game is fantastic until this last update, But to have to uninstall and reinstall a game over that issue. Id rather move on. Ive played every AC game except handhelds and AC China. This is the first time ive actually experienced a problem that was game breaking.Gameplay 7/10Story so far 7/10World Size 9/10Graphics 9/10 some models dont look goood close up.
