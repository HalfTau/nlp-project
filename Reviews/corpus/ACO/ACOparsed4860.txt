Ive noticed a lot of negative reviews lately, mostly towards performance issues and/or DRM. I have not personally had any issues with either, and Im genuinely sorry that other folks are having to deal with those problems. Barring those 2 things, I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who is a fan of open world games and/or RPGs. Im quite blown away by the difference in direction that Ubisoft Montreal has taken with this game. It feels like a much needed breath of fresh air for a series I still enjoy, but have not truly loved since AC2 or Black Flag. There certainly feels to be elements from both the Witcher and Dark Souls the latter in terms of combat to a slight extent, albeit with its own unique locale and art style. Hopefully Ubisoft will patch/fix the performance issues others are facing as it would be a shame to miss out on this title due to something like that.Again for the record I have had zero issues with performance or DRM, but I am running this game on an Nvidia 1080 ti so perhaps that is helping avoid this. Doubtful since my RAM and CPU are quite old.
