I dont really wirte reviews of games, but I feel like Assassins Creed Origins deserves it.This game is imho the best in the series so far. I LOVE how they improved the overall mechanics of the game, the witcherlike RPG system is insane!There are lots of cool weapons to chose from, with different effects. They may be silly, but its hella fun shooting flaming arrows from a semi automatic BOW, or guiding the arrow to your opponents head. Unrealistic, but HELLA FUN.The armor system is pretty basic, you grind/farm materials to level the pieces up, but its really enjoyable. As for the looks, you have outfits that are noncustomisable.The combat system is interesting, they added hitboxes for different parts of the body. Playing it on hard and I gotta say you cant really charge a keep or base. Well you can, but its challenging not to die instantly.The stealth system is improved, the AI is aware of its surroundings.The skill tree is fine, there are so many cool abilities and combos to choose from. Unrealistic but FUNNNN. And thats what a game is supposed to be.The game is pretty well optimised for pc, im running it on a entrymid level gaming laptop and Ive had no problems. The CPU ussage is rather high, but most UBISOFT games are pretty cpu intensive. Watch dogs, tom clancy.To sum it up, this game adds a totally new experience to the AC Universe, in a good way. Fun, cool story, lots of places to discover, beautiful map, sick combat and stealth system. Few bugs here and there, but its alright.Overall 8/10
