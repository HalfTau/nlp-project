Ik its a bit early to review but this game so far is really fun, graphics are amazing and the stealth, the weapons, the clothes are all very intresting not to mention the variety of loot you can find and finally the size of the map is so big its probably got one of the biggest maps in all games ive played in the past and believe it or not ive played lots of games.  Ps Its finally an assasins creed game thats good in my opinion as i hated the likes of unity.Overall I rate this 10/10 for the reasons mentioned above...
