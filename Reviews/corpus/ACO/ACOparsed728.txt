Assassins Creed? No?Wait... The title is Assassins Creed Origins. No!Its a completely different game, and I love it! At 60 hours I finished the main quest line on hard mode, never changing back to anything lower. At 75 hours in I found my first game breaking bug where I fell through the map, quickly resolved and funny as hell when I died.Overall 10/10 for the gameLooking forward to more AC games from Ashraf Ismail
