Wish i could put mostly recomended. Enjoying the gameplay, really like the charater Bayek, love the literal eagle vision and overal having a good time.Just wish it would use more than 5060 of my GPU while its at 100 of my cpu GPU gtx1070 at 2200Mhz and CPU 4690k at 4.6Ghz both watercooled but hey, ubisoft are poor at optimising games and making good decisions in general.Also wish they removed Layla and replaced her with someone else. Hell Id even take desmond back, or a talking tree that doesnt do anything else Move the anolog stick to sway side to side. or lara croft. yeah do a crossover. You do sort of raid tombs.While I put recomended, Id say either wait to see if ubisoft cut the bull or wait for it to go on sale.NEVER upgrade your PC because ONE game is poorly designed. Otherwise it be the most expensive game youve bought this year. Just like if you bought a console just to play Halo or something silly.
