Almost a flawless execution. This is now one of my favorite games. The story is Great, Every character has emotion. The side quests are some of the best Iv ever played, due to them actually having story to them. My only cons are the Auto Drive A.I. is pretty bad. And there arent a very large variety of finishing moves and assassinations, only real variety to me for that is the bow kills.But still, a vary well made game.
