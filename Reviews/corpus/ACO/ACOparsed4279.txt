OMG, you couldnt compress all the majesty that is Assassins Creed Origins into an encyclopedia. This is every good aspect of FarCry, GTAV, Ghost Recon Wildlands, and the Witcher 3 all wrapped up into a single game. However, they didnt stop at that, then they went and improved everything again by a magnitude of 10!This game sets the benchmark so high that they will easily get game of the year for singleplayer.Very, very, very well done Ubisoft
