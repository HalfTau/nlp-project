This is the reboot that Assassins Creed needed in order to be an enjoyable game again, the 1 year break they took shows in the game being less buggy than the previous ones on release.Gameplay wise, all the added RPG elements fits perfectly and adds a nice layer to all the gameplay elements from the previous AC games, i would even love to have more RPG elements but many of the casual players wont like that, so I understand why its a bit simplistic when its compared to an actual RPG.The graphics are very nice and the locations are stunning, as usual based on actual locations but all the previous AC didnt look half as impressive as Origins, wherever you go on the whole map you can stop for a few minutes to take screenshot in what i think is the photo mode ever in a game and sharing the photos in game so your friends can see them while checking the map is an excellent idea.Add to that the charismatic characters, decent main story  OK side quests and you end up with a very good game for AC fans and non fans.
