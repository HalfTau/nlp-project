Literally took 5 minutes to run the benchmark and Im running an i76700k and 1080ti and my frames didnt get above 60 during 90 of the benchmark.I alttabbed out of the game to check what was wrong in the Task Manager and I could actually SEE the mouse lag and typing lag from the Denuvo and other DRM.It is unacceptable for games to absolutely DESTROY your performance in order to guarantee sales. Ubisoft has been known to tank performance and degrade graphics in the past, but this is just ridiculous.
