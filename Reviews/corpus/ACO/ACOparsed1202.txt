An excellent change of direction for Assassins Creed. Yeah gameplay can be a little clunky but its hard to find something boring about this game, hell even wandering the middle of nowhere desert is entertaining. If you love AC this is a must get, if youve been holding off coming into the serried the last couple games this is for you too.Quebec has done an amazing job with this and delivers over what Montreal couldnt seem to figure out for a better part of a decade.
