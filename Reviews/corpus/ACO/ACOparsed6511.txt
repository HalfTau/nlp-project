Performance ReviewSo far so good. Performance sits at around 7080fps average with all settings maxed out. The games graphical menus are impressive and feature a ton of options including a really handy performance chart that displays GPU, CPU, and FPS linegraphs from the past 30 seconds of gameplay. The game also includes a benchmarking tool that displays similar information. Overall, gameplay is very smooth, but there does appear to be some minor hitching Stuttering especially during certain cutscenes and when exploring city areas. The benchmark and gameplay line graphs display several drops in FPS because of this and it hurts and otherwise smooth experience.Still, aside from these stutters, this is probably one of the smoothest Assassins Creed PC launches Ive seen and Im excited to play through this some more. Stay tuned for a first impressions review by next week and a full review once I finish the game.Specs Win10, gtx 1080ti, i7 6700k, 16gb DDR4 Ram
