I have to admit that Assassins Creed Origins is the best game of 2017, the level of dedication and commitment which is shown by the developers is absolutly worth applauding for. I really couldnt find a single mistake either in story or in the gameplay as compared to previous Assassins Creed Series. As Origins have various side missions which makes me eager every single time to explore the game even more. Its really addictive once you are familier to the controls, moreover the whole new set of controls makes it more challenging than ever before. I would 100 recommend anyone who is into RPG and Action games. Its an absolutly unseemed reality. As an Indian gamer I was first resistant to buy it as it was of 3500 bucks for a single game but after playing for a while now, I have no regrets buying this Beauty. 3 Looking forward to play the extention part called The Hidden Ones which took place 4 yrs after the completion of the main storyline.
