So, Ive put 23 hours into the main story with minimal side questing.To keep this short, Id give it a solid 8/10 as it is today.With some optimization patches, definitely a 9.The optimization is what lets the game down.The story, sound, environment, setting, everything is great. None of the quests made me feel like I was doing mindless fetch quests either!The two cons with the game are shotty lipsyncing and optimization.For reference my specs are listed belowPlaying at 1080pi54690K8g RAMGTX 970850 EVO Game installed here and ran from hereNo matter if I set the settings to low or high or a mish mash in between, I cant get my frame rate higher.I look forward to what the season pass brings as the story was ended quite nicely. It feels like a complete game as it is.
