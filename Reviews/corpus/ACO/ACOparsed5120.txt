I took a chance and bought the game despite people having problems with its performance, and found no issues at all. Instead, I got a beautiful game. With an i7 and a GTX 1080 it runs smooth for me, easily over 80 FPS  in my opinion, the negative reviews are unjustified.The game itself is stunning. I havent touched any Assassins Creed games since Black Flag, because they started to feel stale and too much like a rinse and repeat. Origins does not only appeal to me aesthetically with a gorgeous rendition of ancient egypt, but the culture and the storyline of the game is also wonderfully presented. The new combat system is refreshing and the RPG elements they brought into the series work so much better than the way they have previously handled it.Quests so far seem solid, including the sidequests. Definitely an improvement to previous design.All in all, Im pleasantly surprised thus far and look forward to finishing the game. I hope Ubisoft will continue to take down any future Assassins Creed installments in a similar RPGesque style.
