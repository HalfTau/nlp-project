I started playing the game fine but then suddenly i couldnt get in my original save, i looked on so many articles and reports, but none has an actual solution, i am stuck on the loading screen after playing with my character in the animus in that infinite space, please recommend solutions he comments. I NEED HELP. The game is very fun if you dont have this glitch or whatever its called.
