100 recomended.Very impressive how big and detailed the old Egyptian land is.Good and interesting storyline, a character that becomes more and more sympathetic as more as you play.This is the closest we will get to a real new Prince of Persia.Better than expected. Overwhelmed by its beauty.Very much recommended. Full price worth.
