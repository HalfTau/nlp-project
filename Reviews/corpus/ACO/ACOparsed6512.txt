First ImpressionFeels like Im playing a bit of Zelda, Witcher 3, Wildlands, and Assasins Creed. The game runs pretty smooth for my machine. Im a graphic over FPS guy, so a steady 30 fps at 4k with mostly high settings is perfectly okay running on i7 5820k and a 1070 FTW. This game is such a beauty to look at and fun to explore. The combat experience is pretty much a complete revamp, and it works! This title will revive this dying franchise, and its definitely worth picking up on day 1.
