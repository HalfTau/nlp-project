Well, I was a AC Fan from day one till after Black Flag. The series kind of lost its true nature after Ezio left us and Connor seemed to be the last Character.But now we have Bayek and until now i can say hes one hell of a new protagonist. Not to mention that the gameplay is back to former glory.The ingamestore can be ignored, to be honest there is nothing of value in it and the cosmetic part Unicorn, wtf is...well also not important.
