THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT!This is the game we Assassins were waiting for!Well its pretty much the same, the environments are stunningly wellcrafted and the graphics are gorgeousAh, The revamped combat system adds skill and unique kill animations that dont hand the kills to you using the countersystem. The world is immersive and alive. This makes planning your attack more important, rather than jumping into a group of 10 enemies and murdering them.Assassins Creed is a RPG now, so you need to hunt and craft your gear to level up to you quests!You got to know how the Creed and the Templar Order was formed!It gets boring eventually to the middle, but the final sequences wins you heart!Its amazing how they connected fiction to the real history.Well thats enough for the story part, as no spoilersUbisoft did a great work!Assassins, go for this gamesAssassins Creed is finally good again.My score 10/10
