As a long time assassins creed fan , I can defenitely say this game is my favorite out of them all , the combat is a whole different thing now which I kind of didnt like in the start but once I got use to it the game was just way better.Dont forget about the huge map , After beating the game entirely I still havent explored it all , I love all the side quests they arent actually boring and repetitive , this game is on my top 5 for sure.
