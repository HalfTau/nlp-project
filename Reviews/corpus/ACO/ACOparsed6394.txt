Pros  Good story, good combat, huge beautiful map, very good time period, and a ton of things to do including very in depth side quest. Over 50 hours of gameplay hereCons  Limited parcour, a few noticable bugs, unomptimized for AMD which affected me cause the best fps I got was 46 and it was in an empty desert got about 27 fps in crowded city and the game does not look much better than the last one in my estimation and I got very good fps in Synicate upwards of 5560 fps and like 38 at the lowest, and lastly for the cons I did not like how they depicted the Romans, the Romans look cool and all but they are not historically accurate, the basic Roman solider of that time is the legionarie who wears lorica hamata chain mail and has a basic helmet, tower sheild and a gladius, the Roman brutes in this have giant axes like they are barbarians or something and wear Lorica segmentata, the plate armor that wasnt used until 100 years after Caesar is deadCaesar is in this game, the Roman depicition isnt that big of a deal but if you are a history buff like myself it does bother you a bit.Verdict I reccomend the game at the 60 dollar price point, with hitorical falses and unomptimized gameplay for myself I still clocked 47 hours at the time of this review and more after, this shows how good of a game it is, my list for top ACs is AC1, AC2, Brotherhood, Revalations and 3 in that order and this game is basically tied at 5th with Assassins Creed 3 it is very good and probably the most RPG game of franchise with so much to do.
