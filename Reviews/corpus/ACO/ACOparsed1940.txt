Im a huge Assassins creed fan, when the first game was realeased in 2007 I remember being so excited to play it, it had some new features that I liked that other games lacked, I payed it on my super old now dead desktop pc at 5 fps haha i didnt care, until my father agreed to upgrade my pc and I got to play it decently.Over the years AC games never ceased to amaze me as a player, I was a huge fan and still am, i didnt like unity much, didnt feel special playing ac3 but ezio trilogy and syndicate were amazing/Now to AC Origins, WOW i had a slow start with it, because i needed to get used to all the new features they have, it as an RPG now, but the game really helps you make the most of it, it teaches you everything you need to get you started then it is all on you, I LOVED how vast the game is, upgrading my weapons, looting and exploring the game, they did an amazing job on this game, the world is super vast and huge, full of things to do, that when i open the game to play I have a problem deciding what to do because there are so many good options !!!!!Didnt notice any glitches on my part, although the game crashed whenever I record my gameplay but I guess that my RAM is to be blamed on that.Im playing the game on 1080p on ultra, and the game looks so beautigul, the details and everything/An awesome game, very vast and big, good story mode, lots and lots of side quests, good fighting system, and the looting and upgrading system are also good, need a little bit of getting used to though to make the best out of it!If you havent bought this game then I RECOMMEND you do that now, although if you are a student beware of spending too much time on the game haha I had a hard time to stop playing the game because i needed to study/I havent finished the story mode yet and that is because I like to get 100 sync, looting and exploring everything laeving nothing behind, but on the holidays Ill make sure to finish it.
