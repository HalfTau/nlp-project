Following the decline of the Assassins Creed franchise, Im glad Ubisoft made the decision to build this game from scratch. The overall gameplay feels fresh yet retains the essence of an Assassins creed game. Storywise, I have no complaints, I wont say it is better than some of the other successful AC titles, but it is good nonetheless. The combat here is my favourite part of the game so far. Gone are the days of just an attack/parry button, the new combat controls make fights more challenging, yet satisfying. This game takes on the more RPG, open world game approach, with countless side quest and places to explore. Although the sidequest may be a little tedious to complete sometimes, every one of them is different and unique. There is plenty to do around the map of Egypt, from exploring tombs to hunting animals, to saving villagers from bandits. The developers really added lots of detail to make Egypt lively and immersive. Another thing to add is that events and community challenges such as the Trial of the Gods, offers more content to players who have already completed the main storyline.Nothing much to say here, the graphics is amazing. Egypt is vibrant and beautiful.On my setup with a gtx1060 and a 4th Generation i5 cpu, the game runs smooth, averaging at around 60fps. In towns, it drops to around 40fps, which is still playable. However, if you CPU isnt powerful enough, you may encounter an issue where NPCs take awhile to render. Resulting in faceless mannequins, or clay model looking figures in place of the NPCs.otherwise, there should not be any issue that might make this game unplayable.Overall, this is a great game, and i would definately recommend it.
