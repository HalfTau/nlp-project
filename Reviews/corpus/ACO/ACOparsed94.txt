I got this game on console and enjoyed it but had a problem with the frames and the lag so i went ahead and got it for pc. Amazing game and now its running fluid at 5060 frames with beautiful graphics! The fighting is fantastic and the side missions are fun because bayeks role as a protector really shines through! Ive been going through every part of the map  which is huge btw and trying to complete everything and I havent lost interest in the game at all! Its very rare a game can keep me entertained for such long periods of time. The last time I remember having this much fun I played the witcher 3 and I cant stop saying good things about that game. Finally ubisoft made another good assassins creed game Id compare this one to assassins creed black flag in terms of innovation and playablitiy! Fantastic.
