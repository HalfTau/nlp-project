After finishing this game, I went to the game review page to see what everyone was praising. What they liked the most and what they thing the game could improve or add on to. But when I got to the reviews, all I could see were negative reviews that had nothing to do with the games story, mechanics, difficulty, or environment. Just that the game was incredibly demanding, cpuwise, and the micro transactions had people refunding.What? Was I one of the lucky ones and had good frames through the entire game? In the past 4 years, the only thing ive upgraded is my graphics card, a recently purchased 1080evga. Besides that, my computer has a 4770k and 32gb of ram for editting purposes and this game was stunning.As for the micro transactions, this game never tried to encourage me to get extra gold or clothes. There were wayyyyy too many oppurtunities to get gold and materials myself, no matter where I went. The only game I can think of where their microtransactions in a single player game had enough sparkle to actually get and save time was Shadow of Wara game I did end up getting and enjoyed alot, but really killed my initial hype of the game.If you want to explore a Hellenic Egypt with Roman influences and plenty of relics from the Old Kingdom, this is the game for you. The map is gigantic, consisting of dozens of regions, all with their own unique settings and problems. There are tombs to find, animals to hunt, puzzles to solve, caravans to attack, an insane amount of side quests and arcs to do, chariot races, gladiator fightsmore than one arena, and last but not leastthe amazing story of Bayek, the Medjay of Siwa. Ubisoft has its job cut out for them if they plan on making the next title better than this one.
