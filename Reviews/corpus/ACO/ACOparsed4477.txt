So I only have about 6 hours into the game so far, but Im absolutely loving it. I played the very first AC for a short while, and I played Black Flag for a short while  thats the only AC experience I have until now because I just didnt care for the AC games. This is different. Im playing it at 1920 x 1080 at medium graphics settings and getting around 33 FPS which is fine with a game like this. The game still looks gorgeous. I checked my CPU usage and it was around 6070 constant  again this is fine with me.This is an extremely well done game. No crashes, yet. Could it be optimized a little better? Perhaps. I recommend it!
