story 6.5/10combat 9/10overall the game is great so much stuff to do and explore easy to sink alot of time into it but the story itself was pretty meh in my opinion but apart from that the combat is pretty good and taking outpost and stuff actually feels rewarding sneaking around killing people and hiding bodies. the amound exploring you can do in this game is 10/10 aswell love games where you can just be wondering around then end up sinking 30mins into exploring an ancient tomb
