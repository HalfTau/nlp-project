To be honest, I was extremely hyped about this game and I had every reason to be  insane graphics, the storyline looks quite interesting, but I was left... I dont know how to put it shocked. Shocked at how bad and basic it can be. They ruined everything.Combat system  plain awkward, I cant even describe it, but it feels like the charactersincluding yours have no weight whatsoever. If you go right, your character instantly moves right0.00000000001 ms  same goes for riding that mount. It feels like playing an old game with insanely good graphics.Climbing stuff  horrible. They took the pleasure out of climbing buildings and made it some automaticthat doesnt even feel real and doesnt even require your help  its automatic as hell.Killing lots of people  well, goes handinhand with the bad combat system. I dont feel like an assassin, I feel like a 10 pounds soldier who goes to sword fight everyone.And why is there no sprinting in this game? Really now. They ruined the controls SHIFT is for withdrawing your sword and shieldand no, there is no sprinting key assigned in the controls whatsoever  as there is NO sprinting and you climb stuff with ALT and drop with C.On top of that, not every cutscene is fullscreen.Worst 33 minutes of my life, glad I can ask for a refund on this and move to better games. Ill stick to Syndicate for the time being, miles ahead of this thing.
