Not done yet, will update when finishedLaunch day commentAssuming problems dont arise this is looking to be the reboot Assassins Creed needed and more.After 15 hours in gameAlthough I was originally going to complain about performance, it seems the new update fixed most of my frame drop issues so good on them for supporting the game. Other than that my main issue with this game so far is that while it is a large open world that seems to have taken heavy inspiration from The Witcher 3, it is still very linear when it comes to the story. What made The Witcher 3 so great were the many decisions the player had to make. Those decisions would have a real effect on the story. In AC Origins, there arent any decisions to make. Dialogue options are not present at all. I can see Ubisoft not wanting to allow player choice in main quests for lore purposes but they could have at least given fake decisions in the main quests and real impactful ones in the side quests. Id like to see this in the future for AC especially if AC continues to lean toward being an RPG. I still reccomend this game since the linear story is actually pretty good but the lack of decisions to make knocks it down a few points for me.
