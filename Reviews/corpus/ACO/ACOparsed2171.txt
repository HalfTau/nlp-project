This game is pure I do not advise anyone whos interested in this to buy it. There will be many times when the game freezes for multiple seconds. The combat isnt fun what so ever. You know how you used to have to think a little when climbing to get to a synchronization point? Well not anymore, have fun holding the climb button and watching the magic happen with no thought involved. I know Ive only played four hours at the time of this review but I truly couldnt bear the idea of playing more. The people outside of the animus, in current day, are ing annoying. Thankfully the time youre forced to spend outside of the animus is sparce, but the time spent is not enjoyed. I skipped playing Black Flag and Syndicate because I lost interest in the series. When I come back to this, Origins, I expected that interest to be reignited. It was not. They stabbed the series in the heart and spit on the soul. this game and RIP to a series that used to be great.
