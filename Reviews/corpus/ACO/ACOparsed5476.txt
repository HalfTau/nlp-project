So far so good with the game, but really Ubisoft PATCH IT UP ALREADY, i have a geforce 1060, i can play Doom 2016 with ULTRA settings in every aspect just fine, but this game I have to play it with low graphics in order to have a decent frame rate between 45 and 60 fps sometimes 30. WHY CANT I PLAY THIS GAME WITH HIGH SETTINGS?The game is really good and it has interesting side missions, but come on Ubisoft FIX THIS
