The best AC after AC2. Last time ubisoft took a break from AC, they produced a master piece. This is not quite in par with that, but an epic game in its own class. Assassins creed is back, and is back with a bang. Watch out all the big names out there of RPG, Action, Adventure  open world genres, if Ubisoft continues on this path, Assassins creed is gonna be a big part of their revenue in coming years. If you are an AC, you cant miss this. If you are a Witcher series fan, you cant miss it. If you are a tomb raider fan, you cant miss it. 9.3/10
