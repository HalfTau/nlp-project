Good game, they did a fantastic job with the world and the npcs, not so optimized on all systemsi have i56500,16gb ram, gtx1060 6gb keep my setting on medhigh and get 7090 fps but when i am in alexandria i get like 5068. I recommend this game to every ac fan but if you just want to buy this game and you are not a biga fan you may want to wait for a sale sry for crap english.UPDATE The winter sales is the best time to buy this game if you want to get into ac, go for it
