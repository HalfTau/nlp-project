The new direction of Assassins Creed is promising. There is a lot of improvement that has been made in this game. The major one is the revamped combat system. It is very refreshing and way more engaging than the previous games.If youre into open world games or a fan of Assassins Creed OR other Ubisoft games since this game incorporates A LOT of ideas used in other Ubisoft games then i give it a recommend.
