Im 23 hours in to this game and I only like it. Dont get me wrong, the game has a lot of flaws but I dont belive the flaws kill this game, they hurt the game from being a amazing game. But lets get to the review, first the flaws so you dont get your hopes up because this is real life. The combat its not as good as I would like, the look on system needs to be gone and the shield system is a bit off the performence BY UBISOFTS OWN ADMISSION its And now that you lost hope for this game Im going to tell you what is good the graphics are really good if you enjoy 50fps it plays like a RPG think witcher but a lot more dumbed down but still enjoyable Bayyek is a ing amazing character its up there with Ezio for me and now Im getting tired of writing this review so lets wrap it up if I had to give it a number it would be a 8/10
