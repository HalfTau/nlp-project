Best Assasins Creed since Black Flag definitely getting my recommendation  8.5/10Pros   New Combat System no more sit, wait and counter. Gorgeous visuals One of the better looking games this year Tons of crazy randomness events with AI and npcs keeping things fresh flaming lions are terrifying Easily the best controlling Assasins Creed game Story is really well done and actually expands on the Assasins Creed universe The map is enormous and will take hours to explore rivaling some RPGs in size and scope. You can collect gear and weapons Side Quests arent just tacked on they usually have their own seperate story line with a payoff in the end. Exploring Tombs and Papyrus Puzzzles Fire is awesome  Flaming Arrows anyone There are a ton of graphic settings which can work for or against you watch the little VRAM scale in the corner andBENCHMARK BENCHMARK BENCHMARK it will tell you if your settings are low, stable or high you want too aim for high oryour game is gonna have frame dropsCons   The community and their inablility to read system requirements its 2017 you cant run AAA titles on a potato just meetingminimum requirements is a horrible excuse as well because your game is gonna run bad, and having a 1080ti running on adinosaur i5 isnt gonna cut it this game is fairly CPU intensive so upgrade your rig. Uplay still sucks Theres some weird issues with sound and Logitech headsets but Ive found this is just a general Ubisoft thing. On occasion the game can feel a little grindy since theres leveled enemies who will destroy you if youre under leveled You have to really comb through your settings Benchmark and figure out what is going to perform the best if you have theVRAM to spare I recommend you TRY 4K this requires a fairly beefy GPU regardless of your display textures are better yeseven on 1080p displays and the game actually is less taxing on the CPU.Overall the break Ubisoft took with the series was well worth it theres some dumb little performance issues here and there but this is an action packed visceral entry into the series just dont buy the game if you are not meeting the requirements listed below simple as that.  If you meet the min. requirements run the game on low and if you wanna run the game on ultra highthen you need to exceed the recommended settings since the recommended settings are designed for the High preset.MINIMUM CONFIGURATIONOS Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 64bit versions onlyPROCESSOR Intel Core i52400s  2.5 GHz or AMD FX6350  3.9 GHz or equivalentVIDEO CARD NVIDIA GeForce GTX660 or AMD R9 270 2048 MB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0 or betterSYSTEM RAM 6GBResolution 720pVideo Preset LowestRECOMMENDED CONFIGURATIONOS Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 64bit versions onlyPROCESSOR Intel Core i7 3770  3.5 GHz or AMD FX8350  4.0 GHzVIDEO CARD NVIDIA GeForce GTX760 or AMD R9 280X 3GB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0 or betterSYSTEM RAM 8GBResolution 1080pVideo Preset High
