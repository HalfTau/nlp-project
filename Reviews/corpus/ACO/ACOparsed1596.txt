This is possibly one of the best Assassins Creed games of all time...I have been playing Assassins Creed since the very beginning, Playing as Altair, the original assassin, then to see Ezio go from a Naive young man, looking for revenge.. Into a Legend and the most well known and respected Assassins ever.This game breaks off from the traditional Assassins creed games, Turning it into more of an RPG. I was originally sceptical about the changes, however they grew on me. I was used to the One Shot kill with the hidden blade, worrying more about tactical planning and thinking about my approach. In this game you have to upgrade your hidden blade in order to kill higher level enemies... Which is kind of annoying but I can see why it makes sense. I am enjoying finding new gear to progress through the game at a reasonably fair speed.Anyways! Its a great game, as it brings into account the ancient Egyptian beliefs into the story, has an interesting story and tonnes of quests to do!
