I will highly recommend this to anyone. Ive had no issues what so ever with either bugs or crashes. The game it self looks absolutely gorgeous and I enjoy the new RPG touch to AC. I instant fanboy this game due to being a huge ancientegypt times fan. So the world makes the game a 10/10 for me alone. I cant really find anything wrong with the game.. With a GTX 1080 and i7 6700 I could get more than 6070 fps but no complaints. Must buy
