Best AC game so far in my opinion Ive played more than it shows. Before I go further with my review, I want to mention that apparently some people have performance issues or cant even start the game at all. I personally havent had any issues with this game and It runs perfectly smooth with 90120 fps on ultra settings at 2k res, I even had to activate vsynch in adaptive mode. I guess Its a compatibility issue which will get fixed. A very beautiful open World with many details. The World is huge... Impressive graphics! Very good PC implementation. Quests are not repetitive, It makes a lot of fun actually and there are tons of it!. I do love the new fight mechanic, It makes this game well balanced. There are different enemies and all of them have their own unique style! youve to change your tactics if you want to face them. You can let your mount run automatically to the marked points! yay Variety of items with positive and negative points. A very interesting and good Story with Interesting NPCs, youll remember them. 3 game modes, Easy, Normal and Hard. Minigames with which you can throw your time. None  You get even Shop Items for free ingame.All in all, Im really enjoying this game.
