Looks like it might be fun, however the technical requirements of this game are EXTREME.  I am running an AMD 8320 clocked up to 4.1 ghz, 24 gig of RAM and an NVIDIA 1070.. it stutters and struggles on low.  All 8 cores of the CPU are maxed so I assume the problem is there, but I am very surprised that 8 cores of 4ghz isnt enough for this title.  It will be a while before I actually play this one and write a review about the actual game.  For now this is a nogo for me, I wont even look at it until my next machine upgrade, which I am not in a hurry to do just for the sake of Assassins Creed Origins.
