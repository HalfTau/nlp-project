Recommended specs as per ubisoft will run game  30 fps. So unless you have a beefy CPU which this game heavily relies on just wait out on getting this.I have an i5 4590 and a gtx 970 and even though it is slightly above recommended specs, i can still run it decently on high.Still doesnt change the fact that this is a really fun game. Love the new combat system
