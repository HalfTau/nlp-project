Personal ratings 9/10Running a gtx 1080, i76700K and consistently manage to get 80100fps on ultra.Personally this one of the best instalments I have made. Assassins creed has come a long way and has taken influence from other games such as far cry and combined them. The map in this game is massive with a deep story of corrupt people and evil pharaohs. This is explored throughout the  breath taking environment. The story of this game is fairly long but requires you to do side quest to level up and experience different missions or skill sets.Pros Insane Performance Open world, Map is massive Achievements require actual work There is more to the game than the story, such as side quest Item sytem Leveling system Combat requires skill Story has meaningCons Laggy under water
