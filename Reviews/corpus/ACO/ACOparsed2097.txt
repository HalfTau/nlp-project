After years of cranking out a AC game every year, ubisoft took an extra year on this one, and it really paid off.Origins is fantastic, best stealth an AC game has ever had, and hte RPG elements make it phenominal.If you like being a stealth archer, this game is for youFrom rapid fire light bows, to Magic Guided Missile Longbows, ive had alot of fun in this game
