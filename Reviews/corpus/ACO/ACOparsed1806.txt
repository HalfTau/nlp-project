Great game! I LOVE it! Best AC yet! BUT! I just played a part where Bayek fights a giant snake and keeps calling him Devourer and Soul Eater. Now, the snake is clearly supposed to be Apep/Apophis. But all the die hard Rick Riordan readers amongst us know that Apophis is a giant snake and Lord of Chaos, yes, but the Devourer and Soul Eater is yet another monster. A really darling hellhound called Ammit. But so far thats the only mythological messup Ive found, so kudos! Really good game! Kinda reminds me of the Far Cry games. Its not what youre used to when it comes to AC, but its lots of fun.
