My time with this game is limited, but I feel compelled to share it and Ill keep it short.Some people seem to be having no issues with running this game  sadly, with a GTX 1070 and an i7 6700HQ, neither of which are particularly diminutive  I struggle to maintain 40fps in cities, and the framerate is so wild and unstable I frequently find myself dropping to the 20fps mark during fights and lots of movement. No amount of Nvidia settings, ingame settings or various other tweaks and fixes has changed how awfully this game runs.Despite the awful running, what I have played is enjoyable, and it saddens me that I cant properly experience it without massive lag.Before you buy this game do some research and try and find someone with a similar rig/setup to you and see how it runs for them.
