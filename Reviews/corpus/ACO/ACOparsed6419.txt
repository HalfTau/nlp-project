Amazing! !Ill cut the chase and go straight to my review here.ProsOptimization Runs smooth as  without any stutters or hitching or FPS dropsSoundtrack The OST is back to its core, where AC should beCombat Now everyones going to have a mixed opinion on this, however IMHO, i actually like the new combat style. Its definitely more fun and more challenging. Kinda feels like W3s combat system.Stealth mechanics has been drastically improvedBayek is a very cool and charismatic character. Kinda reminds me of Ezio. Hes very romantic and badass at the same time.Can travel through the entire map with just Senu and that is amazingNo loading times other than the initial loading. Even fast travelling is quick and instantGraphics and draw distance are out of this worldEvery quests has its own unique story and nonrepetative.Photo modeForget Ansel, this is thewe wanted for a long timeConsEven though the game runs smooth, I see it has still some potential to improve. 100 CPU usage on all cores and GPU utilization never goes above 80Game has some minor pop in issuesAnimals can be quite annoying at some timesControls have been revamped and it will take a while getting used to in a KB/MOverall, its a great game and I definitely recommend people to actually pick this game up. Will update the review once Im done with the game.PS It has a playable modern day segment that actually isnt t cinematics.
