Only played for an hour but already love it! Its a mix of assassins creed , The Division and Fallout. How you may ask? well this game isnt like any other AC, Its more like the division on how you unlock new areas down to your level, it has many more side missions then other ACs and more looting and upgrading is involved thats what makes it like a fallout kinda game. Personally the time its set and location is much more enjoyable then other ACs. BUT TBH its not assassins creed, so if youre a die hard AC fan you may not like the way the game feels so watch a good hour of gameplay before buying, but for someone that loves fallout type of games like i do you will love the looting, exploring and quest grinding.
