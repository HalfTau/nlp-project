Can recommend this game. No performance issues whatsoever on my end and thats running max settings in 4K. I do have a pretty decent machine though, so please bear that in mind.Specs are i7 6700 / 3.4ghz 16gb ram Geforce GTX 1080 Windows 10.0 Home EditionGame is a lot of fun. The combat takes a bit getting used to, but the level of immersion and stuff to do is quite good. At times the dialogue can seem a bit lackluster, but it doesnt detract too much from the gameplay. There are plenty of perks to choose from and some fun ones to boot example make your enemies go bezerk and attack each other.A worthy sequel prequel? / continuation to the series.
