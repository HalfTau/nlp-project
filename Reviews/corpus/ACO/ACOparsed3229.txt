Almost 30 hours in, and Im only scratching the surface. Ive enjoyed most of the other ACs in various degrees, but this is without question the best the series has ever been. Its better than most games have ever been. The combat is a huge step forward, and the world is one of the best video game worlds ever created. The protagonist is an actual character, not some lame fill in. Great game.
