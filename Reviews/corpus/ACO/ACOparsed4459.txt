The game is beautiful and fun for the first 15 minutes I played it. However, I refunded the game based on the same reasons as everyone else....100 CPU usage. I was easily getting 60 FPS, but I am not risking my computer for one game. Hopefully Ubisoft will patch the coding making the CPU usage so high.Btw, I can play other CPU intensive games on the highest setting with streams going at the same time Total War Warhammer II, PUBG, etc..
