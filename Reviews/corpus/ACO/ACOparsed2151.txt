Assassins Creed Origins may be good at some points but in my opinion, its a disapointment of Assassins Creed series. Short story, I played more than 60 hours and the things I do is to find materials for crafting, money for upgrade, EXP for level up. The side mission is more interest than the main quest and when you reach level 40, no one can stop you even Cleopatra or The Order of the Ancients .
