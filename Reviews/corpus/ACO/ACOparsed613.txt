Probably the best Assassins Creed to date. Its got some flaws, and its rough around the edges, but its a lot of fun.I should say, it feels like there are some things that have been taken out of this one. I couldnt assassinate a man while he was riding a horse, for example. There are also times, particularly climbing around on mountains, where the collision gets really wonky. The AI is just a little too smart for example, if you get noticed, and hide, theyll often beeline for your hiding spot, no matter how sneaky you were in getting there. The combat feels like the Witcher, but with less finesse and more required grinding. Ive just hit a boss that feels basically impossible to kill, because Im a level below him and havent upgraded my Health very much.Those are all minor gripes, though. Its almost as fun as Black Flag, which was admittedly only very fun because of all the boatonboat action.
