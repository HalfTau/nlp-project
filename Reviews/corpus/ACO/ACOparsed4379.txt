I am one of those AC fans who was hooked since the first game. I have bought every game, and enjoyed all except for Unity. I dont have a good enough rig for ultra settings, but am perfectly happy at Medium/High.I am enjoying this game, but literally every time I play, my session ends with me falling into the inside of a wall or mountain, and not being able to escape, and I have to restart the game. Every. Single. Time I play. Luckily the game saves like every 5 seconds, but this is so frustrating, especially when it happens as I am about to complete something.I dont know enough to know if this is a bug or what. Its happened to me once or wice in previous titles, but never like this. Seriously every session. I always disregard the hate reviews, but for the first time I am seeing what seem to be literally unfinished games being released at full price.Please Ubisoft. Bring it back. Patch this up quickly. This story and setting has been a really enjoyable return, but this falling into a wall bug thing is really putting a damper on the experience, and I cant recomend a game that breaks every time I play.If there is a setting I can change would appreciate the advice. Happy to lower graphics to avoid this frustration....although feel like it shouldnt be like that....
