Bought this singleplayer game, downloaded this singleplayer game..  Can not get access to this singleplayer game because I need to log into UPLAY online...and Ubisht does not send change password email to me.. had the game about 24 hours and didnt yet get to start it.During the wait for my change password email, I have recieved multiple other emails from ubisoft. Still not 1 of the 50 requests to change password though.Very dissapointed in Ubisoft.
