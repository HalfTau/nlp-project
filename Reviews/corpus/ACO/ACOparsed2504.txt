Much needed change for the Assassins Creed series. Origins brings a fresh feel back to the series without abandoning the mechanics that make an Assassins Creed game. The new fighting mechanics feel way more interactive and satisfying. AMAZING views. Huge open world with lots of side quests and exploration. Solid immersive story. No bug problems aside from occassionally getting stuck on a weird angled ledge.10/10 Would smash Aya again.
