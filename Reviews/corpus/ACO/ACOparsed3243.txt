Ive played all Assassins Creed games and it was great to see Ubisoft fully open up the world for exploration. Combat has recieved an overall for the better and graphics are some of the best Ive seen. With lootboxes being such a dirty word in gaming, Ubisoft implemented a great system in which you mostly use in game currency earned through playing the game to open Heka chests. As well, they seem to want to keep players engaged by adding new content over the next few months and events which can lead to some really great weapons, outfits and mounts.
