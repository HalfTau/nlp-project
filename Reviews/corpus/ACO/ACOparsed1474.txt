one of the best games i have played! i can not recomend it more 10/10 ubisoft! but WARNING it is pretty diferent then the older assassins creed games in all good ways tho. for example in the older games the fighting was just lerning the counter button and u could take out whole armies, now there is a great system that allows for each player to creat their own fighting style and add a need for some skill building throughtout the game. sorry for any miss spelled words, I have bad dyslexia and will mess up words if i dont pay attention
