Most people say Assassins Creed Origins is the best installment of the franchise since Assassins Creed Black Flag, probably because just like Black Flag it diverges from the traditional AC formula. However, its not a perfect game like Assassins Creed 2 WHICH IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE AND WHAT ALL GAMES SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE LIKE, ALSO EZIO IS THE BEST CHARACTER EVER.The game tells the story of Bayek and Aya There is another playable character, but its not like that matters anyway who are seeking revenge against the Order of the Ancients Why? Well, it is an Ubisoft game...So you probably have an idea, this path of revenge leads to the formal founding of the brotherhood.The story is mediocre at best, its full of cliches,unexpected twists, cartoonish villains and it handles the founding of the brotherhood very poorly, but worst of all... THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR HOW BAYEK CAN SEE THROUGH HIS PET EAGLEs EYES yes, eagle vision is literal now.The map is massive and beatiful, from Alexandria to the giza pyramid, you get to explore most of lower egypt, and i must say its one of my favorites in the series BUT ITS NOTHING LIKE ITALIA. Unlike the maps from previous games, Egypt is not plaged with collectables...However, the game is filled with side quests, which sadly just like most RPGs nowadays it means going from point A to point B, kill someone, loot something and repeat EVERY TIME.The soundtrack as always is amazing... But its not even close to the MASTERPIECE THAT IS ASSASSINS CREED 2s SOUNDTRACK.Unlike previous games the combat in Origins is actually hard, it works wonders when facing one or two oponents, but it quickly becomes a mess when facing multiple enemies. And then there is stealth... Which is the same with some exceptions, namely the removal of social stealth but who cares? I dont and the fact that you cant assassinate enemies that are higher level than you without upgrading the hidden blade Who thought this was a good idea?.Overall, this game is not worth your money, its just another mediocre RPG. However, i really believe if this game had one or two more years in development it could had been the return to form the franchise needed. If you want to play Assassins Creed, just buy Assassins Creed 2 ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY.The truth is that Assassins Creed died with Ezio.Requiescat en pace Assassins Creed.
