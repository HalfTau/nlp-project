I have played all the Assassins Creed games from the beginning. The first few, I played on console the rest were played on PC. Do not get me wrong when the first game was released, I thought it was a masterpiece. But slowly, and surely, every year produced the same rubbish with one or two more added features.However, I am really happy with this new release. You can tell that Ubisoft have tried to keep the basics of what made people happy, whilst adding things that people wanted. Of course there are going to be downsides with projects this big, but I really like it and it has me hooked.
