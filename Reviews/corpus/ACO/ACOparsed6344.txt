However, It has alot of problems.First of all, this game contains micro transactions. Something all gamers should stay far away from.The game is also broken in multiple ways, for example, Surround Sound is completely broken and some very unlucky people are even having issues hearing dialogues at all in the game.This feels like another money grab from Ubisoft.Another thing thats also very dissapointing, is how the recommended system requirements is so very wrong.This game dosent run stable at all on my higherend pc, wich is way past those recommended system requirements.My friend is also having the same issue on his rig.The game contains Microtransactions, is very poorly optimized and contains alot of bugs.This feels like another money grab from Ubisoft.Id recommended everyone to stay away from this game until it goes on a sale, or a majority of these issues are solved.
