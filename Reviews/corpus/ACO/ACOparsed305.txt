This is one hell of a good open world game with amazing visuals.And no, this is not another AC game, it has greatly improved on every relevant mechanic at least since I stopped buying the games a while back. It works perfectly as a RPGlite open world experience, it has interesting progression/crafting/equipment, actually decent fighting mechanics, good overall story as far as AC goes, tons of stuff to do and GORGEOUS graphics, yes, its one of the best looking games Ive ever played.As many have said, it IS in fact very heavy to run and will make your CPU work, BUT it is worth it. With a GTX 1070 and a AMD 8350 I was able to run it very well with a mix of Ultra and High settings that was extremely addictive to look at. Many times I caught myself gazing into the beautiful world you have to explore.I dont think it is a game for people who prefer a more straight to the point kind of game, I have personally felt this is one of those its just as much about the way than it is about the destination experience, but one thats highly recommended for anyone who enjoys openended/ sandbox and openworld games.
