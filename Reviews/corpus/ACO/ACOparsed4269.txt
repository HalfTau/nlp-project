A bit dissapointed about the gameplay. Disappointment is merely an emotion. Emotions are merely the abstract fabrications of our consciousness. Our consciousness is merely the byproduct of sensory input. This game is neither good or bad as both are irrelevant concepts. The sheer acknowledgement of the meaningless of existence is freeing and actually helps me feel more up beat and positive on the inside
