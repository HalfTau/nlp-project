Hello,Unless and until Ubisoft removes this PoS DRM, this game simply is not fast enougn to reliably run on most systems, And maxing out all cpus on a pc just to add copy protection is quite dishonorable, as well as being bad practice. And as a programmer, I would be doubly frustrated with the stupid stunts pulled for the sake of DRM, which will be cracked in short order anyway. Dont tell me MVProtect cannot be hacked  any chimpanzee and its dog will tell you that anything can be disassembled, code obfuscation AND virtual machine layer or no.When this drm is removed, Ill gladly recommend this game! I honestly love theis series of games, and I absolutely respect the authors and want nothing more than to honeslty support them in every way, but to be slapped in the face so hard is just not right. Ubisoft needs to stop pizzing on us paying customers.
