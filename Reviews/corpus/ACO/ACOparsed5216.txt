I dont know if I made a really good CPU choice or the performance is not as bad as people are saying, but i get about 50well ok 7080 in Alexandria usage at all time on my ryzen 5 1600X, so i have no problems on that side.The game is really good, there is a lot of side quests and more kinds of quests than games that came out after black flag. the quests are a lot like black flag actually, which I think is good. I also think the acting is really good, but only for the main quest.
