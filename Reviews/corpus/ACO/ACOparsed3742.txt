if like me you was a little hesitant to purchase this game after reading all the reviews regarding its performance, I can say with absolute honesty it performs just fine. yes it does demand a rather powerful rig to run at high graphic specs but all the people saying they own the best of the best components and are getting terrible framerates I can only say they are either boasting better components than they have or are just plain not telling the truth. I am running it on an i7 2600k  4.2GHz an asus strix gtx 1080, 16 gb ram and a samsung evo ssd and have yet to dip to a framerate below 50 on ultra high settings.   if you enjoy the assassins creed series and like the idea of a slightly witcher 3 type take on the game then I can only encourage you to pick this game up ASAP. in regards to the microtransactions, they are completely optional and the only reason you would ever purchase one is to save time on the slightly grindier aspects of the game, which dont feel like a grind at all if you enjoy the gameplay
