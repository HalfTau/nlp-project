I love the fact that this game feels like the older assassin creeds, but has plenty of new elements in it. The open world with the RPG aspect makes it feel more like an RPG which makes it 10x better in my opinion. One of my favorite parts is the loot system. It makes you want to grind out the daily quest for your guaranteed legendary.
