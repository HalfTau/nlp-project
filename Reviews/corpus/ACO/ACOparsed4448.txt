PROS Im usually skepitcal  about Ubisoft games as most are crap lately. But this is alright, its fun, not my favorite of all time but worth the base price IMO. Lots to do, decent story so far. New combat mechanics which I like, you can switch between two weapons and two bows on quickly which fun. Climbing seems to work flawlessly this time. Overall, well polished.CONS It takes forever and a lot of grinding to get ingame cash and to buy a nice outfit it will use up all that hard earn cash FAST and most likely for ONE outfit. Lots of grinding for cash and materials, know why ? Because those are some of the things you can buy with real money, so theyre hoping you get tired and just buy the stuff instead. I hate these kind of things and will stop buying theyre games if they keep this up.About CPU it is usually 80  and sometimes at 100. Would be nice if they can optimise this better. Whats most important is to monitor your CPU TEMP than usage, my temps remain in the acceptable zone so Im not to worried about the usage of my CPU atm.
