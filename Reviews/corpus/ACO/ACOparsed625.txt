There is no question that this game is absolutely stunning to look at.  The water alone is in many ways worth the price of admission.  If you enjoy beautiful open world games then this is a must game on your list.  I enjoyed almost all aspects of ACO and reccomend it.  However, its not perfect and the areas I feel that fall short are few.  You stop progressing at level 40 and there is so much to do that theres no need to do the sidequests or to explore much more unless you just want to for the fun.  I wish you could keep leveling.  There is a bit of repitition to the undiscovered areas.  they typically fall in one of a few categories.  Either youre killing some animals, or taking over a fort for loot.  It can get a bit repitious, but still very fun.  I really enjoyed the game and put 68 hours in until I finally just stopped.  I didnt finish the game just because I just kind of get a bit tired of it and didnt really care much about the main story line.
