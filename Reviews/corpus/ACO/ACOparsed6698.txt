I am a realist when it comes to day one launch games, nothing is ever perfect, but I am only seeing minor bugs. For example, minor quick buzzing during some voice acting, but has not prevented me from hearing what is said or progressing. Running with a GeForce Nividia 1070ftw and the game looks and feels great. The combat is quick and fluid and has been what I have been waiting for. The eagle companion is cool in itself just flying around spotting.The attention to detail in the game from the people, animals, and city/landscape is amazing. Objects can float and move bobbing along the surface of the water. Underwater gives you the immersion you are actually in the water. Your breath is just the right amount of tension without being annoying. You can break an oil jar, cover yourself in oil, then swim in the water and watch it wash off as it leaves an oil trail on the surface. The place feels alive, you can only imagine the compassion, dedication, and love that went into this work of art. I only wish it were a bit darker at night, but with a full moon it is to be expected.Collectibles are the right amount and I do not feel as if I have to spam my search constantly or check my map. I can be immersed in the world and stumble upon things organically. Looting is easy, efficient and non instrusive. Changing outfits is easy and does not affect your actual stats. You can look how you want and not feel you are hindered by your cosmetic choice. The different weapons feel right and each have their own unique style. The bow combat is solid too and plays into the melee well. Combine this with mounted combat and the fun keeps coming. Best advice I can give is simply judge the game for yourself as other peoples opinions are subjective. Ubisoft, great job, thumbs up!
