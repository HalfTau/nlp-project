Ive not been playing it long, but so far Im blown away!Beautiful graphics which run at a very satisfactory framerate with almost all settings maxed, make this one of the prettiest games I have played on thge PC. You can really see how much the dev team love this game and have poured their hearts into it.Gameplay so far is fun and I am really loving the migration to RPG from action based.Ill update this review when I have a few hundred hours more in it, but so far so good Recommended? Hell yeah!!! D
