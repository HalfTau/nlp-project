Truly amazing. The best AC since Brotherhood, easily. From the writing, to the combat, to the movement, to the open world, to the soundtrack Including an updated version of Ezios Family for fans, this is just everything I wanted from AC after the announcement of a two year break. We got something truly great from that, on par with games like The Witcher 3 and the like.I may be speaking as a fanboy, but I couldnt have asked for more. A full recommendation.
