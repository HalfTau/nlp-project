Ok here is the truth about origins, the game is excellent. The visuals are beautiful, the animations are awesome, and the RPG elements are amazing too, but honestly its not an installment of Assassins Creed, it is its own game, and you cant compare it to previous AC titles, so just know that going in. For people to go and vote not recommend on this game is stupid, as the game is amazing, and from launch until now, Ive had no technical issues. The way I see it, it is so selfish for people to go and write reviews like my computer is amazing and cant run it, which in turn taints the view on this game. At the time of reviewing this, it sits at an 80, and 99 of the bad reviews are technical problems. This game is an excellent game, even if a couple of people cant run the game at mega ultra settings, go ahead and purchase this game and enjoy what the developers made here, an amazing game. Whoop dee do, your PC cant run it, you can either 1.refund it or 2.fix YOUR OWN problem, but for people to vote not recommend really hurts a game that should be sitting at 95 in my eyes.
