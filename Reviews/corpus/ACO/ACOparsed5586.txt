ACOrigins GOTYEdit After 40 hours I can honestly say I have not encountered any bugs or noticeable framerate drops or excessive cpu usage that others are reporting.The game is rather fun with what feels like skyrim levels of side quests popping up.Just finished the main story line at 53 hours with a lot more content to get through, considering the price tag for this game I can safely say it is worth every penny.Overall I highly recommend this game.Running on an i76700k, msi gtx 1080 and 16gb ram.
