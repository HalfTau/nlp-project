This game is BORING! Dont let the pretty graphics and the lack of a minimap fool you Its just another openworld Ubisoft game. It just so BLAND!17 hours in and you know Ive already seen everything the game has to offer Those bandits stole my kettle, can you go to their camp and get it back, and Sneak into this militarey camp and steal some info so the main line plot can reveal its next objective. Spoilers Its another military base.Stealth isnt as compelling as Far Cry 4 or 3 for that matter, and the 3rd person open world stuff isnt as compelling as Witcher 3.Still better than that awful Zelda game though.
