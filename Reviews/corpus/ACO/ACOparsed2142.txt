this is my first steam review so i dont know a proper structure.this game IMO is fantastic i dont have a really fancy pc so i have to play on low graffics but that doesnt stop me from enjoying it.i see people talking about performance issues but i havent had any so far,game runs smoothly the story is really good the gameplay is amazing..for me its a 10/10.definitely reccomend it!
