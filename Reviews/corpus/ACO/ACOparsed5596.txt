great game but performace is bad i have a 390 with an i5 7600k and i meet the recomended settings for high 1080p but it runs pretty choppy right now 30fps feels like 24. might wanna wait for a performance patch. all and all one of the better ac games cities feel very alve and the map is giant and graphics are very good for an open  world game hunting is fun but if you dont have good gear some animals ill destroy you like a lion.
