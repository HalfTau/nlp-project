Okay, I have just a few words to say...1 This game is probably a masterpiece of the modern gaming era. The level of perfection in every detail from cinematics to scenery to combat that Ubisoft has achieved is unbelievable! I love Syndicate, but Origins blows it away! You will have to experience it to understand what I am talking about...2 I will have to give this game a negative mark though, as I am not one for hiding my honest opinions. I HATE soap operas, chick flicks, etc,... and I HATE being taken on an emotional train ride every time that I play this game. SPOILER ALERT I have several children of my own, and I would hate to lose any one of them. But seeing the dead children, the dying children, the crying parents, especially the death of Bayeks son.... it is almost too much for me as it pulls at my fatherly heart strings EVERY TIME. It has gone beyond just story telling this is downright excessive. Once, okay,... but not this many times! I spent money on the gold edition of this game and now I am on the verge of shelving it. Chances are that this is my last Assassins Creed game....Would I recommend this game for the calloused gamer living in his parents basement? Yes. Would I recommend this game for the fathers of families who genuinly love their children? Nope.Fathers, take my advice save your money and spend it on something else.
