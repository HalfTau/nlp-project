Great game. Giant open world with the best graphics, i stop all the time and just look at how awesome everything looks. Runs around 50fps most the time at 4k ultra, no AA. I7 8700, gtx 1080. Not sure about all the bad reviews saying it isnt optomized, i get better frame rates and better graphics than witcher 3. CPU is usually 35 or so/
