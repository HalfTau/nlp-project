This game has brought so much more life back into the Assassins creed franchise. Before this game came out, the franchise was dying and was becoming a repetative mess. This feels like a completely fresh start to the series. The visuals are stunning and the world is one of the best i have seen in a video game. The story feels really immersive and explains a lot which is unexplained in past Assassins creed games. The combat is completely new and provides much more of a challenge compared to previous Assassins creed games. Overall this is a great entry to the Assassins creed franchise, and it is a great game even if you havent played previous Assassins creed games.
