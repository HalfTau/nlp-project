About 80 hours behind and Ive done pretty much everything you can do in this world. So its time to give my honest opinion. And I gotta say...This game is fantastic. Easily one of the best open world games Ive ever played. I havent had this much fun playing Assassins Creed since Black Flag in 2013. Is it perfect? No, theres no such thing as a perfect game. Heres a short list of what I liked / dislikedGreat story.Likeable main character.Extremely detailed Egypt thats full of life.With the new updated mechanics such as combat the gameplay is a lot of fun!Graphics. ITS BEAUTIFUL!Theres a lot to do in the world and sidemissions never feel repetitive.It runs a lot smoother than previous entries.Perfect balance of old and new things to keep fans happy.Few annoying glitches here and there.Character customization couldve been more detailed. I want the system from Unity back!Most of the looted weapons are pointless.The way they introduced hidden blade was very disappointing for me. I wanted more...Navalcombat is fun but there are too few of those missionsHippodrometournaments are AWFUL mostly because of rubberbanding AISo its 8.5/10 for me. Definitely on Top 3 of ACgames.Btw, I bought Gold Edition at release but I still havent played The Hidden Ones DLC, so I cant say anything about that yet.
