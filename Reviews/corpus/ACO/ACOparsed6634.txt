Might as well just buy it on your console, and then trade it in and resell if after youre done. I5  GTX 1070, 16GB ram. Performance falls between 2055 FPS very stuttery, place it on 30FPS for a smoother experience but at that point your better off just buying it on console and saving yourself a few bucks in the long run. I cant attest to the quality of the game but it looked really good from what I played. May consider picking up on a steam sale in the long run if they can increase performance or if I shell out another 600 bucks to upgrade to an I7... whatever comes first.
