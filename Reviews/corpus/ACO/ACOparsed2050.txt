So far, I have just been hunting and pillaging for resources crafting my gear to max, that alone has been fun, I enoyed hunting in AC3 a lot.The game looks great and performs fine for me, max visual settings1080p  60fps on a 980Huge map to explore, lots to see, it will definitely keep a player busy for a good while.Combat gets a little wonky at times, a pretty unforgibing camera and weak targeting system can make for some pretty lame fights.Climbing is janky at best, some surfaces you can climb no problem, others you cant touch, its strange seeing how walls with NO hand or foot holds can be scaled, and walls with ridges cannot.You are much less acrobatic in this than other rassassins creed games.
