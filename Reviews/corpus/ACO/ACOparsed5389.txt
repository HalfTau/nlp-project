People who are complaining that this game is unplayable just havecomputers, end of. Works excellent with a GTX980. Holding a solid 5580FPS in high density areas.This game is a work of art, do yourself a favour and buy this. This is a lot closer to a Witcher/Dark Souls game than Assassins creed.Still barely scratched the surface, cant wait to GO DEEP!
