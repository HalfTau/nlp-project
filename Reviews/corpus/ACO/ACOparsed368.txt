Had very little expectations for this game going into it. Its easily the best AC game in a long time. Combat is fun, the story is great, and its a beautiful game. Major step forward for the franchise and Im excited to see where they go from here. Id say my only complaint is the CPU load that this game produces is insane from all the DRM they put into it. Be aware of that when purchasing and watch for it.
