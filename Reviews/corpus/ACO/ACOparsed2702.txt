Assassins Creed. A series with a slight element of surprise. Sometimes, it catches us. Sometimes not  and from time to time, we catch it.Here, it catches us. Like its predecessor Assassins Creed one and two, it is a breath of fresh air  for the most part. The things you thought you knew have been altered. Combat, sneaking, a new levelingsystem, a grand map with many different secrets to look for and uncover while youre progressing through the main storyline. Which brings me to the next The Main StoryIts a subthing right in between Reality and Virtuality. Right beside history and fiction. A perfect story though I am not a fan of the ending itself with many different cliches throughout the long story questsystem.You follow a person, Bayek of Siwa. Last of the Medjay, an ancient Order that used to protect the people and Pharaoh of Egypt  though not anymore. Bayek seeks revenge for...something that happened in his life.He fights the fabled Order of Ancients who discovered the location of the First known Apple of Eden, though we dont hear the name, an artifact of immense power, capable of controlling Free Will itself.As we know from the later games, the Creed seeks to protect these Relics, these Apples from the Knights Templar aka Abstergo which also show up in the storyline, though not the way we expect.Im personally a fan of the story, history and pretty much everything in the game series of Assassins Creed. And with the year Ubisoft took off to release the movie and make this game, I think theyve earned a lot of peoples respect and gathered a lot of players back from the fails of the previous few games.Overall Rating 5.8/10 Stars.Combat 8/10 Stars.Sneaking 4/10 Stars.Story 8.2/10 Stars.Quests 5/10 Stars.Playability 4/10 Stars.Though the rating is a bit low, theres still room for some improvements in the future. But, I highly suggest you play the game before judging, and judging for yourself is probably the best singlehanded option out there. Good luck!Grammsay
