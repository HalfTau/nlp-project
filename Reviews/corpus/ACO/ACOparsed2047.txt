Ive been both sceptical and hopeful in regards of this game. First 10 hours of playing I was angry and hadnt been liking almost anything. But then suddenly the pace picks up, the game opens up, aaand suddenly theres 61 hours on my counter. Once you start playing  you cant stop. I dont know why, but it is what it is.I dare say, its the best game on the series after the Ezio trilogy. Im shocked and awed.
