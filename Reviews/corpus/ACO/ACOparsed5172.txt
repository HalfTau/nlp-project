This game is worse than bad...its boring. EVERYTHING in this game has been done better in Witcher 3. Well, ok the climbing is better, and Egypt is fun. I wish that I could return this game, I have put in 40 hours, not even half way through. I kept thinking it might get better. The villians are forgettable as is the main character. The combat system and crafting are so basic it seems like it was created 7 years ago. Worst of all they felt validated in adding a cash shop that has no real purpose other than to try to bleed money from an already shallow game. I have had some very good times in previous Assassins titles, and that with the Egyptian setting influenced me to buy it. This game is tired, feels dated and incomplete. PASS and wat for sale if your bored.
