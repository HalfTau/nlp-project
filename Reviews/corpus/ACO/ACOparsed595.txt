Its a good game. Egypt is a land that is majestic and mystic, and you will find yourself lost in its beauty. The main quest is well written with a emphasis on the narrative told in the previous games.Now for the sad part  The side quests and activities become overwhelmingly repetitive. You will find that more often than not, you are an erand boy running around fetching things for people. The other times you will be infiltrating a camp just to rescue some poor bloke who is caged up and cant walk, pick him up and run out of the camp with him. These same quests fill the world you are in and just keep coming up again... and again... and again until the games end.Its the best Assassins Creed in the series but it lacks in multiple areas and is riddled with micro transactions. Chances are you will enjoy it, just dont expect too much.
