Ill be honest Ive always been a bit of an AC fanboy. But by the time AC Unity and Syndicate rolled around, I really felt like the games were running out of steam. I still loved Syndicate, and never lost faith in the AC games, but I was slowly getting bored. So, when I saw how different AC Origins was, I was both excited and apprehensive. The idea of a reworked AC seemed like a huge gamble, but I can confidently say that it was worth it. AC Origins is a masterpiece, and something I absolutely recommend to all. If you havent played any of the other Assassins Creeds, then this is a great place to start. Its not really full stealth mode like the previous installments, but the reason for that makes sense The Brotherhood isnt created yet. Ive only played this game for 17 hours since release, but have only completed around 14 percent of the game because theres so much to do. There are very few bugs, and exploring the world actually means something for once. The side quests are actually interesting and worthwhile to do, and although there is a little grinding from time to time, entering missions as a bit underlevelled isnt completely impossible and really tests your skills as an Assassin. Origins first felt a bit like Far Cry 3/4 in the whole liberatethecamp bit, and its fair to say that the game was somewhat inspired by the Witcher 3, but the rest of the game is completely Assassins Creed.9.5/10 must play
