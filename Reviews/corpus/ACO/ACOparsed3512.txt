Best AC game since Black Flag, which isnt a coincidence since both games were made by the same studio.The story is really interesting as we get to witness the origins of the Assassins. The characters are memorable and compelling as well and there is also a modern storyline. The only disadvantage is that the ending feels a little bit rushed.The design of the world is amazing. Ancient Egypt is depicted beautifully at a large scale and the overall atmosphere is unique.If you are an AC fan this game is a mustbuy. If you are not, this game will make you a fan of the series.
