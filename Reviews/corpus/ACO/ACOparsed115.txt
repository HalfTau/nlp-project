Ive been trying for weeks to get back into this Assassins Creed but I dont see why people like this so much. Yeah it has amazing graphics and super detailed world but the gameplay is the weakest in the series. They oversimplified the wall climbing to one button when they perfected it in Unity and Syndicate. The combat just feels clunky with crappy hitboxes and forced rpg elements that only exist to stretch the game out. The story is your bog standard AC Story revenge plot but it might change later on but i wouldnt know cause i havent finished it. I have played every AC from the first to syndicate excluding chronicles and liberation and for every 1 step foward this game takes 2 steps back. The stealth is just a joke. Gone are the social stealth elements the series is known for and instead you are confined to overgrown grass which you shoot laser guided arrows because the hidden blade now has rpg stats you need to upgrade so if you accidentaly go across a river to another camp and you find that everyone has skulls over their heads cause they are higher level than you. This forces you to do the most boring side quests ever just to level up and take them on. One other thing as well which is what super grinds my gears about open world rpg games when they let you explore the whole map but basically lock it off with enemies that are higher level than you. It would be better if you had to use stealth against high level enemies to kill them but you cant. Hunting is back with this one too but they completely missed the ball with this as the amount of materials you need to get to upgrade your stuff is batshit insane. This is the only AC game i probably wont finish and its a shame cause it is so well made.PS probably dont buy this game unless you have an I7 or higher
