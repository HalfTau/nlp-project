I spent 95 hours finishing the main campaign, side missions and other events which took me through just over half of the expansive and beautiful map that recreates ancient Egypts varied architecture and environments. Its filled with areas of soft sand that are swept by dynamic sandstorms, ranges of treacherous and rocky mountains, catacombs of towering ancient structures built in the names of the gods, and the decaying shacks of the common people. Refreshingly, I discovered all of these things through an organic drive to explore, rather than through the series traditional structure of climbing to viewpoints to have them unveiled for you. There are plenty more secrets to uncover, and the delightful sense of discovery still hasnt left mePros 1. Freedom of undocumented history2. Challenging combat3. Immersive Skill Graph4. Enhanced Looting system for better Crafting5. My boy, my favorite eagle scout6. Economy I just love the way they pictured economic system which has little to fair similarities to the economic system during ptolemaic dynasty, kinda fancyCons 1. Archaic weapons and technology2. Mysticism more than realism3. Maritime Focus   it is already missing out the major portion with the exclusion of naval battles and sea fairing, so thats my reason Gameplay  8.5Story  8.5Graphics  8Presentation  9Overall / Verdict  8.5/10Hence that is my Final Verdict !!!!
