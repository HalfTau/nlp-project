As a hardcore Assassins Creed gamer, I started the game on hard difficulty and played for 13 hours. Its really well reflected in game as you cant just rush in and wait for enemies to attack to pick them off one by one. On hard you need to scout out with your eagle, plan your moves and nail blocks and dodges, because constantly backing away from two guys with scepters, two with sword and four guys raining arrows on you WILL get you killed.Looking away from the sneaky microtransactions availiable the game has character, story, music and combat to put you in AWE. The most important thing on hard difficulty though is levelgrinding as the ability/perk/skill system rarely offers something useful and half of those useful are because they are needed for achievements.
