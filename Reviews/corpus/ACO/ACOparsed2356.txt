40 Hours in and I still havent completed it.Is that a good thing? No.I have never been this uninvolved with a video games story in my life.In order to flesh out the longevity of the game the game will suddenly spike up the main quests level reccomendation every 3rd quest or so to make you go out and do more immensely boring and repetive side quests.This is also with out a doubt the worst Assassins Creed Assassins Creed game yet. They have completly culled blending in with crowds, inutive/fluid parkour and stealth.I havent been this bored and uninspired to continue in an Assassins Creed game since Revelations.
