I really enjoyed Assassins Creed Origins, but it is not without flaws.ProsConsI give AC Origins a solid 8/10. It would be a 9/10 if my above cons were addressed. If you like open world third person action RPGs, try it. I recommend the Normal difficulty to give a more casual experience. I can see the higher difficulties being frustrating with the clunky combat.
