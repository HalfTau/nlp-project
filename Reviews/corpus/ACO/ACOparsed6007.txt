I dont usually write reviews, but I think this game deserves a lot of praise.If you disliked the recent Assassins Creed and Far Cry titles for their mindnumbingly dull, vast as an ocean, deep as a puddle open worlds, then give this a shot. Its a nice change of pace. Theres a lot of emphasis on exploring the environment, thereby making the game less linear. Think Black Flags seaexploration, but on land.The developers of this game seemed to take a lote of inspiration from the Witcher 3, which is fine by me. Some ways theyve done this is through meaningful sidequests, a lot of detail to the environment, a pretty fun crafting system, and the previously mentioned quality of exploration.The combat is fun and engaging it feels like a mix between Witcher 3 and For Honor. Dark Souls players might not like that, as they would say its too easywhich is fairbut relative to previous Assassins Creed titles, its a big improvement. Gone are the days of waiting to press one button to counter and kill.I cant write too much else, as at the time of making this Ive only played about ten hours and spent a large chunk of that time upgrading my characters gear. However, its been a surprisingly wonderful experience. All in all, the game feels like a proper, spiritual continuation of the original Assassins Creed gamesand by that I mean before things started going down hill.
