Alright, so I havent played much and wont cahnge this review because im too lazy but here we go. Im not an Assassins Creed fan, I enjoyed the first and second but lost interest after that. This game is, different. Im not going to go into detail about gameplay etc because im sure you already know it so im just going to say this, the game is a lot of fun to play. The biggest problem with this game is how unpolished it is, the cutscenes are just awkward and the voice acting is terrible so it does take away from the story. Considering the game was in development for an extra year you would think it would be polished up but well, its not.So if it is so unpolished why am I reccomending this game? Well, as I said before, its a fun game to play.
