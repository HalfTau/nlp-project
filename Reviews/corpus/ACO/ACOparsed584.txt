First Assassins Creed title in a long time that I really enjoyed playing all the way through. the extra time Ubisoft put into the ame really shows when compared to previous titles like Syndicate and Unity. Brings together elements from far cry, destiny, and dark souls while still retaining the feel of an Assassins Creed game. Would recommend getting it when on special for anyone who is on the fence about buying this game so that the extra money can be put towards the DLC.
