Ive played most of the AC games Except unity and honestly I enjoy Origins a lot still not finished with the game yet because of a couple reasonsPros minor spoiler aheadCombat system is new and interesting, this is debatable as some prefer the previous e counter mashingThe leveling system gives a good sense of progression and as always there are interesting weapons to choose fromThis is a personal pro for me because I always enjoyed the Desmond story arc,, but at the beginning of the game I saw easter egg files on Desmond and his father which had me intrigued to learn more.Greek architecture reminiscent of the earlier AC games, as well as a variety of traversable environments to keep things interestingOther new features such as photo mode which encourage players to explore new areas imoNaval combat is still relevant but is more medivalLots of side quests to doClimbing and freerunning feels a bit more down to earth, instead of spiderman climbing mechanics.ConsSo far I find it hard to relate to either of the main protagonists, the given motivation is strong but I feel like the voice acting and charcter dialogue didnt do it justice just me being picky not a biggieSometimes griding side quests are a bit of a drag because they are often neccessary in order to do story missions, which was not that bad for me, but some may find this annoying since side quests are called side quests for a reason, they are optional.Other than some minor bugs flying guard corpses, dancing guard corpses I recommend this game to any reluctant AC vets and new players wanting to play an AC game.
