After playing this on the PS Pro ive now got it for the PC ... and all i can say is that its a fantastic. I play on ultra settings for everything and play at 1440p buttery smooth 60fps everywhere, but this was not always the case .. i have a I7 7700 with a 1060 6g card but only 8G RAM and this is where the problem is guys. This game needs 16G RAM otherwise your cpu will hit 100 by the time you get to about 40fpsI7 77001060 6g16G RAMWill get you 60fps ultra settings and 1440p EVERYWHERE 16g RAM GUYS ITS THE RAM!This was bought after the 1.10 update btw
