I have not played all the AC games, namely the second, I believe, and Black Flag  so I cannot judge on this installment compared to the others.That said, ACO is just about the best game I have played this year, and its up in the top 5 ever for me. I must be in luck, because my new yet cheap computer can run it on ultra settings with 45 to 55 FPS and it looks GORGEOUS. It also plays very well, the controls after remapping them to my preferred keys are great and the whole experience of diving into ancient Egypt is just fantastic.The boats handle well yet heavy, which they should. The mounts are also great, camel or horse  and the chariots are bad in small spaces as they should be. My only accidental kill of a civilian was trying to steer the chariot through too narrow roads  a mistake I wont repeat.All in all, this is a big phat YES, I am SO recommending this fantastic game.
