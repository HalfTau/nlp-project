Not your fathers Assassins Creed. The year off really did the series good. Gone is the tired combat system and boring missions. No longer can you just run in, stab, and run out. Quests require some planning and thought. Make sure your level and gear is up to par, otherwise you will be destroyed quickly. Egypt is beautiful. Ubisoft really put a lot of work into the world and it shows.
