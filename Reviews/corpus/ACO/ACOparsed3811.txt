The DRM is real. Its disappointing enough that I cant play this game with an i77700k and GTX 1080ti without the CPU peaking at 100 even when idle, but just the fact that this game feels just as intensive as say Witcher 3 which I can run at 100120fps with or without streaming...Please Ubisoft, lighten up.
