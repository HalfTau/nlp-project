I paid 42 euros for it, achieved 100 no DLCAnd i must say it was worth it Great Graphics some textures look like ps2 even on ultra Great main character, seeking for revenge, but his state of mind is not always the same like we had in the past Connor, Arno, etc. Great Open world, with a decent variety of locations no more stupid collectibles papyrus puzzles Gladiators Arena Chariot Racing No character customization, it was amazing in Unity, we could be whatever we wanted A small variety of outfits, but a big one of weapons Monthly Events Tomb Raiding was a really great addition, it was one of my fav parts in AS II Trials of the gods Great soundtrack Nomad bazaar Physics/ Story was more or less OK, we dont actually know much of the creed, but it was OK in general/ I loved the new combat, but even in Nightmare difficulty i felt it was easy/ Performance was decent, but again, high end PCs almost using their maximum to play it/ SideQuests, many were actually the same, quantity does not mean quality/ Parkour, not great as Unity or Syndicate/ auto sprint, can be a bad aspect for many playersIn general, i loved the game, the new RPG themed AS, personally... 8.5/10
