Assassinss Creed Origins is probably the best game in the series after Assassins Creed Black Flag.the one year break by the developers has resulted in an absolutely fantastic game with absolutely stunning visuals, such depth and detail which nearly unmatched by any game in this genre.Fantastic world to explore with tremendous size and depth its filled with great amount of content which doesnt feel reptitative at all,a rewarding loot system,good variety of wepons,fantastic gameplay and combat takes a bit getting used too.weak plot is the only major setbackIf you like exploration,gameplay,lots of side quests/activities,stunning visuals and your okay with a liner and rather weak plotnot that its horrible just doesnt live up to some off the previous titles then this is a must buy.Performance is great havent had any crashes or major framerate drops during the whole duration of play, minor drops here and there.overall highly recommend this game.
