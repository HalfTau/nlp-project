Ancient Egyptian slaves didnt have to work as hard as your CPU will trying to run this game.Im running a GTX 1080, but as we all know the gpu wont determine how this game runs, so onto the CPU.i5 4690K overclocked to 4.5ghz. Ive beefed my cpu clock speed as high as possible without causing bluescreens and its still not enough. In cities I still drop to around 35 fps with my cpu maxed out at 100.Dont expect to run this game unless your cpu is god tier. If I were to guess id say a 5.0 GHZ clock speed might be enough to stay above 60fps everywhere.
