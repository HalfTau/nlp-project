Save yourself the money and dont buy this filth, absolutely amazing game but ubisoft have once again ruined something with great potential. I have been waiting a month for this game to be patched properly and when they finally do patch it they ruin it even more, so much to the point that its literally unplayable. Patch 1.05 The game ran ok on my rig before this patch, I have a 980ti and 6600k  4Ghz and 16gb of ram. Fix yourubisoft, robbingIn this state I cannot recommend this, otherwise it is a really good game and a refreshing return to the series.
