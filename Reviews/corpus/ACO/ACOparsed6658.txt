Ill sum up the mixed reviews..Good reviews game is good with much needed improvements compared to other AC games.Bad reviews Game is buggy/not launchingI personally am not having any big crashes/bugs. I notice some weird little things here and there but nothing game breaking and no huge FPS drops.My specs i7 6700k, gtx 1070, 16 GB DDR4 RAM
