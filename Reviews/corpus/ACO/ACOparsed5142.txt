Jesus christ this game is in an awful state right now. Initially it seemed fine, 60 FPS with minor dips, but as soon as I exited the initial tutorial area and entered the first town, there were frequent drops to 1020 FPS every few seconds, not to mention the freezing and audio glitches. My CPU was at 60 degrees just in the menu, and jumped to above 70 within 5 minutes of game time. Just hoping this is to do with the DRM crap that can be patched out. Unplayable as of right now.Edit tweaking some settings in NCP helped somewhat, but still fluxuates from 253060
