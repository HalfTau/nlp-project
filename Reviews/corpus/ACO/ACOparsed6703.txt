GTX 1080 FTWi7 7700K OC 5.1ghzFirst impressions, very underwhelming. Multiple crashes in the first hour, already seeing floating assets not being rendered properly.Environement looks detailed but texture anistropy doesnt seem present at all and anti aliasing washes out edges and blurrs the image.Controls are an absolute mess  cant comment on the combat, I prefer this style to previous AC games but refuse to risk puting in the time to assess things further in case nothing is done about the optimisation or SLI support. Will give it a week before refunding1440p a no go unless you want an average of 65fps with dips into the 50s  Probably accaptable at 1080p with these specs.Will change review if problems are sorted  until then, these developers need sales stunted for not giving the required attention to their most devout followers   consoles.
