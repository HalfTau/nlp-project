This one took a different route than the whole series. Gameplay is much similiar to The Witcher than AC. Combat system is more of Dark souls style. You can climb almost everything. Still, i like it.. Not as an AC game but as a standalone game. I have played every quest there is, every errand and every possible event and im still craving for more! Story/World is good enough but not as immersive or accurate as games like The Witcher and Horizon.
