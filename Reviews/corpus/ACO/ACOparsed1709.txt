This is technically a positive review, because the game is enjoyable, but its also just kind of... adequate. Its pretty, but the animation feels off. The voice acting is pretty good, but the writing is dull. The RPG elements are a welcome addition, but the combat is pretty lackluster, and the stealth is about as mediocre as its ever been in Assassins Creed.The word that keeps coming to mind when I play it is clumsy. Its pieces dont quite fit together well, and everything feels like its just a little harder to accomplish than it should be. Theres a lot of open world jank in here, too. A boy I had to save from a cave was standing diagonally on the floor, and that was like 20 minutes into the game. Ive seen plenty more jank since.So yeah. If you really like AC games, this is an AC game. Ultimately, though, as with many of Ubis games, its pretty and fun but ultimately kind of forgettable. So, like, maybe buy the game, but maybe wait for it to hit 20 first.
