Better than I expected.The gameplay reminds me a lot of the Witcher 3. That being said, the combat is not really as varied or quite as polished as the Witcher 3.Story so far seems good. I kind of like Aya more than Bayek though!Graphics are good with plenty of options for PC.Performance is decent, although still no SLI support.The microtransactions are dont feel intrusive and I feel like its pretty easy to aquire most of what they offer with just a little bit of in game work.
