I had very low expectations for this title ever since the last 2 flops in the series.  But, this is easily the best in the series since AC2 and AC4.  The last 2 titles in the series seriously made me want Ubi to just kill the series entirely.  Now it seems they are listening to fans and wanting to return to what made their most popular titles great.  It has the size and open world aspects of AC4, but with a more on foot approach with lots of wilderness like AC3.  The combat system takes a bit getting used to but offers a more strategic challenge than just waiting to press the counter button for instant kills like in the previous titles.Performance was great from day 1.  Some small issues with cutscenes, and some small hang ups now and then but besides that it runs great and looks beautiful on my mid range machine.  Its like they mixed the best of Red Dead Redemption, MGS5, Far Cry, and AC into one game.  Awesome game.. the ending is left open for a sequel.. i really hope Ubi continues this longer development for the next title in the series.. this reboot of sorts is definetly working.
