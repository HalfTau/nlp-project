The game itself is really really good, dont get me wrong. However, it is ridiculously cpu intensive, and its only gotten worse after the most recent update. In cities, my cpu is pegged at 100 usage, my gpus down at like 40, and Im getting like 2530 fps, dropping as low as a consistent 1520 in some cities. I have an i56500, which isnt exactly a powerhouse cpu but it runs simulation heavy games like Cities Skylines and Planet Coaster perfectly fine, and in situations with much denser NPC population, such as head on attacking strongholds in Shadow of Mordor or shooting down police in GTA V cant wait to get put on a watchlist for typing shooting down police it runs just fine. Im not asking for a perfectly smooth 60 from a cpu that is barely below recommended spec, but over 25 would be nice.
