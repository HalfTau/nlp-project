Actually what I wanted from an assassins creed since the series started, actual combat adds a lot to it for me.TechnicalIt runs OKAY on a 970 at modest settings but I do get a few hard crashes. Not necessarily aggravating because it has a very good auto save system, but it still makes me nervous that my file might get corrupted or something.areas like Alexandria and Memphis are prone to crashing for me.StoryI actually like Bayek, and Im not typically a fan of ubisofts characters. That being said, all the characters in the future segment basically outline exactly what I dont like about ubisofts characters.The story is neat and they add enough fantastical elements to make certain things in the AC universe make more sense, such as the final conversation with the person you murdered. Its all heavily inspired by egyptian lore and makes it feel less like an awkward cut.GamePretty good combat, most areas provide alternatives to stealth which is good because Im AWFUL at stealth but stealth is also probably one of the best ways to level so it kinda does give you motive to stay stealthy without making it forced.Loot system is surprisingly robust, but if you find a weapon you like you can just scale it to your level at the blacksmith so there isnt a lot of motivation to keep reequipping things after you found your first rare.Im like 30 hours in and I havent made money trivial so the shop system is actually way better balanced than the other ones I playedId definitely recommend this, I wish it was more stable but theyve seemed pretty good about keeping it up to date.Also the environment is really well done and the different architecture from city to city is the bees kneesAlso I feel the need to mention theres a cash shop where you could buy weapons and outfits but none of it really feels like the game was made around it, leveling is easy enough with the things provided, and youll almost immediately find something with better or comparable stats a little later in the game.
