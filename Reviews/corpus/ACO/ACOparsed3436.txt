Too be honest not a game for AMD users and people with cheap CPU which is me xD, its still a good game which im somehow still playing even though the performance is ultra low, its disapoiting Ubisoft has failed to make the game playable for most pc users, 2 anti piracy softwares running in the backround simutaiously while uplay and steam also running affecting the  ingame performance thats just nonesense, Ubifsoft are not planning to fix this problem so if u want to play this game i recommend getting a good pc with an expensive CPU and a Nvidea graphic card or two cause 1080 is not enough for 60fps lmao.
