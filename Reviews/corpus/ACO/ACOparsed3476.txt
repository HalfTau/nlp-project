This game is amazing. Gameplay is fun as hell and the setting is beautiful.The only thing is of course, the performance. I can barely run this game on 60 FPS, only if i run it on VERY LOW. Lets be honesty. Nobody wants to play a game where everything looks blurred and muddy.The minimum recs for this game isGTX 660 Intel Core i52400s  2.5 GHz or AMD FX6350  3.9 GHz or equivalentand recommended isGTX 760 Intel Core i7 3770  3.5 GHz or AMD FX8350  4.0 GHz,which is complete t. I have a GTX 970 i5 4690k  3.5 GHZ and even if I run this game at very low, the fps still dips, into the 20s. I can run it on medhigh with a steady 45 fps, with dips in cities, which doesnt bug me.The Witcher 3 minimum recs isGTX 660 Intel CPU Core i52500K 3.3GHz / AMD CPU Phenom II X4 940,and recommended isGTX 770 Intel CPU Core i7 3770 3.4 GHz / AMD CPU AMD FX8350 4 GHzand I can run The Witcher 3 at ULTRA with uncapped FPS and it runs like a dream....The minimum recommended for Assassins Creed Origins should really be a GTX 970, cause even at very low settings the fps still goes toat times... Just makes me ask the question wtf is going on. I mean if I could run TW3 on ultra, logic would say that I could do the same on ACO right?All in all, dont play if you have anything lower than a 970. Other than that, fun game, even with the performance issues. Still gets a good review from me, cause to be fair, my computer needs an upgrade and I did have fun with the game, but thats only cause 45 shaky fps doesnt bother me.
