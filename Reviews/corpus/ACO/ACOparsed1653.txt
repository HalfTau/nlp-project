Amazing game, really enjoyed it, especially as an Assassins Creed fan.Some things I loved about the game1. Scenery was breathtaking.2. Combat system was fluid with interesting combos and a wide range of weapons to choose from based on your combat style.3. Storyline was great.4. Huge open world map.5. Many things to explore.6. Side quests and other objectives are fun too.7. Revamps of certain features were pretty cool.Some things I didnt like about the game1. Descent freerun and certain parkour moves were removed. My guess is because the story of the game is way before games like Syndicate hence Origins and thus perhaps the Assassins do not have the techniques yet?2. Somewhat grindy, have to spend some time to fully upgrade the character. I suppose it is not completely necessary to beat the game, although it would make it a lot easier.Overall still a great game, would definitely recommend.
