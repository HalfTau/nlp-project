As a long time fan of Assassins Creed this is my honest opinion.I really liked how the freerunning worked in past AC games. In this game there doesnt seem to be a sprint button. I may be mistaken but so far it doesnt seem like there is. You automatically run when you move. There is no free run down either but it doesnt seem to be much of an issue so far.The combat seems much more challenging and free than past games but Im definitely struggling to get used to it. I keep dying because I cant get myself switched over to another enemy as they attack. Im just not used to it but it should get slightly easier with that.The last thing is that the performance could be better. I have a GTX 970 and Im struggling to get over 40 FPS on medium settings. Changing it to low doesnt really help much. But I would guess that there is a patch on the way for this as I have seen a lot of people complaining about the performance.So far the story is looking pretty good and I love the setting of ancient Egypt.I know I criticized it a lot in this but it does seem like a very fun game so I am going to recommend it.
