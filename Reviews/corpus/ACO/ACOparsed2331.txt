So for starters, I have played this for 10 hours and I am enjoying Origins a lot! The graphics are gorgeous, the eagle view is stunning. The story seems to be good so far. The combat system takes a while to get used to Id say this is best played with a controller if you are a melee person. Targeting your bow with the controller s so I had to switch back to the traditional keyboard and remapped some keys. There are a ton of missions to undertake. This was the good part.Now comes the bad part for which I feel cheated after buying this game. I dont know how the DRM affects the games performance, it may or maynot affect the performance, but the PC port is pathetic! Besides, Ubisoft wasnt absolutely transparent while shooting down the news about how VMProtect  Denuvo 4.7 killing the CPU. With a GTX 780 3GB FTW Edition, Intel i7 2600K, Samsung EVO 850 1TB SSD, I was expecting this to run flawlessly on High preset but sadly it doesnt. The frame drops are ridiculous and random, ranging from 15FPS to 32FPS, ocassionally shooting up to 45FPS. Sometimes there is a lot of stuttering. I have a Asus ROG PG279Q monitor, with vsync off, the Gsync too doesnt help much in improving performance. Tearing is minimal but does happen often. I wouldnt recommend this game for the next couple months till patches are out to fix this CPU hungry game. I love the AC genre and Origins has been as good as AC2  Black Flag, but Ubisoft has always been bad at PC ports. All their major AAA games require 23 months of patches to work properly. Plus, they doubled the price of their AAA games this year in my region which was a  up move.For now, I will not suggest people to buy this game unless you have a decent GPU and an even better CPU.
