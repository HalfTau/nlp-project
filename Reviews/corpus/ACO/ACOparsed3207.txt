Assassins Creed reboot leading to the birth of the brotherhood in ancent Egypt.The game itself is great with improved visuals, movement, and combat. Everything has been improved upon. The story is good getting to meet and kill iconic figures of history. This is the largest map for an AC game yet giving you a huge playground to explore. The down side is that you will run out of missions before seeing it all and there are several areas with next to nothing in them. That is not to say there isnt enough to do because there are a ton of items to hunt down and explore to easily get over a hundred hours into this game. But with the size of the map, there could be more.However, what the game lacks, like Syndicate, is online content for coop. Had this game launched with the online coop feature of Watch Dogs 2 where you could play with others or take on assassin contracts to defend or kill targets or other players, it would have easily been game of the year for me. As it is, its a great game but not what it couldve been had they kept pushing the coop of AC Unity. And due to the lack of content for the huge open world map, it feels a little empty once you complete the main story.If youre an AC fan, this is a must play, especially if it is on sale.
