I just want to play the game it is crashing every 5 to 15 minutes. Every so often the ground textures are replaced with black squares as far as the eye can see and they will not go away until you restart the game or just wait for it to crash again. I have a powerful PC with updated drivers, OS, everything. ACO desperately needs some updates to stop the crashing.Despite the bugs it has been fun. I have logged 3 hours of play time, equating to about 50 game crashes but it has been worth the struggle so far.... hoping for seemless gameplay within the next week or so.
