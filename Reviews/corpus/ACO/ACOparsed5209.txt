First off I want to say that this game LOOKS like it is going to be amazing once the issues get resolved. That being said here we go....Performance issues a plenty. I do not have the BEST computer, but even my midtier PC can run games pretty damn well. Unfortunately with this game that is not the case. I was looking forward to starting this game while waiting for the raid to drop in Destiny 2, but because of the stuttering and audio issues I guess it is back to the power level grind for me till a fix comes out.
