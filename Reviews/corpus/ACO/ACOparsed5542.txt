Alright this is my first game review ever.Assasins creed Origns is not a flop game unlike some of its predecessors. When I first bought this game, I was scared that the game would become boring quickly, but until now that hasnt been the case. The game offers a variety of verry good side quests. Its been a verry long time since Ive had fun doing side quests in a game. Assasins creed origins offers a nice story that matters and isnt boring. The game runs verry smoothly on the highest settings and the graphics are superb.  The game is set in a beautiful world with a truly interesting setting. I also find verry enjoyable to explore the immense map this game offers.  For now the only negative thing Ive come across is that there are some graphics glitches. Restarting the game does the job though.
