This is the best overall Assassins Creed to date.The revamped combat system adds skill and unique kill animations that dont hand the kills to you using the countersystem. This makes planning your attack more important, rather than jumping into a group of 10 enemies and murdering them.Graphics and performance are good. The game looks fantastic on Ultra settings at 1440p and I get a consistent 5880 fps at all times. If you have GSYNC your game will look even better.Side quests are fun and enganging. So far Ive seen a good  variety with no repetitive quests back to back.The world is immersive and alive. You can follow any NPC and they will go throughout their day as youd expect a normal person to do, even going to sleep at night.SO FAR because I have not finished the game, or am even close I would give this game a 9/10, only because the combat can be slightly clunky at times, but I still love it compared to the old system.Will update if I feel the need over the course of the game.
