Unfortunately had to return this game... I spent more time tweeking the visuals and lowering and lowering all the stats to get a playable performance but even that was not enough.  I have a high end computer that plays all my other games just fine including other Assassin Creed games, but this is the only one that is totally unplayable in its present condition.  I imagine you need an SLI Nvida Titan cards, where I only have the one and probably 7 cores, where I have the i56600K CPU  3.50 GHz with 8 GB of corsair platinum ram with a Solid State Drive.  Card is Nvidia GeForce 1070.  I would wait for them to make more fixes, This last patch did not make a dent in the overall performance, in my opinion.  I cant imagine how bad it was before the patch 1.03
