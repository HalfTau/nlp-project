Reminds me so much of the Ezio trilogy and the first game. AC finally got itstogether. I usually dont get this into the newer games but I have been playing nonstop and I havent gotten bored. And as a bonus it is actually challenging on harder difficulties. I was worried the assassin would be boring like Conner but he actually has been extremely interesting. Highly recommend for anyone who has or has not followed the series.
