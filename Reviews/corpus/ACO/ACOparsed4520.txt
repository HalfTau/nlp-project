Games seams good gameplaywise.great Performance tracking tool.Performance is strange, little unstable got better after 1.03.100 CPU usage on all cores.hard to guess whats so hard on the CPU or which settings influence the CPU Usage.Technology support feels very offEytracking but NO HDR or Dolby Atmos on PC?Wait until performance issues are patched out
