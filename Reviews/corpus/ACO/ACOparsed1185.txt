been a AC fan since the first game, but with early releases and increasing lack of innovation and botched releases i stoped caring with AC. This time around i was very skeptical but been couple of years without buying an AC and this looked promising and....it was right, this is a solid soft reboot of this franchise, blend of AC with the best of other games that Ubi didnt seemed to hide at all the borrowing, which is good and healthy, if someone does something good, get it and improve upon.in short this AC is mix of Destiny  Witcher 3  Far Cry and AC DNA all in one. Despite having microtransactions this game doesnt makes the game grindy or padded, the pace of rewards is very generous, incredibly higher than the games that ACO borrowed from the concept.the world is gorgeous, quests and enjoyable, however the story thus far is...typical AC clich.... but at least has one and now the big elephant on the room....ubisoft overzelous use of drm, ok its fine to use one as placebo to think none can steal it, i get it... but nearly handful of them at same time HOLY  !!!!!!!!! but this doesnt break the game, but clearly puts an dent to those extra fps that can help in making the game more smooth and avoid some sudden microlag moments, even if not too often they can happen no matter your pc specs, saying this inb4 you rig sucks, git gud hardware no... this issue is for everyone, sadly...that said, its a good game with plenty to do, with content to last endless hours and its fun. if you like AC and wants something new, get it.
