I have to say this is the best Assassins Creed game ever made.I am a huge fan of the series and I would have to say black flag was my all time favorite and i didnt think any other Assassins Creed games would beat it but oh my god was i wrong.Every moment of this game was fun and entertaining, from doing the main story quest to just running around hunting or stopping a convoy or tomb raiding or one of the MANY side missions. There is just so much to do in this game and i never found myself bored or not wanting to play. Absolutley loved it, Ubisoft got it right with this one. 10/10
