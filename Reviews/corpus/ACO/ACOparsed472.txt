Story is ing garbage, a lot of the voice acting feels awkward, the combat gets pretty boring after awhile and a bunch of random people you met out in the world suddenly all know eachother towards the end of the story and make a creed BUT it looks sexy af on my overclocked rog strix 1080ti so Ill keep playing it until they stop releasing new content.Id only recommend this game if you have a sick pc, otherwise theres no ing point and when I say sick pc I mean a truly powerful machine. My ocd 1080 ti, r5 1600x ocd 4.2ghz and 32gb of 3000mhz vengeance lpx rig still occasionally stutters and has major fps drops on ultra at 2560x1440 with 140 res scaling. My guess is youd need a threadripper or i9 and slid titan xps to play on 4k with hdr enabled. I was told by ubisoft that my cpu was bottlenecking which makes no ing sense because the cpus in the new xbox one X and ps4 pro are an absolute joke compared to a 1600x and they run this game seemlessly in 4k. My guess is it has something to do with the antipiracy t they always wrap into these games on the pc.If your pc is nuts and you have problems with stuttering, dropping the tesselation down to medium seemed to fix it for me.
