To summerize it quickly, for me its the best game in the franchise just topping Black Flag.You need to understand that this is Egypt around 50bc so you can expect a LOT of open desert areas...as there was 50bc Egypt.The story isnt the most compelling, but its by no means the worst. I get into the main protagonists especially Bayak so they did well in developing those which naturally goes a long way, you can feel the chemistry between the two in a sense.Theres plenty to do, I had well over 100 hours in the game before Id completed all locations. Sure the areas generally have the same thing in, viewpoits, bases to clear, stargazing which was a nice touch, animal lairs to clear but most games to an extent are repeatable.The side quest are unique and can add some decent game time to it, they each ahve there unique story to it even though again the main quest involves much of the same, just multiple times. Again though, Im not sure you can really improve on this at the moment. Far Cry 5 will be the same to some extent like the others of its franchise.Im able to run it in 2k which minimal FPS issues. I may get a drop when theres a lot going on for a few seconds but nothing worth getting in a twist over. At 2K is really does heat up my 1080ti and require Precision X on full to keep it from going into meltdown. Im sure on 1080p it would be a lot less heavy.Also the DLC The Hidden Ones is a decent DLC for around 8 pounds which opens up 3 new areas and is set four years after the main storyline.If youre a fan of the Assassins Creed franchise then this is the one you must have.9/10
