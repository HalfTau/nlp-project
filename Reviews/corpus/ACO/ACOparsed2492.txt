I have always been a fan of Assassins Creed since AC3, but for the past couple of years I was adamant that Ubisoft killed the amazing experience I found in playing Assassins Creed. I felt as if they had abandoned everything that made the games amazing for a quick buck. I was proven wrong with this game.Assassins Creed Origins brought the series back to life by reintroducing some of the greatest Assassins Creed mechanics with a just little bit of change here and there. Ubisoft listened to their customers. They brought back a refreshed climbing system which allows the player to climb literally any surface a feature Ive been missing for the last 3 games, they toned back the beatemup combat style so agressively used in AC Syndicate leaving a clean as well as focused combat style, and they focused much more on the world and story. Part of why I found this game much better than AC Unity  AC Syndicate was the open nature. And the story is dark and intriguing, I havent finished it yet, but I think its safe to say it may surpass AC3  AC Black Flags storylines!This game also introduces new mechanics to the series which arent too overbearing. They introduced a sort of RNG for weapons ingame, allowing the player to get randomized damage types on weapons. This mechanic is great because it doesnt impact gameplay that much. Destiny, for example, has the same RNG on weapons but it is so heavily focused, its hard to play without requiring hours of grinding for a simple weapon. Ubisoft balanced it well.The only negative things Id have to say about the game is the side quests. Early on, the side quests begin to get pretty vanilla with little variety to what is required. Completing the entire map takes an argregious amount of time as well, doing mundane tasks.Finally, Im glad they kept coop out of this game. Now if they wouldve reintroduced Online Multiplayer this wouldve probably been my favorite game for a while.
