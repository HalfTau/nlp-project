I bought the game expecting that Id play around with it for two hours and then return it with a decision about whether or not to buy it again when it goes on sale. Seven hours later I realize its too late for a refund but I dont mind over much, as Im having a very good time. Immediate disclosure, Im not really a fan of the AC series  I got about 20 total hours of enjoyment out of the Chronicles games which were fun but just became too difficult and got fed up with the first game after struggling with the confusing controls for an hour. So this is really my first deep foray into the AC games and I have to say, this feels like a great place to enter.As I understand it, this game is a more open world and rpg insomuch as that means tinkering with skills and inventory, you have no decision making power in the story than the previous games and for a newcomer it works well. The skill trees are clear about what they do and how to spend xp the crafting system is pretty basic, which is fine for me, and gives you a reason to do a little gathering as you travel  even if you dont craft new stuff, you can use materials you gather to upgrade what you have. Combat is very simple to pick up and flows well it reminds me, a lot, of Witcher 3s combat system, which is only a compliment in my book. The stealth system is very simple, not even so complex as Dishonored, and while this will be considered a drawback for some players, I liked the fact that I didnt have to juggle a dozen mechanics to get around while in stealth. That said, what this means is that it isnt really a stealth game so much as a 3rd person action rpg like Rise of the Tomb Raider with a very useful and reliable stealth mechanic.The setting is beautiful the writing very passable if nothing special the story straightforward and not particularly complex at the 7.5 hour mark but it might expand from here and if it doesnt, theres also something to be said for simple stories if told well. Missions can sometimes be a bit fetchquesty they havent become tedious yet and a good part of that is the writing which makes them feel interesting, even when they boil down to Go here, kill X.At this point, I my inclination is to give it a 7.5, maybe an 8, out of 10 nothing youll remember much once youve finished it but itll keep you entertained while youre playing.
