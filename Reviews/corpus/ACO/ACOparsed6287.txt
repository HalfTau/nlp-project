First Impression ReviewFrom the 5.1 hours Ive played this game, its REALLY that good. Not the best or anything. Just fun in its own right. Glad they changed the style of the series and went with RPG genre.Kinda wished they go with the Mass Effect/Witcher style of illusion of choices. Something series might be good. I guess well see from the next Assassins Creed game.The good so far.The gameplay is paste and easy to handle.Egypt. Finally were getting Egypt this time. Been asking for AC to go to Egypt with since it fits the history with this franchise.Skill tree. Not too heavy. But great.The Bad.AI can be dumb and stubborn at some missions.Perries takes time to get used to.The official controls are garabage. Glad you can change it.Weird glitches and stuttering here and there.Overall, great game and fine entry to the series. Cant wait for more Assassin!
