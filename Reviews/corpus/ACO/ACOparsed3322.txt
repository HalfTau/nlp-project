Very nice game, I really like the RPG system with with the leveling and the number of weapons. The world is beatifull with a lot of side quest and places to visit. Main story is also really good, especially the main character, Bayek. He is really different from other characters fromm AC games and I really like that. But I have 1 minus for this game and that is the main story is really short, but that is only my opinion.
