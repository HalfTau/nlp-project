Combat mechanics is a hit or miss, typical ubisoft game...Very high system requirements.If you want to learn more about Egypt theres YouTube, additionally the time period they protrayed in the game is the most boring part of Egypts culture.Overall I will only recommend buying this game if its on sale and its down by 50.
