I havent had this much fun with an Assassins Creed game since the Ezio series. Ive been dying to see them use Ancient Egypt ancient is relative I guess, because in 48 BC the Old Kingdom is ancient to them and it looks incredible, and its by far the biggest map weve seen in any Assassins Creed to date. The combat and controls took getting used to hint if you are a series veteran and you dont like the button assignments, go to alternate in the controls and itll feel more familiar  thats if you are using a controller like I am but a few hours into the game and I was taking on crowds of enemies like any selfrespecting Assassin. This is Game of the Year material.
