Assassins Creed Origins was one of the most anticipated games of the year, well atleast it was for me. I was a huge fan of the Assassins Creed Franchise up to Black Flag for one reason or another I could not enjoy the titles that came after. This game however got me hooked after only a few hours of gameplay. When i first launched the game I intended to try it out for 3 hours... somehow that session took about 8 hours, this should give you an idea of how hooked i was and how addictive the game is.Ubisoft seem to have improved a lot of the games interface and mechanics. The most noticeable is the introduction of the ActionRPG system, and they have done it right. There are levels, talent trees, rare drops, Critical hit chance, onhit effects and much more RPG aspects that make grinding feel more rewarding and worthwhile. They introduced this RPG system while still managing to keep the game ... Well still keeping the game an assassins creed game where stealth, exploration and recon are still important.Other Positive notes on the game areAmazing environmentVery large and connective openworld one that I can compare to the Witcher 3 if not largerUnique and rewarding side questsA fun Combat system that is MUCH superior to the games predecessors. fans of Dark souls, BloodBorne and Nioh like myself, will fall in love with itGraphics are pretty amazing though requires a decent VGAAmazing Soundtrack as we have come to expect from any Assassins Creed game
