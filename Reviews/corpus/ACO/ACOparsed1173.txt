Worth all the money!Amazing graphics and great attention to details. The way the game works with the new fight system and the items based on levels and special abilities made me love the series again.Side missions everywhere and they are good I barely made few main missions and I know I still have a long way to finish the game, but who is rushing.Riders in the desert who are waiting for you to come and die, snakes inside the pots and Bayek hates them, he reminds me of Indiana Jones.P.S. you can find a side mission with 2 futuristic characters from final fantasy probably collaboration/advert
