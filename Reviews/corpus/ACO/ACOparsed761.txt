I will make a more comphrensive review after I finish the game, but I just want to add to the positivity.I LOVE this setting, ancient Egypt is amazing and beautiful. It really captivates me in a way that Black Flag or The Witcher 3 couldnt triggered comments inc. The gameplay can feel a little too repetitive at times, but I seem to forgive it since the world is so damn charming. The story so far halfwayish has been good, not super exciting thus far, but entertaining and believable.It runs for me, so I guess I am one of the lucky ones.Performance on my 58 year old hardware is actually not terrible. My i5 2500k OCed to 4.5Ghz is finally turning into a slight bottleneck, hitting 100 for a few moments running through dence areas. My 7970  1080p on Medium settings nets me about 45 FPS on average with the lows slightly above 30 FPS. Its too much to handle at 1440p sadly. My GPU has been behind for a long time, so Im ok with it.Its too bad it cant run well, or at all, on some systems. I am sure the rating would easily be 90 if they worked harder at hardware optimization and bug fixing.
