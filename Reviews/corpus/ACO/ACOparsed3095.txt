An old story deep and simple at the same time away from the complexity and interconnected stories of past parts. The story is composed of four main chapters each of which contains about 4 anonymous leaders and with each chapter the enthusiasm grows. I was very impressed with the difference and diversity of the fighting style of the leaders, each of them has a different strategy and weapons that change your skills and style of play, and is a change in the style of playing Assassins Creed series. The selection of main characters and lateral conciliator as the story reviews the most important historical events with Cleopatra and the Roman Caesar Julius
