But I frequently found myself riding through a city of lowres polygon people who had not loaded in yet.I was blown away how quickly the story wrapped up. It seemed both heavyhanded and sparse simultaneously. But up until the very end I was loving it.Time to get un?criticalAmazing voice acintg, and a wonderful web of main and side stories to be told with themIt is pretty dang fun to not just be another assassin. Made it really stand on its own.All the usual super pretty AAA stuff.
