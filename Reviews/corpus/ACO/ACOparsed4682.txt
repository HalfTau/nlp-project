What a game guys. If you were upset with the last few AC games, Unity and Syndicate, this one takes the cake. This feels like, in my opinion, what should have been released after the the most recent awesome AC game, Black Flag. It has a massive world and feels very open. The control scheme has changed a bit using xbox 1 controller but in a good way with less random drops/jumps of walls/buildings very fun game. I have not seen really any performance issues since I have installed and I am getting 65 fps running Ultra settings. GTX 1070, i7, 24 gb ram, even when in cities. I do occasionaly see slight tearing in the image from bitrate issues when I am streaming with high stream settings and ultra game settings. Fun and performs will. If you have a similar system or better, I HIGHLY recommend getting this game as it is one of the few recently that I have felt like....yep, that game is worth 60 bucks!
