I5 4440,  8 GB RAM,  GTX 760.As soon as I can get past the launch screen I am sure I will enjoy it.Moving files to C drive has fixed it.I am not disappointed with the way the game is running.  It could be more optimized.The game they have created is great.  It is just a matter of settling for less on your PC that should handle it no problem.
