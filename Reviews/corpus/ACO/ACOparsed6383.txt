I preordered and waited until midnight for this game. I was so excited to finally play it, only to be met with utter dissapointment. i have now been trying to get this game past the loading screen for 14 hours. After uninstalling the game nearly every driver on my computer and switching which SSD the game was saved on the game still crashed at the very start of the game 100 of the time. Never forget this is an Ubisoft game and it will never work correctly.
