Great game. Very reminiscent of Witcher 3 but not quite there yet.The story is unfortunatley muddled and never reaches its potential. Personally I found Syndicate to have more compelling characters and story. Bayek is a functional protagonist but a little underdeveloped.The strongest aspect of the game is exploration and it does it in spades. The sidequest are more fetch quests, which is a little dissapointg. Voice acting needs improvement and the repetitive character design gets old fast. The combat is also another feature that is greatly improved compared to the previous entries into the franchise.Strongly recommend this game as its got great exploration. OST is not bad, especialy the main theme, but leaves you wanting more.8/10
