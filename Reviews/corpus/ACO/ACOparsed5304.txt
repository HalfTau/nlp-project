I only played the first couple of assasins creed games and didnt finish any of them since I felt like the combat was really lacking just hit button counter constantly. Assasins Creed Origins feels incredible. The new combat system makes it feel like a completely different game, very Dark Souls/Witcher 3 ish. The skill tree and weapon system give this game way more depth than previous versions have had. I can easily see getting 100 hours out of this game and am looking forward to future installments.
