This is the best Assassins Creed game after Assassins Creed Black Flag! Ive never been as immersed in the main protagonist or the story. Ive always approached the Assassins Creed games as another action game. I love the mechanics, the stealth kill but Ive not been as invested in the story.Origins sucked me deep in terms of story and motivation.This is a must buy!
