Its really a beautiful time in Origins. I like seeing hallucinations in the desert Though, after a couple of hours played, I kinda missed 80s, city, filled with civilized people environment and those tall buildings. If Ubisoft decided to make another AC games, I hope I can see that kind of setting again P.S. gladiator mode helps me perfecting my fighting mechanics. helps a lot when fighting Phylakes
