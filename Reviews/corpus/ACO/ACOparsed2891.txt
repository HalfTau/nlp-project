Level systems for Assassins Creed? This isnt a RPG like Skyrim or Fallout, youre an ASSASSIN not some guy learning to fight for the first time. Its such a waste of time to slice and shoot hundreds of time to get hit once and die. The story isnt worse than AC3 and the voice acting is the worst I have seen in a AAA game. The way the story is told boring and I havent seen anything that really attaches you to a character so I couldnt care less if they all got their heads ripped off and shoved onto pikes.
