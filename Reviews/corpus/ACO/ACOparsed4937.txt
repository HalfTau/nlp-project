The best combat system PERIOD.Even if hyenas kinda buggy inside stones and fps kinda spiky on huge city, the game still please me with their dedication for making egypt so damn good and perfectly historical. Ive played 3 days full and still on 1/41/5 story, A lot of side mission to grinding level, and the missions are not repeatable and boring. The missions are very amusing. Pyramids are kinda short to explore but you gain 1 ability points just by hovering your torch and said one sentence.BEST ASSASSINS CREED 11/10
