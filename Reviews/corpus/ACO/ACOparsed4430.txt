Theres nothing more satisfying than jumping off a ledge falling in the air and shooting someone in the face with an arrow!I didnt think Id buy this AC game but I am glad I did. I watched some Youtuber play it and it looked really fun. I pulled the trigger and I have had so much fun since. I dont regret it at all. The game is so awesome. Theres so much to do and I am not even close to beating it. It reminds me of Witcher 3 a little bit and thats my favorite game of all time.I havent had that many problems with the game like a lot of users have with CPU usage. After the patch I actually have better performance than before. The highest Ive seen the FPS go up to is the upper 70s and the lowest was in the 40s.ProsGameplay is really addictingGraphics are amazingCombat reminds me of Witcher 3So much to doThe map is hugeCrafting systemConsIt has blue screened my computer a few timesIts crashed a couple times on meSome graphic glitchesWeird buzzing over the audio that happens sometimes
