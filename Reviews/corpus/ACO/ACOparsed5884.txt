Ubisoft finally took the hint from games like Witcher 3 and Dark Souls 3. Revamped combat system and a larger open world with no loading screens. Best in the series so far imo. I really enjoyed AC3 and Black Flag but found Unity and Syndicate to be bland and uninteresting. So far the culture and storyline are really interesting. World is huge and I feel Ive barely scratched the surface after 10 hours playing.
