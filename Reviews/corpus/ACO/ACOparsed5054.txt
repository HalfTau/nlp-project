Dont buy this game until DRM is either removed or performance is not impacted by the DRM. My rig struggled to run this game well and its a i7 7800x GTX 1080 16gb 3200 ram. Legit customers being penalised for the people who try and steal. This doesnt send a good message to people who do the right thing. rantover
