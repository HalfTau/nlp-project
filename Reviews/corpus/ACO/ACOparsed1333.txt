Best Assassins Creed yet.Large Map.RPG Elements.Side quest like The Witcher 3 but a little watered down compared to.Graphics are stunning and breath taking.Story feels compelling.Also there are a few things that !!bug!! me.FPS issues, low fps in some areas of the game, mainly  cities and lush areasCutscene stutter is distracting only in some its noticeable, mainly action fast movement in scene.Enemies on horseback that attack you with arrows are a pain.NPC that follow you will sometimes stay way to close.There are a few bugs that i have encountered to many to list and most likely to still find. But its an Assassin Creed game they have always had funny bugs/glitches.
