As someone who is fascinated by ancient egypt this game was a blast every step of the way!The visuals alone and art direction are the best of any game I have ever played to date. The insane amount of tiny details you notice as you play are incredible and the people behind the visuals and research team of said visuals need to be given a huge amount of praise.I really enjoyed the new combat system and gameplay and as someone who has played every assassins creed title it was extremely refreshing.All the small details really bring the world to life and the locations are an incredible spectical.Ive played this game for 22 hours so far and the environments are still breathtaking and I find myself going into the camera mode just to have a look around.I honestly cant recommend this game enough and you have to play it on a powerful pc so you can truly appreciate the game to the fullest.This is a purchase you will never regret!
