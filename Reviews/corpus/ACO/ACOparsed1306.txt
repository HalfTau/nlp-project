It is surprisingly good.The last few Assassins Creed games were a bit of a letdown for me, only played them for the Real Life story.This one is different though. First off, where the older games seemed more like a chore to explore, this one is a bliss to look for every nook and cranny you can climb the pyramids D.Combat got improved as well. You actually have to time your attacks and watch for enemy movement.The story is also compelling, although it may not be in everyones taste.For an Assassins Creed Id give it a 9/10For a game in general I would give it a 8/10
