I think assassins creed origin can save the assassins creed series.this game offer us many things that the assassins creed seriess are lacking, such as rpg feeling.the open world map is bigger than the wr 3 that give us time to explore many place trough out this game.this game is so unique compare the the other assassins creed series and give me a new sensation of rpg gaming by locating the game in the dessert egypt.if only this game came out a few years back, this game can win the best game of the year.well, Overall this game is so cool and worth to be buy.spoiler alerti like isu armor and the new feature such as senu perspective, its so much better than the previous eagle vision.LOL i laugh so hard when i finish a mission that have final fantasy XV easter egg on it.
