Seven hours in and I can say that the little break that ubisoft took to make this game really paid off in the end.PROS The world and the surrounding scenery is amazing and detailed. The combat system feels way better than previous entries in the series. The soundtrack is simply amazing! Looting and leveling in the game is really fun. Fun to just wonder off and explore the world.CONS Some minor performance issues in certain places and certain situations not distracting from gameplay though. Had audio issues when i first started the game I fixed it by restarting the game after the game saved. So far the story is okay, its not amazing but its not bad either.OVERALLSeven hours in this game is pretty good and would recormend it!
