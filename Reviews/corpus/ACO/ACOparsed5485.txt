You can safely ignore the manchildren screaming about DRM  the game is very well optimized and runs fine on my 3 year old laptop hardware while still looking beautiful.Ingame world is huge, theres a lot of variety, infiltrating fortresses and combat is really fun. Sidequests are fun, but not as memorable as in Witcher 3, for example. Main story is pretty good too, and I like the way they addressed the villains  theyre not onedimensional goons, but rather everyone has an interesting reason theyre doing evil crap.I never cared much for AC series, but Im having lots of fun with this one. Great game.
