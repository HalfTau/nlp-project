This game definatly has problems. It is very poorly optimized. Running on a GTX 980 with a i76820k I cant play the game on anything higher than low settings which makes the game look awful. I hope patches get released in the future to fix these issues.That aside the story is good and quite engaging. It certainly isnt anything original but was enjoyable enough. Where this game really shines is in the new combat system. Treating the game like a combination between Dark Souls and Arkham style combat was very enjoyable. Alot of the mini games are new and quite enjoyable and tomb raiding is very atmosheric.Overall this game is good but has problems on PC. If you dont mind a framerate that drops between 60 and 30 constantly and an ugly game because of poor optimization then I think you will have alot of fun with this. Purchase at your own risk.
