Fantastic game. Great story, beautiful graphics, top notch voice acting, and a very immersive historical environment. Very polished too... despite what some have said here, it ran beautifully on my machine on max settings without any major glitches which is pretty much unheard of in a game of this size. If youre a fan of big open world RPGs and can afford the price tag, then give AC Origins a chance... you wont be dissapointed.
