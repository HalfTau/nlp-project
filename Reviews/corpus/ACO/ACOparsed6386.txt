First impressions. Keep in mind Im still in the first area of Siwa.Smooth, beautiful and polished. The area is large, and there is no shortage of activities and sights to see. In one of the promotional videos, the devs said something like, See that mountain in the distance? You can climb it. You can. The quests are engaging and the writing is excellent. There is literally tonnes of loot  so much that you can miss it if youre not paying attention.This is not the Assassins Creed of crowded teeming cities it does have a different feel, and the influences of other open world games can be seen. But thats not a bad thing. This is Egypt and the desert. Its beautiful, endless, and terrifying. One point of interest  the ancient ruins dotted about the land are mysterious to Bayek and the other citizens of the world, and thats pretty damn accurate! No bugs or CTDs so far. No optimisation issues. No clunky, sluggish controls or mechanics  the combat is smooth and crisp, and the weapons all have a different feel. No contrived QTEs so far.Hope this helps hesitant fans or newcomers. I will update this as required, or if anything in my experience of the game substantially changes.And as for Uplay  Eh. So what? If I have to have it to play some of my favourite games, fine then. I can live with that!
