Ive played almost all Assassins Creed games and this one is pretty legit. As far as the combat goes, it can be a bit clunky but you get used to it after a few dozen fights and eventually find yourself wiping out the biggest camps on the map. The leveling system is a bit wonky in the sense that not until far after end game is when you can actually have most if not all abilities equipped wouldve been nice to have the opportunity to utilize all abilities when it really counted. The story itself was decent enough to stay interested but I felt that the game went by very fast. I completed 99 of all achievements and Ubisoft challenges at the 79 hour mark. Suffice it to say that I will likely not be purchasing any DLC content as there are only two major expansion releases and a couple outfitsmounts. Seeing as though I only have almost 80 hours in the game, I cant see that Ill be able to milk out another 80 hours from the DLC. I recommend this game but mainly if you can get it on sale.TLDR Fun game to play, not extremely challenging. Completed 99 of all Ubisoft challenges and Steam achievements in less than 80 hours, so a bit lacking in content. The DLC seems way overpriced, probably wont get it. Maybe try to get base game on sale.
