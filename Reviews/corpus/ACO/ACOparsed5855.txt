First of all this game runs pretty good without any glitches at all so far, and looks amazing. Im really enjoying this game. The change from a urban setting to a larger more rural open world makes this entry in the AC series feel fresh.The change in combat and is also welcome. Im not hugely into the main story but the side quests are pretty good so far. I wish this game had a dialog tree and a bit of player decision as the game already is more of an action rpg than the series have been before. I also wish I could turn off most of the map/compass markers as, so that I could explore without the game telling where everything interesting is.
