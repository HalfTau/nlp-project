This game saved Ubisoft, literally.Last year, they didnt make a new AC game, so the could have more time to perfectionize AC Origins and God help me they finally made a good decision. AC games were getting so repetitive had my fair share of assassinating on the xbox 360 back in the day, but with Origins new combat system which is still easy, but not that easy, the levelling up system which can be frustrating at times, but in the end it is very rewarding to level up and get that new weapon unlocked and the overall beautiful graphics, Assassins Creed Origins is worth a buy.Lastly, there are some minor things that can make your experience not so great like the specs you need to play it. I am running it on a 1060 3gb, an i73770 and 8 gigs of ram. The games runs mostly in 60 FPS on the High preset so anything similar that is what you should go for in my opinion. Oh yeah, and the guidable arrows are fing disgusting...why would you do something like that? It doesnt make any sense!But if you got the computer power, you should definetly give Origins a go 8.5/10.
