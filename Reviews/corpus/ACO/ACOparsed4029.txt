another good game bogged down by stupid practices put in place by outoftouch higherupsi have a 4gb 970, a ryzen 5 1600, and 16gb ddr4 rami can barely run this game at 60 on mediumthe reason behind the games poor performance is, despite all of ubisofts objections, the ing drmi bought this game with my own hardearned money, i should be able to enjoy it properly without the troglodytes at ubisoft shoehorning in cpuintensive drmim not refunding this game because what little ive played is genuinely enjoyable and i very much want to be able to play more of it, but if youre looking into this game and you have a midrange pc, wait until they inevitably patch the drm out due to the myriad of user complaintsin the meantime,  ubisoftthis is a good game and i hate that i cant run it
