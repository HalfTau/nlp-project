A nice return to form for the Assassins Creed series. Extremely immersive world with the environment of ancient Egypt really standing out everywhere you look. Attention to detail is very good this year as well For instance there is a lot of debris floating around in the water and sometimes if there is an oil pot you can break it and then shoot a fire arrow at it to set the surface on fire so passing boats might catchCharacters are pretty cool. You kinda go from vengeance to justice and witness the beginnings of the order. Ive skipped a few cutscenese lately only because they tend to drag in my opinion Something I never do and I know that I will likely never see half those characters again because there are so many quests available.Not as much verticle rooftop to rooftop playground this time around but there is enough there to satisfy anyone coming from Brotherhood or Syndicate. Almost every enemy encounter has some type of highground/lowground mechanic so you can still stalk the sky or choose to use the plethora of brush cover to sneak right past guards for a clean and silent kill on your target.Overall the game lets you feel like a true desert warrior and wanderer as you traverse the unforgiving landscape, fighting marauders and deadly animals alike And you can tame said beasts in many different locales including desert basins, marshlands, rocky mountains, endless dunes, and the modern settings of Alexandria The Library of Alexandria as well!So far so good!
