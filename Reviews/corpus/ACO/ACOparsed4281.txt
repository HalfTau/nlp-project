First of all, I want to state I havent had any performance issues and it opens fine for me.  Im playing it on ultra with a 980 ti, 2500k and 16 gb ddr3. The worst thing performance wise Ive seen are occasional stutters in cutscenes but its not terrible.  I will also mention occasional world glitches, but that happens in all open world games Ive ever played.Secondly, the combat is a huge innovation and is challenging at times but fun to master.  There are end game activities and tons of things to discover and collect.  The map is massive!  Side quests are fun and unique, even doing similar things, the story behind each is different.Thirdly, Im actually enjoying the story.  Im pretty far in now and its gotten very good in my opinion.  Dont want to include spoilers, but the variety and culture of ancient egypt draw me in.This is a wonderful reinvention of Assassins Creed and my favorite in the series so far. Get this game if you enjoy exploring, egypt culture/mythology, rpgs, action games or the thought of a game involving exploring pyramids and gameplay similar to witcher 3.
