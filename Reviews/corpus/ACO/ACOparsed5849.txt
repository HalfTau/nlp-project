WELCOME HOME ASSASINS CREED FANS!Ok so this game is worth the base price,fun,so much content to do and explore vast places with some cool history and story points.If you love exploring,killing guards and simple hunting this game covers that fully.draw back? i feel like i dont connect with the main character much but meh I been playing since AC1 all the way through to Unity.Uhm helpful tips I found out and can share as follows1HUNT! kill all the animals even on the way to quests or guard camps,you need the stats to deal with a flood of enemies gangbanging you when you get caught.Healthmeleerange damage all depends on gear and how much you upgrade each stat.2DONT WASTE MONEY ON LOW LEVEL GEAR! my advice is to wait til your lv20 to actually upgrade weapons/shields or bows because that is where you start to really see high crit numbers.I have yet to dismantle weapons I pick up for money but I am the type to buy out all mounts or clothing items first because I like to collect such stuff3SPEAR or SCEPTRE is newbie friendly! at first the short range weapons cost me deaths because I had yet to master the controls or unlock higher skills in the warrior tree.They also provide great reach against shield enemies which in my opinion have given my aggressive playstyle a hard time.They block alot while their friends stab you in the back,especially the bigger guys who carry resources and have larger shields.4TEST ALL WEAPON TYPES TO FIND FAVOURITE! I use short sword,dual swords and spear mostly as those fit my playstyle and I like the kill animations.Just see what you like and stick with those,you generally will find weapons alot so go have fun testing out what works for you.5DO THE DAILY BLUE QUEST NOMADS BAZAAR so far I have gotten 2 yellow legendary short swords with different stats and looks.Its work doing at all levels you get gear equal to your own level anyways 70 of the time from what i have picked up.6AVENGE OTHER PLAYERSyea ok so I was confused to what I saw but I clicked on the blue skull icon and I killed the npc enemies that killed another player,was cool and I got experience for doing it.Id say its worth doing for exp alone the kill tree is cool but you need like 2 or 3 skills points for one perk.7FINISH OFF YOUR ZONES BEFORE MOVING ON. Ok so the map is ing huge...and well I hate back tracking through large areas,yes there is alot of synce/fast travel points but for your sanity just explore the zone/collect all the loot and them move on.It will save you time,trust me guys...THE MAP IS HUGE!Ok so I was excitied for my return to the franchise,as well yea got burned out but this game and the story so far has my loving it and  do love egyptian culture in general.Hopefully you all have fun and enjoy Assassins Creed Origins.
