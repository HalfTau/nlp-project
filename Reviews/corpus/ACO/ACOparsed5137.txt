TLDR  ACOs DRM increases electric and hardware costs. Two wrongs do not make a right. Yet, if you can suck it up, good game is pretty.A small minority of people steal games. Yet, AC Origins makes its nonthieving users suffer for the wrongs of others by adding unnecessary costs to everyones electric bills with computationallyexpensive DRM, not to mention, possibly shortening the life of their CPUs. I, myself, have a Ryzen. The DRM hasnt impacted performance on my machine, yet I am not keen on watching my CPU die young.This will influence future purchasing decisions I make. My friend and neighbor has avoided purchasing the game despite wanting to do so before I even heard of itits my first flirt with the AC series because of the DRM issues hes read about.That said, the game, itself, I find really beautiful and fun. There have been surprisingly few bugs. I dont want to give this game a No. Yet, I dont know if I will be heard if I give it a Yes. Ill give it a longterm Yes by giving it a No, now hows that?
