Having finished the main story now, this has been one of my favourite stories in the AC series. I found the gameplay to be much more challenging, but enjoyable and the setting of the story is interesting. Had a few framerate issues but it didnt stop me from playing it in ultra high which looked visually stunning. The side quests were a bit repetative so I skipped a few towards the end, I probably wont go back to 100 the game, but overall, this was a fun experience.
