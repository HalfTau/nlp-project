Only 5hrs in but my god I can already tell this is the best AC since Black Flag. Graphics are absolutely AMAZING if you have a rig that can run it on the higher settings. The combat, exploration, atmosphere its all here and well done. I cant say for sure when Ill actually finish it huge backlog but one things for sure, if your on the fence about it and have a pc that can run it, just buy it. Youll be hard pressed to find it dissapointing.
