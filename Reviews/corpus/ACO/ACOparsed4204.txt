So far this game looks amazing. Combat has been updated and feels more fluid, and the same could be said for the climing. That said,  Im about 2 hours in and had to spend the first 30 mins or so tinkering with the settings. For some reason this game has terrible performance compared to some other Ubisoft games I have played on my system. I currently have to run on medium settings, and even then, still drop to 46 fps sometimes...My RigRyzen 7 1700 8core 3.72  Game takes about 4050 of cpu usageGTX 1080FE16 gigs of Gskill  3000htz512ssd my gaming ssdI was running it on my ultrawide  3440x1440 on medium settings and avg around 58 fps with dips down to 46.I can typically play most games on high or ultra at 75fps. So I hope they can optimize w/e is making this game not run good on high settings.Hopefully this helps your purchase decision.
