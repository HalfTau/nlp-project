My favorite Assassin Creed game. The more I play the game the more I just want to play it more. This is one of those games where I want to do everything in it. When I first looked at the world map I was astonished by how large it was, sure alot of it is desert but there is still so much to do.Pros New Item system is captivating Crafting to upgrade old equipment, and improve gear Random rarity drops. I like the exp and leveling experience, keeps your character from killing anything like bounty hunters. Beatutiful EnviormentA lot less bugs, Only seen a couple things get stuck in the walls/groundConsNo multiplayer, Revelations multiplayer was fun and I wish they would have brought it back.Item system could use more items. I find alot of Epic/Legendary gear that is the same as I already haveTalent tree isnt too great, needs reworked. I dont like spending points to unlock tools, They should be unlocked in story.
