This is my favorite Assassins Creed game yet!I loved AC 2, didnt like 3 and pretty much ignored the rest. I wasnt considering buying this when I first heard about it until I watched some YouTube reviews and thats when I started to become interested. I didnt think it would go on a Black Friday sale since its still new but it did, 17 off isnt a whole lot but I picked up the gold edition and man I just cant stop playing lol.It runs smooth for me I havent had any issues with it at all. Some people on the steam reviews said their game wasnt working well so Im guessing the issues have been fixed already.Ive only put 18.6 hrs. into the game at this very point but Ive only owned the game for 2 days now lol!So yea, click that purchase button  !!
