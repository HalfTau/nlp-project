I dont often write reviews but I feel the need to  based on people going crazy over microtransactions or game bugs.  Now, I do have Logitech headphones and am currently being effected by having to use a different pair of headphones because of the gamebreaking sound issue.  But sound bugs aside, the game is amazing! As a fan of Ancient Egypt, Ive always wanted to explore this setting and what a treat it is! This is a beautiful game and I often found myself exploring every nook and cranny in the game.  The addition of side quests is great and I actually like the combat system though it can be clunky at times but the variety of weapons is great and using the bow is a nice challenge. I think the protagonist and other characters are well done.  Without spoiling, my biggest gripe so far would be the out of animus parts, but it has been with every Assassins Creed game, Im just not a fan of the modern day flashbacks.  However, I do like the main story so far.  But overall, Id rate this game a 9/10 and if all bugs are addressed because there are bugs as stated earlier with the sound, Ive experienced some clipping, and an issue with the hippodrome races.  if all of the bugs are patched out, its an easy 10/10 for me.
