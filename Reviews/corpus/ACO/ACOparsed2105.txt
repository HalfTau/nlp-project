The only Assassins Creed ive completed was Assassins Creed 2, I played 3, and 4 but found them extremly boring half way through.  This one I am absolutly loving!  I dont understand some of the reviews because I really like the combat system and the story.  One gripe that I have is that the DLC cannot be removed from your inventory!  This is incredibly annoying because for my first playthrough I dont want this crap in my inventory.  But all in all I would say this is the best game since Zelda launched in March.
