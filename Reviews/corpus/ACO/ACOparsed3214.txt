I am not much for long winded reviews, most of what I would say can be read in the previous comments. While I do not have the games settings cranked way up No 4k monitor so why bother I have experienced very few bugs and other than probably 34 crashes, played through the whole story seamlessly. My only complaint is that, compared to some of the past releases, the story all 125ish quests felt relatively short. The upcoming DLCs and free content may add on to that but at this point I somewhat feel im done with the game. That being said, theres 2 rather large zones with nothing, or next to nothing in them, so plenty of room to add stuff and one would think thats their plan at some point or else why even waste time developing those zones.
