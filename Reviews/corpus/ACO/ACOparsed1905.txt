Black Flag was the first AC I played seriously and fully. After that wonderful game I tried the next 2 games, which is where I lost my faith. After a few hours of playing Origins after a friend told me this game was good I got addicted again and to me its even better than Black Flag. Really worth the money. Only 1 downside to the game...I lost my social life...
