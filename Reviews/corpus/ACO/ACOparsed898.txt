I have tried every assassins creed game there is and i  dropped every game after the first one after 30min because they were so boring but this one is so different the gamepaly is so fun and its not the same repetetive thing anymore well it is but not that much all in all this is a great game except the performance, it is absolute I have a ryzen 1500x 8gb ram and rx 550 4gb i should be able to run it at medium/high yet no matter at what preset i play i cant get more than 35 fps, my gpu is at 73C while in any other game it doesnt go beyond 55C and  all 8 cpu cores are constantly at 90 usageBuy this only if you can play with 3040 fps or if you have a beast pc
