How do i put this... its such a great game... love it... i can play it with my ing low spec pc... something that i cant believe it.. with nvidia 2gb 930m, who can expect to play it smoothly... bt truely i can... some aspect i set it on low setting and others on medium especially on character quality... damn good... play it so smoothly with graphic environment good enough... thank God for the dev to make this to be play for anyone whose only have low to med spec pc... beside that thing, the story so far so great and many of side mission. I cant stop playing the game.. to fully complete the game story and all its side mission... after all for those which want to have this game but have doubt on buying it just because of their low or med spec pc of their own, i highly recommend to buy this coz u can play it bro u can play it just like i did... u can really enjoy the graphics even its just good enough some aspect on low the others on med.... lol
