What a joke. What a complete and utter joke.Dont waste your money.I would love to tell you about the game and how it beautiful it looks etc. But as it happens ubisoft have done this amazing thing where they havent checked their patches or weather people can actually run the damn game.I never even made it past the splash screen, and after spending 3 hours trying to fix it and finding far too many people with the same problem as me I just asked for a refund because even if I could get it to work, Ubisoft dont deserve my money. The damn crooks.
