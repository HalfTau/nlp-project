After hrs of playing, starting at 5am MET when it came out and finally having the Hidden Blade I think I am ready to do a little review.1. Is it an Assassins Creed? YES. Its in egypt, yes. BUT it has the typical AC feeling during fights and watching the wonderfull and huge area.2. Performance Ive got an i74790k 5.2GHz and a ROG Strix GTX 1080 OC 2154MHz Core Clock. I play at 4k and Very High Settings having mostly around 4055FPS. Falling deeply in water rendering lots of light effects they go down to around 30 what only happend once now and one crash having my PC turned on for over full 24hrs. For people that have huge drops or crashes, I am using the 387.92 GPU driver, it aint the latest but the last one.3. Graphics The game looks wonderfull and has an huge amount of effects as you would expect playing an 2017  AAAtitle.4. Gameplay Its awesome. Fights are not that hard if you know how to move right as it is in The Witcher 3. You need to upgrade your weapons and armor to be sure that you are ready to fight all the time, its not even a problem to kill lvl10 enemies being lvl7 by yourselfe then even if it doesnt work at the first try. But what always works fine is fighting on your horse. You easily can ride around enemies and kill them while not getting hit once, even for enemies having around 45lvls more than you.All in one its a good game I havent seen any bugs since now having nice graphics and some sweet piece of gameplay.
