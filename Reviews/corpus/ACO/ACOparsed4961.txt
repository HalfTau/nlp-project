Could the legends be true about the doubleDRM?Enjoying it so far, but the random framedrops are extremely offputting. This could easily be my favorite asscreed game if they are able to fix the DRM. It runs fine on my desktop, but my laptops i7 processor just craps itself, regardless of which settings I have the graphical options on.If your processor is made out of the melted flesh of Godzilla, then Id say give this game a go, its pretty gewd.
