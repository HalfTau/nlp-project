This is by far, my favorite Assissins Creed game. I havent play them all though, just majority It plays much more open world then any other AC and the story is incredibly engaging, so far. Also a huge bonus, the side missions are very well done. They are all unique and make me want to complete each one. Some even give me a good laugh which is very welcome. The combat system is also much more enjoyable now, it feels familiar to witcher 3 which is great. Im running it a sorta budget PC with an i5 and a 1060 ti. I get around 60 fps consistantly with very few drops on some ultra but mostly very high settings. I have no complaints about the omptimization. I would definitely recommend this game.
