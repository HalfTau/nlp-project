This game is a lot more expensive than I would have liked to pay but for what it is there is a multitude of content and so far there havebeen regular updates on a weekly basis adding things to the gameplay. The RPG aspect of the game adds an element that was never there in the previous Assassin Creeds and there is always something to do. I am yet to get bored of the game and it is just as easy to play for half an hour to kill some time or to spend a good day just playing the game and getting invested into the story. Yeah its a decent game, just expensive AF.
