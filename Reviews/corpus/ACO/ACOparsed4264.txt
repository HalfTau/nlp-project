Such a improvement from the last one! I have played all the assassins creed games and see where it went downhill from Unity  Syndicate HOWEVER this is a huge improvement and I would defintley recomend. I have 52 hours played so far and I havent even finished the main storyline yet so the most of my XP etc is from side quests. Its very RPG based just like witcher 3. As you can accept quests and can go back to them later on via the quest menu which has various categories like main,side,events etc. The new combat system is amazing you actually have to fight now not just hit a button at the right time to counter the enemy. you now dodge, light attack heavy attack. Plus the final cinematic when you kill the last one in a group of enemies looks brill.10/10 would play again!
