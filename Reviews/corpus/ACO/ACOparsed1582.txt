If you have a Nvidea graphics card good luck in playing this game with stable frames. No matter what setting i had on i would always get between 3045fps, And i have a good pc!. Its been a couple of months since the release of this game and the issue still hasnt been fixed. You really cant trust UBISOFT. Dont buy this game at full price wait for it to go to a very low price.
