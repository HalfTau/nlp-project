Yes, I will highly recommend this game. You can tell they took some hints from Witcher 3 with both the story and new combat system. I am playing the game on Hard and it does offer a bit of a challenge unheard of from the past games of this series. The parkour is almost perfect and no longer limited to the linear obvious routes up. Everything that is physically scaleable by a superhuman is scaleable by Bayek.Bayek is both interesting and likeable and is in no way like Connor Kenway. Associates are also intriguing and i look forward to cutscenes with them.The map is huge, beautiful, and full. you arent mindlessly wandering around a desert like some may lead you to believe and the shear amount of fully voice acted sidequest is a nice addition. It does get reptitive but every game does. This is a solid RPG and im sure i will get atleast 100 hours out of it in one playthrough and that is 100 hours of actual playing, not collectable hunting. There is no more ridiculous amount of collectables.This is not just another Assassins Creed or some cash grab by ubisoft. There is no push for microtransactions like unity had. If you want a couple extra outfits, spend some extra money but thats pretty much it. Every resource is reasonably obtainable and the gold sytem is wellbalanced sp you have to grind but not too much.All these negative reviews are driving me crazy based on cpu usage. Im rocking an old i54430 3 ghz and even my PCMR roommate agrees that the game is running great on ultra. little stutter every once in awhile but is that really such a bad thing. so what if i dip to 35 fps when i first start up the game, its not taking away from the expierence.
