Good Assassins Creed game up to date. And I finished this game 100 except for the achievementsThe reinvented combat is fun and creative to play, although some weapons stats are still useless and the armors does not do anything beside looking good.Not require to be stealthy in every mission, but encourage player to be. To compare AC Syndicate force player to play their boring and lengthy steathy game usually with Jacob, a  steath assassin.Good acting in every moment. The story is great too, except for the last part.
