Very honest, totally useless review Bought this game on sale, still refunded it.The graphics are subpar considering it maxes out my system.The gameplay put me to sleep.Frequent jittery framerate issues.The voice actors were a chore to listen to.On a personal note, I hate how you can climb on perfectly flat smooth surfaces. There is no need to pathfind or plan out your movements, just run anywhere and hold A and you have a guaranteed escape.
