Origins is a fantastic return for the series, Egypt is absolutely beautiful and the attention to detail is amazing!.There are some negatives to this game like optimisation needs work and the combat isnt all that fulid. However, the missions are great and its incredibly easy to get lost in this beautiful world!Origins is right up there with black flag in being a standout for the series.
