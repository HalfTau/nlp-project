From pillfering the Great Pyramids to the Step pyramids to the Bent Pyramid To scaling the Lighthouse of Alexandria to Solving the Riddle of the Sphynx to the Witcher esque combat style to the Metal gear solid V esque stealth elements. Glorious assassinations Chariot battles and Races Ancient Naval battle Hunting in the Nile Delta riding on horseback through the desert.
