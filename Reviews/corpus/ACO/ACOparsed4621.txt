Best game in its series. Havent run into any resource issues, runs just fine on highest settings.Combat has been refined, and feels wonderful  no more simply parrying to kill everyone.Weapons styles are all extremely unique  not just appearance.Mounted combat is actually decent and viable in many situations.Aim assist is almost necessary in some parts, and they do it well  no ones holding your hand, and youre not fuming from all fo your shots missing by not being able to guess where the enemy will be in 1 second while youre getting gangbanged by a mob of guards.Story so far is wonderful  love the Egyption atmosphere, and the many places to explore.The world is HUGE  each one of the 37 i believe maps has at least 34 hours of playtime before you have done all of the quests and storyline missions. Massive amounts of content that dont seem to repeat, always fresh.Love the additional content when outside of the animus  characters are new, and well acted.Spent a couple hours just reading emails and files to catch up on the back story.Also interesting side content such as ship battles and chariot races that are actually sort of fun.Crafting system is perfect  nothing is wasted, as everything you upgrade is just.. attached to your character and never replaced.Well placed boobs, not overdone at all.Perfect level of tactics and strategy by using your bird.The hardest difficulty setting makes for a wonderful challenge  anything is Possible, but going head to head against anyone 2 levels higher than you will be Exremely challenging, and will likely take multiple attempts.Weapon upgrade system is great  have a favorite weapon? Just spend the money every few levels to keep it at your same level.Blows my mind how the developers were able to come up with so much unique content in such a short period of time. Well done.
