I had very little performance  issues with this game. Yeah there are bugs and some frame rate drops. Seriously doesntdeserve a down vote for that. I even had texture issues!OMG I should get my money back lolFind me a game with this much detail, this big that has 0 bugs. You wont!Is it worth it ? Yes!Are there issues? Nothing game breaking for me.Is it one of the best AC games? Yes!Dont miss out on a game because of winey people who may or may not have a system that can handle it. Or they just want to cry about something lol.BRING THE HATE lol
