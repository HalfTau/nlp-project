Having fun with this game... been playing 70 hrs and there so much sidequest left to finish and map to explore. Im glad that they change the fighting mechanics in this game and the graphics are outstanding... If youre a long lost fan of AC franchise youll gonna love it. and ill recommend this also for the new ones. two thumbs up!
