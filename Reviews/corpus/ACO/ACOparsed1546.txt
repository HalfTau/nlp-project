Like many others, Ive played this franchise since its first iteration. However, I eventually stopped around Rogue, skipping Unity and Syndicate, having grown a little jaded with the series. I bought this game on sale, but unfortunately could not play it for long before getting motion sick. Thus, I had it refunded.In how little I saw of the game about 2 hours though, I cannot in good conscience, recommend it. I tried The Division during its free weekend another Ubisoft title and saw a lot of unfortunate similarities, e.g. character levels, item rarities, repetitve missions. While the world of AC O is expansive, detailed, and quite beautiful, this focus on character improvement and Dark Soulsesque combat detracts from the core AC experience imo.AC to me is a franchise about story, a powerful protagonist that begins powerful and acquires tools, or skills later on. Not being tied down to levels, with a beautifully realised historical backdrop. AC O however only has the backdrop. I did not enjoy the thought of having to grind for levels to tackle basic enemies later in the game 5 levels higher than myself or looting mountains of chests containing mediocre rubbish in the hope of getting a legendary weapon.No. It is my opinion that while many may see this as refreshing, and a modern reimagining of the franchise. I think Ubisoft might have taken it too far in giving it the numbers treatment. Where everything is reduced to a game of numbers levels/DPS, and deeper combat without the flair or elegance of past titles.
