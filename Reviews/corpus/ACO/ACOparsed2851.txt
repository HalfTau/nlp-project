As a Veteran of the Assassins Creed series, this may be my favorite in the series. The world is massive and full of content, the combat is really fun and flowing, the gladiator battles are amazing, you get to fly aroung as abird, and the story is really good, especially if your an ac veteran like me. well worth the money.the only bad thing I experienced is poor performance, i occasionally get fps dips for a minute or so and it goes back to normal and is doesnt always run at 60fps when my computer should be able tor5 1600/16 GB/1070
