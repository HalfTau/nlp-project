Its an epic game, riddled with bugs, forced arena combat that doesnt allow you to choose your own equipment what kind of  invented that? Kensa can fight using a bow but you cant? and pay2win in singleplayer games low value microDLC, just like Bethesdas paid mods initiative.Cons and issues forced combat scenes and arena fights that dont let you use your own weapons instead of ubisofts crap no map filters by category shops, camps, etc. no individual HUD/GUI settings there are only presets forced photo mode what the hell that is not turned off by default Photo Mode is off in the options but community photos still show up as the first filter and prevent painless fasttravel, no, the feature is not the problem, the real issue is you cant switch it off utterly and permanently without always filtering the map, and yes, the photo blips were blocking fast travel points had to hover out and over to fasttravel forced social/pseudomultiplayer that cant be safely opted out still very buggy, just not buggy like AC Unity was, just buggy in its own way, assassination prompts are worst when sometimes they dont trigger at all in the bushes when not moving at all moving while hidden helps it trigger, loot appears below the ground making it irretrieveable, even one instance of a captain vanishing into thin air probably died from rebels in the area, which didnt count as a kill, or something else arrows are gone in theboss fight, reloading last objective doesnt help thanks to the  ubisoft team who cant reset the scene and the goddamn ammo, and naturally cant be aborted either as it is a main storyline quest which should be retractable nonetheless  yes, if you play on Hard, an empty quiver on desync is a serious handicap being on fire on a ship not a boat kills you in less than 2 seconds must be a bug, on land it takes a fair deal more than a few seconds wanna be op? you can be a pro sucker and feed the pig aka give ubisoft money to gain skills, when the game was already paid for, which only feeds the monster and encourages it to violate real gaming the one without money wasters aka time savers more and inciting ubisoft to cut out more content on launch than before no way to equip and customise aya the game lacks minor, miscellaneous quests and storysupported assassination contracts, that sort of thing, in addition to side quests. Like Witcher Contracts in Witcher 3, which were properly embedded in the story wellnarrated the RPG system is not halfbaked but is not quite fullbaked either, cant buy back items, cant craft weapons and armour only some utilities/improvements levels the parkour system is a little weird compared to recent AC games and takes a bit to get used to, running was tweaked too much no mods or moddability or mod SDK, as always, so no surprise here other issues such as loot casually disappears after death, cant complete objectives carrying a rescued person on your mount, sometimes it makes sense to put them down on some bedroll, but sometimes it doesnt make sense at all and the quest stage should be autocompleted just fine even when riding with that other person mounted not dismountedNah, the above bugs are not insignificant bugs or glitches such as animals standing vertical the wrong way like they occasionally do. They are gameplaybreaking bugs, however small or annoying.The setting, Egypt, is beautiful, the world is huge, music enchanting, the combat fluid and graceful, and the RPG system and an adequate amount of side quests is a rather welcome change makes the game longer and enriches it in a few ways, gives a reason to collect all those meaningless trinkets and complete the game, well, completely. Its like Black Flag, gameplay is expanded, this time with side quests, and more indepth exploration is demanded to gain good loot and XP.Cant miss buying property and making a profit on it, it was cool, but it was gamebreaking, you could get all the equipment without even trying. AC Origins forces you to raid tombs, explore locations, wreak a fiery havoc on military camps. Cant say its an AC game or not an AC game, every AC game seems to undergo a heavy experimentation process, and almost no two AC games are identical to date. Well, maybe except for Brotherhood and Revelations, and Black Flag and Rogue, which shared almost every game mechanic, in quite the same way.Whats that about pay2win? Supposedly its only singleplayer so it does not harm other players like in MMO games, but just to calculate it for you59.99 a game that contains thousands of animated models, textures, sounds, hundreds of 2D art pieces and voices and dialogues, a full ingame soundtrack around 5070 hours worth of one single walkthrough playtime a little overquests tens of outfits, tens of mounts, hundreds of weapons, tens of shields9.99  1000 helix points  two legendary outfits34.99  4750 helix points  19 legendary weapons by the by only 4600 helix credits can be bought with 34.99 so you have to buy the 49.99 7400 Hpts pack to be able to buy them or get them via Packs/bundles, NB got all legendary weapons here without buying a single helix pack and yeah, 34.99 is a price of a good AAA game that went on sale or is not freshly released anymore, or 2 or 3 awesome indie games, or one or two big expansion packs and yes, all of this comes from a hypocrite who spent over or around 1000 on Lineage II and regretted it later. Normal pay2win is harmful to other players, while this singleplayer p2w not only harms your wallet but also threatens future game development when they start to cut out more and more content out of the game for sale in the store, and not a legit, full, big expansion pack.In the end, ness and greediness of ubioft aka abtergo knows no bounds. Extremely enjoyable game. Insufferable company.PS Will not mention PC DRM, it was already noted by other reviewers, and theres no need to echo them. Cant confirm either, there were no issues here on crappy GTX 970, i7 4790k, 32 GB RAM and Windows 7, although it crashes after exiting, relaunching and loading game if any other pcheavy software such as a web browser was used inbetween, as Win 7 sucks at freeing up used up resources. 3060 FPS here on ultra settings.
