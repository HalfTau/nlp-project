So far its really fun! The detail and size of the game world is amazing, I feel like Im in a pixar movie the graphics are so good, and the animations are very fluid. Story is good so far, although im only 7 hours in. The side quests are pretty interesting not just some random filler like in some other games.People have been compaining about performance issues, well I initially had some microstuttering even with high frame rates, as well as some big drops but heres what seemed to work for meDisable hyperthreading/cpu virtualization in BIOSMoved to a SSDCapped frames at 45 fps / Vsync ONIm running a FX 8320e, 16 gb RAM and a GTX 1080, windows 10, havent had any stutters since I changed those settings running most settings maxed, antialasising low and 1440p.
