After nearly 100 hour in this game, i can say i am totaly stunned.I did never expected a publisher could do such a good work, after messing up a hole game serie.But actually they did turn arround and focused on the strong points of Assassins Creed.First of all they show an amazing world. The view is great and you have the feeling to be really back in time.You do not have to go to towers anymore to see whats arround you, you only need to go to these places to fast travel.The game gives you the option to finish it in different ways.You want to fight against 20 enemies sure, or no one should see you also possible, or you let your enemies fight themselfs no problems.I needed these 90 hours to actually use all option of fighting in this game.And when i talk about fighting they make it so much better than this parry conter thing before.The side missions are often the same but somehow they managed, that you never get the feeling they are.So to put all together. This game brings nothing new, but put all good things together what an open world game should do and is pulling out the best out of this.I can not wait for the DLCs to come and to see if they keep up with this great work or not, the future will show.I say get the game and see it yourself, i am sure its worse the price and ofcause even more worse it on sale  .
