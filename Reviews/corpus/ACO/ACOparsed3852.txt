In Assassins Creed I and II they gave us an open world limited by the technology of their age, and a core group of gameplay mechanics. In Brotherhood and Revelations they restricted their open world to just one rich, culturally and geographically diverse location, choosing to make it larger and more immersive instead of giving multiple locations. In Assassins Creed III they pushed new limits and tested new ideas, like an assassin in the outdoors, hunting, in depth crafting, and naval mechanics. In Black Flag they took the best of those ideas and crafted them into a massive, seamless open world held together by the sea itself. In Rogue they gave us a new setting, with a new perspective on a story we never really got to know. In Unity and Syndicate they again pushed new limits and tested new ideas, bringing back old ideas in a grand experimentation. In Assassins Creed Origins they accomplish what theyve been working toward for years a true, completely immersive, open world experience driven by a rich narrative and held together by the sea of the desert. There is rich diversity culturally, geographically, and even in the enemies you face, the wildlife you encounter, and the missions you go on. No more grinding more of the same in a stale universe. There is wonder in this game. Even after beating it in a week, putting more hours into this game in seven days than I have into school all semster, there is still more for me to do. More for me to explore, and I plan on going to find it all, because it is deeply rewarding.Side Note I have not spent any money on the microtransactions that are offered to the people who want them. The game is 100 playable and complete without paying for anything extra, and that is a wonderous miracle in itself in this day and age.
