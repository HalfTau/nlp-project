All I will say is I was one of those who looked upon Assassin Creed games in a negative light previously. Now this is my new obsession. It has its flaws sure, but if you want a ticket to ancient Egypt and to see it in all its glory this is definitely the right game.The mechanics are fun.The story is excellent.The visuals are insane.Why are you still reading this?
