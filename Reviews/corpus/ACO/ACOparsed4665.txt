So far the game within its self is amazing.Good voice acting, graphics and combat but there are some performance issues. For whatever reason this game is using 100 percent of both my CPU and GPU which it should not be doing. But besides the performance issues the game itself is a masterpiece.Edit  Just beat the game for me the best assassins creed game out of the entire series.If you look at the vastness of the world, you realize something...I am but a grain of sand, but I am part of it all.
