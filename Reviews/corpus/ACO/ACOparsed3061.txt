It took me 50 hours to finish the main quest and a lot of but not all of the side content, and I can say that this is my favorite Assassins Creed game in a long time. The world building is fantastic. The way the map is organized, the little details everywhere its very impressing. Not all areas are on the same level, but when everything clicks like in Alexandria it really feels like a organic living world. It just have something more than the other games of series, where the world were great to look at, but less fun to play on.Stealth needs improvement, but most of all of the other changes are for the better. Combat is way more enjoyable, and the loss of several gamey elements helps a lot with the immersion. Gone are the minimap just a compass on the top, detective mode eagle vision, instafail on detection, bonus objectives like kill 5 guards from the ledge, glowing orbs to collect, and so on. Once I got out of my  mindset of the previous games and stopped trying to go 100 stealth and just let the game flow on its own, I found the loss of all these elements actually helped my enjoy a lot more the game greatest strength its world.The weakest aspect is its writing. The side quests try to emulate the Witcher 3 model of populating the world with contextgiving stories, but with a few exceptions just arent as clever, and as a result you see the repetition in the mechanics a lot more clearer. They are still leagues better than any of previous game in this series, and in fact than any of recent open world games I played havent played Horizon, but didnt quite get to where they were aiming for. The main plot also gets really lost in the end, and while a little better, Ubisoft still doesnt know that to do with the modern era stuff.It should also be noted that the traversal in this game is very good. Climbing almost everything without getting stuck, riding horses, or using the follow the road command then switching to your eagle to enjoy the view everything just feels nice.
