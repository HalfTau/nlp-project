First off, Its not necessarily a bad game, However there are some caveats Overlooking the terrible preformance on a high end machine, the game is essentially a beautiful open world with no life and a shoddy combat system. I much prefer the old combat system that made you feel like a badass as opposed to this crappy lock on combat reminiscent of zelda. If you prefer busy work RPGs and a more arcadey combat experience than you will definitely love this game as the RPG elements seem to be fleshed out.Overall, not my preference of game but it seems to be a pretty packed experience for those who enjoy this type of RPG.
