I just beat this game and it one of the better assassins creeds that ive played. Its a lot of fun doing the main missions and even the side missions are fun. I really enjoyed the way they incorporated the tombs and the pyrimids. For this being a game based in a desert which is a pretty boring setting, but they made it look amazing especially next to the nile river with the foliage. Overall the game is great! And looks beautiful too.
