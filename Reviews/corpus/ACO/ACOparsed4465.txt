Vivid historiacal characters Cleopatra, Caesar... and deities Amun, Horus.... Stunning scenery. Intense combats. The assassinating system did change somehow level barriers are really hard to get over..., but think about it this is 49 B.C., the creed had just formed. Sometimes fightings are necessary instead of just assassinating all the time. Youll see how the first people of the creed gathered and learnt their ways of doing things.The setting is Ptolemaic Dynasty  almost the end of ancient Egypt, which means that tombs of real pharaohs or officials throughout the ancient Egypt calendar, from Djoser to Smenkhkare, remain for you to explore. And these tombs are welldetailed, with hieroglyphic texts fortunately Bayek knows how to read those lol, grave goods, mummies, and the four pots holding the organs... Have you ever wanted to dig into the three Pyramids in Giza? Or to get inside the Great Sphinx? Or to witness the mummification process? This is the game that can realize your wish. Youll even have the chance to face the deities themselves  Anubis, Sekhmet, Sobek, and so on  and get their theme outfits.Okay this is not a Tomb Raider review but again most of these are real tombs existing or existed so besides that, great protray of famous cities  Alexandria, Memphis, Krokodilopolis... Also great portray of peoples struggle in this time period, of Egyptians anger and complaints about the invading Greek/Roman culture. Peoples everyday lives are simulated really well under the day and night system over this huge openworld map of Egypt.Overall, a mustplay for AC fans and for those who are into ancient Egyptian culture/mythology. Ive played over 60 hours and this game still keeps giving me new surprises.
