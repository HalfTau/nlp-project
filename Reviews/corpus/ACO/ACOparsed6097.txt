I had vertigo climbing the Great Lighthouse. Seriously. It felt it was real. I never felt vertigo this way before. On top of that, you can climb mountains, every single rock. Tame kitties. Oh, the shadows. OMG HDR has come.Run flawlessy with a RX480 very high 2.5k with AMD optimization. Superb. Storyline seems great also, AI could be tuffer on HARD pnly minor hiccup. Also riding in AUTO mode let you enjoy SENU scouting in birdview while on the move.14 kilometers map height.... althought in real world scale those would be 1400 km... its huge...
