Pros bigggest map in the series. played over 25 hours and still havent done half the mapbeautiful scenery they really outidid themselves with the open world in this one great loot system reminscent of destiny imono bs opening tutorial or growing up phasenaval missions are still in iteagle vision is dopeConsnot enough killmoves feels extremely lazyno sprint button you just always sprint feels too weird and slow after having one for like 8 gamesway too many of the same reused character models even compared to the older gamesthe same bugs that have been in assassins creed for years are still presentthe lack of decent robes. i get its being culturally accurate but the hoods and robes are what made the  assasins creed characterthe story kinda suckedalthough i dont like what they did to combat in the game, the rest of the game is just great. it still has its repetive bs known as assasins creed and the bugs to follow it but hey what do you expect from ubisoft.8.5/10 woulda gave it a ten out of ten if they put more work into the kill moves and didnt jsut resuse the same 2 for each weapon type.
