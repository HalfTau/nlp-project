Apparently the game is great! i wouldnt know as despite having a good quality gaming PC the game crashes and glitches the second i attempt to start campaign, the main menu works atleast. apparently this is due to the insane anti piracy techniques the devs have implemented meaning my pc is tanking just to run it never mind start any actual gameplay. The loading screen is kind of pretty at least.
