So recently there is a lot of hate for this game in the reviews but honestly at least for my setup it runs perfectly smooth no hickups, no problems. If you have a similar specced system this game might be for you, if not lets hope Ubisoft fixes the issues people are having with DRM.SystemAMD Ryzen 7 1700XNvidia GTX 1080 TiSamsung 960 Evo NVMe PCIe M.2Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3000 C15 2x8GBFramerates are between 42 and 67 FPS in 4K with max settings except AA.This game is captivating and my god does it look gorgeous! The fighting is a bit dull and very easy even on hard difficulty but the story is well written, the dialogues are good and voice acting is decent. I am not really into the franchise and only ever owned one Assasins Creed game before this one but this was very much worth the 60 Bucks.
