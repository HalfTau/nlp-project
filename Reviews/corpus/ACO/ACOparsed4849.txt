After playing AC1 and AC2, I was a fanatic of the series. However, I lost a lot of faith after unity and syndicate, so I was extremely skeptical of this game. I even set a timer for two hours to fit into the return window because I was expecting to not like this game. Boy, was I wrong.The good...Absolutely stunning visuals. The world is so completely designed, its a living, breathing world. I disliked the pseudo open world feeling in the old games when youd be in a city then suddenly the animus walls prohibit you from going down a certain street. Not anymore  the map is HUGE. So far you dont need to travel via loading screen to any regions, you can ride your horse from any part of the entire map to another without the need for a loading screen although its way faster to fast travel.Nice difficulty of combat. Combat isnt as hopelessly impossible as Unity, but youre not going to mow down 20 people with ease like in black flag either.Combat is also much more fluidFree running is fluid. I havent had any issues so far of it being too sticky like some of the previous games.Bayek is a welldeveloped, interesting character thus farI think the birds name is Semu? Theres a bird that is very useful and a welcome addition to the AC series. Obviously borrowed from Far Cry, however.The bad...75 cpu useage? Ubisoft is literally the only developer that pushes my cpu that far.They got rid of those popups that tell you about historic landmarks that you happen to wander pastThe game takes such a long time to loadThe ugly...Ubisoft never fails to have such expensive ingame purchases. Compare ubi to CD Projekt Red, who gives SO MUCH DLC for FREE. Ubisoft disgusts me with their lust for money.
