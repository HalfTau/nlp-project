PERFORMANCE i7 6600k at 4.6ghz and a 1060 6gb, runs at 60fps stable on an ultrawide 1080p monitor, some drops but very rare and never below 30fps.GRAPHICS Holy bejesus this game is friggin gorgeous.GAMEPLAY Combat is accessible but deep enough to be mastered. World is stupid massive and FULL of stuff to do. Have encountered zero bugs in 30 hours, movement is smooth, climing feels natural.STORY IF you decide to watch the cinematics and really pay attention, than there is a good story here. IF you skip the cinematics ... than you clearly dont care about story. The best part here is that the RPG style gameplay allows for side stories that are fantastic. Everything from hunting hippos to rescueing someones daughter from slavers, lots of fun and heart.MICROTRANSACTIONS Entirely optional. Seriously, why do people complain when a game does it RIGHT. You cant pay to win here, the ONLY one worth buying is the map of tomb and circle stone locations. Even without that you can simply google the locations, so why complain.
