First review Ive done So lets dive inI did a good amount of research on the game. It looks great and plays nicely but CPU optimization is absolutely trash. Im average 2235 fps on all resolutions and display settings. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR USED TO ANYTHING OVER 40 FPS.Or untill they fix the issue somehow. But serously im gonna wait 10 days and if its not better im going to go for a refund. Never thought Id actually say this but this game is literally unplayable.Specs Win7, r9 390, FX8350 Oced at 4.3. 1800nobueno
