This, in all honesty, is THE BEST AC game ever made. It takes aspects of all the games, then adds ones from other good Ubisoft titles like GRWildlands and Far Cry Primal/4... then adds totally new things that in ways remind me of The Witcher 3. Its hard to explain but this is one game I absolutely recommend buying... even at full price its well worth it...GTX1070  i77700k crush it at maxed settings 1080p, and its one of the best looking games Ive ever seen and smooth for Ubisoft.If you still need convincing, you can battle on a camel that has cruise control and selfdriving no input required, ful aiming/melee capable to a custom waypoint... while looting what you kill without getting off Joe camel.
