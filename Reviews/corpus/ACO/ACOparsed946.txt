the game is incredible. I feel like they took the best part of every game ubisoft have created and mashed them into one. But like every ubisoft game theres technical issues the game crash like I never seen a game crash and freeze before... I got a good pc, the specs are way over the recommended system requirement. I did every tricks in  the book trying to fix it and nothing works, hopefully ubisoft wont take 3 months to release a decent patch..
