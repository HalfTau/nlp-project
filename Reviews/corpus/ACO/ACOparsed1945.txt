Sigh The game is overall average except the for the graphics, they were increadible. The story was lazy and terrible, most of the things that happened was just lazy writing, and doesnt show much of the Origins Stealth was okay but had its issues. As for combat, oh boy, the idea was great but it was just terrible, Bayek doesnt lunge and it gets really frustrating since NPCs can just keep walking backwards and you cant hit them, and if you hit an enemy as hes about to hit you he doesnt flinch which is super annoying since most games like dark souls do flinch. At the end I just wanted to finish the game to be over with it, and the reason why I dont recommend it is that Im a huge AC fan or was and was super excited to see the origins of it all, and what I got out of this was really dissapointing. I was expecting a great story how it all began like how they made the hidden blade or what was the idea behind their assassin symbol, and who wrote down the rules and stuff.
