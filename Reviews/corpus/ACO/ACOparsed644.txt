This game is a must buy if you guys were tired having the same experience again  again! It just has content for over 100 Hours  is so much fun! There wont be a single moment where you are not progressing because you will be ADDICTED to the games leveling system! And the story takes a really good turn towards the end which turns out that it ISNT THE END!And it just kept me going for more! The OUTFITS in the game are good enough but my only concern is GIVE US ALL THE LEGACY OUTFITS FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS GAMES!The weapon and fighting system is awesome  using the BOW is just such smooth!MISSIONS  SIDE QUESTS are very UNIQUE in their own way and play major role in the game!UBISOFT If you are reading this just give us ALL the LEGACY OUTFITS including AGUILARS OUTFIT in the Uplay Rewards because TWICH PRIME ISNT AVAILABLE in all COUNTRIES.I RECOMMEND THIS GAME HIGHLY TO EVEN THE ONES WHO HAVE NEVER PLAYED AN AC GAME  I cant wait to look forward to the next game.UBISOFT, take your time for the next one in the series but please GIVE us all the LEGACY OUTFITS  WEAPONS from the previous games in the series.Go Ahead! youre gonna spend 100 hours on this one without a single boring moment.
