I have spent almost 20 hours so far in the game and i will say i have played AC1, AC2,Part of  AC3, And AC black Flag. With that said i am loving this chapter of the game so far it is amazing. The world of Origins is so beautiful and very nice to run around in or ride on your horse/camel it feels great. The movement did take me some time to get used to took me way to long to learn how to go down stairs or decend But i finally got it figured out and it is nice.The weapons in the game feel great with the leveling system and upgrading so if you like a particular weapon you can upgrade when the time feels right so you can do proper damage.The side quest are fun and enjoyable some people would say as they always do things are repetitive But it is a game and with games this is a main focus from shooters to MMOs you are always doing what the game offers so this is not even a valid concern in my opinion.The combat feels good and can be brutal when you decide to go rambo on them and have 510 enemies going at you the game will make you rethink and use strategy to accomplish things not brute force.The story and voice acting is great so far and very well done i have felt that i am taken back to a place in time i have always wondered what it would be like to see and experience. The world and acting and everything together does this nicely.You have to upgrade certain things as health and melee damage and range damage accordingly to what suits you. Overall this has been one of the best single player experiences i have had in a game and i am just starting it seems and i have put 20 hours in already. The content is put together nicely. I only have the base version of the game and even with this only i have had nothing but a positive experience.I personally have not run into any bugs or problems with performance though with the world it presents it should take a good medium spec computer to run.All in all i think this game is a A and glad to have had the chance to play it, it really is a rare jewel.
