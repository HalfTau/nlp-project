I dont feel like as much like an assassin in this. BUT THAT IS OKAY! I am technically not an assassin. I am a Medjay, I help the people. And I really feel like I do, especially when it comes to side quests with fleshed out cut scenes to make them feel important and give closure. I have yet to feel like a sidequest was just a mindless grind.I feel like Bayek actually has character/charisma we havent seen since Ezio along with strong voice acting.The open world is phenomenal and the screenshot system is absolutely addicting to use.The new combat system actually makes me feel like i have  to be engaged instead of just waiting around mindlessly.Overall the game is a 9/10 purchase when its 40 dollars and youll enjoy it. As long as your not too nostalgic on AC1 and AC2 expectations.
