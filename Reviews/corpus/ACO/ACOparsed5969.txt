If you just annoy the everloving  out of the ingame currency you buy with real money, the game is dope. The combat, the missions, the looting system, and basically everything is better than any other AC game to date in my opinion unless you REALLY like pirates. Im having some technical issues personally Sound not synching to video, but I think Ill figure it out by messing around in the settings and its more on my end than the game.
