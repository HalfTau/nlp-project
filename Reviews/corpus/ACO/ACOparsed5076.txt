Ive only put 5 hours into the game so far but from my point of view I find this to be the best assassins creed with the exception of black flag. This installment is definitely better then prior games which were very disappointing to say the least... looking at you Syndicate... and as far as performance goes Im at 1440p and on the ultra settings Im getting 90ish fps with dips into the 80s at 1080p however its smooth as butter, the cutscenes are the only place I see any stutter at all. All in all a very refreshing assassins creed game to say the least.
