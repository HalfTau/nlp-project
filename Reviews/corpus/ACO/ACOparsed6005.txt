Game is ruined and unplayable the way one would like , by the game controls,its not possible to run ,running is automatic you cant run when you need to ,it takes very long time to travel anywhere on foot or even a mount ,there is no freedom of movement....it will take years to finish the game if you would like to fully explore it.
