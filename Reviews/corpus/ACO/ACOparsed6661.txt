Looks nice, 1440p maxed ultra settings runs 60100fps, average around 74. The game looks great and runs decent. However its initial release has a sound hang in cutscenes that sound like driver hangs on windows lmao. Also laggy cutscenes. Surely the day1 patch will fix this. The intro is a bit unclear, who you are isnt but exactly what you are doing and why you are fighting is.ProsGreat landscapesImproved freedom controlslively environmentdetailed lives of the people, irrigation systems and hunting/wildlifei love the avenge missions, like Shadow of War where you can avenge friends and find their killers.public screenshots appear on the map, but nonintrusivelySubtle things that work that you dont notice. On the map location names become visible and fade.Chained sidequests that can sometimes be really neat. For example, the sidequest Children of the streets, the victim you save wants you to continue helping by killing the perp. However she tells you to come back later. I followed her to get it, and she stopped at several places, inspecting the events of the quest before. Very interesting and something easily missed/overlooked that you would never know.Its the little things. Today I ran into 3 romans raising a dead guy on a crucifix. In the act. Pretty neat.ConsI expected the music to be better and more authentic.One speed for you and your horse. No running or galloping.I had hoped the pyramids would be a bit more intricate and interesting.I expected more authentic death traps and leverage puzzles.Finding your way in some underground areas were maddening. My most unpleasant experience with the game.
