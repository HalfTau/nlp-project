I struggle to recommend AC Origins or not. This game has an extremely high processor usage for no good reason.Just after starting the game, my Intel i7 4770K is at 40 usage and I havent even loaded my saved game! Once playing, the CPU increases up to 95 and is causing frequent dips in my framerate. Its infuriating.This is quite unfortunate because I thouroughly enjoyed the rest of the game. The main story is great and the side missions are very diverse and often quite interesting as well.As for the open world, it is goregeous and sometimes even breath taking.Its really a shame about the processor usage. Update Ive just built a new computer with an Intel i7 8700K reused my 1080 TI. CPU usage is at 35 in the menu after starting the game,  right before even loading a saved game. In game, its around 70 on average. Thats ridiculous.
