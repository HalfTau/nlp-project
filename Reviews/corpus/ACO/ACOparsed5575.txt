A breakthrough in the AC series. A breath of fresh air  FINALLYThis game is easily winning GOTY. Everything you could hope for in an Assassins Creed game set in Egypt, this game will deliver. I havent even done more than 3 main quests, and I am in love with the game. The detailing and visuals are seriously breath taking. Apply Reshade to this and you will stare at your screen with your eyes wide open. The crafting and progression system is well made and you really need to work youroff to be able to fight enemies who are beyond your level, else you stand no chance. Hunting is a lot of fun. Combat is completely different than previous titles, and will challenge you in the beginning, so practice hard to master it. Lots of loot scattered throughout Egypt makes you want to explore more and more. The developers have really put in a lot of effort in making this, which can be seen by anyone who appreciates the detail in this game.UPDATE With the latest patches, the performance has improved a bit, photo mode works without AA on which is awesome for Reshade users. This game is simply dope AF.Verdict MONEY WELL SPENT, FK YEA. BUY IT.
