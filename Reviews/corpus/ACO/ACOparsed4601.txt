I have such a love hate realtionship with this franchise, I love what Assassins Creed is, but I hate what Ubisoft has been doing to it.However I can tell you right now, this ones a real winner.It almost seems like the blag flag team has completely read my mind and addressed almost everything I hated about the old AC games. No more 90s collectathon gameplay. Secrets are no longer just stamped on your minimap just waiting for you to pick it up. This game actually expects you to explore and look for these things on your own, with some items giving riddles that lead you on to possible sidequests. FINALLY The long awaited move away from the batman counter combat. It feels a little floaty, and its not quite there yet, but its such a huge leap in the right direction. Sidemissions are FINALLY induvidual and varied. THANK GOD.There are some fps drops regardless of what settings your on. This game needs a CPU optimization patch, other than that its still a beautiful open world with a lot to do. Honestly, for the most part, this game is really good mostly because it borrows heavily on the best from other popular games, but its leaps and bounds better than what has been going on. I can only hope AC continues to go down this path.
