Im not going to make a lengthy review. Graphics are amazing, even on medium because any higher and my current computer would burst into flames. The music is pretty great as well, really fits into the assassins creed mantra and time period. Story while Im not yet finished the main line is very well done in my opinion, love the characters both main and secondary. The open world is very large for an Assassins Creed game. Like, really large IMO.Ive described this installment as Skyrim but Assassins Creed.Really hope they stay down this path from now on
