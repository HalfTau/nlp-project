Unbelievably vast and detailed open world with a pretty good story and some memorable side quests. The Witcher 3 is the best comparison Id give this game, and that is the ultimate compliment since thats my favorite game of all time. Its not quite on that level, but its pretty close. Theyre also supporting the game with new content regularly which is awesome.
