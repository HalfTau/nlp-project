Great games so Im 42 hours in and havent finished the main story yet. There are a ton of interesting side quests to do. My only gripe with the game is that the horse running is too slow, it should be like how it was in red dead redemption. But other a great games and for those who say its not assassins creed anymore, after maybe 5 or 6 hours in the game youll see that all the great elements are still there.
