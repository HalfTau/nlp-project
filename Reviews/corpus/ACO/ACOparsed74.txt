This game is incredible, everything you want in a game like this. Beautiful game, amazing story, good job explaining everything through out the game. Its like taking a history class on Egypt but youre playing a beautifully made game and enjoying every second. I also like the aspect that you have to grind some side quests so you can get all the things you want that lets you explore every beautiful place they made. Overall, amazing game that is very well done.
