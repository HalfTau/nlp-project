Its way more fun than what seems. They really learnt from Witcher 3 on how to make a better game. There are some minor stuttering on cut scenes, but the overall FPS counter is on average 60.It may seem its not really a AC game anymore, but it feels right.The combat is a bit dodgy, there are times you can kill 30 people but then there are times 2 people can destroy you.I finished the game on Nightmare in 70 hours doing all the quests, side quests  main quests  approximately 120 quests, toward the end I was bored of the side quests.Some of the side quests are really good, like solving murders, but some get really boring and repeatitive.Overall the game looks beatifull, runs alright, amazing story and I think it saves the franchise.
