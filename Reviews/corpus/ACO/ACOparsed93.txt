This game is one of the best games I have ever played. Far better than any of the other Assassins Creed games. The story and side quests are very detailed. The graphics are FAR superior to anything I have played in a long time and make the game very immersive.  This must have taken a lot time and very talented people to make. If I could give it 110 I would.KUDOS
