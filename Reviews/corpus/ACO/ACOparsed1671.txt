One of the oldest yet best story driven game franchises within the gaming industry. A great franchise with a huge influence over other games and with an original story driven setting Assassins creed. After the launch and huge success of ACII the game has had a lot of successful title releases however, in recent years Assassins Creed failed to show gamers that their franchise is still the best story driven series within the respected genre. That is until Assassins Creed Origins drops and it is insanely good. It almost brings the vibes from what you felt in ACII.Personally, one of my favourite gaming franchises a long with other several Rockstar and Bethesda games. I cant play single player games since they bore me however, with Assassins Creed I can always make time for. Assassins Creed Origins deserves a top 3 in my favourite AC games.I hope you enjoyed my quick review of Assassins Creed Origins. I highly recommend getting this game as Ubisoft did a great job reviving the series after a few recent flops. This game is very addicted and immersive. It gives an insane insight to how the creed was formed and how Egyptian life was as well a bit of the Roman and greek life within Egypt. It teaches you more than what you history teacher could ever teach you. You will come out with more knowledge as well as hours of gameplay. I cant wait for the next game for the series.
