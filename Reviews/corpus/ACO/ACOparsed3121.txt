Exits my expectation. The open world style of the game removing of multiple loading screens is really great. The game itself is beautiful and the gameplay is a lot smoother than previous AC releases which were filled with bugs in the earlier period of the release. I have yet to run into any game stopping bugs.The controls on the PC are still quite awkward.
