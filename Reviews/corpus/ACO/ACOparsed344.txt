After enjoying this game for a relative good amount of time and reaching a level of 45 notbragging i defenetly recomend this game. First off the controlls will feel a bit wierd atleast so it was for me i got used to it very quickly after starting. The experience of the freedome while roaming in Egypt is just amazing there is so much to see that i havent even completed all the side tasks. Maybe for some the fighting mechanism will feel a bit wierd at first but when you aquire the amazing perks avalible its really fun to go into a camp and slay a bunch och enemys and animals. Afterall the best part of the game is the main quests you assasinating all the characters and fighting against egyptian god e.g Anubis. There is one negative side though and that is that for the map expansions/dlcs you need to purchase a season pass and this i have never been a fan of but if you have an extra 90 dollars laying around in you bank account this is not a waste at all What i mean is that you defenatly get more than what you pay for there is so much to explore and do in this game, you defenetly should consider in purchasing this game.
