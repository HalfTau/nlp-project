Good game but the performance can be better, 7/10 experience.Using a GTX 1050 Ti and an i7 7700HQ on 1080p with tuned settings grants me an overall 45 FPS on the wilderness but it will dip into 30 or less in a heavy populated area which is good because its over 30, but could be better if it can be optimized to run 60 fps with tuned settings.One bugs that still havent been optimized is sometimes NPC wont load its high res mesh resulting in faceless low poly NPC.And if Ubisoft can remove the Denuvo DRM  its cracked anyway  or upgrade the denuvo version  to prevent future version cracks  it will be amazing for legal game buyer
