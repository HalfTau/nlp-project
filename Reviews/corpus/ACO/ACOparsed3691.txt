Really fun. There is a lot to do and you can put many of hours into this game. Really big map and beautiful visuals. I havent had any problems with my frame rate or other graphical bugs.I like the new combat system, it gets rid of the block and counter until everyone is dead fighting.There are lots of weapons, shields, and outfits, and you dont have to worry about your favorite weapon or shield becoming obsolete because you can pay gold to bring them up to your current level.If I could give one piece of advice for anyone playing the game, it would be to not use poison weapons on the streets when there are civilians around. It will essentially create a big cloud of death that gets bigger every time it kills someone. If this happens, quitting to title screen and going back in will get rid of the poisonous bodies.A couple of minor bugs I would like to see fixed areThese are about the only things Ive noticed that could use fixing, the rest of the game is bugfree as far as I can tell.
