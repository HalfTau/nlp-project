This is by far the best addition to the AC franchise, since AC Brotherhood. Love the gameplay overhaul and the npc mechanics in the game.With every good game there are some flaws or drawbacks, namely the use of two DRM softwares, i.e. Denuvo and VM Protect, which hampers the CPU performance, with usage exceeding towards 100 CPU usage.I highly request Ubisoft to remove VM Protect, if not Denuvo, with their future updates.
