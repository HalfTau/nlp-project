Im not one to write reviews on games much, but as a long fan and player of the Assassins Creed series, this one nudged me to do so also mild spoilers ahead.I figure Ill start with some of the stuff I didnt really likeThe combat system, while most praised it, Im kind of disappointed with.  Theyve been dumbing it down a bit over the years for new players every release, but personally Ill forever prefer the combat system of the Ezio era of games, where you could lay down a body pile of dozens of soldiers via well timed parrys and instant hiddenblade deaths lol.  That was a combat system that made you feel like a true assassin of sorts.The open world is somewhat too open, there are a few zones that otherwise seem to literally have nothing in them, but Im not letting this directly impact my consideration of the game because I realize they may likely be populated later on via DLCs perhaps, but its worth noting just in case.The Dialogue can be very involved at times, yet at other times insanely lacking.  There are situations in this game, much like previous ones, where the character youre playing at otherwise comes across stuff that defies all reality of the time period, yet Bayek doesnt even comment on them, at all except one mainquest driven event, but even then the dialogue is catered to an awe of never having seen such stuff before, which is very awkward if you have indeed done those locations and very much seen things like them.A tiny nitpick as itll probably be patched at some point, but mission AI can be goofy sometimes.  When on escort missions, sometimes the target youre following will basically wander around in a search mode if you get into combat, as if theyre hunting for someone even if you had killed the target already that instigated them.The Parkour system has kinda been degrated much like the combat system.  While its still cool and nifty, theyve reduced a dramatic amount of the finecontrol you used to have, like precision leaping to where you want now it seems like leaping is largely locked to the closest 45 degreesplit direction youre facing which can lead you leaping to your death rather than into an eagle leap spot.  That said, you can seemingly climb a LOT more stuff in this game that you wouldnt expect to via pretty tiny cracks in the walls lol.Now for things that I loved, such as the little attention to detail on so many thingsCats walking up to you and rubbing up on your leg, to which you if you would crouch down, Bayek would literally.If youre in the middle of the water somewhere, nearby people in boats would literally come seemingly offering to give you a ride so you didnt have to swim all the way.The ability to light braziers and sconces just because why not?  Or to clear up all them nasty cobwebs with your torch by just throwing the torch at it lol.The beauty of the land scapes, which might sound weird for a world that is predominantly desert, but thecast upon by, let alone thewith all the torches lit and people walking around in the distance.Sandstorms are also an impressive thing, while I feel they could be a bit more impactful than just a, they can still look impressingas they roll upand valleys.The throwback to Black Flag withwas also fun, if short lived.  I wish there were more to be honest, or at least some sort of ocean missions you could trigger rather than them being limited to the main storyline.And of course there is the general deep plot/story itself outside of the main questline that is, while it kinda starts off weird and as noted above somewhat without any actual character response/reaction, as you find all the ancient sites, it starts to lay out what I feel is a probable basis for REALLY interesting stuff in future games, this for me is probably the main thing as despite all the buggy mechanics of previous games, I have always been very invested in the underlying story itself, and Origins definitely gives me a lot of theories about whats to come.Past that I know there are other things that I cant even remember, little details here and there which at the time definitely caught my attention for the effort put into them, Ill perhaps update this later if I recall them.
