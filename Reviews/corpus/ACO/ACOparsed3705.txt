In this game you play as Kiko Landry, the newest addition to the thief brotherhood. The game starts with Kiko yelling at his friends about how he hates them then he kills this noob named paul. you see paul was the leader of the league of dwarfs, the league of dwarfs objective is to enslave humanity and make them play no mans sky, you see If you share the same love for space as I do, not pay any attention to the negative reviews this game has recieved. Ever since I could remember, Ive loved space and the idea of space travel, ever since my parents bought me my first little pamphlet on astronomy I was hooked. This game gave to me what I could never achieve in my lifetime, and that is exploring an entire universe. No, not every planet is totatlly different. No, the game isnt very complete. That being said, what this game does provide is a first person experience at exploring the universe, something that has always fasinated me since I was a child. Nothing makes me happier than playing this game, the game looks beautiful, and though it isnt a very complete game, there is PLENTY of room to add on to, this game can only get better, shame on you if you refuse to play this game because a handful of people where expecting Space Minecraft and instead got a wonderful space exploration simulator. This game is a beautiful escape, thank you Hello Games for releasing what will be one of the greatest games ever made, Do not lose hope developers, if for noone else but yourself, finish what you started. Make this game what you REALLY wanted it to be. better climbing and combat 10/10
