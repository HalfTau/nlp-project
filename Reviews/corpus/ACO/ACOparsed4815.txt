Ubisoft should be proud.... I pay 60 for a game I expect it to run flawlessly. I have a 1200 Alienware laptop and this game is a lagging, slow, clusterf! Game stutters constantly, character cant move for 5 seconds without stuttering. This game uses so much CPU and makes my laptop ridiculously hot. Why do we keep letting Ubisoft get away with this?!?!
