Finally a true NEW Assassins Creed !!!! One of the best in the series thanks to release date year Technology, Graphics, animations etc. The game gives you a truly new system of RPG for AC series and its definetly good ! Its not the type of RPG in which you change items every 10 minutes of gamei have 12 hours and changed loadout about 5x only. The combat is actually very good, you have many types of weapons you have about 68 class of weapons, every class is diffrent and it is fast and enjoyable. The new RPG system brings a new system of quests too, quests are suprisingly enjoyable and some of them even very interesting and have some good back story. The landscape and world is very living IMO and the architecture is best in series IMO, the deserts, pyramides,cities etc etc....To the end i give this game 8/10 in my 12 hours
