A Masterpiece!I am an avid fan of Assassins creed franchise and after playing Assassins creed Black Flag,I really thought there wouldnt be a game that could beat it.Boy am I wrong,Assassins creed origins  presents you the privilege of being the, Medjay of egypt,you being the last of its kind.This game is handsdown one of the best games I have ever played,the exploration and side quest are equally as interesting as the main story quests.Even after you complete the main story ,there are lots of activities to do,that keep youaddition to that,ubisoft gives us daily quest and timed events where you can challenge gods of the egypt for legendary gear.The Graphics in this game is amazing and Ive spent hours loving the ancient egypt,taking photos of this beauty.This game is a must buy for all gamers.
