Its a killer game but ported terribly to PC standar Ubisoft. Might be ok on nvidea cards but if you have AMD just dont bother. Can run witcher 3 on ultra yet Origins is consistently below 30fps on lowest settings to the point where its unplayable. Cant recommend it when it wont even run even though I know its awesome haha
