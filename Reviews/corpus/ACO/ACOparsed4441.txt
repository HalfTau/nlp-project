I cannot begin to understand why a game would be released in 2017, and run so poorly on current generation hardware. The game runs suboptimal on an i77700k and a 1070. Every 10 seconds I was experiencing a frame rate dip and a stutter that just distracted me from the game.I cannot in good consience reccomend this game to anyone on the market right now. The Double dipping on the DRM will make this game push your CPU to its knees and come to a crawl.Please avoid until Ubisoft decides to patch/fix this game breaking issue.
