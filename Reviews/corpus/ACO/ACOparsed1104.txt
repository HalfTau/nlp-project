Straight to the review22 hrs right now, and i hope it less than half of the game. I expect so much more.Maybe this is the best assassins creed game after AC2 series and AC4 Blackflag. Unity was good but the story and characters are forgettable. Syndicate was good for first few hours, but it became so boring.I cant say about the storyline, because i havent complete the game. The characters maybe just okay. I havent see any significance development i hope i wont be bored like unity or syndicate. The battle is good, while it was rather different than AC games before. Rather challenging, even a common hyena sometimes manage to hit me if i was surrounded by 2 or more.But importantly, I was astonished by the beauty of the world, and thank god they made ingame photo mode! I spent hours just riding between the vast desert while adoring what i see. It was contemplating.
