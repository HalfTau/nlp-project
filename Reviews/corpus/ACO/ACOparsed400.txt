I have a unicorn. I am amused.I have loved assassins creed games since I first started playing them assassins creed 3. This one is just the next level of amazing. I love the hunting and interactive parts with the animals. The fact you can get a camel or a horse as your trusty steed but also that there is an ability to TAME ANIMALS. If you LOVE having a fellow companion to bring into fights as you explore the map, this is just a great feature, reminds me of Far Cry.Other things about it... I just love the story, Bayek of Siwa seeking revenge of those who caused his sons death. A loving but dangerous woman he is married to i think owo. And the two who continue the animus project in a hidden cave in a desert! Just amazing gameplay and even the weapons are amazing. I suggest any predator bow for extraaa accuracy!
