i have changed my negative review after some playing time and problem fixingafter some blog reasarch and suggestion i discover that the problem was that the gme was using the pc integrated memory instead of my nvdia geforce gtx 960after switching manually the setting the game run smoothly and without any problemtwo consideration1 this is the first time i have to manually tinkering with this kind of setting. no other AAA game gave me this problem2 really i have to look on the internet blog and other utents suggestions? why devolopement team isnt adressing this kind o problem publishing a fix? i see that is common problem with a quick search online,and that many pepole have the same issue.from a big company i pretend more effort in problem solving. it is a shame that utens must search online on their own on blogs way to fix a AAA game setting issuethat saidthe game is gorgeusthey have innovated the brand in many form, especially on the combat sistem no more similar o dark souls or the witcher. is this a good thing?yes and noyes because it is a wave of fresh air and innovation and it is really funny to useno because the levels of enemy sistem and the new combact stile put a strong action push to the game. the stealth part is still present but is less preponderant.and the bush stealth is ridiculous. funny to use but riiculousa full grown man cant  hide crouching in 5070 cm of tall wheat grass or bush from a 56 meter distant guard.especially if he moveit will be more realistic if immobility in bushes granted invisibility, forcing you to pay attention to when movingbut this is not the casethe widespread and positioning of bushes are so common hat you can easily kills entire outpost or area without ever exiting your bush camouflageit is broken in my opinionthat said the game for the setting, the graphic and the new mechanics is surely one of the most beautiful ac ever and a hell of gamestrongly reccomened
