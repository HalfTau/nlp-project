This is my favorite Assassins Creed game yet. However, its extremely buggy. Ubisoft is slow to fix gamebreaking bugs which makes it very hard to enjoy the game. In large areas, NPCs do not load in completely and remain as lowtextured model placeholders that cannot be interacted with. Sometimes they finish loading quickly, but most of the time it takes long enough to make you want to turn off the game.Ubisoft hit the nail on the head with this game, its just the bugs that are disappointing. No game should be THIS buggy months after release.
