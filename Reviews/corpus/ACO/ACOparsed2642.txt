This game follows a similar Ubisoft formula. In terms of leveling and base clearing its similar to Ghost Recon Wildlands and the Far Cry series. This to me is a good thing and is done well. The new looting aspect is a welcomed edition too. What I like most is the world you explore. Ancient Egypt is fascinating to wander around in and the developers built a world YOU wanted to be in. There are a few glitches and bugs, but nothing gamebreaking. This is a must own Assassins Creed.
