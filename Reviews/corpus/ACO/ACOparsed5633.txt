I friggin love this game. There are the technical issues, which arent that bad at all, but everything else is amazing. If they should improve anything, it should be the rpg aspect, but it does very well as is.I am also digging the archery in this game. I love a game with good archery and this one definitely has it. It feels good.If any AC game deserves multiplayer, it is this one. I wish so bad that there was a Ghost Reconlike coop. It would even work well with PVP too if they wanted to do it. Multiplayer in other AC games were dumb to me, but it would be cool for this one.I do wish there were more caves scattered about, but the map is huge so there is definitely plenty to do. When I say huge, I mean YUGE.The outfits look badass of course, however, I wish there was a little more to the outfitting. Like, I wish it was more like Elder Scrolls or the Witcher in that sense, but its not a big deal.I am a little bias on this game because I have been waiting for a gnarly Egypt setting since I played Spinx and the Cursed Mummy back in the day.Ubisoft, ya did good. Pat yerself on tha back there....then add COOP! Please!
