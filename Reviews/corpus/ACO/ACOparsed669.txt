I just finished the game, you can probably get it complete with 40 hours and a slow run of around 60 hours. I have no clue how long it would take to complete everything becasue the world is so full!If you enjoyed the other good Assassins Creed games such as Black Flag and Brotherhood then look forward to playing another game of the franchise that lives up to what everyone wanted out of it!Lots of hours, very immersive, great story, great side quests that really build the world around you and really strengthen your connection to the characters.My only ONLY! complaint is the fact that it didnt take brotherhoods mechanic of ordering Assassins around to kill people as like an extra thing after the main story finishes. Would have been cool.
