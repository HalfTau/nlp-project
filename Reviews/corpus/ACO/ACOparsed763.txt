This game is pretty fun to play. The Gameplay is fun, combat is pretty sweet, the RPGness.But when will the creators of Assassins Creed stop trying to push the  animus and its users on us? I for one have no interest whatsoever about Desmond, the other losers and Layla. Literally ruins the story. I would 100 prefer a legit story about history.Anyway. If you can stomach the phases with Layla, then this game is sweet.If anyone from the dev team happens to be reading this, please make a new game, leave Assassins Creed behind, but make a new game revolving around some point in history. No animus. No magic apple artifact. Combat and leveling in  Origins was fun, and should be revised and kept. End of rant.
