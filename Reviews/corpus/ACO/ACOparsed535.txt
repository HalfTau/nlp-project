cant say im a fan of this ac game seems very shiny and polished at first but as I have been playing ive noticed some odd things.driving a charoit on auto pilot and the charater riding with you is going overboard about how you are a driving god...walking around villagers, two or three of them will start saying the same line seperated by about half a second, that got old REAL FAST.WTH is up with the animal animations? horses fine, birds? fine anything else? camels look they have extra joints in their legs when they run, hippos look like they dont have any bones at all, they just kind of jitter towards you..I havent made to too far into the story as it just feels like work, Ugh have to go play more aco because i bought it.  But really this is the least entertaning plot so far out of an ac game.  at least outside the animus was interesting.upsidesclimbing works welldiving mechanics work fine, boats are a bit twitchy for my taste but workthe hawk pet works well and was a nice break from traveling by horse on auto pilot.
