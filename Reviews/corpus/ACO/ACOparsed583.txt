Exactly the change this series needed. The gameplay mechanics will be very familiar to old fans but, AC Origins makes more than enough additions and changes to make the game feel fresh without being extremely glitchy or feeling repetative. Its crazy. Im no game publisher but, giving a game an appropriate amount of development time seem to be beneficial to the overall quality of the product! Weird.
