if i cant find a way to run crossfire im getting a refund because i cant even run a constant 60fps on low settings on my crossfire 7970ms and there is 2gb of vram not even being used wtf this is a AAA title developed by a major publisher and they dont even take the time for crossfire/sli support even though their previous titles had it????
