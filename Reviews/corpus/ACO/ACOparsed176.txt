The year off really made the difference. After some mediocre games, Ubisoft finally hit the jackpot. Amazing open world, loads of side quests that arent boring or tireing to do, intrigueing story with really well developed characters, very nice structured villains and the atmosphere of the certain age is just perfectly made. Highly recommend it, worth every single penny. 10/10 for me.
