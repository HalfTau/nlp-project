From playing the pass Assassins Creed to this, its like night and day the difference of it. I mean it is truly amazing. From stalking your prey, or whatever you are hunting lets say a deer in this case.. I was stalking it in the grass and waiting for my chance to sneak up on it and kill it when suddenly a group of loins come up and start attacking the herd I was watching. Small things like that are what keep me coming back to the game, not to mention all the side quest and all how indept the story goes with the land and how people respect you so much and all the Gods. I love travling around the map and finding camps with soilders in it and sneaking up and stealth killing all of them and then taking there loot and then riding off into the night as if nothing happen.PROSAmazing mapIncredible storyGood leveling systemNice crafting systemCONSRiding horses can be a bit buggy at timesI was fighting a jag and it was glicthed and stood still and let me hit it.Just small stuff for the CONS
