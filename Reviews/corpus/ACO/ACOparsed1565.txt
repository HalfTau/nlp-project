I dunno what is wrong but the AA that they use is completeand cant find a way around it literally my 3hrs of gameplay is trying to adjust to get the so called Best Graphics of 2017 and all Im left with is constant blurry image quality I even used Reshade to do adjusting but that literally didnt do anything either. If anyone has tips that would be much appreciated cause I can not deal with their horible AA.UPDATE I have contacted a agent from Ubisoft and was very helpful.Amelie C has helped this blurr issue which off all  things steam overlay was interfearing badly and disabling helped and now the game is gorgeous I now fully recommend this game!
