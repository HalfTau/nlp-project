Dont get me wrong the actual gameplay is alright, and I like the skill tree and such.The game runs like it was on its first day of Early Access. The diaglouge volume is completely broken. Volume controls are either 100 or 0.Now to get started on the actual problem. The game, just like everyone else, hits 100 CPU usage and stutters like no other. Its not as bad if its the only thing Im running. But if google chrome is open, forget it.Im running a water cooled I74790k and a MSI 1080 Gaming X, and its installed on a samsung 850 evo. There is 0 excuse as to why this game is capping out.I submitted for a refund about 30 minutes ago.
