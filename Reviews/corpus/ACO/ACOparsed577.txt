What a Game!This game has one of the best if not the best stories that Ive ever played, which includes the origin of the Assassins with a character that fits perfectly, Bayek of Siwa. The way the characters are implemented and the way they interact with the real storyline of the Egyptians such as Cleopatra or Julius Caesar makes the game more enjoyable.For the Post  Game part its also very impressive, as there are a lot of secondary missions, ubications to complete, chests to find..., that you practically wont ever get bored.Overall Rate 10 / 10.
