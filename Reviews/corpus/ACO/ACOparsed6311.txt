READ IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS LAUNCHING THE GAME / BEING STUCK ON LOGO AT START.ive been trying to get the game to launch  correctly sense its release yesterday on the 26th but had no luck from fixing files to reinstlaling game multiple times i found out it was because i was downloading it onto my EXTERNAL harddrive where all of my games on steam are and for some reason assassins creed orogins does not like to be there, so if you have multiple memory drives on your computer make sure to install it on to your MAIN HARD DRIVE and hopefully itl work for you as it did for me, also make sure uplay is up to date have to uninstall and reinstall it to do so and everything is linked properly, ive always loved the assassins creed story lines even if some are buggy and ive seen quite a bit of game play of this one so i feel this one will be great as i play it and a good worth buy as long as you can get past the stupid bugs ubisoft has not fixed in the years of its making to make game launch properly, overall from what ive seen theyve changed a lot from combat to story to it now basically being like a rpj so would i recommend it? yes but as i said ive loved the assassins creeds games sense the first one came out and ill always play whatever one they pump out at whatever year so if you love the series or are maybe new just give it a try and if it dosent launch properly try some fixes people have been posting online, or just get it for ps4 / xbox and not have any launch problems to begin with if you dont want to deal with it, along with all that i hear plenty of people complaining about the keyboard and mouse layout of the game but you can always relay out the buttons or just simply use a controller like i do for the game,
