Overall, great game.Open world is alive, big, and immersive. Battling is technical, fun, and theres lots of weapon choices.Only downside for me was that it is not the Assassins Creed I expected. Gameplay has shifted to more rpg skill development rather than stealth strategy and story is not as interesting although that is being picky its a great game.
