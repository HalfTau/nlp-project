Bad first impression, but the game is really nice. The design is outstanding.What many people are saying is true, the game is not well optimized. I had to play it in 720p for the frame rate to stay above 35 even though I have a good system.Update  after 40 hoursThe gameplay is really nice and the map outstanding. But the quests...so boring. Repetitive and unmemorable.This is the best new assassins creed in terms of gameplay but in terms of story, so far its the worst.
