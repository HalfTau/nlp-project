Loving the game  story is detailed and the open world is beautiful in detail and texture.I am experiencing a headphone issue but it is working on speakers.I am struggling with the control somewhat  It has slowed my progress a tad but I soak up the craftsmenship of the game in all honesty.I would love a patch to have my PS controller working as I started off my assissan story with Ezio on PS3. Liberation was a tad easier but that game was too short.Its a must have game in my opinion
