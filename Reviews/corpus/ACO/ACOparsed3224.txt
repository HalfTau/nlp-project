When I heard they were making an Egyptian version of Assassins Creed I was blown away and really looking forward to it. Now that they game has been released I have to say that they didnt disapoint. It is really unlike any other game that came before. It is before the assassins, before the templars, you come in right at the beginning and experience how it is all formed.If you are a fan of Assassins Creed games, even if you havent played the more recent titles ie Syndicate or Unity Id really recommend this game.
