ok for those that are having issues with origins and the pc version i have and i mean i have not had any cpu graphics or lag issues playing the game running on a i7 6700k processor running at 4.0ghz with 16gb ddr4 ram a gigabyte 960 gtx ti 4gb video card all this sitting on a msi krait gaming 3x motherboard. and all of this was built myself not store bought. so its not the protection cause it is geared for newer machines not older.
