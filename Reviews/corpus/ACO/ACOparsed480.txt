The side quests are varied and divided into parts with story and charcters. The world is filled to the brim with loots and exploration is so much fun. I loved assasins creed 2. I wish Ezio had this game mechanics to explore Italy but whatsoever I am completely satisfied with this game. It keeps you coming for more and more. The combat is varied and attacks really make you feel powerful. An wonderful game by Ubisoft. Egypt is a beauty. So is this game. Highly recommended.
