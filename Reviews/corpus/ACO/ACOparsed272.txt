AC Origins was better than Unity. No doubt. The story was good until a certain point where it must have ended. Honestly, in my opinion it dragged a bit too much. The music and OST are fantastic as ever. Side quests are superb especially the ones which involve investigations. Taking down camps and forts give you that thrill and you get to see a lot of fascinating things the guards do. Each AI has its own lifetime in this game. Wonderful world design to cap it all off.
