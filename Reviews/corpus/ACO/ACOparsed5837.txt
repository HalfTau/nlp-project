This game gave the franchise a new breath of life in a few major ways, despite some minor technical/graphical gripes.The new combat system is so good compared to the older games. There is actually the possibility that you might die in combat instead of just parrying every single time your enemy telegraphs their attack. Thats not to say the combat is hard per se, but it at least makes it feel like you are actually participating in the combat in a more intimate way. The maps in this game are MASSIVE. Ubisoft definitely borrowed some elements from Far Cry Primal with the eagle eyeinthesky pet and the crafting system where you kill a bunch of fauna for skins  not that I mind this too much.For the bad stuff, the maps being really big make some spaces feel kind of empty. I think the huge expansive maps work well in the context of this game, but its just kind of cumbersome to have to spend so much time travelling around a huge desert when you havent yet unlocked the fast travel point. Another gripe was the visual quality on the opening cut scenes. The cut scenes put black bars on the top and bottom of my screen, the framerate is garbage, it looks like the resolution was dropped by 1/4... what gives man? The actual ingame graphics looks AMAZING compared to that opening cut scene. Besides that, I had some issues with screen tearing but updating NVIDIA drivers and playing with VSYNC turned on almost completely corrected it. The game did crash on me once when I was in a pony fight with 5 other guys on ponies. Not sure why that happened.Also screw the helix currency garbage. Its not as bad as other forms of microtransactions but I still dont like it and dont want it anywhere near games that I paid money for. Keep microtransactions where they belong free,  iphone games.
