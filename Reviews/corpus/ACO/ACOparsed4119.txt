If you like to play games, dont buy this one. I purchased and installed, but cant even launch the program. WTF? have tried several fixes, looked online, no answers. Will be requesting a refund and will be giving ubisoft a permanent farewell in my game library. Id love to say let me know when the problems been fixed, but im done giving 60 dollars to Ubi just to get dicked around.
