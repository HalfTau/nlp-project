Great game. One of the best, if notbest, AC games.Id rate it a 9 out of 10 and it its worth every cent.Huge, beautiful world to explore. Great atmosphere and setting. Interesting story, lots of lore.The fact that you can basically climb everywhere and anything opens up the world like no free roaming open world game Ive ever played. If you want to go to the other side of a mountain you can get there in a straight line theres no need to find some obscure way around. True freedom to go anywhere you want.The free combat is way better than the scripted combo combat of old.The loot based gear is done well not great but more than good enough. I dont really like the upgradewithgold mechanic but Ive seen and played much worse.The shop is done right if you dont want to you dont need to use it at all.Ive experienced no technical problems at all.The The Hidden OnesDLC is good. Its basically more of the same for high level characters. Not special but not bad either. To me its worth its asking price.
