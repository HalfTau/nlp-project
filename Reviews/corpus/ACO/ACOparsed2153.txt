Played the first 3, didnt really like the ones after.Bought this on a pure whim.This is awesome as both a fan of egyptian mythology and big open world games.I can see they drew a lot of influence from TW3 which is great although this game is no where near as good as TW series...but it is still an amazing game!Get it you wont be unhappy
