This is updated review of the game after the patch 1.10!I really liked the game, new RPG touch, combat, story, new protagonist, all of these are really interesting and I could see myself spending hundred hours in this game... except.. performance is really bad. Game might be well optimized but issue is Anti Tamper, most of time I never compaint about Anti Tampers, honestly this is first time. This game doesnt just use Denuvo anti temper but also uses another solution which checks denuvo like denuvo checks the game itself we can call it emulation. Even in just main menu, youll notice 40 CPU load, because this Anti Temper solutions run in every frame. If you dont have top of the line I7 Skylake or better, you are pretty much screwed if you want to hit 60FPS. Also there is one really greedy thing about this game, In game benchmark isnt really working. I had Very High Performance scored in that benchmark, without any FPS drops, but as soon as you launch the game, youll have to turn down settings. Along this I cant say for sure but I think starting point is greedy as well. You dont get to go to big city untill you have played 2 hours of the game, thats where everything comes, if you played on constant 60 FPS before, once you arrive in city FPS starts to drop, and I mean by a lot. Due to this, I cant really recommend this game at least untill they remove anti tamper solutions.PC Specs for testingCPU I56600K  4.5 GhzRAM DDR4 2400Mhz 2x8Gb RAMGPU Asus ROG Strix GTX 1060 6GB OCOS Windows 10 64 bit, all the updates installed.
