Assassins Creed returns with a polished take on the franchises mechanics as well as stunning visuals and vistas that will make you feel like a virtual touristin Ancient Egypt. It marks a much welcome change of pace for fans of the Assassins Creed series. I was constantly impressed by its jawdropping visuals, from its detailed architecture and geography to its excellent use of light and shadow. I also found the story to be compelling thanks to Bayek and wife Aya, who provide an excellent lens from which to view the games narrative. If youre looking to get back into the series after a long absence, this game represents a worthy point of return8/10
