This was an awesome entry in the Assassins Creed franchise. Gorgeous enviroments. Egypt is stunning. Graphics are great The new combat system works great and adds a refreshing challenge to the game. With multiple difficulties! Photo mode is addicting. I took 619 screenshots... Main characters are great, as well as their voice acting. The new loot system is fun, getting a new piece of legendary gear is always a good feeling. LOTS to do. Theres 130 quests in the base game and I dont even know how many locations there are but theres a LOT. Story started off strong but felt a bit rushed near the middle/end. Its overall decent though. Performance isnt the greatest but by far not the worst running Ubisoft game. Small variety of animations. Youll get bored of seeing Bayeks combat and climbing animations fast, nowhere near as varied as older games such as Unity or Syndicate.This game feels nothing like older Assassins Creed games. Theres no crowds to hide in, fighting is a better option than running to hide most of the time, and theres not a lot of free running. But maybe thats what makes this game good? I dont know but nonetheless I loved this game and definitely reccomend it!9/10
