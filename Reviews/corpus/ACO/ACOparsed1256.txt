I was really hoping that this game would bring the series back on track but I was wrong.The mechanics controls, combat etc have been changed, just for the sake of being changed. The game is either poorly optimised OR the DRM that is constantly running is hindering performance, or both. Storywise, I caught myself yawning 20 minutes into the game.The graphics are great, I will give them that.Not recommended.
