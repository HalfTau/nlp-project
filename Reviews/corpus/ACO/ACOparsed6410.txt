Well mah dudes, what I have experienced so far is constant crashing. Game seems extremely unstable. I have tried multiple fixes and reinstalls on different drives and I still cant get out of the first mission. Sounds like the game is awesome, but sadly my 69.99 has gone to waste thusfar. I really hope that we get some patches and updates and that I can report that all is well within the day. As of right now, I have just wasted my money. DONT BE ME.Nvidia Geforce GTX 980  2x I have disabled sliIntel i7 4790k CPU 4.0ghz16 gb ramUpdate It is now 1122017 and the game still crashes constantly. I have been able to get it to run in a somewhat stable manner on my Razer Blade 2015 model so I have had to play what I can on the laptop. Still cannot run this game without excessive issues on my home gamin machine.
