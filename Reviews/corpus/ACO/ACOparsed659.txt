This game is awesome, graphics 10/10, gameplay 8/10, story 7.5/10 and scenary 8/10. But I will only thumbs this up when my gtx 1060 6gb stops being bottle necked at 20fps by the constant 90 CPU usage, been waiting on a fix for months. Witcher 3 on ultra runs smoothly so I dont buy into the whole quadcore CPUs being outdated  on forums I see. not paying 500 quid to get 70 CPU usage across all 8 cores for a game that can run fine on a PS3 CPU.
