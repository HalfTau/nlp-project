I initially bought this just to try out. The graphics as with all current Ubisoft games is supurb even better on my Acer X34A 219 ultrawide screen monitor which the game recognised and locked me in on the settings. Ive got a nice GTX1080TI so I can max out the graphics. The graphics are supubly done.I just revised my review. I got to addicted to playing this. Im upto level 32 and fought with Severimus I think his name was  helped put Cleopatra on the thrown. There is a lot of content and  the environment map is brilliantly done. The game play is the same all the way though but the crafting and looting element does get  addictive, Its been a while to say this but this is a good Ubisoft game. It crashed on me once on  around 48h game play so its very stable but I do have a good PC. Recommended.
