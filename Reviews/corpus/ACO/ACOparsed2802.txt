Was really reluctant to buy this game after since assassins creed syndicate , which i feel was just an improved version of black flag but after my friend bought and finished the game he told me it was an whole level of experience. Also was shocked that the combat system had change, so i tried it though it has some flaws in the system overally i think its a great game. Since my gpu is run by gtx 1060ti , i was able to run with high graphics and the view was spectacular.
