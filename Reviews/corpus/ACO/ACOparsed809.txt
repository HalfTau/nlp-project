So I got pretty bored with the AC series and didnt want to buy this one until I heard that it was rather different to its predecessors. Haveing now put a good few hours in to the game I can confidently say that it is incredible. One of the best games Ive played. I really enjoy how you can play your own way, the depth of the open workd and the sheer amount of stuff going on makes it feel alive, and just stunningly beautiful. They did good with this one and I cant recommend it enough!
