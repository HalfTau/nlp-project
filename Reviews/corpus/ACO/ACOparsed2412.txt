OK, Im 15 hours in and although the game had a slow start including a strangely disjointed prologue section, once I got to Alexandria things really started to pick up. Now Im finding it to be one of my favorite AC games alongside AC2 and Black Flag. I like the new RPG features and the immersion factor of seeing life in Ptolemiac Egypt is very cool. I have some complaints 1 the beginning which I already discussed, 2 a few sparse areas especially before you get to Alexandra, and 3 some slowdowns that required me to dial back a few settings, which probably shouldnt happen on my system I7 7770K 4.2, GTX 1080, 16 GB RAM. It IS a very pretty game and perhaps the Ultra settings are meant to futureproof the game a bit, but the game and Nvidia did recommend Ultra settings, so maybe a few patches are in order.All in all, if you like AC, this is a very good AC game!
