Love it. Its beautiful, the world feels extremely alive and over well done. I love the turn they took with the franchise trying to make it a RPG. You can clearly see they took from The Witcher, Zelda and other games to make it their own! Just need a patch for some sound bugs I experienced an other minor things.
