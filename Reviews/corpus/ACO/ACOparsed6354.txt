Im having a blast. Wasnt the greatest fan of old AC combat, but really enjoying this new style. Its fun. The bow and arrow is a great addition. Climbing around, sneaking, surprise arrows is all fantastic. The game is beautiful, the map is huge. Could spend hours just exploring Alexandria. I am enjoying the quest system and loot/gear is straightforward but effective. Camels, Senu the Eagle, chariots and chariot racing are all great. Soundtrack is superb.Some people hate uPlay. Fine, I do too usually, but I cant even tell its there in this game. It flashes up briefly in the background on launch. I dont care about the microtransactions, because they are irrelevant. No impact on the gaming experience if you ignore them. My performance isnt great but its solid.tldr  Its fun and its beautiful.
