this game deviates very much from the assassins creed games so far, the combat mechanics are nothing from the previous games of assassins creed, for example, the jump is now alt key and they introduced dodge which is space bar, the assassination is now holding f key and you dont have the hidden blade so far i have played 2,5 hours into the game. it feels very wrong and i am not recommending this game to be bought. feels like the developers are trying a desperate attempt to make the assassins creed game live a last life
