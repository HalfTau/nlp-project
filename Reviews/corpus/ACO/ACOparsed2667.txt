This game was better than what I was expecting. Id give it a 9/10. The combat change from previous AC games is refreshing and the story is more engaging as well. Side missions seemed to take a note out of The Witcher 3s book, as they seem to carry more weight and you can easily and gladly get sidetracked at times. The setting in Egypt was a solid choice. There were times when things felt a little repetitive, but it didnt affect the gameplay nearly as much as previous games.
