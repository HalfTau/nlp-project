I had to give Assassins Creed Origins a try, and im happy I did so!Here is my first experience and perception of the game so far, from a regular gamer who has not played the Assassins Creed games for many years.An Emotional and Realistic ExperienceOverall, the game is intriguing, immersive and they have clearly put a huge effort into creating a more realisticly felt experiece, with real felt emotions. This goes for people, environments and objects. A great example is seen at the beginning of the game, where you are carrying a wodden horse with the inscription telling you, that your dad made it for you, but you were always sad that it wasnt a reallife horse, and you still feel that way. That is excellent writing, and such small aspects makes the whole difference to the experience so far.AC vs. The Witcher ExperienceAn important intial question for me was how it compares to the Witcher experience. A cleaver person ones noted When reading the acclaimed Brandon Sanderson fantasy books, you were cursed by the sanderson effect and always rated thbooks worse than you otherwise would have. Same logic applies to the Witcher i think. So far, yes there are many similarities, but i see them positively and it only resembles the known. And it works for me, and helps create a smooth gaming experience!A real RPGLike many other people I was very excited to see the works of a real RPG experience of the AC series. The open world and open quests work out as well as I had hoped for. You get the feeling of curiosity and like you are in charge without being forced to do certain things, or follow certain objectives. I am thrilled to keep exploring this game, and see how the rest of the story stacks up to the great experience so far! !
