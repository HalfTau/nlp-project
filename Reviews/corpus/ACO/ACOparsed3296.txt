This is actually an Assassins Creed game which is fun and together with Black Flag the best in the series.Graphical wise this game challenges the attention of detail the Witcher 3 had. The crafted world is stunning. For the first time for me exploring was fun, as everything felt handcrafted and with a purpose.The gameplay mechanics are also good.But still, besides the beautiful world, this game leaves me disappointed thinking what couldve been done with the solid ground work.Its not that any part I will list now is bad, but music, story and characters are only ok or good.With an amazing story and story characters you could relate to this game could rival the Witcher 3. But in its actual state all that remains is a very good open world game.
