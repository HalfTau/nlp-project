this game does have its performance issues but they pass after putting vsync on and going into borderless. this game is honestly the best game ive played in my life, the story is great, and it also shows you hints of the traditions of the old games, like the cut off ring finger and the name and the rules, but you wil be needing a monster of a pc to run this gam
