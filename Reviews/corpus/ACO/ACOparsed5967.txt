PC Optimization is really good always above 60 fps. The pc options are also amazing i love the FOV slider in a third person game. Really appreciate the extra effort on the devs part.In terms of the game it self game play is fast and fluid, you dont get those awkward wall climbing moments anymore. Everything just works like its supposed to. The controls and movement is very intuitive and you never feel like you arent sure how to do something.Combat is basically dark souls lite. The enemies can be punishing and you want to avoid taking on more than maybe 2 or 3 at a time and your focus should be to end combat as quickly as possible by either killing very fast or running away. If you drag combat out too long, more guys might join and then youre in trouble.Exploration and resource gathering is fun and I spent lots of time hunting down crafting materials my only complaint about this is that in the upgrade screen it should say the name of the material as well as show the picture. It only shows the picture so sometimes you have no idea what that thing is but you just know what the icon looks like.
