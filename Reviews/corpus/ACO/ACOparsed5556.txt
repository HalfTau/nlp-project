Im really enoying this game so far, there are a ton of things to do and a lot places to explore. I did have some issues with getting this game to work after updating my drivers but after verifying the game files i havent really had any mayjor issues or crashes. The game is amazing, I cant put it down. The RPG elements fit perfectly and I just feel more involved with the world due to seamless side quests and revenge quests. You dont feel the need to chase new loot, but when you get a random legendary you just feel epic. The size of the map is massive and the Graphics are amazing.
