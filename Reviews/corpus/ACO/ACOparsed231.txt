Im going through my entire library and putting a minimum of an hour into each game and then reviewing them, here is mine for Assassins Creed OriginsSo I am not done with this game, but I really love the direction theyve taken it so far.  Ive just been playing and doing other things lately so I havent come back to it yet.  But its still installed and will stay that way until I beat it.
