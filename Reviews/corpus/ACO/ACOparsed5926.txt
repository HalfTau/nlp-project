Id have to say this game is a lot of fun. Its different is some ways but still AC. Story has been great so far and Im not that far into it. Just got lvl 21 and still on main quest that are about 1516. Just exploring everything in each new area before I move on. Worth they buy but it is poorly optimized compared to other games it still runs decent on very high for me.
