i bought it Expecting to Refund it but instead i put 40 into it before i even finished the story, There is so much content that doesnt just feel like  filler stuff. The Side quests lead to bigger stories within the side quest. The combat is excellent, the Game looks incredible, The detail included is astounding.I would recommend you buy it 100.I play the game at 1440P on Ultra settings with Reshade enabled and in reshade i use Apative sharpen and Clarity  and get around 70 FPS and dips into the high 50s in mega citys like Alexandria, but i have a Gsync monitor so i rarely notice the drops.My specs I7  4790KGTX 1080TI16GB DDR3100 would recommend, i would say this is game of the year by far.
