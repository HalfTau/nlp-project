The best Assassins Creed that has been made, they did it right this time. People blasting this game for DRM is honestly ridiculous, there is no problem with a company protecting its product from piracy.  Games take money to make, they need to make that money back and profit. There are some slight fps issues, but those will be ironed out with updates. If you like Witcher 3, Far Cry, and other Assassins Creed titles, this is definitely worth a buy.
