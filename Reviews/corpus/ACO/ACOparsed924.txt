For the first time in years, an Assassins Creed game has captured my attention in the same way that the Ezio trilogy did. An incredible world crafted to perfection, loveable and realistic characters, and rewarding exploration makes for potentially one of the best Assassins Creed games ever.I have to admit I was skeptical of the game at first. But after actually playing it, I can only say that it has rocketed to definitely become one of my Top 25 all time games. Good work, Ubisoft. Hopefully you can keep it up.
