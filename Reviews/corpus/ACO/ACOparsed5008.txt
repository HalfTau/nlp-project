The CG in this game is just so so. Cant run on PC at least you cant learn it in tutorial and tbh Im not a player who would spend abundant time figuring out this in the following game because the beginning has alreadyme off. Not a fan of AC series. For similar games I only played The Witcher 3 before and I must say The Witcher is way better. This game does not deserve a 9. Also Ubisoft sucks at users experience design.
