This game is beauty incarnate.  The work the team has done fully realizing ancient egypt is immaculate.  Aside from a few performance quirks here and there, the game runs flawlessly on my system 7700k, 1080, 16gb RAM.  The new combat system is a noted improvement over the old, and the storytelling and character writing is leagues beyond anything weve seen in the series to date.  Would highly recommend.
