I own and I have played every AC game. To be honest Im not impress with Origin. Dont get me wrong, the game graphics are awesome, locations looks beautiful and rich. Game play is fun but I miss the old combat system, the one introduce back in AC 2. Im not saying I hate the new one, but it can be boring, not to mention it looks silly when fighting animals. I which they had put more effort in it, like they did in the rest of the game.Will I recomended this game to a friend, sure. Is a great game, but again the new combat system sucks!
