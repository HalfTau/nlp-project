I tried to get into the Assassins Creed games, unfortunately due to many glitches I encountered. I stayed away from them, when they announced the Assasssins Creed Origins game, I gave it another shot due to my love of Ancient Egypt. This game does not dissapoint! Plenty of things to do and the art style of the game is really well done.I wish they did add a few more things to the game, but it looks like the DLC will make up for it.
