While My review may be a bit bias I have all AC games i understand the frustration on Ubisofts part esspecially when it comes to games like this. But While i come into this game both Excited and Low expectations, i was pleased on the outcome. There are many key factors that i belive the developers imporved upon that really seperates this game from its predicesors.Charater devolopment has imporved from im an assassin and this is what im ment to do. Bayek gives is a true beliver in his culter and shows it well, He acts differnetly to everyone Happy and excited to children, caring to those mistreated, and a bit judgemntal to tose who arent the greatestCulture, i fell like i was learning about Egypt rather than running and climing on things they wont allow me to climb anymore, From Roman dictaorship, to Egyptian problems of racism, to Greeks... being Greeks, I ran throught the game in a glowing armor and a unicorn but that didnt stop the experincesCombat is on of the first things you will notice, how could you not and its going to kick your  if youre used to the other AC games. Even your all powerful one shot kill Hidden Blade is a garbage when you go up against those who have higher skills and better armor.Skill Tree This is the least memorable thing in my opinion because it works, and works well but its unessacary after a while. the max you can go it 40 but you can gain more levels after with no imporved health and damage but i faced the god trials at 38 with some extra skills and still managed to defeat Anubis after many tries with Sobek being easer at 40, i like it so i can gain more combat and ranged damage boost but its uneceassary, even for completionist since theres no acheivements. Maybe the gods will be more difficult or other challenges in dlcs but doubt it.
