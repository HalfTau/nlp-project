THIS FING GAME RIGHT HERE. If you are a fan of Assassins Creed and enjoyed the first 2 games, this one will not disappoint. Not only is it the highest reviewed game of the franchise yet for good reason but its so beautiful and amazing I want to cry. It feels like a true Assassins Creed game, yet it is also entirely fresh and new. The combat is like Zelda mixed with Dark Souls. The missions are all good stories and I have yet to receive even ONE Tail this guy mission. I mean, come on, COME ON! This is an amazing openworld RPG set in Ancient Egypt during the Roman golden age, in beautifully extreme detail. Its got great music though I still miss Jesper Kyd who did the music from the early games, great characters, great everything. This game is amazing. Play it. Please.
