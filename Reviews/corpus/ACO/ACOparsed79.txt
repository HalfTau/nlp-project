I was bit discouraged when I saw the Ubisoft logo pop up but after giving this game a chance Im actually having some fun with it. The side missions are actually not all fetch quests and the combat is actually engaging.The story is not the best and Ill leave that up to you to find out why. Also theres those good old ubisoft bugs which can really ruin a dramatic cutscene, you do however get to bang your wife. The leveling system is a bit annoying because a  guard who is carrying a pool noodle can one shot you because the number on his head is 3 more then yours.I would give this game a solid 3/5 for the updated combat and the fun side missions. Fix the bugs and let me shag my wife more often then i would boost it up to a 3.5/5.
