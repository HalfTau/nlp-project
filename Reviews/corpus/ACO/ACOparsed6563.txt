Specsi74790kMSI GTX9708GB ramTLDRDont take any review with less than 3 hours seriously, just spam. After 5.9 hours, one bug encounter, audio, within first hour. Didnt last long. Overall enjoying my time with the game, and my hype was not a let down.Full ReviewFirst off, for the love of God, do not pay attention to reviews with less than 2 hours getting upset about optimization and bugs because they probably havent updated Nvidias new drivers. Secondly, make sure you update your drivers. Now to the real part, this is the first AC game I have played of the last two. I played the hell out of Black Flag on Xbox, and was not interested with Unity or Syndicate after the initial mess that they were. However, after seeing that Origins was changing the game up and was taken place in Egypt I immediately got excited about this game. The beginning of the game was generic cutscenes setting the base of the story, which the reviews with less than half an hour havent truly gotten to open world yet. The combat takes a minute to get used to, but you should be stealthy, right? Horse combat and archery are what I am currently enjoying, and feels rewarding when you can get that double kill without being alerted. The only negative thing I have experienced so far was an audio issue about 45 minutes in that slightly altered the frequency to a buzz, which stopped shortly after it happened been having headset issues lately could be that. As well as my character getting stuck on a corner of a step but came loose shortly after. I cant wait to get to some of the other areas of the game, since I havent even left the beginning town, Siwa. I hope this review kind of pushes all the spammy, garbage reviews out of the way, and gives players on the fence a decent review to help decide whether to purchase this game. Happy hunting guys.
