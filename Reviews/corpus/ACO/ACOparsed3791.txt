IDK what going on with peoples cores but mine are fine, i tried running highest setting with a 960 2gb and i7 7700k and my i7 didnt get more than 60 on each core maybe higher on one but thats normal and i got around 2030 fps lol with a 960  and i have 8gb ram 2400 speed. Guess i got lucky with my game as my i7 just stays at Turbo speed4.5ghz.
