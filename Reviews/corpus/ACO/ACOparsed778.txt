I dont like the RPG format for AC. Its absurd that I can kill the crocodile over here in 1 hit because it has a low number by its health bar but I have no chance of killing the crocodile over there because it has a high number by its health bar. In a fantasy setting I dont mind so much but in a historical setting like this its just silly. Main plot is the usual political intrigue involving a whos who of famous people from the era, the side quests are pretty good somebody at Ubi must have played the Witcher 3 and taken a few notes. Its not a terrible game by any means, just bloated and forced against its will to be an RPG.
