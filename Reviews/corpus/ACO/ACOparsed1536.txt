Im playing this game on my i5, gtx1070 and I even put the game on my SSD. And the game isnt just playable for me for some reason. Whereever I start going its starts loading and my game freezes for a minute or two. On the firsth launch after I pressed the play button I had to wait around 15 minutes to load the fricking game up. All I can say is that I cant recommend this game until they TURN OFF their  double security. One day this game will be cracked, liked they or not It will happen. And then will be the question Why?Update got the cracked version and it runs better then the legit one, lmao.
