The game is ok content, missions, character design, etc but the main problem at least for me is the optimization, I bought this game when I saw the requirements and I realised my specs were way  better than the recommended but unfortunately playing in medium settings I only get from 45 to 58 FPS, it can be playable what sometimes there are several FPS drops at cities such as Alexandria. If Ubisoft optimizied this game, it will be amazing, more than it is now. However, I still recommend this game.
