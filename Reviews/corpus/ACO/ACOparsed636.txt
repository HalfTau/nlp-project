Bear in mind that this review is only 1112 hours into it. But with that in mind, this is the first Assassins Creed game that didnt grab my attention within the first couple of hours of gameplay. Yes, the other games had some issues and this game seems to try to address some of them but...Ive never gotten to the 1112 hour mark and been uninterested in continuing in any of those games.The setting is beautiful, but the story...meh. The story behind the main character is strong, but how they fit into the bigger picture, not so much. In previous AC titles the combat starts a bit hard but you get the hang of it and eventually there are few enemies you cant defeat with relative ease. The combat system in this one seems much less intuitive. Maybe Im just not getting the hang of it or maybe I need to refer back to the old titles to tell you exactly how I preferred them. Not a waste of money, but a waste of a beautiful game world.
