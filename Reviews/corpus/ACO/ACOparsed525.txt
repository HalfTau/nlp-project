Overall I really enjoyed it. I havent been this caught up in an AC game in a while. Though im a thumbs up, id still wait for a sale. I beat the main quest in 34ish hours after doing a few various side quest. There are still side quest for me complete but I like to base a game price off the story line hours. I bought this game on a sale for 41, and that to me was a good price for this game. 60, not so much. I had a solid 5060 fps for most of the game, only a few times would it drop to 30 but only for a few seconds. So overall its a good game and worth a buy on a sale. Have fun fellow Assassins.
