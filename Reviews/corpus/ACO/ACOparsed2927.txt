In my Personal opinion i think that this is one of the best story games of 2017 and the best assassins creed game ever its worth its 60 dollar price tag and honestly i would even go as far as the gold edition being worth it and with a complete and full story and awesome story rich side missions, with 55 hours i havent done everything and i hit max level at about like 52 hours and level cap increases coming with the new dlcs this is a definite buy 9.5/10
