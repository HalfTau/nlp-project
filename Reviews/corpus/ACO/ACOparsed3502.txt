They changed the fighting system a lot. Feels like destiny with the items and far cry with the skill trees. Game is beautiful though, story was great and the gameplay is pretty nice. I liked being able to climb anywhere although I wished the enemies scaled with your level it got pretty easy even with the difficulty maxed, but assassins creed has always been about slaughtering a platoon of enemies with ease. Beware of micro transactions. 7/10
