I gave it a bad review originally however i got it up and going running both steam and the game in admin to even launch the game. so this is a honest review of the game now that i played a little probably wait on patches for lag and bugs. The game has potential if not for it being very laggy with my pny gtx 970 and amd 8350 processor with 16 gigs ram even on medium settings. If the people making this game give it more attention to reduce said lag it may be a great addition to Assassins Creed family and not a black sheep like Unity. Fix the other bugs as well of course and we will see it has a bad start atm with all these issues people including myself are having. I will recomend this game later on but to rush out to buy now i can not given it needs a lot of work to be worthy. So for the time being i must say we will see. I will give a recomend however its a maybe type game as it stands until all these fixes are met.
