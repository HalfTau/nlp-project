This is a fun game,it has good gameplay that is on euqal terms as assasins greed one and two.and it also has good side quests and boats. witch I did not expect in the desert.the characters are fun and intresting, and overall its a good story.there is still some negitives like bugs.Screen flickering during some secments.and some sounds issues. like sometimes you hear static sounds for a few seconds.The mayjor sound issue I had was that I lost voices during gameplay.but these are issues that can be fixed.The most negitive thing I can think off is that its open world yet you are forced down a certain route.as if you stray from the path you will encounter enemies that are stronger then you that you have no chance of beating.But this is a game I can recomend you try out. and worth the money.
