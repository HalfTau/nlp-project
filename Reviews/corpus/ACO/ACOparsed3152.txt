Definitely the best looking Assassins Creed game. Top notch visuals, the rendering of Egypt is so astounding, very detailed and so much stuff put into the whole world. Performance wise its great. Running on almost max settings and still runs smoothly. Now if only Ubisoft can finally give us a better story for their gaming world.
