I have play all Assassins Creed game From AC1 to ACS and I have to say, this is one of the greatest AC game ever.Combat? No, you wont wait for counter like AC1 to ACR and you wont be one shot like ACU, it is more like Darksoul series. You have to dodge to choose a position to strike back from behind or shield for parry, but dont underestimate the NPC, they know every technique to kill you literally, archers will climb to higher grounds and use their arrow, and very more technique waiting for you to discover. And for the game feature? This game isnt the downgrade like it seems when Ubisoft announced spec few months ago, the optimize is very good and Egypt in this game is very beautiful, and dont forget, Ubisoft will feature a tour in game in the feature after the Trial of the Gods event. The quest system is perfect, alot of quests and rewards are waiting to be done and claimed. It also have puzzle, finding it can be a hard challenge or easy one with google XD. Gears in this game are very easy to claim, dont like Shadow of War, legendary gears are even more easily to be founded, and you can have it without your money.In the moment I write this review, I have comple 86 of the game checked by using Ubisoft Club mobile app and have few achievement to do. And I play in hard mode. So this review about NPC can be a little easy for those play on Easy or Normal mode
