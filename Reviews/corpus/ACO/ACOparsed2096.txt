This game is so damn good. Coming from someone who doesnt play every AC and contemplated even picking this one up. I can say Im glad I did. This is probably the best open world experience to come out since The Witcher 3. Ive become addicted to completing every side quest I come across and exploring every hidden area in order to gring through the level progression and unlock the many desirable abilities.  If you are on the fence rather or not to pick up this iteration I highly recommend you do.
