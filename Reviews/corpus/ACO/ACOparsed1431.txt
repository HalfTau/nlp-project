I bought the Game yesterday,  the game is Great, the story is good all judging from an youtube standpoint as I havent played the game much yet because as of update patch 1.1.0  I am experiencing Stutter all the time,  most probably related to the 100 CPU usage it produces for me,  which I believe to be Out of Order  not proper / inadequate  given the level of CPU I have.If I am to pose an opinion as to why this is happening and not only to me,  I would say its becauseof the DRM security system draining the life out of my CPU .. And now in all honesty, YOU MOTHAING DENUVO ! !Ubisoft better solve the problem .. their game is great but cant help to be Angry at Ubisoftfor implementing such t on their game. Most disappointing  !
