My rig more than meets the recommended setting to play, but even on the lowest graphic settinsg it bugs out and crashes constantly. I WANT to like this game, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. The bugs Ive found are just too hilarious and stupid to have in a gamlike this! Hopefully in time itll change, but until then, I have to give it a thumbs down.
