Game was fun for the first few hours and then the glitches started. Got to the point that I couldnt open the quest log or map. Most of the NPCs dont load. I have a system that exceeds the recommendations. Ive asked for a refund and might buy it in a year when the issues are fixed and its been discounted. I dont know that Ill ever buy a ubisoft game again though so maybe not.
