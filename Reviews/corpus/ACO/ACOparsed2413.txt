Ive played this for 25 hrs so far and really enjoy it, its so far still lagging behind Black Flag and is hanging onto the tailcoat of Brotherhood. That being said its highly enjoyable, exploring has been one of my favorite aspects of the game. I look forward to finishing it and we shall see if it will take number 1, 2 or remain at 3rd in the franchise for me.
