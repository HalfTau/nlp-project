AC Origins is a good reset back to the basics for the francise. There was an absolute ton of stuff to do. Most of the objectives do get a bit repetitive, i.e. kill x, or loot y but I figured out ways to make even the most mundane task exciting. The achievements also helped in that regard. Ghosting a camp is one example of compounding the difficulty.The new combat system works both for you and against you in some situations. The enemies are way tougher to take on in groups. Also jumping ahead on the level difficuty is not really an option. One level difference is fine, however the enemies typically like to at least pair up if not roam in groups. Making sure you can outrun this group is key.
