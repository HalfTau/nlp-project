I cant be bothered writing a massive review with pros and cons, but Im writing this up In the hope the Devs see and hopefully fix at a later date..Im not holding my breath though.Please change the combat system to incorporate counter attacks with multiple cinematic effect finishers.Also please add more assassination types. As at the moment my character only seems to do the same type every time I take down an enemy.It is also too stiff and rigid looking too, it needs to be smoothened more like in previous assassins creed games.Other than the combat and assassination system, it is really enjoyable. Different, but enjoyable
