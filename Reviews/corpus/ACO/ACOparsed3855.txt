Never spent so much times playing an AC game before, or actually glad I spent 60. Ubissoft may have finally listened to their customers.ProsExploration is enjoyableFreerunning is nearseamlessCrafting is very rewardingThe acting of every main character is well done. I really hope they give Aya some DLC storyYou only explore half of Egypt by the time the credits roll, so theres good opprotunity for end game activities.ConsAt times, the combat made me yell. Parrying can be very finicky at times and the game does not do a good job of letting you know which moves you can parry or should just dodge. These are highlighted by yellow or red moves. I think you can parry red moves but not yellow, but Im still not sure.AI will attack you at random sometimes, especially when riding past a squirmish between AI that you do not interfere with. Other times I was attacked in neutral territory while approaching an encampment.Assassinations are no longer onehit kills unless you level your hidden blade up via crafting. I only ran into someone I couldnt instakill once since that was the one thing I made sure to go out of my way to level up continously.They got rid of the Animus Database. Due to the modern day story aspects, I can see why, but it still bums me out. I was the guy that would actually read the database entries when they appeared in previous games.
