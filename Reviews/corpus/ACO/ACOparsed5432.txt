Dont write Assassins Creed Origins off just with the AC Formula conceptionsWell well, it seems that the game has taken lots of people by surprise. There are so many different and new things in AC Origins that makes it wholly different from the previous iterations.The game took many ideas from various games like The Witcher 3, Horizon, and even Dark Souls, while still keep the Assassins Creed identity intact. The game is still mainly revolving around stealth and assassination, but there are also some notable new/improved things such asIm liking the direction of the franchise has taken. It made me went from zero interest on the franchise to full anticipation for their next game. Though Im considerably new to the franchise only played AC II and Black Flag for a bit so some things that are listed above might not be a new addition to Origins.Overall, this seems to be the best game in the Assassins Creed series. That extra year of development time has really helped Ubisoft find its creative center again, and craft something that feels both fresh and energized. The game feels fresh, has a new combat system, RPG elements, a great story and looks absolutely stunning. With so much to explore and do in its jawdropping setting, Origins is exceptional. All I care about is how utterly engrossed I am with the gameplay loop.
