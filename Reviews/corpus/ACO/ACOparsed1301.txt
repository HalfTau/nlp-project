Even though the past several assassins creed games have been hot garbage, I have to give props to ubisoft where they are due. This game was fantastic, and you can tell they really put some effort into this one.My only gripe with this game is they kept the irl aspect with the girl going into the animus. I get that its part of the AC story but I really couldnt give a fck about it anymore. It was alright with AC 1 with desmond, but its just gotten annoying, takes you out of the immersion of the game.The mechanics really shine in this game, the combat is really satisfying. My hope for the future is for Ubisoft to rip the mechanics from this game and make a new open world RPG with them, away from the AC universe. Cause lets face it, the series could have been finished after the original 3 games AC1,AC2,AC Brotherhood. All the games after that except 4 were not so great, and just felt like an attempt to suck money out of a respectable trilogy.But anyway, havent had this much fun with a singleplayer game in a while. Solid 9/10 for me. Good job ubisoft.
