The game is absolutely gorgeous but even with a 1080 Strix Edition, 32GB RAM and i7 7700K cpu I am having endless crashing problems.  Game starts fien for me runs without a hicup for about 20  30 min then crashes as I reach new areas, or finish a quest.For now at least I cannot recommend it but I am sure it will be patch at whcih stage this may change.
