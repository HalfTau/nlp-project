Is the hype true? personally i think they exaggurated how good the game is. Mainly because the story is badly written, as the characters just dont feel believeable, and the way they force you to do side missions grind between story missions completely murdering the pace of the story. I didnt expect wither tier side missions, and honestly they arent all that bad, but they feel like a chore when you have to take every mission you get in order to get to get to the appropriate level for you next mission. Now you probably think but the world is so big and amazing, there should be anough of fun side missions thats true but untill you get to the max level of 40 the world doesnt really open to you. Last complaint the combat, i guess this is a personal thing, but this dark souls like combat just doesnt work for a AC game, especially when fighting groups, in my opinion they should go back to a more arkham style combat system.Verdict Its a nice to see a change in the AC franchise and a change it is, but personally i dont think it was a mistake to take AC this far in RPG territory. World is nice but opens way to late in the game, the story is badly written, the combat is mediocre, stealth works but isnt that important as in other ACs, side missions feel like a chore.
