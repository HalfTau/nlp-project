Ive been so busy playing this game and forgot to write a review. I have always played the AC series but have always found the series to be flawed. The high water mark was AC2 for sure.....but I did really think that black flag was something special. I adored AC unity but I do understand the harsh criticisms of that game..... but it really is one of the best looking games ever made and the story is a bold love story between an assassin and templar.I knew that the Black Flag team was working on Origins and that got me excited. I knew the series was being somewhat rebooted but after playing Origins I found that they kept all the good parts of AC creed. Its still AC and Im really happy about that. They borrow some aspects of the The Witcher 3 who wouldnt and how could you not to round out the edges.I play these games to step into history. Unity let me step into the turmoil of the French revolution and AC O takes me to Egypt in jaw dropping fashion. This game looks and runs great and really is stunning best water 2017 or ever?. This is a bold meticulous hand crafted world that stands among the best of them....well maybe not Skyrim but is that possible?I have loved every second of this game. the combat is somewhat generic but tight and fun and the exploration and story are top notch. This is an easy 9.5/10.
