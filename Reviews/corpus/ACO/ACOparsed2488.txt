Ive recently grinded for the past few days, overall astonished by the comeback that Assassin Creed has done with the newest game, Origins. At first, I thought it would still have some bugs for being a new game, but Ive rarely spotted something that I questioned in terms of the developers work in scripting. This game sparks a new type of taste to Assassins Creed that hasnt been done yet, and it has made the game way more interesting. There is plenty of quests to do, and an entire map to explore leading to endless amounts of hours. This game is a great choice to buy, truly speechless by the historical features and story itself.Pros  Outstanding Geography/Architecture Endless amount of things to accomplish/do Unique and different quests, not repetitive The new use of resources to upgrade and make your character stronger Use of costumes/legendary items you can collect from treasure crates to make your player stronger The theme of Egypt itself, with all sorts of history and the features itself like sandstormsCons  Kinda dissapointed I wont reach level 40 in time for the 2nd trial of Gods  just a me thing haha The overall combat with the NPCs is kind of vague, like its the basic hit and dodge sequence everytimeTruly impressed by the game, worth every dollar! !
