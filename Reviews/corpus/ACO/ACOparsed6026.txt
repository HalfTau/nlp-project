Game is amazing, definitely the best of the series imho. Im playing with a gtx 1060 6gb, i7 4790 3.6ghz, 12gb ram and Im playing in 1080p, high settings locked at 45fps. This game absolutely hammers my CPU. I cannot play at 60fps, even on low preset because my GPU is being bottlenecked. Will play at locked 45fps until this is addressed. The open world in this game is absolutely massize and there is so much to see and do. Theres quite a variety of side activities. New combat system is a very welcome change, I love it. Loot system and upgrading is very addictive. Game is beautiful and a joy to play. Im hooked, dont want to put it down. Ubisoft has outdone themselves! However, buyer beware because you need a SRONG CPU for this game. Its crippling most quad core CPUs and Ive even seen Ryzen 7s hit 90 usage. You will have a hard time running this at high framerates. Idk if its because of DRM or the way this game is designed but its crazy how CPU bound this game is.Update Installed the latest patch, everyone should be on 1.03 now. They fixed a ton of things and I can confirm performance has improved somewhat about 510fps I think. Still hitting my CPU very hard but I can do a locked 60 fps most of the time with some drops into the low 50s. My advice is to experiment, and find out where to cap your framerate so you can run it as high as possible without maxing out your CPU.
