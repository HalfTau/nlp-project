I really want to play this game its so much fun... but it keeps crashing every 5 minutes ranging to and hour.. and my rig is way better then the reccomended settings. Ive put in a ticket to ubisoft and have not heard anything... i really want to play this game because it seems so good. i dont get how all these other people are getting any issues.. if anyone could help thatd be awesome!I suggest changing the frames from uncapped to a set ammount.
