I preordered. played for 35 hours no issue. Then, all of a sudden I crashed every time i hit play. I spent hours trouble shooting. finnaly I called it quits for the night and flipped on youtube to find out ACO has applied some new attatchments for piracy. I was waiting til I finished to review. but I cant finish. I cant recomend this game.Update after 5 days nothing is diffrent. The ubisoft support did nothing but give me busy work and then tell me they cant help. I change from cant recommend this game to dont buy. it runs poorly and ubisoft support will not help
