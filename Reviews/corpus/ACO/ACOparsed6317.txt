This game is the next big game after AC IV and my second favourite after AC II. The story is good and has depth. Quests have a story finally most of the times at least. Combat/Stealth changes are very good and give the game a more RPG like style. Egypt is huge and gorgeous. You could say this game is a masterpiece until you see how it runs on PC. Apparently, its a one more badly optimized game by ubisoft. If you dont have an i7 or a Ryzen you really cant get 60fps in towns even with GTX 10601070 at High 1080p. I have i57500/GTX 1060/8gb ram and cant get above 45fps in towns. Sure i can get a stable 60fps outside of town but most of the combat tales place in palaces and towns and 45 fps is a pain in the Havent got any AMD graphics card but i heard that one of the best AMD cards cant maintain 60fps on 1440pMight be a myth but i wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt. Seems like ubi doesnt give a sh!t about AMD cards.. All in all its a good game but the performance is pretty decent and that is bad.
