I wish I could enjoy this game more. It doesnt feel like the same engine as with the other versions of AC. I have a fairly new PC but I have to run this at low graphic levels which ruins the fun. AC 1, 2, 3 and 4  ran great and I could run them on high settings. There is so much to do in this version. I dont have full time like I used to so Im sure this game will take a few months to complete. I like the Egypt Theme. I wish we had a character creator to change the look of some of the characters.The acting and dialogue was not so great in this one as others have been better.Some of the Key bindings are difficult to set up to comfort.All in all I give this 3.8 stars out of 5I have played every AC that has come out and love the franchise however, this one is a little more difficult unless I, of course update my PC....Why not, Ive done it with almost every game to date  Blah!
