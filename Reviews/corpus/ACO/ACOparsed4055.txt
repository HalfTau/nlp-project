After reading the comments about the CPU load at 100 and stuff thats going on better gaming rigs then my own i was struggeling to buy it.. Then ofcourse i cant wait no more and buyed this game. Worked on drivers, then on graf.options...And started the game in 1080p on uber setings with shadows and textures on high my gpu have small amount of ram needed. Played few h, learned that F1 give u performance grid. And saw that i got near 60fps non stop, but in crowded places like Alexandria it goes down to low 50fps! No stuter! No cpu overload 7090 never 100... so my I5 4690K OC to 4.3Ghz with Gtx 980 notOC runs this game WELL! So ppl with better rigs have maybe software/hardware problems D
