So i thought id give this a try and then decide if id refund it or not.The CPU is always between 80100 with my Xeon E31231 v3  3,4ghz. Seems like Ubi wont change anything anytime soon about that.I played everything on High with my Geforce 1060 and the frames were mostly above 60 and sometimes going up to 80.I think there is nothing to argue about the stunning visuals they have delivered here.The gameplay feels good, the controls are okay. The missions i played so far were okay too. The world is awesome and gives you a lot of opportunities to explore. I also discovered that you can look at screenshots other players took on your minimap, i was really surprised by that feature and liked the idea a lot.Now lets talk microtransactions. Or as they call it Time Savers i am not  you, i will add some screenshots.You can go full money mode and buy literally everything Skillpoints, crafting materials, gold, weapons, outfits, mounts.I think there wasnt a big buzz about that because it is a singleplayer game and there are no lootboxes but still it is insane that a concept like this is implemented into a singleplayer game.My conclusionIll refund it because i dont want a game that uses my CPU like a cheap hooker. And trust me if anyone is a rich businessman, it is Ubisoft. You can be glad that EA does an even worse job these days.If some magical day the games double DRM is removed, id gladly buy it again and play through it, until then a REFUND and a THUMBS DOWN.
