Assassins Creed Origins....I plain loved it.Origins is set in not actually ancient Egypt. Add to that the simply beautiful graphics, that alone should be enough to make you buy it! It may be pricy, but if you loved The Witcher 3 and Assassins Creed II, you will definitely luuuuv Origins.The storyline is actually pretty good, considering the s!t boring ones of the previous 23 AC games. Its definitely an epic comeback for Assassins Creed. Its not nearly as great as Witcher 3, I must say though yep, Witcher 3 is the best game of all time neither is it as great as Assassins Creed II, though there are many similaritiesthe accents, for instance. Bayek may not be as great as Ezio Auditore, and hes no Geralt of Rivia....But hes the protector of the frikkin pharaoh of frikkin New Kingdom Egypt!How cool is dat?!Cheers. Big thumbs up. Buy it.On sale means you shouldnt not buy it
