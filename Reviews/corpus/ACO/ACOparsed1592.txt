An extremely wellmade game, probably the best Ive played in a while.Vivid world, stunning graphics, smooth gameplay, engaging story, amazing historical accuracy.The level of attention they pay to the littlest detail really blew my mind.and the screenshot system is amazing, I can literally spend all day taking screenies in this game.Plenty things to do postgame if you are a completionist.I honestly dont have anything negative to say about this game. 10/10
