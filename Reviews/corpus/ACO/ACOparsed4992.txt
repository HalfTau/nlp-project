i7 7700kGTX 1070 Overclocked to 2000MHz32 GB or RAMPlaying on a 7200 RPM HDDPlaying on ultra at 1440pSo are reading a lot of these reviews and seeing people saying that they are getting poor frame rates and drops I decided to write this. I as well was getting these frame drops in game 4550 FPS. I found a solution however, becuse I was overclocking my GPU i was keeping an eye on my frequency and I notices that the frame drop would always happen at the same time as a frequency drop. From what I could tell this was an issue with the cards power management. It will drop below base clock to save power when it is not in heavy use.You can fix this in the nvidia control panel under power management.So over all I think that this is a really interesting game. It is not at all like the other AC titles. It has many elements from the witcher a game that I love. Overall I would recommend this game if you are a long time AC fan or if you are new to the series.
