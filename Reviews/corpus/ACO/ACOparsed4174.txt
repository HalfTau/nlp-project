I am pleasantly suprised by this game and am just entralled by it. Mostly due to me having nothing to do with this game when I saw it at E3 and the notorious flops of creed in recent years. I picked the game up and was expecting all these issues with DRM and cpu usage but was greeted with a game that supports 219, amazing gameplay, and pretty good optimization.The only issues I have seen myself so far would have to be pathing in some of the opening scenes could have been better but that is honestly it. This game is definitly worth a buy at the price tag and I can see myself getting upwards of 40hrs of gameplay.If you are on the fence buy it through steam, if you do not like it refund it. Its that simple, and all these people ing about DRM yea I get its an issue but I mean from a retailer point of view thats pretty much the only way they can hope to thwart piraters early. I mean yea its going to get broken easily but at least for the short time they can feel happy.Game runs perfectly on a 1080 and a i7 6850k 4.4ghz
