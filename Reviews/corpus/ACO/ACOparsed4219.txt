Been playing the AC games since the start, well i have to say ive been a bit dissapointed in the last years since Black Flag, luckily enough i havent been among those that have had problems with any of the AC games ever, almost never any bugs, not even in Unity. Anyway, this game has just been fantastic even from the start, something new, the combat not entirely different but its something..,The graphics oh my lord Running on a i7700k, asus 1070 oc card, 16gb ram 2400, and i got it installed on a Intel p700 card with a Acer 27 Predator XB271HU Gsync IPS, got smooth 90110 fps all the time on max graphics.The gameplay ing hell yes, everything is just great, the hunting, the environment, the MAP just the scenery is awesome, nothing like it before, even gotto do in the middle of the desert. And of course some cool history stuff. The quests aside are really cool, some of them could be a bit better but its great, i love the side quests theres a lot of them, but its still great, it feels like you just dont rush through the main story and your character actually evolves.It just a great game!
