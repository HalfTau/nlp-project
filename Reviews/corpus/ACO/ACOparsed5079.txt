When i first bouth this game I was very worried about my computer being able to run it, boy oh boy was i wrong, this game runs very well on my 1050TI at very high settings, besides this game has so many options that you can just change something less important down a level and then it works again. The game play is a breathe of fresh air, I love it, I intentionally dont stealth kill that much just beacuse I want to have that fun of fighting them straight up. It used to be that the second Assassins Creed was my favoiurite but I dont know if I can say that anymore, I love Bayek and Egypt with a roman splash is the best setting they could have chosen, very good job Ubisoft A.
