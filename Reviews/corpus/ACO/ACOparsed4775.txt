Damn! Great game, didnt played a game like this in long time, 44 hrs and i finished the game but not 100 map completed. Overall its worth every penny. The story, gameplay, graphics, map, lvling all 10/10. I could say its quite addictive. Bayek is a hell of a man. Wish they could add the beard and long hair as cosmetics. Worth it 100
