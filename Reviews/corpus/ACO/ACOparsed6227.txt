I did try to play. I really did. Visually, its a gorgeous game. But.Previous Assassins Creed Titles caught me with comparatibly fluid animation, easytolearn combat, the ability to explore and go wherever I wish to.Origins is disappointing on all of these levels.The animation is laughable in comparison The camel mount looks as if it is trying to run on legs made of sticks Even the NPC/Enemy mounts have more fluid animation!, emotion is nighabsent in any facial features, and even Senu, unless in flight, feels more like an action figure than an actual animal. Combat is wonky at best, some abilities are broken and dont work properly Predator Arrow specifically here, and since everything has a leveltag on it, youd best make damned sure you stay in your little nest until youre ready to leave it.Oh, and dont you dare try run away from your enemies. Bayek nearly killed himself by suddenly deciding that forcetilting the camera towards some sights he wanted to comment on was more important than saving his pincushioned butt from the guards chasing him.And.. Microtransactions? Really now? As tempted as I am to ride an unicorn around the desert, I will not pay you actual money for it. At least not beyond the damn near three figures I already parted with on preorder.
