Ive never clicked with AC games in the past. They just seemed clunky and weird with goofy movement and rubberbandy combat.ACO is significantly better in every way, IMO. Better movement, combat, presentation, world interaction, etc. There are many longtime AC fans who think exactly the opposite, but if this was like the older games, I wouldnt be playing it right now..
