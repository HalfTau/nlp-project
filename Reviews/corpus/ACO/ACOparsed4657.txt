Edit Patch fixed it, i played it. Its bloody good. One of the best in the series and also enjoyable for a non assasins creed fan.Lesson Dont buy an Unisoft game and expect it to work on day 1.My first review so go easy.This is not in depth, since the game runs way too bad for me to continue playing. Despite being a long term fan of the AC series sort of my guily pleasure games i refuse to play this one and already requested a refund.At the beginning i was very pleased to see this game coming out. I heard a lot of positive reviews since the launch so i bought it, since the setting and new combat seemed very entertaining.But despite me playing activly for only about 3 minutes i have seen more issues compared to even other AC games.Even in the opening sequence i got no sound exept background music. The first tutorialencounter played a few more sound but it was obvious that some was still missing dialog, swords clashing etc.. In return i got some loud buzzing noise about every 20 seconds.In addition to this i got frequent framedrops.My PC should handle this game with ease and it has done so for similar games. It is not a performance issue. Even the game itselft showed me that on an unnecessary options screen.These issues are not to be overlooked and in addition to this the game being out for a few days and these issues still unfixed.tldr there might be a very good game begind all these issues i am having, but im not able to find out. Thus i can not recomend it to anyone and i dont want to, to be honest. These issues are offputting and makes one unable to play the game at all.
