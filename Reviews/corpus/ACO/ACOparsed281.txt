Very beautifull game. I enjoyed every moment playing it. Finished the game in 105 hours with every side mission and location discovered not including the DLCs. Awesome story, gameplay, ambiet, atmosphere, wildlife, arsenal and exploration. Huge map without feeling the emptiness. So it has quantity and quality for sure. Recommend strongly!
