Playing oni5 3570k, r9 290 4GB, 8GB DDR3, SSDGame looks good, but does have performance problems. On latest drivers 17.10.3 and high settings with no AA. I didnt know what to expect with reviews and the discussion page going back and forth between super negative and super positive. I know, I know, I should have known there would be some issues, but with the overall positive reviews, I had to give it a go for myself. Im sure many of you are in the same boat. IMO, its definitely worth a shot. This is just a performance review based off of the first hour of my experience. Most reviews I saw were on much more powerful hardware, so Im not at all upset with the performance on my aging machine.
