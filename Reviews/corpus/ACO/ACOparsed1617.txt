ive never been into assassins creed, ive never played any of the games though ive watched the first three be played by friends. none of them really interested me or sucked me in until i saw this one. a whole year after release i decided to jump right in and buy the gold adition of this game. i am not disapointed. im only 14.7 hours into playing and just started etching away at the story. so many side missions and so much to explore ive spend most my time exploring and talking to those around me to get more side missions. Egypt is so spot on in feel and looks and im quite happy with the characters looks and feel as well as the background characteers being very true to the time period with their hair and clothing. im loving the picture taking feature as this world is far to beautiful not to snap a selfie here or there! i tend to play many more hours of this game and i already know im in for quite a story and fun time
