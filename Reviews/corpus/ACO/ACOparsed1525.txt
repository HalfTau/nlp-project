The game is graphically impressive, story is not very interesting but it is okay. Although the unity got negative reactions from the players it is still the best creed game for me. At this game you dont feel the pleasure of climbing things, parkouring through the rooftops etc. but i can say that the fighting mechanics is the best so far among creed games..
