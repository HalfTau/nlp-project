Assassins Creed 3 was my favorite AC game until Origin, which now takes top spot. This is an incredible game. The gameplay, the controls, the graphics, the attention to detail, the story, its all extremely well done. Origin sets a new standard for AC, and hopefully Ubisoft continues this focus on quality over quantity in the future.
