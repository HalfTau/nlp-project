Remember that kid from school with all that potentional and promise only to get hooked on meth and  his life up before hanging himself?This is Assassins Creed Origins, a travesty of a game where your FPS is more unstable than a American politics, the combat has been ruined beyond repair, it tries to be similar to darksouls and the witcher but falls flat on its face leaving you with nothing but a janky cluster.Wouldnt recommend this if it were the only game in existance.
