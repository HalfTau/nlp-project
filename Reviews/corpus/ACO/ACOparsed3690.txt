While I havent beat this game yet I feel Ive played it long enough to form a pretty concrete opinion on it. This is the first AC game since 2 that has really got its hooks in me. Its loot system is very well made and I always feel like Im getting something better than what I had or progressing in some way. The map is massive and has a lot of life to it. Theres always something going on, wheather its seeing hallucinations in Giza to the hussle and bussle of a city you might run into.There is also a ton of side quests some of which have a large amount of thought put into them. I have ran into side quests that I was not sure if it was a part of the main story or not. Of course the writing isnt fantastic all the time though and the NPCs can vary pretty heavily from great voice acting to horrid.All in all I would say give this game a go if you have felt Asssassins Creed needed to change the pace. They definitly have and it really shows.
