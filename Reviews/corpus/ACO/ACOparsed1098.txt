This may be the best AC ever made, Im a big fan of the Ezio era but this game is incredibly beautiful and really really vast and alive, its the first AC that doesnt end up being repetitive, to me at least. The combat system is finally interesting and you dont feel like a super hero when youre fighting.Ive finished the game without a bug and with pretty good performances considering I run it on a  laptop with a GTX 950M.There is only one weird behavior if you try to map mouse buttons other than the left/right/middle to actions it doesnt seem to register properly and you have to click multiple time, so I ended up binding everything on the keyboard, for an AAA game its a bit weird.
