This game is beautiful!From the city streets of Alexandria, to the pyramids of Egypt, this game has been one of the best assassins creeds ive played.  One of my favorites is Black Flag, and this one does have a hint of Black Flag in it.  From the soundtrack, to the sunset views of the ancient cities, this game has been very enjoyable.  Ive only just started passed the first chapter in the story and I have over 20 hours invested.  I Recommend this to anyone looking to kickin back, and playing an open world action adventure game.
