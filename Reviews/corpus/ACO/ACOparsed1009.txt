I havent played much of the franchise and cant really say how far it has strayed from the original creed but Im having a good time with it! I can tell that there is so much to do in this game. I have barely scratched the surface with a few quests and exploration, only 10 hours in. Im finding the whole thing quite refreshing! Egypt in its final days! Game On!
