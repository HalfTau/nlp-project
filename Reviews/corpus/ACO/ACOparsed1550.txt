I have played most of the Assassins Creed games. When the franchise first came out I was pretty in to it and I was enjoying the story. Aspects of this game look very good, the main characters, the world however, some of the NPCs look pretty bad even on ultra settings. The characters are all also pretty unintersting that being said I have not finished the game, but I dont know if I will be able to...The missions and side quests are pretty bland and repetative....If you have played one AC you have played them all...the best part about this game is exploring some of the well known egyptian landmarks. Unless you absolutely love collecting the same crap from around the map, and repeating the same tasks over and over I do not recommend this game.
