After 24 hours into this game Im done with one third of the story I guess.. So far the story has been ever so immersive and catching as the predecessors. In Fact I think Origins matches even Black flag in that! For me the cinematics and acting aswell as a believable story is fundamental in a singel player game. On top of the story is loads and loads of side missions and exploring to do so youll not get bored quickly.This game looks stunning on my i7 5820K and GTX1080 rigg and runs at 60fps in 2K 144hz on Ultra high settings. The amount of freedom in movement and the insane number of animations is also breathtaking imo. I have not been a devoted fan of Ubisoft and havnt got many of their games in my library but this masterpiece Id recomend any day even for you Ubisoft haters out there!I had only two crashes so far and only when tabbing out of game. The only big con for me is that the controler settings are not saved correctly which leads to that you have to reconfigure after everytime you reconnect your controller!
