A ing bug force me to abondon this game. This bug occured  when I was doing a main storyline quest in Memphis. In this mission Im supposed to escort the wounded brother of the twin priestess to his own house. But as soon as I arrived at the destination of the mission, the game crashed. I had tried many times over 10 times I guess but the problem couldnt be solved. I have spent over 20 hours on this ing piece ofgame. and now I get stucked and cant even finish the main storyline. Honestly speaking, I doubt that AC Origin is a semifinished product.
