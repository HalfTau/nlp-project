Definitely the BEST Assassins Creed game. I was skeptical at first but after debating with myself, I decided to preorder the game. The last Assassins Creed game I preordered was I think Syndicate or Unity, that was a mistake. They were mediocre but they were a little too modern. Ancient Egypt is a fantastic setting and the combat is much nicer than previous Assassins Creed games. I would definitely say to buy this if you liked the previous games!
