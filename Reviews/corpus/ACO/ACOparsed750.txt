This is the worst Assassins Creed game ever  and thats why Origins is so good.Origins breaks away from the stagnent Assassins Creed series and reinvents itself, and its all for the better.The combat esspecially shines in Origins, I refrain from saying its Dark Souls but the free feeling combat system sure does remind you of it. On top of the new combat system is an entirley new Role Playing component not seen in Assassins Creed, before you always played as someone else and replicated what they would do, but in Origins you can finally play asand for the first time you truely craft the story of the main character.
