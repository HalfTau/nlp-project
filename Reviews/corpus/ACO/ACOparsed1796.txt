Been playing the game for 13hours.Here I am to write a comment for those who havent bought the game yet.JUST BUY THIS SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS GAME!Why? I will list the reasons belowspoiler ALERTGameplay eliminate your enemies in a variety of methods, play as an assassin/warrior/prophet, an eagle will serve as your scout, how cool is that!  You can just stick to the main quest unraveling the first assassins story line, how he avenge for his lost son, or finish the side quest such as helping someone out /killing a beast while roaming, the control is simple and stupid, whether you had played the franchise or not, you will get the hang of it within seconds.Graphic Melodramatic. Beautiful sights featuring vast desert, persianlike architecture, pyramids, oasis, and tons of crocodiles,haha! You will be amazed how detailed they were able to recreate the scenes of the mighty Egypt empire. Notice how Bayek shakes his hand when he gets out of water, big thumbs to that. Once you have played this game, I think you dont even have to go to Egypt. You know the land like the back of your hand through the game!Music One of a kind. As soon as you listen to the soundtrack, you get this exotic feeling instantly, drenched completely in the Egyptian culture. As you make progress, you will hear different themes, too.Alright, so much for it, i think this game is worth a try, really appreciate the quality of the Assassins creed franchise.
