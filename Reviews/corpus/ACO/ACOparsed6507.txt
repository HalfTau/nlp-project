Feels like an Assassins Creed but doesnt.  Thats not a bad thing.  Its new and refreshing.  If you are a fan of the series youll apprechiate the new mechanics.  If you are only a fan of Black Flag, youll apprechiate that it doesnt feel like a typical Assassins Creed game.Bugs for me have been nonexsistant. Not one.I have maxed out all options on graphics and it runs like a dream.  And boy, is it beautiful?
