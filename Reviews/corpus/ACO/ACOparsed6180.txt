Overall a solid 8/10, combat is very interesting and challenging, story is good, better than the last two AC games. However performance is not stable. Sound and frames sometimes glitches, stutters, which really kills the immersion. Will be a good game after some patches.By the way, is anyone struggling with stealth? The enemies spot my a/ss instantly even when I just pop out the bushes a little bit from half a mile away.
