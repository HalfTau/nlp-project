Definitely one of the best installments in the series. They finally fixed the combat system, the story is solid, and the setting is just to die for. The world is MASSIVE. Ive spent probably around 40 hours just exploring the open world so far and Ive still got about 10 of locations to hit up. Definitely worth your time and money.
