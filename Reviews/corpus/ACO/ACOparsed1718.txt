The game is good, combat system is really hard there are lower level enemies with shields who are faster than me and I cant hit them but the game constantly crashes at every cutscene. Until the latest patch I could counter this by disabling the last two CPU threads but not anymore.Edit Since patch 1.2.0 crashes are reduced almost 100. The game is playable. Thanks.
