This is a beautiful open world game.The world detail is fantastic. The world is very big and tons of stuffs to explore.The combat has changed for good, but will have to improve and build on this combat system for the next versions.As i said there are lot of side contents all over the map but there are no in depth side quests like in witcher.Its more quantity over quality.The main story is soo vague.Dont buy the game if you are looking for a good story.There is a decent story, but how its narrated and implemented is so bad and silly.the last few hours of the story is a total mess and youll end up finishing the game without any feeling for anything. The AI of the game is still poor, just like the previous games.
