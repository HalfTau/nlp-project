Ryzen 5 14008GB RamRX 570 4GBStill crashes while i am playing it. Other games in my library works just fine. I played for 30 minutes and the game is still stuck on the battle with the first enemy. Everytime i hit him, the game just crashed. I think ive had enough. I had so much expectation with this game, the trailer looks very promising. But the result is just so dissappoiting. Dont buy this game until they fix it.
