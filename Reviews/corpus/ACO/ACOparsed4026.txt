I would recommend this game because simply, its great. BUT the performance issues are what really hold it back, using a 6core i7 with liquid cooling, GTX 1080, on an SSD, running it at 60fps with no stuttering, so whats wrong? Dont plan on running this game at ultra high unless you really want to burn your CPU up, i was hitting about 60c on ultra high when most games i hardly break 50c on the same settings. People are blaming Denuvo/VMWare, using a double antipiracy program which really taxes the CPU which i would have to agree with, idk what game ive played recently that has just put my CPU usage to 100 constantly other than this one. Ubisoft needs optimize the game so it doesnt hurt gameplay for customers who actually paid for it.
