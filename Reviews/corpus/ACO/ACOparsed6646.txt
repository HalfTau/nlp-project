Early Impression...I absolutely love this game so far lol. Its everything I hoped for while watching videos and doing some research the last couple months. Think they did a great job adding the rpg elements and the new combat system. Its fresh and new yet not so drastic a change that it doesnt feel like Assassins Creed anymore.Running this on i6700k / gtx1080 / 16gb ram / 1440p monitor and Im averaging around 60 fps give or take with max settings, for those wondering about performance. Not really great optimization but decent I guess. That being said the game feels very smooth and it looks wonderful. Even if I play on my 4k tv with some tweaking on highhighest and the fps is around 40 fps it feels stable. Cant wait to sink a bunch of hours into this bad boy.Update So Im about 20 hours into the game I can honestly say this game is amazing. The main story, side quests, and other activites in the game are extremely fun and immersive. The combat too me is very satisfying and rewarding specially when you get use to it. Its exciting. Plain and simple. Wether Im shooting an arrow through someones head while on horse back, beating their skull in with a warhammer, or just sticking my hidden blade into their jugular Im thoroughly enjoying myself.I know it prolly sounds like im just a pure assassins creed fanboy, but im not really...I just like good video games especially rpgs, action games, and stealth. And this game is the perfect blend of all of them. In my opinion it is a masterpeice and a must play. A masterpeice in mechanics and gameplay set a in a world of beauty and intrigue. It doesnt get much better than this.10/10 GOTYExtremely Recommended!
