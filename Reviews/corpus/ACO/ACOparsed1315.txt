More often than not, statbased RPGs tend to make you always feel inferior, because enemies not only become more powerful, but they also level alongside you. But in this game it isnt the case, getting better gear and upgrading it actually gives you an edge instead of just inflate the stats. Also the difficulty is regionbound, so if something is too hard, you can always return when you are better equipped.The world is staggering, the dialogue between NPCs is amazing and immersive, the foliage is stunningly beautiful and the animal kingdom also adds another layer of liveliness. There are so many amazing cities and things to see, this game and its visuals are defining the future of how a game should look.Finally, FINALLY! The AC series has become a fully fledged stealth game, I have been waiting for this too many years that Ive lost count. The predecessors of AC Origins have always had some stealth elements, but thing like sneaking around havent reached their full potential, and finally there is proper stealth.I felt like there was a lot of Tomb Raider inspiration in this game, which is a solid plus from me, I absolutely love the Tomb Raiderseries. Exploring secret areas, finding hidden goodies and solving puzzles is always fun when its done right, which this game has nailed. I hate when games overdo collectiblesThe story is a bit clich, but the meta story surrounding the person studying Bayek was quite interesting. The mix of real history from the Ptolemy period with the AC fiction was interesting. Real historic figures appear in the game, like Cleopatra and Ptolemy.The performance and optimization are lacking a lot, Im struggling to get 60fps at maxed settings because my CPU is getting bottlenecked, the latest drivers havent fixed any performance what Ive noticed. Hoping new ones will fix the issue soon.8,5/10
