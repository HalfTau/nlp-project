Assassinss Creed Origins is a step above its predecessors in almost every aspect.  Its story is a bit weak but not enough to detract from any enjoyment.  If you enjoyed any of the Assassins Creed games, Origins beautifully crafted world and familiar mechanics make for a great game all around.  Definately passes the one dollar one hour test.
