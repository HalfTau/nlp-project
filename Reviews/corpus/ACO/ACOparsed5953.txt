Apart from the poor optimization of the game given that I run a GTX 1060 6gb with i57500 cpu, 1TB of space and 8gb RAM and still get 30 fps on medium settings its already very fun to play. I dont think I even have an hour of recorded game time and I already love it. It is indeed extremely different, though. Sneaking, running, climbing, attacking, animus pulse kind of a setback for me but I can adapt quickly, everything. You definitely will have a hard time at first. Then again, who likes an easy game? I just hope there will be a graphics update even though Ive never paid attention as to whether Ubisoft actually updates Assassins Creed games once they have been released. All in all, you better have one mean son of a  of a computer if you want that game to run smoothly on Very High settings. I definitely recommend it nonetheless.
