Best Assassins Creed in years. I believe that leaving a bigger pause between games is a good idea and the way it has moved towards openworld RPG games has also paid off. Next game should go in these steps, modify what doesnt work well and add more things to do I loved building the brotherhood, hiring people, building base or bases....
