Actually really enjoyed the game. Im a completionist so I played it all the way though, finished all quests, got all achievments ect. Was a refreshing new take on AC gameplay. However, after patch 1.2 the game insta crashes after launch. Verified files integrity, uninstalled/reinstalled... No dice. Its been a few days since the patch dropped and still no update. So the game is unusable... unfortunate. Had little to no performance issues before this patch with 60 to 70 fps 2K w/ gsync.SpecsGTX 1080 ASUS STRIXI7 7700K16 GB DDR4 3200 RAMCrosshair V FormulaZ MOBO
