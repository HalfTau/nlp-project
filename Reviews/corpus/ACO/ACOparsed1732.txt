See, Watch Dogs 2 did something right.I gave A damn about Marcus and was A bit invested into his identity, I also became more and more interested in seeing him win.This game doesnt really do that for me.It sacrifices story arcs and beats for quick immediate action to get you into the game, and whatever.
