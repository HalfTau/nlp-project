For what I have seen, it is a very good game.Maybe not the best gameplay ever but simple and vast enough to provide fun for everyone after 30 min needed to understand how it works  the gameplay is far better than in all other ACs. Also, one of the games with the best environment ever  massive open world full of life in an interesting era in an interesting country.I had a few little bugs but on that matter it is far better than most AAA for that only a few texture glitches in remote areas. UX could maybe be a little bit improved it is often hard to follow NPC and the ingame interface can become a little messy sometimes, but nothing to worry about.It runs with medium parameters on my 800e 6 monthsold laptop at 3545 fps to compare, it is more than Civ 6 on my computer, which is quite amazing because graphics are very good the game animates a lot of water, light effect, fire effect, birds ... which are usually quite hard to render, good textures, very good DA, good optimization work.One omnipresent in the current AAA industry problems  ingame transactions. They are a little bit hidden you need to press a button during the pause menu to reach the market, and have little to no impact on the game you can have a very good  shiny stuff by doing annex quests, but knowing it exists annoys me. Same thing for the DRM...
