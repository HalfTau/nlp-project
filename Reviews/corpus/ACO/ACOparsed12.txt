Even though at high settings I run 4050 fps rarely 30 it is an awesome game! It reminds me of Far Cry 3. If I turn down my graphical settings it only gets worse, so high / ultra high works best for me.I would call this game Far Cry 3 Egyptian Edition. So if you, like me loved Far Cry 3 and dont mind if it is swords instead of guns, then this game is just for you and I can only recommend it. Crafting, assaulting camps, exploring unkown places, destroying propaganda, hunting, bows3, abilities etc.NPCs can act a bit weird sometimes. It doesnt affect the game, it just look silly.If you want to know my PC specsCPU Intel Core i5 4690  3.50GHz, Haswell 22nm TechRam 8 GB, 799 MHzGPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB I use a Zowie XL LCD 144Hz screen which helps a lot on the low fpsI may update this review sooner or later since I only have 6.8 hours of playtime
