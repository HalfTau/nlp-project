I gotta say, this is an incredible game. By far one of the best open world games I have ever played. I am 20 hrs in and I have barely scratched the surface. The setting is stunning, the graphics are great, the weapons are awesome and the quests dont feel tedious. Ubisoft really hit it out of the park on this one, if you have never played an assassins creed game, this is for you. If you have played all of them, this is for you. If you didnt like the assassins creed games, this is for you.Spectacular. Truly.
