right now? every other game on my steam list works, including other assassins creed games. but this one, despite having 35 hours in it already, will not let me click anything or use the keyboard at all. i can load up, and half the time it loads into a windowed mode where i cant change anything either. so in its current state for me, its completely unplayable and total bullsht. wanna kill some time before the crazy holiday and i cant even press any key to continue. way to go ubisoft
