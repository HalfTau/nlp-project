After 67 hours I took a break. Yesterday I reinstalled the game, and can now not play the Gold Preorder because they cannot verify ownership. Support hopes they can help me.Ubisoft need to alter their antipiracy stance and behaviour, or I will pirate their games no matter if I want to play them or not.Interesting gameconcepts, spiteful treatment of customers. Do Not Buy Ubisoft Games!
