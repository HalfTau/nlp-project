3 months after buying this game and it is still completely broken for me due to intense stuttering. I purchased this game November 16, 2017 and have yet to play this game for a minute without game breaking stuttering. Its been over 3 weeks of the devs working on the issue so hopefully I might be able to play the game in March, but honestly I could care less at this point.By following Ubisoft Supports diagnostic procedures I have put over 3 hours into the game making it unelidgable for return. Instead of patching game breaking bugs they released a bunch of new micro transaction items and a DLC... Me and likely hundreds of other people payed 60 for a game that is completely unplayable, and rather then acknowledge that the game even has these major issues they go on to sell DLC for this broken game. This will be the last Ubisoft product I ever buy, which is a shame because originally when I bought this game I wanted so badly to play it and I probably would of given it a positive review. I also supported and played Siege up until now, but I wont support a company that conducts buisness this way. I was also looking forward to buying Far Cry 5 but there is 0 of me ever buying a ubisoft game again after this.Gameplay footage showing stuttering
