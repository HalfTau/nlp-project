This game is so amazing.It runs very well 59100 fpsvaries on region of map w/ GTX 1080 and i74770K 4.0GHz.The Graphics are truly stunning.The main quest is intriguing although I felt like some things went way too quickly and didnt give much significance.The map is hugeeee, 27 hours into the gamewith main quest beaten and I still have like 5 regions left to check out.There are also a ton of side quests and tons of things to do, I mean with how much time I have into this game theres still so much stuff let for me to do.This is actually worth 59, thank you Ubisoft for an amazing game that I will have so much fun with for a long while.
