i would give a 6/10 rating for this.. its a decent game, i will play more. its just pretty boring and generic feeling, like i could have bought shadows of war and had the same amount of fun.game felt dulled down, the plots where boring and the combat was overly simple.optimization was a issue at times, although the game looks good and runs well.....more bugs in this game then in a egypt tomb. i hope they update soon so i can get back into the game because i had a few that just turned me off from playing more.
