Ah, I love this game. I bought all the dlc which came with great extra content. Its expesive though. I also want all the different mounts and outfits, but cant justify spending the money cause it seems rotten to charge so much for the extra stuff. Why couldnt they make it to where we have to EARN it or just simply make it alot cheaper? Sigh, Im weak and will prolly spend 50 on mounts and such. Whyyyyy!!!!! So Mean!!!
