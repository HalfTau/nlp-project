EDITOk, after 73 hours, Ive finished the main story, visited every point of interest or at least I think I did, since theres none showing up on the map, but that may be because some points of interest only show up when you get close enough to them, and I think Ive done every side quest except those related to papyrus/papyri? because I suck at them and Im not inclined to use guides to find them, completed every Gladiator Arena on normal mode, havent even tried Hard Mode yet, but I will soon and upgraded all my gear to max level before the Hidden Ones DLC came out, so now theres even more upgrades.Now, Ive been playing the Hidden Ones DLC and I just feel so happy that theres still things to do in this game. The DLC doesnt bring many actually NEW things to the game, but it just keeps going on the same formula that worked so well on the main game, and thats more than I could hope for. Im really glad that Ubisoft has done this right at least for me, but I hope that more fans feel the same way, because Ive been a huge fan of Assassins Creed series since the first one back when it launched, it was the first new gen game I played and I 100 it at least 7 times and it saddened me to see the series go in a Call of Duty style life cycle, in which they would just rinse and repeat the same aging game in a different setting over and over again.All in all, its an AMAZING game, that borrows a lot from many other great games out there like Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Far Cry and Horizon Zero Dawn and mix them up in a not so classic Assassins Creed way, giving a new breath of life to the series while keeping many of the things that turn it in what it is today, and it works great, both for newcomers to the series and for fansEND OF EDITI was going to write a long review blabbing about how I think this is the best Assassins Creed since Brotherhood and how Im extremely happy to love an Assassins Creed game once again, but Ill just cut to the chase here Ive been playing for 36 hours ANOTHER EDIT 73 hours Im not even half through it ANOTHER EDIT 2 I guess I was half way through, after all, since it took me around 72 hours to finish the main story I actually liked the new combat although I dont think it was the best choice Ive visited only one third of the map its HUGE and filled with places to explore EDIT Ive visited the whole map now, but its still HUGE and filled with places to explore and new things to see and learn Cheesy jokes and random facts on loading screens Ive set myself on fire a lot A LOT The storys actually pretty good Its OH SO PRETTY The parkour is kinda weird Unitys was better, but it grows on you and it feels really fluid, specially when youre trying to be stealthy Im not bored yet still true It has the best stealth in the Assassins Creed series in my opinion, of course Last but not least, its so good it has kept me from playing Super Mario Oddisey and thats saying a lot.Oh, and BTW, Im playing on Ultra High settings, 1980x1080, and I havent had a single issue besides a few random FPS drops it goes from 60 to 50 sometimes, but it doesnt seem to be related to crowded areas or anything like that, it just happens from time to time, but it never happend during a fight or any life or death situation.
