Definitely bestin last years. Big open world, finally interesting side quests and other activities. steam achievements  finally! first Assassins Creed game that have them  difficulty settings  same as above  likeable and interesting main character Bayek awesome big world with plenty of activities set in ancient Egypt really enjoyable gameplay new combat system  its not perfect though  big variety in weapons looks great sounds great RPG elements photo mode cant kill chickens  yup! microtranscations  you can buy some costumes, mounts, boost to exp/money etc. basically nothing special but its there..... well some side quest could use some more work
