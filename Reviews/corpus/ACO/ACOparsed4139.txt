So to start this Review of the game of and give you the right understanding of me.Hi i am kevin and i played all of the Assassins Creed  games so far and love some and hated some.I played the very first one when it came out  and directly fell in love with it,it was something new traversing over the Rooftops of Damascus,Jerusalem etc.But as the series was going on it got dull the combat felt to easy while the storys were still good but kinda on the way downhill aswell.But coming to the part thats important now.I got the Game Gifted by a Friend and was interested before.The Setting Looked GoodA Diffrent Combat SystemNo Climbing Towers to Unlock the MapIt was at this moment were i though the game looks like its gonna be quite decent but let me stop here boy oh boy i didnt expect this.The Game Literally Left me Awestruck i played it for 83,8 Hours so far and i am sad that i finished the Side quests and Main quests.The main story would be aroun 3035 HoursWhile the Rest has been side quests and freeing eqypti could make a count of how many things i like about the Game but it would be far to long so i just list someChallenging Gameplay/Combat is not click to block its acutally timing and thinkingThe Map is Massive and a Beatiful Craftsman workAlexandria,Mepmhis etc look like you would imagineIf you like History from that time a very good ExperinceRPG Elements with diffrente Weapons to choose that change your fighting styleEnough Side Stuff and Filler in the World to Keep you OccupiedSo After listing some of the Stuff over to the best partThe Story is written very well and center around your main character Bayek and his wife Aya who are on a quest for vengance against the Order of Ancients.The Charactes are written well and at some points of the story you can really feel what is happening around you.You will be meeting mutiple people of this time that are quite famous in History like Cleopatra,Casear or Potlomey and witness the Birth of a Creed.Enough about the story shall we look at the PeformanceOne thing that is causing some problems currently is that people report problems about the DRM hogging the Ram of your Pc.To that i can say i didnt have too many problems with Peformance only that in certain parts of the game it dropped from 6055 FPS donw onto 40 but as the change was not really felt in the game i didnt mind it.Well there is more i could write but i think this will be more than enoughI can recommend getting the game as for me its my game of the year.I enjoyed every last bit of it and hope i got you intrestedThanks for Reading Kevin out
