I have a i7 4790k with a 1080 FTW and i could not run it on 4k, period. i tired the lowest settings and still unstable in the 20s, but somehow i can run 4k max on other games with no serious problems like this. Game is GREAT so far, however, they need to fix how it runs.Update I have seen many reviews with the same problem as far as running the game, i however, ended up going 2k res and ultra and im getting much better results, 60FPS with no problems.The game world is also amazing and i already have 2 hours in and have only touched the first mission.Im giving it a thumps up mainly because the game works perfectly on 2k res, for me and i havent run into ANY bugs.
