This game is great, it has an awesome storyline, I love the setting and the vast amount of places to explore, the many things you can do ect. Running this game with GTX 1080 ti and i7 5820K and still getting 6080 fps. I enjoy the storyline, side quests and everything. I dont really have anything to complain about except a few points in the game where I have random frame drops a bit but which is something I can live with. Its bareable. The game is in overall really great and its definitely not something I would get bored of so fast.
