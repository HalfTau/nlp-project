You know, there is nothing I hate more than dark marketing... Whatdo I mean by that? It is when people or persons market an idea or a product by underhand means.Why do I believe that about this title? Because yet again, the high anticipation has been utilized as a means to get someone else to do the hard work and cost them to do so.Over the next say six months, this title will eventually become more optimized and playable as it should have been upon release. Many people wil defend Ubisoft and keep the 49.99 title, sending in feedback and helping Ubisoft a multimillion dollar outfit to fix the problems that this title suffers from, and they will do it at a cost of 49.99.When said title is finally playable the way it should have been, the price will have dropped, title available much cheaper because of the passage of time and Ubisoft have screwed many.Forget it, I will buy this when I am not paying Ubisoft to beta test their rushed ports.
