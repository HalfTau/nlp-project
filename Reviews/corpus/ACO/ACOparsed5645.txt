Its pretty amazing so far!It has a huge open world to explore with plenty to do and its defenitely a fresh take on the AC series.Just a few things that I like are the ability to us 1h,2h, dual blades,bows,xbows, and other weapons. The combatis no longer just spam parry and counter, you actually have to multi task and fight with some thought.The world is very detailed and beautiful, it runs 4060fps on my GTX 970. I would also recommend using acontroller as there are alot of buttons.In short, I was hopeing it wasnt just another AC. It turned out to be, IMO a completly new experience and would reccomend it.
