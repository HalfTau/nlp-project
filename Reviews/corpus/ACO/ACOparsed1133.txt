So Ive finished all of the previous Assassins Creed games except Unity Because it wouldnt run and Ive got to say that this is possibly one of the least interesting games in the series. Its just not fun. The ranged weapons are too powerful and make the stealth trivial. All the leveling system does it lock out content. Like sure as a level 26 you can take down level 40 badguys without any trouble but the damage reduction means that youll be there for hours. Its one of the larger Assassin Creed games but all that translates to is that you spend more time traveling. The mounts you get are incredibly slow and the run speed of the character is so bad that I honestly thought that I had toggled walk on.Its just a chore to play.
