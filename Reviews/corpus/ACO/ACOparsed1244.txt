Great revival too a dead series. Ive played all the previous assassins creed games starting from ACII all the way to ACIV on console, every game was amazingly fun, the ezio series easily being my favourite although did not make any other game feel any lesser than the other. I then had a break from the series from when i swapped to pc, only just starting to get back into it after assassins creed syndicate was released, I tried the 3 new games rogue, unity and syndicate and was dissapointed, The series really felt dead and I thought I would be done with the series.When I saw origins, It looked good being a new setting we havent seen before but was still hesitating to try. With the christmas sale I decided to buy it, and Im amazed on how well they did with it, the series feels revived to me, everything feels new to me even the parts that i was so used to, Im 15 hours in as of this review and I love it so far. 9.5/10 easily.
