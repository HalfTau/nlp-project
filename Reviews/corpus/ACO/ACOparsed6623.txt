Microtransactions in a non free to play game enough said. That being said this game is a huge improvment over Unity and Sindicate in almost every way, but unforunatly the microtransactions keep me from suggesting this game to anyone.Added I would also stay away from this game as they sold us a season pass that dosnt even include the dlc they are releasing. They have released 4 packs 2 of which season pass holders have to pay seperatly for, or wait till they add them to heka chests. AVOID THIS GAME TILL THIS IS SORTED OUT!
