Review with SPOILERS!StorySo u play a woman u only see for about 5 minutes that dreams of being Bajek.Bajek thinks hes a Medjai. A person that should help everyone and is something like apolicemen today. But Bajek is more like Officer Doofie from Scary Movie 1 and so it doesnt take longuntil he kills his own son. Now Bajek totaly gets mad an insults nearly everyone and gives nearly everyone, despite himself the fault for the death of that boy.On his journey of death hes killing bazillions of people and thousands of peacful animals to make bags and stuff out of them.After every kill of one of the guys  that has a unique name  Bajek loses the last connection to the real world and we see some spacy videos of these dreams in the dream Inception?.Sometimes u even play as Aya. Bajeks wife. Shes like Bajek mostly occupied with murdering people and spents an unhealty amount of time on ships with an old drunk guy.Big goal is to kill everyone on ur deathlist! U do that... GGAnd theres something with aliens i found quiet boring.10/10 for creativity!GameplayGeneric Open World 0815Go there kill that. Go there collect that. Go there and reajust stars and talk to ur dead son.Beautiful world. Repetetive tasks. /7,5/10 for huge map and lots of massmurderGraphics/PerformanceHolymy Cpu is burning. Game is beautiful but not really optimized.With my specs I7700k,Gtx1070,too much Ram i nearly never dipped under the magical 60 fps border.For me it was fine, but i think weaker systems would have problems.Very Cpu intensive... and if ur ram is single channel get another stick  20 frames 5/10 for beautiful graphics and bad optimisationConclusionEasy 100 achievo game. Lots to do. Great graphics. Story for the trash can.Turn ur brain off and enjoy!7,5/10
