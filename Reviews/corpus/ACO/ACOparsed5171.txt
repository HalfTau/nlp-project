I dont get why many people find this game unplayable. Ive been running it totally fine with no crashes, bugs or major fps drops, infact my fps is constantly staying around 60.Origins really surprised me on how good it is. Im only 7.5 hours in and im already seeing it as better than AC2 Still the best for now.As long as your PC is decent, this game will run fine!10/10.
