A fun return to the Assassins Creed franchise. The scenery is nothing short of amazing. Sidequests galore! Eagle vision is literal eagle vision the game has you control an eagle named Sanu. The main character is interesting but the cliche tropes are back. Man redeems himself.. etc... etc.. fun game nontheless.
