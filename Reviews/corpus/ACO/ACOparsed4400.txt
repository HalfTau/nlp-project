So with a little less than 40 hours ingame at time of writing this, I have to say one thing and one thing onlyThe water in ACO looks so incredibly well made, you can almost smell  taste it. Im not kidding. I have never seen a game with such a realistic water shader than this. Providing you run the game on max qualityIn all seriousness though, I havent played such a good and well made Assassins Creed game since Brotherhood. And Ive played them all. The story and environment of Egypt didnt get to me before I started playing, hence I didnt pick this up right after it launched. But I have to say that I have zero regrets. The game looks and feels amazing.The only downside Ive found so far is that at some point, some of the activities feel a little repetitive clear area x, loot area y, slay beast z, etc.
