AC going back to its beginnings.Very good title. Especially like the idea that the whole team gave up on the idea of doing 1 per year and sticks now with 1 per 2 years. The game brought a lot of improvements.Parkour has never been more simple. Amazing combat system. Great events. Story and character development finally done in a proper way which hasnt been done properly since AC 2.Great job.
