The game DID play well and looked good but once I got past the point of no return and passed 2 hours, the game played at around 15 frames and looked awful. I wish I bought it on my ps4 for a consistant framerate with good looking graphics. IF THERE IS A WAY TO GET THIS GAME ON MY PS4 WITHOUT BUYING IT AGAIN, SOMEONE TELL ME!Edit You guys think im blaming the game for my problems, BUT Im not. You are right, my computer isnt powerful enough to play it. It played fine at the start, but now its not. The only reason I gave it a bad review is because I am not the only person having gameplay problems.
