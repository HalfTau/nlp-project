Such a great game so far, the map design is beautiful and the game runs so smoothly, and Id actually rate it one of the best AC titles among all that was made. Tons of fun with my friends playing this game. Although there was a massive change up in the combat system compared to the old AC titles, I think it was good that they took a step forward and tried something new. Also really liking the crafting and looting systems, and being able to change to different kinds of weapons to suit the players playstyle..
