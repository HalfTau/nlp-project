Great game, lots of quests, the main story is good however not as good as the Witcher stories, I dont get as involved with the character as I did with the witcher series.The Open world is huge, and you really get the feeling of being in it, technically they made it into a great experience.The game CTD a lot, Im not sure if its my PC or because the game is not 100 polished. Some bugs here and there but nothing I would consider a problem, just annoying.The crafting in ACO is just a push a button, not very creative so maybe that was a last minute oh we need this too implemented in the game.Go get it if you like open world games with a main story and side quests.
