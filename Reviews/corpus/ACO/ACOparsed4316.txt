Game is amazing and the best in the series, not really sure about all the performance gripes. Im see some frame drops rarely in cities, and thats rarely. The only negative about the game I can find is the loot system is just not fleshed out, traits for weapons are a after thought, its something that they can improve on.Permformance I am running a 1080 ti seeing 3568 fps on 4k. I also have a second 1080 ti mining in the background. with a second screen running web browser. No slow down I can see also I have a i75930k and im using a SSD 32 gb ram. I dont see any real performance issues but my pc is beast so there may be real performance issues still so heed other reviews.Game is great though.
