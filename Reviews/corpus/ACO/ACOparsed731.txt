Yes the map is designed beautifully from oasis of the nile river and desert around giza is fun to explore Memorable side quest  some side quest is probably get you in the feels  you can pet cats Nomad Bazaar  Reda is my homie  Better combat , probably a little like the witcher killing phylakes Solving papyrus puzzle is fun if you like riddleCONS  Stutter Not challenging at all , fighting flavius on hardest difficulty  still piece of cake  just roll and roll  Sea battle is boring sometimes follow road not workingConclusion  If you like Open World RPG games you must get this , its fairly recommended , and i personally think its worth full price , i finished main quest on 76 hours and im not finished side quest , undiscovered location and tower yet , it means its still has a lot things to do , Just give it a try8.5/10
