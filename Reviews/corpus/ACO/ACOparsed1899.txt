Graphically this is a very impressive game, but I found the plot disappointing, especially the later parts which seem strangely rushed. For a game supposed to describe the origin of the assassins, the story is really just a basic revenge plot with uninteresting antagonists who seem to have no deeper motivation than being parodically evil. The main character is well acted and the trauma he suffers at the beginning of the game is handled well, but the engaging parts of the narrative are spread far too thin, and padded with so much grinding that the game more often than not feels like an MMO. The assassin order is thrown in almost like an afterthought, and when it comes to the overall scifi metaplot of the Assassins Creed universe, Origins adds next to nothing.Still, it is an amazingly beautiful game, and it might be worth playing just for the spectacle. I dont regret buying it, but in retrospect I wish I hadnt preordered the game especially not the deluxe edition. Also, Im sorry to say that this will probably be the last Assassins Creed game I buy. I liked Origins far better than Syndicate, but the series as a whole is just not good enough to keep me interested anymore, especially the modern day plot which has been standing still for four games now.So buy this game on sale, as long as you dont expect too much in terms of story, but skip the season pass and everything to do with microtransactions.
