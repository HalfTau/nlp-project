I have an i74790k and a GTX 970. No matter what settings I ran the game at, the framerate was awful, my CPU was at 100 usage, and it was impossible to enjoy the game.There are two possible reasons that my beast of a rig couldnt handle this gameOne, Ubisoft chose a DRM that will tank the gameplay experience and ruin consumers computers by overworking the CPU, showing once again that they only care about making a few extra bucks.Two, Ubisoft is horrible at optimization and pushed out a buggy product because they care more about making money than providing consumers with a good experience.And thats without getting into the shady gambling/microtransactions that they forced into a singleplayer game...Ubisoft is a horrible company that doesnt deserve your money. Ive refunded, and you should too.
