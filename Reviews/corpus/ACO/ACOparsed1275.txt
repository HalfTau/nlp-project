Too many stuttering, random pauses, and the most annoying of all is that goddamn TEXTURE POPPING every minute or so making the game borderline unplayeable. How am i supposed to fight soldiers that just stand waiting the texture to come out? Ubisoft really need to patch this game before i would recommend it.
