This game made me finally get over the two disasters Unity and Syndicate.....kids,always wait for the right one sniff.....never rush.....or you will end up wasting your time....and money PGraphically this game is just breathtaking and well optimised for me atleastThere are bugs though,nothing game breaking but if you have tolerated Skyrims bugs then you can tolerate this one tooThe RPG shift is great but you may take time to get used to it since we have always seen AC games in a different light before.But lets say coz of the RPG angle,you will find a motivation to actually do the available activities in the game ,coz of the levelling up system.Bayek is an interesting and well acted character,defintely my favourite after Ezio.Story is good,but dont expect anything spectacular like the Ezio trilogy.At the end.....this is a game which should satisfy all the RPG and Open world lovers !! !
