Game looks great, runs fine enough. Map is huge. Parkour is okay.In the end, I refunded it. Why you ask?Combat is dull as can be, even the stealth takedowns are boring.I just felt so disconnected from the combat, just swinging my weapons wildly.Really sucks because I really wanted to like this game.
