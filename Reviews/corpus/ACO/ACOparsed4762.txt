Assissns Creed Origins is a great game. This game feels like the witcher 3 only in Egypt. I am enjoying the main quest while completing every side quest I get. I would recommend this game and I gave up on the Assassins creed series and havent played after about an hour into AC3, but this game brought me back.My specsRyzen 1600  3.832GB 3200 RAMGTX 1070Gsync Acer Predator  1440pThe great CPU 100 meltdown debateEveryone is freaking out over CPU usage because their i5 is the bottleneck. Nobodys CPU has exploded and killed anyone, caught on fire, or been fried because of this game. Just enjoy the game knowing if it wasnt your CPU your GPU would be pegged  100. It would be the bottleneck.
