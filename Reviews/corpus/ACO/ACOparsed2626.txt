So far the most fun i have had in an AC game in years and i really enjoy the setting. I use a MSI NVidia GTX 970 4Gb and it runs all on high/ultra and just fine with no stuttering other than an occasional hiccup once in a while. Nothing to get mad or angry over, it doesnt hinder or mess up the amazing game or experience.God Bless!CW  2014
