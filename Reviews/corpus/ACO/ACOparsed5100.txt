Good game indeed.However.You should prepare a really highend PC to hit 60fps though. Plus it has absurdly high CPU drainage and poor multithread support.Got 4050 fps with E52683v3Vega56 on whatever graphic setting. You would like to reconsider the purchase if you have large multicore CPU.Building denuvo on VM sandbox is indeed the craziest DRM Ive ever heard about.Returned to console version.Still recommend it though.
