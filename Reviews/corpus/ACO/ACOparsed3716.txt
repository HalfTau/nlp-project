With all of the complaints out there about performance, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring.I have an i74790k  4.79 GHz and a 1080 ti, so it is far from a typical build, but for me 4K was out of reach without sacrificing heavily on the settings. So, I lowered my resolution scale to 90 of 4K, still pretty high, and put basically all settings at high and havent had a stutter over the last hour.On the gameplay side, I havent played long enough, but this is the first AC game I am into since Brotherhood. I have already had some intense stealth moments that got my heart racing, so for the moment it gets my recommendation.
