My target audience of this review is the consumer who is on the fence about getting the game.I want to state from the beginning that this is not a bad game, per se. In fact, in a number of respects I quite enjoy it.I love the setting, I wish more games were set in ancient Egypt and the ancient Near East in general. But that is the only truly great thing about this game in my opinion.Most of the rest of the game is not bad...but in my opinion that is the best that can be said about it. It is not great, it is just not bad. This creates a pervasive sense of disappointment every time I play this game.The worst part of the game, in my opinion, is the combat other than the DRM issues, and the inexcusable cash shop, but other reviewers have covered those. While conceptually I think the combat is an improvement over previous games in the series, the combat is just not where it should be. I was not expecting the combat to be as good as The Witcher 3, but this falls far shorter of the mark than I expected. Numb is the best word I can use to describe the controls which renders extended engagements tedious and frustrating.The story and characters have yet to engage me significantly. They have at least not annoyed me yet, but they arent interseting and as far as I have gotten in the story so far feel like a bundle of easy cliches.Im happiest in this game when I am running around exploring Egypt and avoiding the story.All this being said, if you like the Assassins Creed series, you should probably give this a try.Other than that, the price is too high for a mediocre experience...which I suppose is true for practically all AAA titles these days.If you are undecided about buying this game, are on a budget, and have other games that you are interested in, I would advise you to pass on this one.
