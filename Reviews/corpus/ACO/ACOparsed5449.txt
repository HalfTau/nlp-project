After finishing the main quest line, exploring the world, and doing many of the side quests this game succeeds in being a very good Assassins creed game. Its not perfect with glitchy characters, fighting, freeroaming and quests but its an assassins creed game what do you expect. The story at times can be very weak but overall, especially as you close in on the end it becomes a lot more engaging and interesting. The story outside of the Animus is also farely weak and we never really get to see much of what goes on. In terms of optimization I thought it was very well oprimized for my sad GTX 970, on very high settings I hovered around 50 fps and even on those settings the scenary was amazing. Overall this game was worth the wait but still doesnt take top spot in the franchise.
