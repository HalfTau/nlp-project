ACO is a great game.Amazing open world, fun combat system, impressive graphics the draw distance! O , acceptable story.Sadly, I dont want to recommend it because of the forced connection to uPlay, which is raw cancer. You can not play offline.So do I recommend this game? No. Just wait for a hum hum perfectly legal hum hum way to play it without playing and without connecting to theaids that is uPlay.Kind regards.
