This game is in a way super impressive! It has a huge world to play in and a game engine to make it all fun. I feel that it suffers from the same things that other AC games suffer from a lack of depth. You never really get enthralled by the story and you end up just sneaking around so much fun, killing mobs and clearing areas. Which is a ton of fun for a while, but after around 2030 hours of gameplay, I was already bored. Its very apparent that AC Origins has been harvesting a lot of stuff from games like Witcher 3 and Far Cry Primal mostly and even Tomb Raider. And its doing it well but in the end, I feel that it fails to deliver in terms of any real substance in art style, story/script, music and other areas that serve to capture you within a game world. Its similar to a shooter that way, its fun to play but doesnt really deserve too many hours played.Dont buy this game full price, Id recommend waiting for at least 40 off. Great potential. Most of it wasted.
