Negative review for one awesome game, It hurts to give this game a thumbs down due to technical issues, constant crashing, audio issues, fps drop, I have a decent pc and as you can see, even with this issues I find myself relaunching this game, its good, but if you can wait, then wait, this issues are too much considering its a full 60usd game.
