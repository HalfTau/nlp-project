Really fun. I love the Egyptian time period, especially with the Roman angle. I actually like the new combat systemit requires more skill than the old counter systemactually, its kind of like Dark Souls IIIs combat system. I just never locked on, and I did fine, even against groups. I didnt have any significant glitches/problems.My biggest complaint is just that the main character is pretty boring. Weve seen the out for revenge guy a million times.Aside from that, I didnt really like the cruisemissile arrow and UAV i.e. Eagle, but I can suspend my disbelief. Its an awesome game overall, and well worth the price. Ill get DLC when it comes out. The lootboxes/store never got in the way, nor is there any need to buy them although I would prefer if they werent there.
