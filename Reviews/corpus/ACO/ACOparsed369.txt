One of the best assassins creeds yet. The game is about 3040 hours depending on how you play, with very little of it being repetitive. All the side quest a like a mini campain, with most of them being differnet, and without this the game would be repitive as you need to do side quest to level up to do main missions.the game is worth every penny.
