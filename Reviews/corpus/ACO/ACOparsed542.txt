This is one of the best games Ive played in a long time. The graphics are beautiful, I havnt noticed any bugs, and the world is a joy to explore.I leveled up by doing the side quests and was never needed to grind so I could continue the story missions, in fact I was usually over leveled for them.I love the way Bayek moves through the world. If it looks like you should be able to climb it, you can. Its also not a platformer. He will never go over the side of a cliff unless you explicitly tell him too. That allows you to concentrate on your tactics which is what I want from this kind of a game. Going forward I think Im going to judge games that dont take this approach very harshly.They just need to add New Game and the ability to replay missions and Ill have everything I want.For their next game that incorporates stealth elements Id like them to take a few pages from Sniper Elite 4. I feel like that game had a more complete stealth system and better enemy AI.
