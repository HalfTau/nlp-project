this game is awesome in mostly every way. people having trouble with crashes or it being glitchy is because their settings are too high. this is the first game i wont run on ultra 4k because i only get 40 fps. settings at very high 4k is right at 60fps  and one of the most stunningly beautiful games ive played.
