Runs like looks likeand story is just t. So many events and arabic words are just wrong and madeup I wonder who did the R and D for this? I tried my best to like it in my 40 hrs of gameplay but nope.Quest are repeatitive af just like go free prisoner, kill a person, chase a person, bring n no of objects, my bro got captured get him etc, they just have different names just to fool us. Weapons are just procedurally generated with different levels, crafting is a JOKE indeed. Graphics are just ok, looks clayey, laggy and blurry to me tbh... rip.Loved the music but who cares... we want good gameplay, story and graphics.In assassins creed black flag you could literally feel the environment, graphics were crisper, quests had variations, animations were close to reality. I wish they could make another assassins creed so polished like that one.
