I was a big fan of Black Flag but found Syndicate too repetitive and that the storyline was dull.  I had high hopes for Origins but, sadly, Im really disappointed and wish I hadnt spent the money.  If you are an AC fan and you have to play this game, wait until its on sale.The biggest problem for me is that the storyline is dull the quests you go on are all around the same theme Ive lost this, someone has taken that  go get it for me and bring it back.  The lack of variation makes it so boring to play and I find myself dual screening whilst playing.   Levelling is irritating and adds to the poor experience of game play when you are level 10 you can kill anything up to, and including, level 10 with ease but enemies level 11 or 12 annihilate you immediately, even if you have invested heavily in stealth tactics.  Adversely, even on hard mode its not challenging enough to upgrade your armour and kit legendary weapons dont require enough struggle to feel special or well earned.Im not even going to start on how badly optimised the game isGive it a miss!
