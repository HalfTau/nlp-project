Game is fun for the 30 hours it takes to beat and then ehhh.....Slow support for pcDont get me wrong this game is amazing.. for 30 hours and then it gets old pretty quick.. id love to see more support and not DLC  support i mean nice new juicy content and not even new areas just a quest or 2 here and there or a small event or some weekly quests or somthing since the travelers bazzar is just an empty promise with no nightmare set stillI want to recomend this game but i cant when it has so much dlc for sale but the base game has just over 30 hours of content... how about pushing for more hours of game content with the released game before asking for  for 2hours more of contentalso wish ubisoft would spend half the effort on getting every single youtuber to play their games and more effort on actually testing how it feels how long did it take to beat was this a cool mechanic should this be changed do you find those packs worth the  but instead they send zillions of copys to spastics who can scream into a mic and swing around the op kit that ubi spawned them in their op mega noob tester dlc kit version of the gamethis game was to quick to beat for an actual gamer and i feel you would have found that out with propper testers and not mass handing the game out to youtubers who scream and yell for views but dont give you any valid input on the development side.I want to say get it but i cant it isnt what i hoped for but it came damn close..
