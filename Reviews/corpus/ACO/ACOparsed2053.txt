Worst game in all assassins creed and worst fight mechanics in all gaming history.There is a huge gap between enemies and bayek. you can not fight them without buying with helix credits / real money  legendry items. Meaningless side missions and impossible earn money. 4 level between enemy and bayek, a headshoot took 1/3 health of enemy but his arrow can took 95 health of you without headshot.Game mechanics like The Witcher but there is not any counter skill or proper defence systems. at least they could include some For Honor like fight system for red labeled enemies or phylakes.Animations are not impressive. For example assassins creed unitys climb animations are more natural than this.Also it has not an immersive Egypt exprience. Personal opinion, I dont need to discover all map. Yes there are pyramids and other historical things but they empty. They can not make you feel they are impresive.With ultra settings on 980 TI and GTX 1070 i7 5820K and i7 7700 HQ, graphics are not beyond the time like other peoples says. For example there is no shadow for statics objects. But there are a lot of post process effects and light rays for blow up graphics.in brief, this is not an AAA game. Its like an indie game.
