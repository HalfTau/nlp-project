Ok, so I love Origins. I mean it is arguably as good as black flag and some others in the series. Well there is one problem however in my opinion. The dlc... I bought the base game for 59.99 and then bought the dlc for 40 bucks... 100 dollars later so far the dlc is a joke! I beat the damn thing in a few hours. I thought there was going to be a huge questline perhaps, but what do you expect for five levels? Well first of all we spent 20 dollars less than the game cost new just for the dlc. For 40 dollars damn I could have gotten a decent full game... well anyway I have enjoyed it and have put in over 100 hours of grinding which is honestly very boring after a while. The same weekly bosses or at least similar and its getting majorly repetitive... come on ubisoft give us our money worth. I mean I want to see more story and perhaps even if you could introduce some coop play it wouldnt make it so bland after a while. Well I cant go a full 5 stars this time until something major happens in the expansion. In my opinion the hidden ones expansion flopped big time. I know others also agree with me too...
