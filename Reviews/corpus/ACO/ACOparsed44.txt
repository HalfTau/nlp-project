Not for me personally  I purchased the Gold edition and played for less than an hour only to realise that it is basically the same Assassins Creed core game reskinned in Ancient Egypt. It looks nice and I think that was the draw for me but after realising that aside from the pretty environment, there was nothing else I wanted from the game that I hadnt already done in previous games, I decided that I can watch loads of youtubers in game footage to see eye candy but really couldnt justify 50.00 for a pretty looking game that is all about grinding and levelling up  refunded. Its a shame as I love Ancient Egypt and think that what I wanted out of this game mroe than the game itself.
