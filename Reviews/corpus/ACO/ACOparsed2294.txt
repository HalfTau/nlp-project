So Ubisoft decided to take a year off and with that said, they made a masterpiece. This is EXACTLY what the Assassins Creed franchise needed. A soft reboot. Its fun, beautiful, filled with heart, and non stop brutal action. Runs like a dream on my machine and cant put it down. Cant wait to keep on exploring Egypt! Lets all hope that Ubisoft can continue with this amazing trend in all their future installments.
