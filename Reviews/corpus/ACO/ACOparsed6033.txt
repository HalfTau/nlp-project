Typical Assassins Creed release. Expect to ecounter bugs until they release a few patches. I had the crackling sound bug and had a bug where I couldnt finish a quest because an NPC wasnt tied up but was asking to be released. Resetting the game fixed the second, and the sound was fixed by disabling all of my output devices except my headphones. Other than the bugs, the game is pretty fun. The melee combat can be a bit frustrating using a controller with the default layout. I ended up swapping the dodge and quick attack buttons because that layout seemed better for me. The bow combat is great, and I immediatly beelined to the guided arrow ability which is by far my favorite part of combat. The assassinate and stealth parts are pretty much the same as other AC games. Overall, I have enjoyed the game and would recommend it.
