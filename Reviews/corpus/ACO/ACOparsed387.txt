Lots of new and intersting things in here for sure definitely a nice change of pace re. the series but also really stands up on its own as well.I enjoy the more Far Cryesque impetus to take on different situations in different and sometimes innovative ways with different perks, tools and weaponsVery dynamic and occasionally challenging gameplay Can walk in and out of the many levelled quests, locations and encounters at will and its also the first AC game where Ive desynced more from dying than mission failures, story is ok and even features a semirelatable protagonist9/10 occasionally forgot I was playing an AC game
