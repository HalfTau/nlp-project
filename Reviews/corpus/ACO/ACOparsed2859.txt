A very meh game for the Assassins Creed franchise imho... Long time lover of the games, but they started to get boring, simply because its been, well this is the 13th legit game... and I need an ending already to this long story they have been trying to keep alive.While the game has a good setting and pretty well thought out characters.. the quests were damn near always the same. The whole side quest or hidden area part feels pretty empty overall... If there is no icon on the map, then its just empty space not doing anything besides giving the illusion the game is bigger.I love the setting and dialogue was simple but on point and always kept you moving forward or towards the ending of another side quest or hidden area with pretty smooth transitioning. Yet I dont like how quick it was to reach the top of a pyramid and how lame it felt sitting there knowing theres damn near no tunnels to explore besides quest ones, No reason to explore really unless a quest tells you to go to somewhere or you have decided to go for all of the achievements, but even then its pretty straight forward. go to the ? and just kill, loot and run to the next one, to be honest it might aswell be a dungeon crawlerThe main quest is the ONLY reason to finish, as anything else doesnt have depth to it not including the hidden message and tombs Its just another AC game with a new polish.While I do recommend it, I suggest getting it on sale... Were going to be here for a while before we find out all of the Assassins and Templars dirty little secrets... So why pay full priceIde like to see Assassins Creed  Endings
