A very good game!I can only recommend itProA fantastic Openworld which is filled with interesting placesHands down the best game in terms of NPCs i have ever playedThey always do something and react upon your playstyle they dont just walk by if you accidently burn down ameadowA huge amount of animals which behave like normal animals unlike many other gamesmany weapons to explorethe whole world feels aliveThe main story is pretty long and has a lot of interesting storytwistsAt the second half of the game the sidequest become very good tooThe huge castles and fortresses which you have to infiltrate are challenging and cool to playThe team play between the protagonist and the eagle Senu works very wellYou will learn a lot about ancient greek,egyptian and roman culture The graphics look greatThe fighting is great too Many things you can do chariot racing,gladiatorial combat Every city has its own charm The parts where you navigate a big battleship are very cool The world interacts with your playstyle  if you fight with a burning sword in a meadow, the meadow begins to burn No need to buy ingame content Many items to collectNeutral The sidequests at the first half of the game are pretty boring The soundtrack is alright but I personally didnt like it very much To upgrade your armor you have to grind certain animals The huge Openworld has some huge desert areas where there is basically nothing like in the real world At some times the main storyline feels a bit repetitive new destination,new target The bow is wierd to play and should be buffed The leveling system with the abilities is good but nothing special The customisation is decentContra Even on a highend PC you will have lowfps and a lot of framedrops The storypart which plays in the 21th century is unnecessary and could be removed and nobody would miss it
