8.3/10A revolution for the series, which is now a stealth adventure/RPG hybrid. Has some flaws but still a return to form for Ubisofts flagship. The best Creed game since Black Flag, perhaps since the grand old AC II.ProsThe games biggest strength is by far the setting. Ubisofts recreation of Ptolemaic Egypt is amongst the greatest, most immervise open worlds ever.The story is more interesting than recent titles, with relatable protagonists. Even though I enjoyed the Freys, it had an excessively jovial feel. Bayek of Siwa and his wife Aya which you control in some missions make for a good couple story, while interacting with the already expected historical characters.Quite a good number of interesting side missions and activities tomb raiding is awesome, especially for a Ubisoft open world.Revamped combat, heavily inspired by Witcher 3, has its flaws, but is decent, and way better than anything Creed offered recently.ConsWay too much level grinding. Way too much. It interrupts the natural flow of the game sometimes.A lot of missions are still glorified fetch quests.The main story could still use a little more density.Launch DLCs.
