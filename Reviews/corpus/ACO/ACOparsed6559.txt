Just completed the first city. The story, graphics, gameplay, and sheer amount of things to do make the game very enjoyable. Cutscenes are full of emotion and Im really liking the story so far and the side missions for the most part actually make you want to play them instead of previous title that just felt like busy work. The new combat system took me a little getting use to, I still draw a bow 110 times when trying to pull my sword out but the Ai is very forgiving most cases so I feel more comfortable with it now than a few hours ago. If I had to gripe about anything it would be that the game has shut off on me in the middle of a load screen once and before I used vsync at adaptive the cutscenes were wavy, but I take that as fine tuning. In all Im loving my experience and recommend for any AC and/or open world fan. Cant wait to get back in and explore the other 95 of the world created here.
