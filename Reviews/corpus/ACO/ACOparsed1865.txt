I have MSI 970 and a 7600k at 3.8 and i cant run this at even mid.  Wtf....all that stupid denuvo crap.   Why would i need to take additional steps........... to get this to run on MID.  I guess literally alll the other games have spoiled me by making games that actually work..........!! i have the recommand spec and still this runs like crap.
