I dont understand why people saying this game hogging their cpu. I have i3 6100 with gtx1060 and the game runs smooth with highvery high setting mixed at 1080p. Im almost sceptical with most of reviewers saying you cant play this game with i3 stuff though...The combat is hard compared to old AC games. Id rather sneak from behind or use my bow instead of confronting enemies. Less brutality if i may say.Sometimes i found it strange why i cant put guard on sleep when they are on high level.This game has beautiful graphic of egypt, but still AC Black Flag is my favorite.
