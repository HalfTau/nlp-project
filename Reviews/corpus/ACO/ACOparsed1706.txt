The game itself seems like it would be fun, but so far the performance issues have made it very difficult to enjoy. Loading screens can last 510 minutes. Framerates are never consistent, regardless of the graphics settings, and it makes the game so choppy that its nauseating. After 4 hours of playing, Ive only made it to level 5 because of the long loading screens.My specsi56500GTX 107032GB ddr4 RAM2k 144hz gsync monitor
