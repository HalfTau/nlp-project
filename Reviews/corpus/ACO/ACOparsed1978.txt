Just when you were about to lose faith in the AC Franchise, AC origins came in and saved the day. This game will get you hooked  on within mins of your first gameplay. The beautiful Egypt is designed in a gorgeous lively way. Heard lot of compalints bout the game not being properly optimized, but for me personally..Hands Down...Game is just bloody marvelous..!! 3
