Assassins Creed Origins is a refreshing and beautiful new addition to the franchise. The graphics are stunning and there is so much to do and explore. Unlike the last few additions of Assassins Creed, Ubisoft took their time on this one, and it clearly shows. The base game is huge, and with expansions soon to follow, you will be finding it hard to put this one down. If you are a fan of the Creed, or you love ARPGs, then this title is a must buy.
