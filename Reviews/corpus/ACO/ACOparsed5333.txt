Where to get started?This is one of my favourite AC games in a LONG time. A lot of things have been changed for the good but the game still keeps the AC feel.Tha good shizzleThe new fighting system actually takes a bit of skill and learning the different weapons instead of ust mashing two buttons like the old games.The story is actually very fun to follow along as their are a few twists and I guess you could say mysteries in the storyEvery different weapon has weakness and strengths so you will find yourself not only sticking the one weapon.The progress system is pretty niceTha bad shizzleUnless you have a 970 graphics card you will most likely have to run the game on very lowlow settings. I play with a GTX 970 and with lowmedium graphics which doesnt look the best get 6090 frames cappedThe game has all the different citys or regions which are level based so if you wander into a region higher level than you, you will most likely get one shot by anything DRight now because the game released there are a few bugs I have noticed but dont impact the game massively.Those are literally the only things I didnt like about the gameThis game is honestly one of the best ACs in a while i really reccomend you try it out. By doing some of the side quests getting levels and doing the main story playing normally i finished the game in 30 hours and there is still a bunch of content I can do.
