I like the setting. Its a ubisoft game  missions get repetitive. Even when they really try to hide it by giving you actual nonrandom side missions with cutscenes etc. But the few basic gameplay loops work fine, and I like returning to the game. The world is BIG. There are lots of empty spaces, but I cant imagine that any developer fills a world this size with meaningful content. It would be a 1000h game. For me the giant world size is a game perk itself. It can really be explored. Need to get to a place far away? Dont fast travel. Take the direct route through a desert you did not visit before. Think of Breath of the Wild.
