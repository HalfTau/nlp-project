The second best in the serie after Syndicate, ive loved all after AC3 My opinion, i had some problems at first with the game launch loading forever but i solved it. At first i thought it was complicating and boring but when i got into it i enjoyed it.EditAll games after AC3 except AC Unity, it was barely playable and broken
