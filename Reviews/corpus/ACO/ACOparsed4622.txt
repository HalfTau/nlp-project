This game is really fun. It kinda has a Witcher feel to it. Its nice and different. This game falls deep when it comes to optimization. I spent probably around 5 hours trying to find the right setting. It was super bad. I now average around 4050 fps. sometimes 6070. Its alright Im used to it. Ubisoft really needs to let Denuvo go. This game has awesome cities. I thought the cities in this game would be as borings as syndacites. I  was wrong. Going through tombs is a ton of fun as well. The combat system is 10 times better than ever. Its way better than pressing B and X. After a view more patches to fix the optimization, I give this game a strong 8.5. I really appreciate their recent patch. Now I can finally play the game 1440p high settings. Thank you.
