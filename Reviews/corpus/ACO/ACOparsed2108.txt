I havent finished the main storyline, yet somehow I am bored. I find that the side quests have become rinse and repeat grinders, the aesthetics of the character have become stale and story feels more incomplete than any of the previous games despite being the most personal. Do I regret buying the game? Absolutely not. After so many hours of pillaging pyramids, discovering the mechanics and depth, it has been a wild ride. I probably regret getting the Gold Edition. No where near 100 worth of entertainment, but 60 sure. The game clearly releases some content thats free and some content that isnt over time. I dont understand how more paid content gets released after I spent 100 to have access to a season pass. I feel somewhat manipulated to have extensive content outside the boundaries of the season pass being released for just another 10, just pay us another movie ticket price for a costume... Absurd.
