This was a great game. I spent over 160 hours in it, and it never got old, boring, tiresome, or repetitive a few rare exceptions apply though. I dont like to do reviews about all the Pros and Cons of a game, because I prefer to think of games as bigger than just a set of items to tick off on a list.This game felt good. The visuals were amazing but sadly have seen a noticeable reduction in visual quality after the latest patch, and it was fun to play. I thought all the characters were well acted and voiced, and the production values of the game were exceptional.Did it have issues, and still ongoing? I believe so, but Im one of the lucky ones that really had no issues, and I enjoyed every minute of the game. The ending could have been better, but it certainly doesnt detract from the great experience I had playing Assassins Creed Origins.This is the first game in many, many years that Ive bought the Season Pass for, so that says a LOT. I also took about 500 screenshots during my playthrough and its now my Windows desktop theme. THAT says a lot, too.
