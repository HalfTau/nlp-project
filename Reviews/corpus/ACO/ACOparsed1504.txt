The graphics are amazing, gameplay is awesome and it has unprecedented depth for the series. Uplay ran flawlessly and the game runs perfectly on a PC with Windows 10, GTX 1080 and i7 6700k. I only had to sign in and click three times to get Uplay to activate and run the game upon initial installation. Highly recommended if you want a beautiful open world game with a good story and fun gameplay.
