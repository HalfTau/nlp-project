Origins should be the best PC game of 2017.The great beauty of Egypt is well presented by the Ubi Montreal and the battle system is really cool and easy to start with. Consderating the splendid landscape made by the Ubi Montreal, the hardware demand is not so strict. My PC with RX480 and old generation i7 can easy handle most of scene with fps over 60.
