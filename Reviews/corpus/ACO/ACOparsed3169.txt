While the previous two games of this series Unity and Syndicate were innovative they still left me wanting for more. With Ubi taking an year off I hoped that the next game would be something amazing and this game is, to an extent pretty good.As a die hard Assassins Creed fan there were so many things in this game that I could relate back to the previous ones,Decently sized but beautifully recreated cities, lots of open countryside fields  and desert with secrets to explore.I am glad that this time the main character Bayek was likeable and not just a stonefaced emotionless character that Conno Kenway was portrayed as. This kind of made the story more immersve to me.Another change was the combat, Bayek does not feel like the one man army that previous characters were for earlier levels but after some progression you get used to it. My only problem is that they went back to the primitive target lock system from Assassins Creed 1.Overall, this was a refreshing addition to the series and Im saddened to see that Ubisoft too, is stealthily introducing microtransactions into a singleplayer only game. Real life money to buy crafting components, ability points, special locaitons  etc. Id say this game is a must buy for any Assassins Creed fan and I hope Ubisoft gets better with time. Hopefully.
