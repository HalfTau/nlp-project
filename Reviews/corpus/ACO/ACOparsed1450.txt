For me AC games are a hit or a miss. This one is definitly a miss. Theres no depth to the armor/weapon system because you always find yourself equipping whatever has the higher number. Plus the characters are bland and uninteresting. But, if youre looking to play the game for the stealth/combat aspect its good.
