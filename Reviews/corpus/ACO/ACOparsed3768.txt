Damn, just when I thought they would never make an Assassins Creed that I would consider to buy, they drop this gem. Its Amazing. Graphics are gorgeous, gameplay is fun and diverse, and the story is quite immersive. Bought the game a week after release, and hardly saw any bugs or glitches. I hadnt bought an AC since AC3, because of the yearly releases. Lets just hope they wont do that again and stick to the extra development time. It clearly pays off.
