If you dont have a high end computer then I dont recommend that you buy this game for PC. A lot of the negative reviews that I have read were about people experiencing CPU issues, however, for me it is more of a graphics card issue based on looking at the Task Manager and the graphic settings in game.These are my computer specs if you are interestedCPU AMD FX 8350GPU AMD Radeon R7 370 4GB8GB of RAMI have a mix of recommended and minimum parts to run the game but I was getting really low FPS and it would drop a lot go from 30 FPS to 5 FPS. I even had the game running on the lowest settings and was seeing no FPS improvement. I did some reading online and saw that Ubisoft hasnt optimized this game at all for AMD its mostly for nvidia and even if you are using a higher end AMD GPU, you wont be able to enjoy the game in 60 FPS. My playtime of the game involved me trying to optimize the game to no avail so I decided to get a refund and buy it for my PS4 instead. I rather play this game on PC but with the FPS being terriblely low and unstable, its unplayable for me. I think the game itself looks like a lot of fun and Im looking forward to playing it on my console instead but just be warned if you dont have a higher end computer.
