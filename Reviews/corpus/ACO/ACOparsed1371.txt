I very much waited for new Assassins Creed, up to the 4th part earlier I was a big fan of a series. But every year the industry left forward, and  marked time. And here lower 2 years there is a new part on which at Ubisoft huge plans. This sorts restart of a franchayz. The first 3040 hours I played with ecstasy and explored this ancient Egypt. And every hour I understood that Origins is not a new product, and just one project of Ubisoft in which all mechanics of studio are used. Hunting and interaction with animals  Far Cry, Oryol drone from Watch Dogs, big empty and boring in comparison with Skyrim and Wild Hunt the world from Wildlands. Fighting mechanics  For Honor on the minimum requirements. A plot which had to tell about formation of an award? Why, if fans can push nonsense with set of historical persons. Lets give to formation of an award of 30 minutes of a game  same INGENIOUSLY. A game is a degradation of a series. The majority of mechanics or is simplified to a minimum, or in general is removed. The architecture is simplified to a limit. Games are caused by disappointment. Origins  a striking example of the fact that Ubisoft isnt able to release the worthy product looking as NEW any more. But a game has 1 advantage  it is a visual look. It is the best study of the area and a historical setting which I saw in video games. At Ubisoft one of the best designers and artists in the industry. It is a pity that only they also work in studio.PS. The Russian postscoring  the worst that I listened to. From ears there is blood.
