Ive been a fan of the series for a long time, since the very first Assassins Creed, and Ive owned  played every major AC game released. Assassins Creed Origins really confused me, and left me scratching my head.Let me explain I really, really have enjoyed my time playing Origins! Thats the confusing part...as the time leading up to my purchase I honestly wasnt really holding out much hope I would enjoy it. It seemed way off the mark from the other AC titles, and in the end, I guess that may be what I liked about it. It gave me a different experience, and a great one at that! I liked the time period, the character  character development, the overall gameplay, missions, visuals  graphics, as well as the sound  voice acting. Being somewhat of an achievement hunter, and not much of a multiplayer gamer myself  I also liked the fact that achievements werent tied to multiplayer actions, opening up the door to 100 completion for people like me. If Im being honest, ACO is probably one of my favorite in the series...I never thought I would ever say that, but its true.Ive noticed a trend with Ubisoft that I really like seeing. They seem to be pretty fluid and diverse. Theyre also not giving up on us Steam gamers by allowing us to play their games, still getting the full benefits of it, while playing it on Steam. Meaning they havent jumped on the bandwagon, as others have, of an exclusive game service for their products. This, of course, goes against most AAA studios who force the play of their games only on their network, which quite honestly sucks! cough Microsoft  EA  looking at you!. Good work Ubisoft on that point, and on ACO, keep it up!
