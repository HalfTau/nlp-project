In the short time Ive played this game, I know for a fact Ill love it for a quite a while. As far as microtransactions go, Ive come to just ignore them, and focus more on the actual core game than anything. With that being said, Origins fulfilled my expectations of the title itself, and pushed some points beyond my expectations. This is so much so that whilst my performance was being heavily affected on my good gaming system equipped with a 6 gb 1060 and i5 6600k cpu with 16 gb of system ram, sometimes I would drop to 20 fps and stick around 2030 although, still, I would play continuously just because of how good the core gameplay is. The side quests are interesting, and the grind aspect is surprsingly very fun. The loot system brought player goals to the table, as now, there is actually initiative to keep playing. So yes, performance at the moment, not so great on my end along with many others. But, this game still holds up so much I played 6 hours straight, then continued on this morning. So, with all that being said, I still very much recommend this game, and depsite its poor performance on my system, I know this will eventually be fixed anyways, and it doesnt stop me from enjoying the lush, breathing world of Egypt this game comes to provide.
