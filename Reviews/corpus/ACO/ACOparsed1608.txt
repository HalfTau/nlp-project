This is a damn shame. The gameplay itself and open world is beautiful. I had fun in the short time I had this game.However, this is all ruined by the disgusting practices of the modern gaming industry, shoving microtransactions in your face whenever possible. I could not find any option to hide/remove the ingame purchases and store permanently. I loathe microtransactions, and just seeing any of them triggers a fit of rage within me. Time savers? Why play at all? Why not just pay 40 to automatically finish the game and watch the ending credits? Egregious practices of the gaming industry.Once again its too bad, this game is beautiful and a lot of fun. But I cannot enjoy it if this crap exists within it.
