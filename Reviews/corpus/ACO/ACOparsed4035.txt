After completing the story I felt that was time to write a review. The game took me roughly 37 hours to complete, This is an incredible game and a far leap forward for the franchise. My favorite AC games were brotherhood and black flag IMO this game blows them out of the water in terms of depth, game mechanics, and detail of the world. This team should the only one contracted to make AC games from now on. There is so much to do in this world and the side missions are great. Some are so in depth I thought they were actually story missions. I cant wait for the DLC!!!!!!!!!! This is a buy forsure if you are a fan of the series and a complete steal if you wait for a discount or sale.
