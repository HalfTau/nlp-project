For Graphics. Combat feels so good and funny, and it needs a minimum level of skill this time to know exactly when to parry and dodge enemy attacks and what weapon to use, but it isnt hard. Variety of ways and weapons to take down enemies  stealth , bows , swords, blunts, axes, etc. Exploration the map is filled with places, cities, villages and tasks tasks like finding treasure chests and clearing beast lairsand enemy camps  and although more than half the map is just desert,  you can still find tombs, enemy camps and miscellaneous missions and tasks in the middle of nowhere. both main and side missions arent all about go there, get that , kill those, there are still these kinds of missions, but not asprevalent as in previous games.Against Main Story the story is about killing the bad guys and taking revenge, its good enough to keep you going but the plot is alittle bit predictable and forgettable. character design could use some improvment. voice acting its good generally, but I dont know how to say it, on some ocassions you get the feeling that the voice actingis indifferent and feelingless you cant tell if the npc is angry, sad, happy, the voice tone is just cold. lack of game plus mode or anything to do after finishing all missions and tasks, the only thing you get is a gladiator arenaand a chariot recing arena, but no way to reset enemy camps or missions Microtransactions this game has indirect microtransaction which means that you use real money to buy ingame money and then spend the ingame money to buy items from the shops scattered aroung the map, and although the MT in this game isnt intrusive or predatory like some recent games we heard of, and you can easily earn ingame money without spending real money by doing missions and tasks or selling items or weapons that you dont need, i still listed MT in the negatives because I dont believe that MT belong in a 60 game.About the technical performance of the gameI can play the game on UHD with everything set to ultra except the depth of field, clutter with the AA set to adaptive andget 49 fps on average, the game freezed 4 times during my 120hr play time, and I didnt encounter any mission glitch.regarding the cpu activity when playing the game, I get circa 35 usage.my specs are i175820, gtx 1080, 16 gigs of ram.Game lengthgame content is enought to keep you busy for about 80100 hours if you want to complete everythingand not in a hurry
