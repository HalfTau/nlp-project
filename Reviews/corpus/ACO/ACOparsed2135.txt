This is the first AC title Ive played since Black Flag. The series began to fall off after that one and I basically lost all interest, but I had to give Origins a try after seeing how good it looked and reading lots of good reviews. Overall Im very pleased with the experience. The transition to an actionRPG style of game worried me at first, but they managed to implement it very well while still maintaining the AC feel. Although its derivative of the drone from Ghost Recon Wildlands, having the eagle to help you mark enemies and find objectives is incredibly useful in such a huge world thats so densely packed with content. Combat works smoothly and is very fun. Archery in particular is my favorite. Exploring ancient tombs and discovering their secrets is very challenging and fun. But probably the most satisfying part of the game for me is just roaming the beautiful wilderness much more than sand dunes and hunting for skins from horseback. In most games where completing the main story doesnt end the game, I get bored with it shortly thereafter and end up putting it down. But I actually want to continue AC Origins after finishing the story because theres still so much to do that actually feels worthwhile. Glad to see the series getting back on its feet with this title. I gave it a try despite some initial concerns, and was not disappointed.
