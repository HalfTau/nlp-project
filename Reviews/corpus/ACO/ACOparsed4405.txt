One of the better Creeds Ive played in awhile.Pros Gameplay is classic creed and graphics are beautifulCon CPU usage is very high in dense city areasi7 6700k oc to 4.5GTX 1070Max setting everything, 1080p display benchmark was 85 average FPS.CPU Usage Issue As far as my spec CPU, I only get 100 cpu usage in Alexandia atm...open areas 6070. If your liquid cooling I wouldnt worry about it. i5 I would guess your gonna 100 usage alot of the time. Need an i7 atm.End result If you enjoy assassin creed games from the past this is a must play.
