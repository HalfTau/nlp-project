The biggest and best looking AC to date. In my humble opinion, it also plays better. The combat system is less wonky, and gameplay overall flows better.If you are in it for historical sightseeing, this is also one of the best ACs. Intresting period, lovingly crafted, and lots to see. In my opinion the best AC yet.
