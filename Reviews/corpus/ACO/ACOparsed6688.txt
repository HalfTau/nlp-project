This is easily my favorite AC from the series. True to the open world nature of the game, and with the flavor of a talent trees, leveling, and gear to manage it feels so much better than the previous ones. Definitely recommend it.Just be sure you meet those minimum system reqs, and be ready to do some trouble shooting, if it doesnt run out of the box.
