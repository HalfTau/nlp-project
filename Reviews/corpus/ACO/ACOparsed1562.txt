NO 3D SUPPORT/FUNCTIONALITY  INSANE DRMWanted to try this game out and left sorely disappointed. I have a pretty strong pc powered by a water cooled overclocked 1080 as well as a Ryzen Threadripper 1950X packing 32 cores overclocked to 4.0 ghz , and 32 gb of ddr4 2800 oc ram. and this game still took a long time to load. I suspect thats due to their heavy handed DRM. Strike 1I am a 3D gamer, ever since i adopted Nvidias 3D vision I only enjoy playing games in 3D anymore. It just makes everything look so surreal. They have absolutely zero support for 3D vision in ths game. It works fine in the menus but once the actual gameplay begins, whoa is all i can say. It absolutely will not function correctly at this point in time. In fact enabling 3D vision in game will crush your fps into the ground and make everything look horrid and nightmarish. I have never experienced this with any other game. Most games will function with 3D enabled but may not render properly but they still dont crush my fps. This one wont even run.Its a shame too. I enjoyed the AC franchise, at least up until the main saga ended with the world ending stuff pre 2012, but lately it seems like these AC games are just not that good. Coupled with the fact that they dont care about the niche population that enjoys 3D gaming, i got a refund and they lost a sale.Im sure the game is fine for non 3d gamers aside from the DRM issues, but if youre a 3D enthusiast like myself then dont bother with this one.
