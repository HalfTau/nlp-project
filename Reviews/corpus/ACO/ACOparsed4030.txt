Requesting a refund. Game seems like it could be fun, but if feels very glitchy and unfinished. The game doesnt even support surround sound headphones. Might get the game again in 6 months or so if they manage to fix some of the many problems.Update I got the game again while it was on sale, and they fixed the bugs that were bothering me. Now that its actually working, its amazing. Especially playing on nightmare difficulty with minimal hud.
