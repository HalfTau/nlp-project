Really FUN game. Awesome graphics and a really big game world in Egypt. The map is the same size like Ghost Recon WildLands, so its massive with cities like Alexandria, Memphis, Heraklion  Krokodilopolis. There are also several villages, deserts, mountains, lakes, rivers, swamps, etc. The control over the character Bayek feels tight and responsive. The game runs well on my PC. Intel i7 6700k processor, Asus GTX 1070 gpu, 32 GB DDR4 Ram, GigaByte z170 MB, Windows 10. I play the game  Ultra settings in 1080p and theres no problem so far.I like that UBi Soft put in Steam achievments in this version too. Still needs Uplay but that doesnt bother me. UBi should have credit because they allow us to shop their games on Steam Store or even EA Origin so the player can have a collected games library. That sucks big time of EA where you only can play on their platform splitting up your game library. I prefer to have all games here on Steam.Well done UBi Soft. Assassins Creed is back on top. Cant wait to continue my jurney with the protagonist named Bayak./// Score 9/10
