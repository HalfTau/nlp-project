Assassins Creed Origins is the most indepth and enjoyable title in the Assassins Creed series so far, and ancient Egypt is the perfect location to showcase it.The redesigned combat mechanics make battles fun while still providing a challenge and a tactical element for those that want to exercise their minds. Senu, the Eagle, is a fantastic Egyptian take on Eagle Vision and compliments gameplay perfectly.
