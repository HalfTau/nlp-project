Precompletion reviewI really enjoy the assassins creed series. My altime favorite has to be Black Flag. I know that some people thought that game was stupid and not part of the AC theme but I personally enjoyed it. As for origins I really like the egyptian era concept but there is one big thing that is really starting to IRK me. The combat. The combat in this game is a mess. You better make sure you lock on otherwise your going to be trying to slice up a fence post instead of the guy bouncing your head off the back of his mace. Along side the combat system that is lacking just as much is the freerun persay. climbing and parkoring all over the place can seem a bit sketchy at times. Theres nothing worse than trying to be stealthy and trying to strafe along the wall and end up randomly jumping off the wall into a circlejerk of enemies.I really want to hit that Yes button but IMO I cannot recommend this game in its current state.
