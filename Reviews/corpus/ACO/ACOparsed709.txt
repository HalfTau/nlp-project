first thing i would like to say about this game is that this game is not the assasinss creed we have played before its not assasins creed.But the risk that ubisoft took is really awesome.They made assasinss creed into a whole new world and the detailing is really just awesome the people in the world are detailed just like bayek and aya.The storie is very intense.I really just love this game.This game is worth buying.
