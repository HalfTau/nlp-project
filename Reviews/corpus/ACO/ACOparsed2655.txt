It is a rare thing to see a long running franchise reinvent itself but thats just what Assassins creed origins had done. Resident Evil 4 flipped the formula on its head back in the day and went down in gaming history because its execution and call of duty 4 refined shooters and the series formula and is beloved still today and AC origins will be no different. The changes in gameplay, world design and the quality of details put it in a league of its own when it comes not only to other assassins creed titles but, open world games as a whole.
