Ive got a pretty beefy computer, so I havent really had any hitches, no drops in frames, or heavy load set.The new combat system took me a bit to get used to, but given an hour or so and youll get into the swing of things, there is a ton of side activities and what not to do, so I never find myself going too far without finding some trouble to get into.Overall, its a nice refresher course to AC, itll be interesting to see if the next game adopts the same mechanics, or if they go back to their usual play style, like they did after Unity bombed.
