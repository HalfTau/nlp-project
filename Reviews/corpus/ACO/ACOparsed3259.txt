Assassins Creed Origins is, to date, the best game in the Assassins Creed series.  The new combat controls are signifcantly more improved.  The graphics are incredible, and the gameplay is generally pleasant.When I originally played the game, the dualDRM took a significant toll on performance  especially in terms of CPU cycles.  There were times whe I experienced framerate drops and stuttering.  This was frustrating because my rig has a Core i57600K, a GTX 1080, and 16 GB of 2400MHz DDR4.  Since Patch 1.10, these issues are completely gone.  Ubisoft did an incredible job responding to user feedback and streamlining the ingame performance.
