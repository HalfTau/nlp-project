This game is very enjoyable. Since syndicate was so bad Im very happy with this game. The actual gameplay and story is great. Plenty to do apart from the main story. There are almost too many side quests. Brilliant graphics too.Now for the bad. The audio in cutscenes doesnt work with Logitech headphones which caused me to miss a lot of dialogue at the beginning before getting a wired headset. You need to create an account with UPlay at the start which is mildly annoying. I have a notification in the top right corner that will not go away saying that I need to update my driver but it is already uptodate. This is quite annoying tbh. Overall 8.5/10.
