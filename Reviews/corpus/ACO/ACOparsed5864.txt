Im already 30ish hours in and other than a few audio hiccups the game runs above 90FPS on maxed outs setting on my GTX1080 paired with an I74770K  4.3Ghz.I love the newly adopted RPG element for this game, it works out perfectly and I really do feel much more immeresed in the gameplay.No complaints so far except for the movement options are a little limiting and it has changed from since the black flag game which took roughly 23 hours to get used to.I rate this a 9/10, GOOD JOB UBISOFT MONTREAL
