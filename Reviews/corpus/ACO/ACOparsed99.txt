This game really brought back Assassins Creed as a franchise for me. I couldnt do it with the last two games to come out. Unity to me was a trainwreck with a character that seemed to really try and take a few notes from the Ezios personality. Syndicate was eh. Origins was a breath of fresh air. Awesome to see some of the beginning history of the Assassins and to watch your character develop. If you were anything like me and tired of how Assassins Creed was going, maybe give this one a chance.
