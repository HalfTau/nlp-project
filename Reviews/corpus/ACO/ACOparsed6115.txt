Excellent game. One of the best in the series. Beautiful graphics Brilliant story telling Vast world to explore Tons of hrs of gameplay combat is getting used to few glitches here and there lesser fast travel optionsNon the less highly recommendedP.S  No performance issues what so ever. Running on ultra graphics. On my Asus laptop with 6gb gtx 1060.
