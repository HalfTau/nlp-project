This is a great game and a great addition to assassins creed. It is different than all the other assassins creed goes as far as weapons, combat, and RPG elements with loot go. For instance the combat is much more like Dark Souls or the Witcher 3s combat with rolling and counter attacking. The combat is NOT Hard at all in my opinion. I saw somone complaining saying it was waaaay too hard but its not. It is incredibly easy if you arent stupid. Dont attack things 5 levels above you and dont run into 20 enemies at once. Ive played for 9.3 hours on hard difficulty and have had no difficulty problems unless running into enemies 5 levels higher than me. The Parkour is another thing i saw somone complain about I have had only 1 bad parkour event where i was trying to go straight but ended up jumping off a platform. It was once out of 9.3 hours of parkouring.PROSSo far, great storygreat characters IMOFun Combat provides a challenge and encourages headshots  well timed attacksGood side quests ive had lots of interesting and noncliche side quests that have been great.Great exporation however it is limited by leveled zones.ConsTo me their is only one big Con and that is the performance issues. I run a GTX 1070 with good CPU and motherboard etc etc but i get choppy 3060 fps on high settings. Normally sit around 36 and itll shoot up if the area becomes less dense. I would love more optimization and smoother fps.Great game. Buy it if you have a decent PC else, get it on PS4 or XBOX
