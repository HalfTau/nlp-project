Game is great, the story is good.Combat is smooth but too much RPG element, some strike should have been a one hit, and hidden blade should be able to instantly kill. I mean, a guy getting stabbed in the head and still running and fighting? Also with bow an arrow, a guard got an arrow through the eye are still kicking.Sometimes, because of the characters level, story are fragmented.Ubisoft should optimize it better, FAST  SERIOUSLYFIX THE PERFORMANCE!My PC should be able to run this game at High 1080p smoothly! Its been tons of update but still no performance improvement...
