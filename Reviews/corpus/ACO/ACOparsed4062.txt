I played three previous AC titles. Also, look at my games on steam from the last two years. I feel qualified in saying that this is one of the best games I have ever played. Ubi hit the nail on the head in delivering a complete and huge game that is so immersive if feels like real life. Its not high teen fantasy like Destiny 2,  or Dragon powers like Elder Scrolls, or Witcher. You wont find a better entertainment value for 60, than this, right now.
