This is an mazing game, Ive played though all of the assassins creed games within the main series. What a wonderful piece of work this is. The game is optimized very well Im getting average 75 fps 1440p with everything on ULTRA. I really enjoy the new control scheme. Byake is a very likable character. The story so far has been incredible. The past few assassins creed games have been kind of bland in my opinion. The visuals are stunning, they have really done an amzing job on egypt. Fully recommended 3PROS Great Optimization Fresh new gameplay Huge open map to explore Tons of weapons and gear.Cons Cannot change the inverted controls for senu. Still not difficult enough even on the hard setting.
