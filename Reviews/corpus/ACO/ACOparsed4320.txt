Besides performance and optimization issues, this game is by far one of the best ive played. I havent had this fun since TW3. I only started playing AC recently with Syndicate and i feel Origins is a fresh and promising outlook in the series. The game catering exploration is a sign that the series is developing fantastically for the better.
