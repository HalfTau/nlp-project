The combat and controls are kinda funky but you honestly get used to it after an hour or two, and once you do you have a really great open world exploration RPG with a fantastic story, great voice acting and characters, and genuinely interesting and fun combat.Sure, there are a few issues with it like enemies tracking the player even after theyre out of view or the occasional minor bug but its nothing game breaking or that werent in games like the Witcher 3.I cant stress enough that you need to give it an hour or so to adjust to the new controls. I thought about getting a refund but once the tutorial was over I realized I had adapted completely and the game became incredibly fun. Just give it the old college try before thinking about getting a refund.
