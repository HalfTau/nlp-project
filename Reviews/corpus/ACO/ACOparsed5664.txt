Excellent game, maybe one of the best ACs in the franchise Along with Black Flag and Brotherhood Breathtaking graphics and the most beautifull scenery from all the AC games yet! points1. Completely reworked and overhauled combat system, combat is more difficult now, and can become lethal quick. Now the player can get attacked by multiple enemies/predatory animals simultaniously. Not the teadious onebyone attack tactic all the other AC games had before.2. Huge map with breathtaking scenery to explore, from lively vilages not boring ghost towns, large desert areas  tombs to the pyramids and the large city of Alexandria3. Explore ancient Egypt4. Cleopatra pointsRequires a fairly heavy graphics card as its needs considerable amount of Vram 4GB VRAM or better and decent processor speed i7 or AMD eqivalent in order to run this game comfortably on highest settings.
