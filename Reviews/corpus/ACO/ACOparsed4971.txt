Theres nothing more to say. What an amazing game!!! I love every element in this game. I love the new battle system,the weapons, the outfits, the maps, the sand.Everything is perfect. Ive played for 5 days, 70hours total. Ive finished over 100 missionsi just played 6 mainline quests.It runs perfectly on my PC, NEVER met any bugs or crash down. Best assassins creed ever. Cait wait for the next serie. I hope it will be placed in ancient China! !
