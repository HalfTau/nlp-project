Ive only played for a couple hours so far but the experience has been wonderful. I no longer dread going through missions like I did in Syndicate. I love exploring and sailing around the rivers and lakes. Flying around with senu is enjoyable as well. There are a lot of small things I like about the game. Mind you at the time Im writing this Ive only played about 15 hours or so. I cant wait to see the road ahead on this game. I hope most enjoy this game like I do.
