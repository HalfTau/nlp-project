This game is absolutely phenomenal. The graphics are amazingly realistic, and while I was a little dissapointed in the ship combat as it is nowhere near as satisfying as Black Flag but it is still good. However, basic combat feels incredibly satisfying and polished. It is much better than other AC games with the combat rework. Overall it was worth every penny.
