The graphics is stunning. With the mystery ancient egypt background, it will give you 20 hours good experience. However, after that, you would find many quests and scenes are similar and repeatful. I know the map in this game is vast and beautiful, but the places in last half of procedure is a little tedious. Overrall, its a good Ubisoft game, but not the best one.
