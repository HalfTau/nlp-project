By far the most smoothest AC game I have ever played and the most fun. I am always a sucker for Roman History and experiencing one of the most palace intrigue filled periods of the Empire is very fun. It beats the Pirates and the Revolution by a long shot. The assassin himself is not big on words but he is on action, Connor was annoying in III and Edward in 4 reminded me too much of Captain James T. Kirk, acting included. This guy is a great balance. Running around with Cleopatra, Julius Ceasar, Brutus and Pompey is truly amazing to see. The game itself is gorgeous and seeing all the historial landmarks including Alexander the Greats Tomb in Alexandria is cool. Its like if the History Channel did another doucmentary but you are living in it. The gameplay is solid although not as smooth as other assassins but hey this guy is a trailblazer so naturally he has to get better with time so it makes sense. The story itself is okay, kind of lost on it till it runs into the historical record of the Cleopatra and Ceasar Soap Opera. Its unique and does the Heros Journey very well compared to other renditions. Basically the positon our hero starts off as is equivielent to a town Sheriff you see in todays Westerns and you progress into a bit of a superhero where in other titles you start off as a nobody and grow into a somebody. The easter eggs in here are also cool, for example one of the in game outfits you get can at the shops is a shout out to Prince of Persia. If you want a laugh, when you are traveling through the desert on your horse, play Americas Horse with no Name
