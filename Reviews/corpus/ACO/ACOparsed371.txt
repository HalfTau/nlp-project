If you are an Assassins Creed fan, then this is a must buy. Definitely worth it. Best Assassins Creed by far.It gives you the feel of the original Assassins Creed. The music the gameplay and everything.Although I did like the counter and then kill that previous AC games had which they have not used it this, as they have used hit registers in the game. I wish they would have given more combat combos.Still its fun to play.
