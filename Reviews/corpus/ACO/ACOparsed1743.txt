This game isnt Assassins Creed, but I still love it. Sure it has a lot of elements from the franchise but it plays so much differently.Doesnt run the best but it makes up for it in the large map and the seemingly endless quests.I also enjoy the new crafting system and rarity system. Its definitely something that should have been added years ago.Solid 8/10 and a close second to AC4
