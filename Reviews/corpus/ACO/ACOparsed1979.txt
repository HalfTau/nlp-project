As a follower of the assassins creed Franchise i can tell this one is the most elaborated game. Stunning visuals, enormous map, lots of exploration, a lot of personalizaion  gear, secondary quest with meaning. I recommend to buy this game, cause its worth it. Its a better game than unity, syndicate and the glorious Ezzio Collection. really really surprised with this one
