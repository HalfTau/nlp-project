s hella nice, bestass  game.Good story none of that oh yeah you do it cuz assassin business they do what they do in the game for vengeance, even though Aya already shows that she is only there for the greater good, bayek couldnt give less of aGood graphics, alexandria and the eastern provinces of mountains are amazing, desert is also cool but they could have done like atone of tombs and mysteries there, missed opurtunity.Aya is so much of a uughh carachter, you might like her, I dont I cant change her weapons her clothes nothing, would be cool if one of the expansions were just her missions out of egypt protecting  adn serving Cleopatra.A biton performance my pc is good not a beast pc but good and i still get from 30 fps to 45 tops on the default settings.The naval part was just downgrade from AC IV.In the end good game very nice best out of all of em
