Overall, I have really been enjoying the new direction of the latest in the Assassins Creed series. Origins has more of a hybrid parkour / rpg feel to it with a much more satisfying combat experience a decent amount of weapons, armor, and items a slightly upgraded crafting system far more enjoyable side quests  missions.The graphics and music really bring ancient Egypt to life. I find myself enjoying exploring my surroundings and taking in the amazing views. With both daybreak, daytime, evening, and night time cycles there is lots of eye candy to enjoy.I will say that at first I had some disappointing performance until I realized that simply turning ambient occlusion down from the highest setting to the high setting gave me significantly improved frames everything else was set to the highest value. Currently, as of this review, I am running an i5 4690k with a 1070 gtx and 16gb of ram. Shadows are the next big fps killer and should be adjusted next if you are still getting subpar performance.
