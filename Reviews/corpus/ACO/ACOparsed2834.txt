I am a bit biased when it comes to Assassins creed so I loved it but heres a pros/cons list of how I felt about the gamePros Bayek is a great protagonist, very human Beautiful graphics and has a built in screenshot/picture editor Best side quests since Witcher 3 HUGE WORLD with lots to see if you have the time Skill based combat instead of the spameroni and cheese system of the previous games Decently sized skill tree for level up points LOOT Good weapon varietyCons Main quest line starts off good but quickly crumbles towards the end Tact on multiplayer revenge quests that are just a waste of time Quite a lot of bugs in my playthrough Annoying grindy crafting system Lacking armor customization compared to previous games Too much focus on combat not enough on stealth No more crowd blending
