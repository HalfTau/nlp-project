Great game besides 2 little things 1 there is a little audio bug that will happen time from time and the 2nd the game will not launch if you install it to you SSD which I think may just be a ubisoft problem because the same thing would happen on For Honor haha anyway its a great game so far and I would recommend it to anyone of my friends.
