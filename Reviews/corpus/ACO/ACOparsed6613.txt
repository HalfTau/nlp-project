Its a beautiful game in a beautiful setting. I like the fight  loot system.However its runs on 1520 fps 1080p everything on low on a GTX 960. I may just tone it down to 720p or keep going on the 15 fps because I want to play the game that bad.EDIT coming back to this. Put the game on 720p  medium settings.Doest it now look like a game out of ancient times yesIs it playable yesAm I enjoying myself yes
