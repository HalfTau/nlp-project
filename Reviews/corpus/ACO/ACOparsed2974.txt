 this game. first off, it looks great but its so god damn buggy its unplayable. constant crashing, missions bugged out, getting stuck on/in things, soft locks, optimized like trash, etc. the gameplay is weak af too, absolutely ZERO originality went into any of the missions, this guy is sick, go fetch this, bring it back, now he needs something else, blah blah blah, same ole DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, just wait until its cracked bc ubisoft does not care about you and the game reminds me of a  5 game with really nice graphics, if you want to play a good AC game, go buy horizon zero dawn on ps4 bc that game is everything an AC game should be.
