This review is only temporary until I finnish the game, but so far this game seems really good. The year off was definitely worth it and this game is far better than the last few AC games, maybe even better than AC4.Also the performance seems pretty good to  getting an average of 3545 fps at very ultra settings on a gtx 960Hopefully the game stays this good throughout
