Easily one of my favorite games of 2017, I can see why some people may dislike it  but I came into it with lower expectations due to the last few games in the Assassins Creed series, and a dislike of ubisoft and uplay as a whole. However, boy was I wrong  all of my expectations surpassed.The side quests can be annoying, they can be repetative and they can be very cliche... but that is pretty much the same with any game. If you enjoy games in the assassins creed series, if you enjoy psuedostealth games like Shadow of Mordor/War and Dishonored 1/2, then you will enjoy this game.If you enjoy history, if even if its being slightly altered to fit a game and storyline, you will enjoy this game.If you enjoy an epic tale of a man who lost everything on a quest of vengeance that will change the entire political landscape of Egypt and potentially the future of civilized life as we know it  youll enjoy this game.The main quest alone is worth the price that I paid I got it on sale, and the combat, exploration, and beautiful openworld, tombs, and mechanics on the game just made it all the easier to justify paying for this game.
