To be honest i didnt played that much because of the constant stutters that i get, i mean i run it on Ultra in 60fps but its constantly stutter especially when i reach the Cities and Villages its weird cause i ran Shadow Of War on ultra and i didnt get any stutters, the game ran smoothly. but its doesnt mean that its a bad game, its actually the best Assassins creed game since the Assassins creed 2. now i dont know if its the Optimization or is it my PC specs that cause those Stutters, but for me its unplayable. but if you know that your PC can run it, then buy it, it worth it, of course that i played it only for 1 hour but i already can tell that its a great game. BTW the Requirements are not that accurate, Im sure that this game requires 16GB RAM instead of 8GB RAM i can just tell it by my experience with the game cause i have only 8GB RAM. anyway its a very good game with a pretty interesting story and setting MUST BUY!PC SPECSGPU Gtx 1070 gaming x 8GBCPU i7 6700 3.4ghzRAM 8GB RAM
