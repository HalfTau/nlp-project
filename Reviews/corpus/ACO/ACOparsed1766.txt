Best Assassin creed game up to now! Much better than any assasin creed game before except the insipid story. Good playing feeling. Beatiful scene. The previous assassin creed have the same pattern scene, everywhere looks the same, and if you complete story mode you will never open them. But origin conquer this. You can travel and hunt in egypt more time than you play the game mode.
