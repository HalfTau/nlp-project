Headline is that this is a nice change of pace for the AC series and takes some inspiration from the Witcher 3 in the process. Its not a total overhaul but it breathes new life into some old conventions.Biggest advice I can give new players is to allow yourself to get used to the combat. At first I really didnt like it, but now I genuinely think its some of the best combat the series has ever seen.For a few more details, as well as max settings 60 fps  1080p, heres my video review.
