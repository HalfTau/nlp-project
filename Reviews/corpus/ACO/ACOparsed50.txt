Having played all AC games released so far except the chronicles, I can assure you that this game is on par, or one might argue, even better than AC2, AC4 and Brotherhood. The graphics are top notch, even at Medium Quality on a GTX960M. The CPU usage is 90 due to the DRM, but I assure you that the game runs fine with no stuttering or any other sort of issues. Ubisoft really did a fine job !
