So far I really like what they have done with this game, for sure one of the best AC in a while.Things I like the most the combat system the map is beautiful and diverse have 4050 of the map discovered the story is interestingThe only thing that sucks I that I cant get above 40 FPS with my r9 390 and i77700k.
