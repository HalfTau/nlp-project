What should I say? AC Origins is an amazing game with a lot of various side quest and good graphics! The combat system is also different then the other AC games but when you get use to it, it will be easy to handle. So far I have been enjoying the game, there is so much to do, I havent tried it al! The few minors of the game are some little glitches and dont get distracted by the micro transactions. The map of Acient Egypt is really big and a perfect setting, you can freerun in Alexandria and other cities or you can hunt in the desert or swamps. If you want my opinion, AC Origins is defenitly worth 60!
