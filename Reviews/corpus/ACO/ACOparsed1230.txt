The game reminds me of Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. Nonetheless, this is a great game. The amount of content is amazing. Even after main quests, there are so much to keep playing with. The only serious issues were bugs such as crashes, being stuck at loading, character animation bugs, and audio bug where some dialogues kept repeating over and over.
