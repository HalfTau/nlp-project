Im gonna start by saying, this is a great game, lots of fun, it actually feels like a propper RPG, its got a ton of inspiration form other games like the Witcher 3, the combat and loot system is almost identical to Witcher 3, the game itself is a refined Assassins Creed Syndicate although im not sure if the story, characters and setting interest me as much as Syndicate, the game looks pretty good and runs well on PC its not that CPU intensive, people lied and exaggerated, it uses no more than 65 of my i7 7700k, which is similar to Battlefield 1, Watch Dogs 2 has used 100 multiple times and sticks in the 90s The game looks super smooth at 45fps with GSync, but similar to Wildlands, turning settings down doesnt change fps very much unless you lower an entire preset. Its map is Wildlands sized, in other words, its massive.I strongly recommend this game, its got loads of content similar to Wildlands but runs a bit better, its a more simplified and casual Witcher 3 so if you like Witcher 3 youll probably like this, if you found it too difficult then this should be perfect.
