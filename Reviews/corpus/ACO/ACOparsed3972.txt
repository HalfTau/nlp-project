A fresh take on the Assassins Creed franchise. The game is great overall. The combat is tough to start with but, becomes super enjoyable once you learn it. The map is huge, but I wish some of the deserts were a little more populated with anything, even viewpoints would suffice but theyre for the most part completely empty. Id give the game a 9/10.
