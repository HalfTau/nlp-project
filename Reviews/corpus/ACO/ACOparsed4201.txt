One of the Top Open world rpgs out there.If you enjoyed titles such as skyrim, Witcher 3, youll enjoy this title. It has one of the most massive and at the same time detailed worlds in a pc game period. Ancient egypt is depicted in a stunning and vivid environment full of things to do. I catch myself just strolling around the vast sprawling cities and appreciating all their detail.So much love has been poured into this game that iam grateful to be able to play it.In terms of performance it runs reasonably 40 fps in 2560x1440 on my gtx 970 and an i5 2500k. doesnt dip below 30. I wouldnt expect more with such dated hardware anyways, but i dont seem to experience any issues such as other people claim.
