It has been 57 hours playing this freaking awesome AC,for me this episode is way better than the last two AC.Not to mention if you are a history enthusiast this game definitely  giving you some sort of real experience living in the time of ancient egypt.Man this game makes we wanna travel to egypt and act like the next medjay XDp.s theres a bit of microtransaction occurs especially after the release of Nightmare set but of ill give this game 8.5/10
