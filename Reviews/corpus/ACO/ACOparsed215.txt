Overclocked 7700K, 32GB DDR4, and 1080TI.... 3 months after release...multiple patches...still cant play in 4K res as the FPS drops horrifically even with all other settings to low, medium, or off completely. Playing in 1440p is much better for fps but screen tearing remains, glitchy movement, and the sand/dust constantly making the screen feel washed out and blurry is not necessary. Not only do I not feel immersed in this game, but I actually started to get dizzy from the sand and constant blur.Climbing bricks and scaling walls causes tearing beyond belief and in 1440p...I get max 7680fps!! This long after release these graphical issues shoule be a nonissue. I play 10 other AAA titles regularly and all play flawlessly maxed in 4K. This game is playable, but the performance issues are staggering and very disappointing.Bottom line, Im pickier than most when it comes to quality  hence why I pay for higher end components and when I cant even stand still in game without the sand/dust and crap causing 2030fps loss..its unacceptable and Ive once again put this game on the shelf  maybe Ill try again in another 34 months and hopefully the graphics and performance issues will finally be addressed.
