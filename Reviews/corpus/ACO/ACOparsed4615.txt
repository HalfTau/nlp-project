Just awesome game.Played for few hours totally got impressed with it. Looking so refreshing having played most of the assassins creed game.Now for the specs. I have i5 4460 8 GB ram gtx1060 6 GB. Game runs smooth in high settings. I have kept Adaptive vsync ON and framerate fixed to 45 eventhough i could play well in 60 FPS too with very minor stutters here and ther. But it doesnt affect our gameplay bad. Ubisoft has impressed me after black flag. Thanks Ubisoft
