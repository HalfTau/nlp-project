ASSASSINS CREED ORIGINSOne of the Best Assassins Creed games ever madeafter AC2Story Hands down one of the best in the AC series. Bayek is actually a Protagonist youll like. His drive for hunting The OrderProtoTemplars is Actually more Personal. and the Origins? Gotta finish the game to know it...brings the old AC feeling back in a way.Gameplay Fun and kinda Hard. But it Feels more like an RPG than Anything. Still, its got the core AC mechanics like Freerunning and Assassinations.Combat Fast and DarkSouls like. and a little bit like The Witcher 3Graphics JawDroppingly Awesome. They really captured the Beauty of Egypt in this game. Every detail of the World is just Stunning. The Desert landscapes are just Beautifuland BigOptimization Optimization is BAD. This games DRMs hammer your CPU by utilizing it by 100. The reason for it is mainly VMProtecta new DRM ubi implemented alongside Denuvo. Had to lock the FPS to 30 to play it in a Decently stable speed.Overall 8/10 would be a 10/10 if it werent for the bad optimizationsThough, the game is not optimized like expected, the game overall is Amazing AF! Hands Down, one of the best games Ive ever played! I definitely have no Regrets!
