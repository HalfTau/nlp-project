Some people whine about how this game favors combat approach over stealth, but the truth is that both are pretty balanced. Ive been sticking with assassination and stealth for pretty much my playthrough so far. You just need to do side quests and other activities in the game designed to help leveling Bayek, and get gud with your bows before trying to deal with higher level enemies, instead of thinking that stealth equals god mode. Ubisoft created a huge, beautiful, and explorable Egypt filled with stories and adventures for you to experience it all, so I recommend that you do it right and enjoy the game thoroughly without the mentality that youre a pro gamer and dont need to grind or anything, but proceed through the main quests or tough areas headon with your assassins skills from the previous games. This is supposed to be the Origins of the Assassins Creed, and Bayek is a Medjay, who lives and fights both as a scout and a protector. That makes him a little more combatoriented than the other Assassins that weve come to know.
