I am a huge fan of the Assassins creed franchise. The best game i have ever played, is assassins creed Unity. I dont think that syndicate is a good game, but i tought that Origins was gonna be the best game of 2017 to whenever the next assassins creed game comes out. But this game is absolute you ubisoft dumb dumb s can come an suck my huge because this game is ing waste of time and money. You have to be a certain level to be able to do missions. And how you are suposed to gain level, is your problem. Because ubisoft does not give aabout making a way to rank up, so you can play the game.
