I enjoy the game but it runs crap on my GTX 1070 according to the listed recommended specs my Rig should destroy this game and instead my FPS is all over the place jumping from 90s to well below 60 at 1440p. Ive lowered every single setting as far is it can go and the game still runs like hot garbage. Legit the worst performance Ive seen and experienced in a AC game.
