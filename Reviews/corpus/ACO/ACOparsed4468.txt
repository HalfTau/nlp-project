Keeps crashing after 30 or so mins. Unplayable and ive gone past the refund time, read online its due to over the top DRM which is sapping all the CPU causing windows to crash, I can only hope the pirates can crack the game so i can finally start playing it. Think ill delete for now and maby reinstall in about 6 months time maby ill be able to play it then.
