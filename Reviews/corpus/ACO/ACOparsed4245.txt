Okay so Ill make this quick.Pros Big Open World Beautiful landscape Different combat Better Weapons Real Eco System Animals are fantastic Difficulty is actually challenging, You need to level up and invest time to get anywhere Story is decent RPG Elements of this game are done wellCons Mostly just empty dessert SERIOUS PERFORMANCE ISSUES, ALEXANDRIA SUCKS TO PLAY IN. Story progresses too quickly without you having killed any of the 5 bad guys, you kill like two wtf is the point!?!? Alexandria lightinh sucks balls compared to the rest of the gameThe game is ambitious and done well apart from mostly dessert and performance issues like you cant even get 60 fps unless you have a beast cpu i have an i5 7500 its no slouch and all cores are maxed out i can play all games on 60fps  max 1080 p but not assassins creed oh boy.Its actiuyally ing ridiclous how bad this game is at times with fps. So yeah if they had just filled those desserts with more outposts or camps maybe it would be better and took out the ing vmp protect and denuvo and optomise this game we could have a game of the year but its far from tat. Still a good game but falling short  due to their own mistakes.
