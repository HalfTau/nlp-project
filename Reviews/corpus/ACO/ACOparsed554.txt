Probably the best Assassins Creed since, well, any of them. I would say this is the best AC game in the series. That extra year of develpoment time was well needed. It pretty much does everything right.My only critizim for the game is its bad performance. Im pretty sure its the game engine. The game engine doesnt seem to be able to handle everything thats going on in the world. The only way you can hit 60fps is by reduceing the amount of content on screen. Stare at the sky/ground slighlty or simply wonder the desert.I was shock that it recommends a card as weak as a gtx760. After testing the diffrence between a gtx760 and a gtx980. Almost no fps diffrence.Still if you can get use to 4448fps, the game is really fun. Ubisoft needs to look at this game and forget the others when deciding how to make the next.
