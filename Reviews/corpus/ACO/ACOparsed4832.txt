Visuals are beautiful just like everyone says. However the gameplay is repetitive garbage, with no strategy required, and little strategy available. Combat is frusterating as guards generaly dont telegraph moves, but you can still predict attacks because every enemy repeats the same basic pattern over and over again. The story is completely forgettable, even optional. None of the characters are relatable or multi dimensional. Huge inconsistencies are visible in The voice acting and motion capture of characters is highly active, but awkward and repetitive, I think that TES Oblivion had more realistic characters emotions and idling. Back ground characters repeat the same 23 voice lines, constantly. Egypt is beautiful, but just exploring a pretty 3D environment isnt a game. I wish I could refund this game.
