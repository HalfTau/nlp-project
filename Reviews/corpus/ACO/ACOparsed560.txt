Origins now have become on of my Top fav List, I have almost every Single Assassins Creed game xD Never enjoyed like this one since from a long old Assassins Creed game. Story i found little bit short, if you keep doing like that, without doing anything further. You have force level system, you have to Level up your Player, or You might die Instantly within secs after high Levels attack you. Story is great, Graphics are awesome, there are many every single details, they really worked great in terms of Graphics wise. There is a Performance issue, but fix little bit after this new update, still there is, when you visit a City type area such as Allexandra, fps goes like 25 / and for other parts it remains stable 60Once you start the game, you will loved to gave more time in your own, just to build more.and the Side quests are so many, it will extend your another extra time, which you will loved that too, also every activity you do, you will get more XP.Recommended 3
