This Assassins Creed game is definitely a step in the right direction. It will live on my top list of AC games, a tie in with Ezio Al Ditore. Easily an 8/10. But let me break it downProsPUZZLES! FINALLY!Good GraphicsXXL Map its 121 km/sq!!!!!Lots of activities to do quests, encounters, etc...Random Encounters rogue animals, attacking bandits, ambushes, etc...Random quests Avenge players, temporary or daily questsVery nice combat style.Low PC Requirements. A couple potatoes and a lemon might run this decently, it just wont be on Ultra High Graphics.ConsToo easy, even on hard its a joke.Senu the eagle is a little bit overpowered, reduced the fun of exploring sometimes.No more freerunning feel to it as was in prior games. Less parkour style and simply more a game with wall climbing.Ingame Store full of unessary stuff microtransactions.To be honest. Ive always enjoyed the AC games. It is a nice little historic game which is not so historically accurate but has nice little tidbits inside that always got me exploring massive ancient structures, etc. AC origins does not disappoint as you can explore pyramids and even has quite a lot of little tidbit historical information that is mostly accurate! Who knew? right?It terms of microtransaction, this game has a fair bit of it honestly. But in my opinion, its not worth buying. Most the ability are not all that great to be honest. Getting crafting ingredients is simply unessary and having those cheating reveal packages ruins the fun. Besides, there already is a map of all the stone circles inside the sphynx, the large table in the middle is a map of egypt with each rock on it reprensenting a stone circle.BTW. Im running a 4th gen I7, r9 290 OC, and 16 gbs of ram and I get a solid 60FPS, even in cities. So honestly, no idea what everyone is crapping about poor perfomance. So, honestly, no idea what is wrong.
