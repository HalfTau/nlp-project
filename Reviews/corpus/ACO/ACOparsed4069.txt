Right... This Review will be short as i havent experienced that much yet, but Reviews for me is a lot about firstimpressions and i think i can conclude that, so.I have been playing for around 3 hours or so now and completed all Siwa content without rushing through the main story.STORY.A lot of people talk bad about the story and how short it is, sure it may be short but the moments you get cutscenes and story telling from NPCs or questlines it is kinda interesting and have at least me hooked on it, i like to follow the story and i sit tight and listening.COMBATBefore i bought this game i was sure that i wouldnt like this combat becuase it looked like however when youre actually inside it looks pretty good, i am new to Assasins games but as i know this combat system is new and for sure to say not flawless but its going well with the theme.OPTIMIZATIONCool, a lot and i mean A LOT of people has talked about the performance, so when buying this game i expected my PC to burn in hell. But hey, we all have to risk it sometimes, So i did and here is the results with this PC SPECi76700K 4GhzGeForce GTX 1080 STRIXSSD  HDD 500GB  1TBPlaying on a AsusRogSwift Screen with 165HZ at 1440P Resolution in the Game.RESULTS Stable 50120 FPS with some stuttering or tense FPS drops in clutter areas or small areas as i noticed like in tombs with 2 walls close around.Other than this, Temp is around 5565C when playing on these settings and all on ULTRA in the settings.FINAL STATEMENTYes id recommend this game, its a polished game but not flawless, it has some optimization problems but with a decent PC u can run it good, otherwise hands on wait for more patches.IF still unsure, wait and buy it on sale, will definely be worth it for you.This is coming from a New Assasins creed Player.
