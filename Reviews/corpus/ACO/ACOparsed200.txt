Alright I love this game, but it feels like the teams conflicted on decision making and Im conflictd on what to say. So Im just going to post everything I wish would change here.Listen to your most loyal customers... If the game is good we will still buy it regardless of where we originally played it.The main story is good, but please put extra effort into these generic side and grind quests. With the exception of event bosses. Can we please expand on that some more? Its freakin sweet.If were going to have these microtransactions, think about it after youve made the content not during. Can you make awesome quality content and find a microtransaction in it, instead of making microtransactions for quality content. The biggest offender is exploiting our time. Is 6 hours of grinding materials worth 10 just because you inflated the required materials unecessarly?Animal diversity and I know this is a farcry but can I please get more options to gain materials.This animus glitch stuff you guys are doing with all this mysticism and magic... Take it and run it into the ground. Im waiting patiently for the next dlc, do not rush it...CHAIN ASSASSINATION? From what I understand as it is Bayek rips an enemys heart out and throws it at another enemy, inadvertantly causing the second victim to have a heart attack and die. Let me show you a game with great chain assassinations.You made this game in the Assassins Creed theme with all the right values, changed things up as usually. Experimented and are successful. Please polish this gem and cherish it.Siwa will never know peace...
