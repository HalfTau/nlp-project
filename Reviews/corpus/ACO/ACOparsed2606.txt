Well where can i start. I have been playing Assassinss Creed since its very first game released in 2009. Even though i felt that they took a step back after the Ezio series, this game nullifies all those silly errors they made in the previous game. Now after learning from their mistakes they have made this brilliant masterpiece of a game.Origins is visually beautiful, the characters have a lot of depth and the story is immersive.Even though i run this on a potato, it still gives me decent performance Dont judge. Great job on the optimisation.The only downside is the high CPU Usage and the steep price for the game. Im willing to look past the CPU usage but the price i do hope it does come down.Im hoping to see more improvements in the game in the upcoming patches...8.5/10
