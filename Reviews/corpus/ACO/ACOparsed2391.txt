I never got the chance to get a next gen console, therefore was stuck with rogue as the last AC game I was able to play. I just got a gaming laptop and got this as soon as I could. Could not be more pleased. The change in graphics for me was amazing and this assassins creed is made like no other. Well worth your price.
