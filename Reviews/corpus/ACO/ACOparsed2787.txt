I was sceptical about this game when it was announced that it was more RPG focused than others in the series. HOWEVER, I cant stop playing it. There is so much to do and the game play is fantastic. Currently 30 hours in and Im not even half way through exploring the world, let alone the story line and quests. The new combat system takes a while to get used to, as well as the upgrade system, buy boy oh boy it is worth the time. A.
