Meh. Had fun most of the time. Ending sucked. Didnt even realize the game was over for about half an hour after i had finished the last story quest, thats how anticlimactic the ending was. Was running around looking for the next one like, wtf that cant be the end...It was fun I guess...  it ill recommend it, but only on sale.
