An amazing game, with very fun combat and stealth, and a cast of likable characters.  The ending was great, offering finality while still leaving you free to continue doing sidequets and exploration activities.In 75 hours I have finished the main story and a good chunk of sidequests, with lots more to do including the ongoing Trial of the Gods events.  I do intend to get the season pass, which at first I had zero interest in.  I reached this decision after finishing the main story, which says quite a bit about the amount of enjoyment Ive gotten out of this game.
