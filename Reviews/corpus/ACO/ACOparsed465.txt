My favorite AC game to date. Period. So why dont I recommend it? Because it runs like garbage on a hot sidewalk.This game at release convinced me it was time to finally bite the bullet and upgrade my old i5 to match my GTX1080. One new motherboard, new set of DDR4 ram, and i78700k later, and I expected it to run like gravy at 1440p....and it does....sometimes. You will not get a rock solid continous 60fps in this game at 1440p even on High settings. You will not. If I cant do it with an overclocked Coffee Lake i7, a 1080, overclocked DDR4, and a clean install of windows, then most people wont be able to do it at all.At 1080p...sure. But thats not why I have a 1440p monitor. Or a 1080. This is a port that was never meant to run at a stable 60fps at 1440p. Period. Alexandria is bad, it stutters annoyingly, but later on you get to Memphis...one of the prettiest cities in the game, in ANY game Ive played. But youll run in slow motion through 1/4 of it and have the game autolock itself to 30fps for another 1/4 regardless of your settings. Keep in mind, I dont have the 100 cpu issue that others are having. It doesnt continuously tax my system that hard, it just spikes often enough to make the game anything but smooth in a city setting.If you wanna play it that bad, wait for a sale. Ubisoft should be ashamed of this...but they wont be. Which is sad, cuz the devs made a seriously fantastic game. They just failed to make it run well for the PC market.
