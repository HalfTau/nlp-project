Coming in hyped, something i rarely do due to worry of being dissapointed i was so happy to realise there was almost no dissapointment to be had. The new combat system really gives something fresh and new and is well expanded upon through the perk system, giving lots of melee skills to master and chain together to overcome enemies. The different varieties of bows keep ranged gameplay fresh with the different types, and switching between them for varied tasks was very enjoyable. Aswell as the combat changes, up there with my favourite additions was the incredible expansive map, with such diversity, one moment you can be riding through the bustling grecoroman city of Alexandria, and soon after be trekking over dusty sand dunes cutting down wild hyena. To keep things short i could go on to describe many more features i would highly recommend this game to fans of combat mechanics, exploration and incredibly beautiful cities and setpieces and hunter/crafter mechanics.EDIT After reading many reviews, i see the game is purposefully badly optimised to prevent cracked games this is a disgusting scummy move on ubisofts part and until this is fixed i really would say, dont buy it until it is
