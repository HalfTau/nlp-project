Id like to redo this review as I feel it wasnt very constructive. I bought this game on sale during the winter sale, and from the moment ive turned it on, ive had troubling issues.From what I understand the game has two seperate DRMs that work as as antipirate protection, this would be all well and good if the DRMs did not drive my CPU to maximum workload the entire time I play Assassins Creed Origins. I can confirm it is the DRMs or something else fishy, because changing the games graphical options grants me no favors. Indeed I turned everything down to its lowest setting, and was shocked to see that it made no difference in performance than the high setting it was defaulted too.Some areas of the game run fairly well, while others can barely keep 30 frames, never does the game reach 60fps, even when there is nothing around me but the warm sands and my mount. Obviously this is problematic to my enjoyment of the game, and I dont need to tell my fellow PC gamers how bad performance dips are when trying to immerse yourself in a game world.Speaking of which there is a lot. The framerate is all over places when in bustling streets, or large areas, its near unplayable. If not for the performance issues, I would completely recommend this game, as the reworked gameplay is near perfect. I will list my specs down below so people can see what kind of rig im playing with, I can assure you it meets the recommended.My SpecsFX8350 4.0ghz 8coreGTX 1060 6gb24gb DDR3 Ram120gb SSD1tb HDDAlso, one more thing. It has been nearly a week since I responded to Ubisofts support team, and I still have yet to get anything back. I feel thats important to note.
