Superb entry in the AC family. Amazing presentation and immersion. Exploring tombs gave me a tomb raider vibe. The landscape  are insanely large. What a treat to explore Egypt!I love the fact they drop the old boring and tired combat of past entries and replaced with a more dragon dogma feel. Not as tight or responsive as dogma but still pretty good. Once you get the hang of it, combat flows well. Some can be thrown off by the combat early on but once you get the hang of it, its not bad.The port is pretty damn good. I did not encountered  any crash and game runs 6065fps solid on my 1080ti with everything ultra except shadow, AA, and tessalation on High. Ultra wide support 219 is the best in a game ive seen yet. In game engine cutscene looks amazing and fluid with no black bars. Prerendered movies are 169 but extremely few.Main potaganist is not bad, I actually like him, espcially once the story gets going. voice actor did a good job. Music not as good vs past entries but I didnt expect it to since this is Egpyt. Side quest are actually pretty fun and varied to my suprise. Overall, that extra year to create this game paid off and you can tell in many ways while playing.
