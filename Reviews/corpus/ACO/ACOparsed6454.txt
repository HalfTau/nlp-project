So far so good, the review will be expanded later, but for now just a quick review for people who are planning to buy it on release.The game runs smoothly even in heavily populated areas, only issues that i had was with audio, but it somehow got fixed on its own when i rebooted my PC.There is a lot of content and even the side quests are worth your attention, because they feel more organic than in the previous games.Graphics also look phenomenal and the new combat system is very much dark soulish/witcherish.Stealth is also a lot harder and the enemies are smarter.I say, if you like open world games, this is exactly for you!
