Fantastic game! Incredible story and side quests! Lots to do, and its near impossible to include everything theyve added to this game! Attention to minor details is extroidenary.  They have added an RPG element to the game weapons are no longer just better than a predecesor, but have their own unique stats and abilities! Super easy to sink 100s of hours into, I would recommend this game to ANY Assassins Creed fan or anyone looking to get into the series!
