the best game of the AC genre I ever played!ProsGood combat gameplay the main reason I like about this gameVarious excellent weapon designs and categoriesAncient Egypt world!Cool enemies / dangerous animals setting!BadoutfitsSailing boats  beautiful water physicsTomb Riders!aND... ...DLCs!! !conssome side missions are boring and repetitiveother than sell or dismantle, the blue and purple equipments are really useless, maybe its because the yellow legendary items have a much too frequent drop rate?I really really hope the combat system can be deeper, like what Dark souls and Nioh did  more weapon techniques and upgrade preference maybe. I know AC is supposed to focus on assassination and stealth, but hey, since youve already done a good job in the new combat system, why not make it perfect!In general, Origin gives me a feeling of Assassins Creed  Dark souls monkey mode  Ghost Recon Wildlands  The Division.I really enjoyed playing this game and I hope the future AC products could be developed based on Origin with more improvements in gamplay.
