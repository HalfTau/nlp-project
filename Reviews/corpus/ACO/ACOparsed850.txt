This new Assassins Creed game is a nice break of pace from the last game in the franchise. The gameplay is fresh and fun, the AI is smarter than before. You can now do proper stealth unlike in the previous games.The design and the setting are beautiful. The story so far is one of the better Assassins Creed stories.Altough I like most of the stuff in the game, I still find it to be a little repetative with the quests. There are a lot of quests, but most of them are the same, just with different characters and different story.Overall, I think this is one of the best assassins creed games.8.5 / 10
