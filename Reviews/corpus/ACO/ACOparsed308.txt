Ubisoft really knows how to milk a franchise  the game isnt too original but it is still fun. How the hell do they keep rehashing the ssame games and keeping them fun? The story was a little.. meh... and being outside the animus is completely pointless, but once again they created an amazing world and addicting experience.
