If youve played the previous several AC games and you start playing this new addition to the series, you think WTF is with this combat??. What the f indeed. But as you keep playing and as you keep fighting, youll realize that theyve made the game much more realistic by changing up the combat style. No longer can you simply block/counterattack/autokill enemies while being practically invincible during the animation. You must choose your battles wisely and be prepared to book it if you get spotted in a restricted area or swarmed by guards.Every single aspect of the game has been well thought out, from the placements of landmarks, to the missions and the stories that come with them, to the experiences or frustrations the player might have. Possibly the best AC game in my honest opinion.
