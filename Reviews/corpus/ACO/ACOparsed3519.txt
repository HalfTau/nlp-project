I have had the same issue with most of the recent assassin creed games and that issue is the lack of realism yes, i know it is a videogame. The fact for me, and i realize this isnt the general consensus, is arrows should kill an NPC if you dont hit them in the shield. My sword should do enough damage with one hit to maim or kill an NPC even in early game. Its just too arcadey and hack/slash. I miss the old AC games where you were a professional killer from the beginning and normal foot soldiers didnt stand a chance. I just couldnt get into it enough in the beginning to progress to that point and have requested a refund.
