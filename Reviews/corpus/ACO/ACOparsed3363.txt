This is an amazing open world version of Assassins Creed. I have always wanted to try this sort of one and it does not disappoint at all. The world is huge, the graphics fantastic, and the world in general feels so smooth and life like. I love to watch the people go about there daily lives.The RPG element of course works well with open worlds, however once all is upgraded the resources become worthless. Hopefully they will implement some other upgrading features in the future. ie. EstateThis is a must to try for any who love open worlds and/or Assassins Creed.
