Okay, but the grind is real.I really dont like how the game is more of a fighter game than an assassin game, I havent played the past ten Assassins Creeds so maybe its been this way for a while.For Example, the assassins blade cant one shot assassin targets or the captain/commanders. or maybe somethings wrong, the assassins blade says it does 4,300 damage but when I use it on a high value target it does 300Ive tried playing as a stealth assassin and while it worked well up through about level 30 now, the enemies above lv 30 have xray vision and can see through walls like when you hide on the wall, whistle, and throw them over.Its much easier to just go through with a mace on horseback.So dont go into it expecting an assassin game like Assassins Creed 1, and remember that the grind is REAL Im looking at you hard leather. But its a good fighting/exploration game the Giza and Saqqara Nome were good.
