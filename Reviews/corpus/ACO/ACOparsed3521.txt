Pros Decent graphics, good variety of weapons,load of extra uselessto do besides play the story quests.Cons Oh boy... Where to start... Hottest garbage of 2017. Youve got a decent begining followed by 3540 hours of aimless side quests and little to no story throughout the whole game until the end when you finally find out why the order was formed. Very disappointing overall, similar experience to replaying AC 1. Game seems like it was made 10 years ago but with decent graphics. Tasks your system as if youre running the witcher 3 on 12k .. Absolutely zero optimization. Plays like an unfinished game. As a huige fan of the AC series I wouldnt recommend this to anyone.
