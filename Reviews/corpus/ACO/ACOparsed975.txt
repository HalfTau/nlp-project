I have to say that this game is a masterpiece. I have sunk all of my holiday hours into this game and I cannot put it down. The graphics are stunning, breathtaking even, the story is amazing and awesome for history buffs. I would say that this is on par with The Witcher 3 my favourite game up to this point.Yes, they borrowed the good bits from The Witcher but hey, I wish more games would in fact.Ive never liked the Assassins Creed franchise until now  this is their best game and I hope it will be the formula for all future Assassins Creed titles. Just WOW!Buy this game, dont wait.
