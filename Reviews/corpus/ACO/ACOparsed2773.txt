Finally asassins creed is good again, Ive been wanting an ac title set in egypt since playing 2 and this really delivers. The world is one of, if not the most beautiful Ive ever experienced and having visted egypt a few years ago I really felt like I was back there. The new rpg features are very minimal but are still a nice addition that made the game feel more rewarding than past titles.
