Processor IntelR CoreTM i74790 3.60GHzGPU GeForce GTX 1080 Updated DriversWindows 10 ProRAM 16GB2K Resolution, 100 Render Scaling 46  58 FPSReviewNoteA lot of people are complaining that they cant run this game. Thats because its time to upgrade your computer. People had high expectations from this game. Game is optimized for 2K and 4K performance GPUs. Dont start crying because your computer cant handle it. Look at GTA5 and Witcher 3. I still cant run those at max settings for 60FPS.Game feels a lot like Witcher 3  Grand Theft Auto  Tomb Raider  Assasins Creed Orgins. This game is very immersive and has a large environment that you can interact with. With DLCs, who knows what this game is fully capable of. I only wish that they didnt have micro transactions... but greedy Ubisoft just had to ruin that part. Game is very good. Definitely worth the purchase. This is the ONLY game from Ubisoft that I dont regret buying so far since Divisions disaster.
