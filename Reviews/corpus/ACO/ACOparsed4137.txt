Assassins Creed Orgins was suppose to renew the Assassins Creed series and experience. Instead it is another Ubisoft cash grab, when you have a triple A studeo producing a game you expect a few things. One is originality the game copies the play style of the Witcher 3 Without Geralt or monsters. Graphics are worst than the Witcher Ubisoft learn from CD Project be passanate about your francise and the game will be a sucess. The story was extremley week, it tries to be deeper than it really is. The game is a basic skeleton awaiting seasonal DLC to drop to rake in more profits. I was willing to give Ubisoft another shot, it sounded like they wanted revamp the Assasins Creed story. There are no city or ship building customizations mechanics. You do not bring or shape the assasins Origins you are just on a long ride on rails for a subpar introduction story that only makes you feel dirty after you realize you game Ubisoft more of your money.OverallRushed launchBuggy GameplayPoor Graphics Witcher 3 CloneCrappy storyMissing City BuildingMissing Ship CustimizationIf this was a Indie studio it would be one thing. But if you love the Assassins Creed francise take it out back and shoot it like old yeller. Ubisoft again is more concerned about profits over, putting a good project out for their audiance.5/10
