Im leaving this review to help people who are confused about the CPU performance issue. I was apprehensive at first to buy the game after hearing all the 100 CPU and FPS issues. It might be a real problem for others but for me its completely fine.As for the game it has its positives and negatives Egypt setting and visually pleasing Open world exploration Decent combat Some nice side quests nothing like Witcher 3 Very repetitive Restriction through levels you absolutely cant fight anyone who is 4 levels above you Never got hooked to the story Glitchy stealth Enemies see through wall and what not Nothing original seems like a poor imitation of Witcher 3i56600GTX 10708 GB of RAMPlaying on a SSDPlaying on ultra at 1440p
