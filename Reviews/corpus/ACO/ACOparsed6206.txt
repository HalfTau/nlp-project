This is a summarization of the Assassins Creed Origins pros and consProsHavent encountered any gamebreaking bugs mentioned in other reviewsRuns smoothly60 fps at ultra settings 90 of the time on my i7 6820 hk  gtx 1080Fun gameplayBeautiful graphicsLots of stuff to doRealistic open worldA variety of weapons and playstyles to choose from.ConsMinor bugs such a an enemy spinning in circles by himself every once in a whileNo sprint buttonSide quests are not that repetitive anymore, but still boring. I literally dont care about the characters.The story seems, right now boring as well.Gameplay is a bit too easy, even on hard mode.Useless collectiblesThis game is very entertaining to play, the view is breathtaking, and the combat is very smooth, but I guess similar to the Legend of Zelda BoTW it also hasfrom what I know now an uninteresting main story and boring side quests.but is becomes annoying when you are forced to do the side quests to level up quickly to do the main missions.
