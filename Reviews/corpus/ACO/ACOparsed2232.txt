Honestly, Im sure the game would be okay, but I cant play it. As with all my other Assassins Creed games, I cant play this one from my second hard drive, and my C drive doesnt have enough space for it. So Id advise waiting on this purchase if you run multiple hard drives on your system. Ive put in tickets with Unisoft for this and other games, but they never fixed the problem.
