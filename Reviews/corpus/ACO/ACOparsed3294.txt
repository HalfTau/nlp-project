This is hands down the best Assassins creed game. It may not be my favorite Im loyal to 2, but the rework of the gameplay is great. The combat is fun and requires more attention. I LOVE the world and level design. Ancient Egypt in this interpretation is immersive and intresting. The characters are fun, believable, intersting and well designed. The quests are not cookie cutter missions like the previous titles and I wanted to do all of them. The main charater Bayek is an extremely well thought out character. He is charismatic but isnt a copy of Altair or Ezio. His dialogue is scripted and voiced very well. His wife Aya and his relationship with her executed perfectly. The out of animus is brief which is good IMO.Overall I love the game and will be launching it up to participate in the timed mission events.
