The density of it is made more impressive by being able to explore it in its entirety without any loading screens, with the exception of some story cutscenes, and if you choose to fast travel. If you want to get around quickly, a smart inuniverse transit system lets you call your mount and press a button to follow the main road, or to head to a custom marker youve placed on the map  all fully automated, letting you take in the scenery around you.While the main story is delightfully mystical and elaborate on its own, Origins also has some of the strongest actual mission design Ive encountered in the entire 10game series  and maybe in any openworld RPG. From collecting clues to solve mysteries, to chariot racing and gladiatorial arena fighting, to chasing down leads and assassinating highlevel enemies hidden in fortresses, to Black Flagstyle shiptoship combat, I was pleasantly surprised by how each of them felt like a selfcontained short, wellpaced story. Another highlight is the series of hidden temples, which  without spoiling anything  tie into Assassins Creeds overarching scifi story, among other things. They are distinct from every other tomb youll find in ancient Egypt, and even include some throwbacks to the fanfavorite, timingbased platforming puzzles introduced way back in Assassins Creed 2. I rarely felt like I was doing too much of any one thing.
