This game is a good game, but its not an assassins creed game. I miss the old fighting system. Where the sword fights with ten people at a time made you feel like a badass. The counter attacks, the amazing kill animations. This game along with syndicate has deviated a long way from the what the AC games were. If you like the Dark Souls type of combat youll like this game.
