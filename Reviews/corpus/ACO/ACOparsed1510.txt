Its so much better than any AC theyve put out since Blackflag.  Takes the best features from 1, Brotherhood, 3, and Blackflag and mixes it with a more RPG feel. If I had to come up with a any complaints itd probably be the stupid confirming body feature and how your hidden blade isnt always a 1 hit kill but hey the game is fing great anyway. Highly recommed.
