i5 3570K overclocked to 4.4GHz with an EVGA GTX 970 and I cant get 60fps even on the lowest settings.Thanks Ubisoft for your scum DRM practises. Its embarrasing that the pirated version of this will probably run better. I feel bad for the devs who poured their heart and soul into this only for corporates greed to ruin their image of what this game should be.Id refund this if I could.
