Very good game and worth the money.Performance at a mixture of about medium to high settings I average out about 4750 FPS. CPU usage is high, but manageable. Some spikes to 100 on my i73770S even using a GTX 1050 Ti and occasional cutscene stuttering, but nothing too serious.Combat It isnt very difficult playing on Normal unless you try fighting people that are way above you in level. AC Unity combat was a far bigger challenge than this. I thought I was going to try to stealth the entire game past the intro prior to actually getting it.Story not quite a Witcher 3 story but its much better than the weak Unity and Syndicate stories.Microtransactions As stupid as it is, get ing real. The microtransactions arent even shoved down your throats. You can get ingame currency easily. Youre already started off with plenty of Helix Credits to get more ingame currency. Theres Uplay rewards which through playing the game you can get MORE currency for FREE. You literally do not have to spend a ing dime to get better gear. Its all about exploration.Cons No  Skyrim horse physics.
