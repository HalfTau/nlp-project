The overall game is good. Maps size is huge but most of it is just dessert . Im using xbox controller on PC, most control is good no sprint button is a good thing, the combating control is very questioning, sometimes the action is delayed after button is pressed making the character easily get damaged. I can feel the game trying to reference the best game around this few years especially Witcher3. If i compare this game to Witcher3 its just uncomparable, Witcher3 is still on top high and mighty in almost every edge of this game.
