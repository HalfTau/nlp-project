As someone that has never liked any Assassins Creeds,this game won me over.A great main character in Baiek and a great and smooth combat and movement system.But the real star is Egypt.The madmen reacreated a lot of Lower Egypt in stunning detail.You feel there and the atmosphere is amazing.If your PC is up to snuff I highly recommend it.
