I would say this game is better than the last assassin creed, way way better. People drop negative reviews due to optimization iusse, but I run the game pretty smooth with the newst Nvidia driver. And for me, the biggest concern was the varity of side quests. It is typical for many ub games that story line is motone, plain, and kinda boring however, up to 2 hours game playing time I know it is not long, I already convinced myself that this game is worth to spend time on playing. The side quests in this game keep me feeling fresh and energised. The art design just reach the standard of classic yet some physical model still need to be fixed. The battle system reminds me For Honor, and they have added tons of different weapons and features to it. Combat is challenging under the high diffcult level. Also, it is worth to mention that Ubsoft upgrade the AI of NPC  unlike last assassin creed, you wont get noticed when half size of youris outside of grass . Overall, Assassin creed is a comprehensive edition of games that ubsoft have developed during the past year, and it shows the potential of being the guidepost of future assassin creed games.
