Great gameplay, story, and world, had a ton of fun, love sliding down pyrmids, but I would not recomend getting DLC, overpriced and not special, and warning runs at 8 fps with 3 monitors and I have a very fast machine well over requirements with 2 1080 Ti running in SLI SLI does not seem to be supported something else might be wrong, but runs well with 1 monitor between 70 and 120 fps.
