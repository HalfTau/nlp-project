Best Assassins Creed since IV Black Flag. RPG elements are a welcome addition to the series. New combat system takes time to get use too and is not as fluid. The main story is bland and the ending has some questionable gameplay choices. However, nearly every other aspect of the game makes up for it. Sidequests, stealth, exploration, and the beautiful setting make this game.9/10.
