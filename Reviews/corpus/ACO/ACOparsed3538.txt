Disclaimer I am playing on an older gaming rig circa 2009... Xeon W3565  ATI 7970, 8gb RAM Samsung EVO 256gbI get around 40FPS on medhigh settings, with some key settings on medium.Great gameplay and story, a few minor bugs here and there but nothing to cry home about. Already have 90  hours in and I very much enjoy this game. It has a natural combat flow and it is very easy to pick up. I do wish there was a way to get items back that you accidentally sold but I understand why it is easier not to.Storyline is deep and rich, lots of hidden nuggets of info everywhere. Diverse landscape and cast, with some great voice acting. I havent played all the AC series so I cant speak to all the games, but this is one the better ones. Id say wait another month for optimization to finish, and for some of the smaller bugs to get ironed out, then definitely purchase this game. Strongly considering the Season Pass, but I may just hold out until the first DLC drops.Happy assassinating.
