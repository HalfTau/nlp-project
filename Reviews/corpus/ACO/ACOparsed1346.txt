Origins was a decent game overall. If you are familiar with the franchise, you know what you are getting into. The mainline quests could probably be finished in 10 hours, but with the leveling system that is in place, there is some expectation that you will likely have to do the side quests and exploration.All told, I spent 70 hours in the game, and honestly the side quests were fine, but the exploration grew repetitive. Objectives for both are very similar, and of course cross back and forth to areas that you may have already explored. This is especially annoying if you had just cleared a fort, and was then told by a quest giver to go and get something from said fort. There were some challenge/exploration areas that I thought made things more interesting, and I think the game probably could have used more of them.Overall it was a worthwhile story, though there is some question of whether it needed to be told. Having played the series from the beginning, it does now leave a gap that Im sure they will cover between the end of this and the first game at some point.
