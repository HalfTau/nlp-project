Great game,kept all of the greatness of assassins creed games, parkour and stealth, and amazing questsBut added a larger map several quests and actual freedomThere is also logical progression and upgrades.The combat is great, but not quite up to Witcher 3 standardBut overall a great game to loose yourself into, actually worth it!
