One of the best games i have ever played. I am a fan of the Assassins Creed seeries and Origins is one of the top AC games if not the best. The story is good and it has beautiful locations for you to enjoy. On the other hand, the DRM that Origin opted for this game, makes it a complete garbage on average computers and it even hangs on top end ones. Hopefully they will drop it soon because it hurts the players that actually pay for the game more than the crackers. they will crack it eventually, but we have to struggle with it even though we payed for the gameStory 8/10Gameplay 9/10Environement and landscape 10/10
