I can happily say that it exceded my expectations altogether. This is the most immersive game that i have played since The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. The world is massive and i find myself getting distracted quite frequently.Personally i have encountered zero bugs. Perhaps this is due to the day one patch and if that is true then it still doesnt give reason to try and convince people to pass on this game since there is obviously an easy fix. As for the problems people are having with crashes i havent had one problem. I dont have the best rig but with i77700 4.2 ghz GTX 1060 6GB 16GB ram. I have been running at ultra settings with 5080 fps which is great to me because i dont have to have 100 fps to be happy as long as it feels smooth and looks good. I honestly dont understand why some people are having these problems and others arentYou can pull arrows out of your shield to use for yourself.You can put dead bodies laden with poison on the backs of horses and camels and send them into enemy encampments to poison crowds of enemies.There is now a loot system based on the rarity and attributes of equipment.Items can be broken down into crafting materials.Scoping out enemy encampments is now easier than ever with Senu.You can seemlessly explore underwater now for new gear or just for the fun of exploring.Viewpoints are no longer an actual necessity for opening up the world map.Animals can be tamed and become allies.Side quests tell their own stories similar to the way The Witcher 3 handled them.Everyone in the game lives their own lives which opens up numerous options for assassinations.The hood can be taken off and put back on.You can pass time with the press of a button.You can climb anything now so pesky mountains wont get in the way.We get to see the beginnings of the brotherhood as we know it.Stealth is still incorporating the awesome crouch and behind cover features from Unity and Syndicate but also adding a free aim bow for the first time.Senu can be called in to attack or distract which adds another useful and tactical element to scenarios.Combat has taken from the much loved styles of the Souls series and The Witcher 3. You are much more involved this time around and it isnt about button mashing counters and finishers anymore. This involves parrying, blocking, and dodging.We see the return of tomb raiding and it will be very beneficial for those who seek money, equipment, and earning skill points.Regular enemies will stand back and watch and cheer as you fight their captain single combat.You can light arrows on fire by standing next to any fire including your own torch.Enemy AI responds to just a glimpse if you by investigating the area they thought they saw something which is a big step up from the previous AI who would stand in place and look for a few seconds before deciding their minds were playing tricks. They will also hear an air assassination or headshot if close enough.Bayek is a well rounded character who is out for blood with an angry vengeance but often shows a lighthearted side as well.The story is well paced and you can walk away from quests now at any time without worrying about failing.Tailing missions are gone and replaced with finding out information through other more interesting and fun means such as investigation and interrogation.The formula has been changed dramatically from the previous entries in the series and has moved towards the more popular RPG style of game yet it still keeps important staples of the series.
