For those who have their doubts, as I did,The game is certainly not as We Wuz Kangzy/Afrocentrist as expected. While there are a number of inaccuracies as to how most ancient Egyptians are depicted on a racial level, they do not simpy make them look SubSaharan African as you would expect from the Marxist gaming industry.Above all, one is left is with a beautiful and highly intricate recreation of Ancient Egypt, whether it concern architecture, varied landscapes representative of the region itself, the showcasing of art and culture, pagan rituals, or the daytoday life of the lands inhabitants. In addition, the narrative is solid and further adds to the extensive lore of the Assassins Creed universe. For those unfamiliar with the series, this is a perfect entry point and introduction.
