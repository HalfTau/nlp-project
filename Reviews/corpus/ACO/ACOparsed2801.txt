After some pretty average games in the series, Ubisoft has finally returned to adding very good game to the franchise.Shame about the microtransactions and store , but thankfully its not needed at all as there is plenty of loot in game.Amazing graphics,excellent sound with solid story line and good side quests.Overall 9/10
