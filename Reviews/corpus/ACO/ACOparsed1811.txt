As a longtime fan of the series, this has been a wonderful, refreshing experience that has revitalized the Assassins Creed series. While Unity and Syndicate were enjoyable due to their variety of weaponry, coop in Unity, beautiful settings, and fasterpaced gameplay, they still followed the cutandpaste formula that previous games have also followed. With an open world, however, we now have more freedom to choose our path, get distracted, and explore a beautifully crafted world of Ancient Egypt, which Ubisoft has truly brought to life. While Ive read into Ancient Egyptian history, I would never have been able to visualize it to the extent Ismail and his team did. Absolutely fantastic work!
