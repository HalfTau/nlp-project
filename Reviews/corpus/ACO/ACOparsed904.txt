Aside from the whopping amount of horsepower this game needs from your processor, everything is flawless. It definitely is a stunning work of art and every corner of the world is picturesque. The combat mechanics have been revamped to stray from the press assassinate to win and towards a more challenging dark soulsish kind of battle controls. The story is substantial but whats noteworthy is how all side quests are in some way still tied to the main story which makes the game even more cohesive and gives the player even more to do in the already vast world of Egypt.Overall, I give this a 5/7. Assassins Creed Origins is a breath of fresh air from the seemingly repetitive mechanics the series has grown fond of  something the franchise really needed.
