I was very skeptical of buying this one, based on previous AC games and their lack of advancement through the series.  However, I have been really surprised at the new ways of exploring areas with the hawk, the combat is fun and streamlined, and the vast open areas of Egypt are great.  I would highly recommend this game to any fan of the series.
