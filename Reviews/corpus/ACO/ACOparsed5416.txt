1. Game is absolutely stunning in detail, by far one of the best Ive seen to date.2. This nowait looting system is a gift from the gods as it used to take me a millennia to loot some dudes corpse.3. I absolutely despise the new hitbox based combat system, this is me probably just being extremely biased as all Ive ever done/known is the older AC fight styles and how glorious they were.4. I noticed when climing/running around the animations are a lot more chunky  sharp/edgy and I instantly found it a turn off for the eye.5/. Origins should not be considered a bad game from a newcomer, unless they as I are biased in some other sort. Its got the looks and goods to fix you for days. As  as it sounds the sole reason I dont enjoy this game is due to its combat system, and for that reason Ill go against my better bit and give this one a 1 haha
