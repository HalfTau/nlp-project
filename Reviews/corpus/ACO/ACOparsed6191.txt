A word of caution it wasnt five minutes before the QA testing or lack thereof becomes apparent. The game is big, beautiful, and probably lots of fun, but when you have to hear BZZZZZT every time a character speaks for more than a couple seconds, or watching the graphics glitch, load slower than others around it I hear someone talk... I mean BZZZZT, but dont see them right away, or lag in not especially complex cut scenes, Im a bit disappointed it wasnt optimized better. For a two year hiatus between releases, its too bad the game is about on par with their yearly releases and will need a patch before its worth your money. This is such a big budget title their QA should have been given the time like TaleWorlds well maybe not that long... and held on to the game until its READY. Ill try again later.
