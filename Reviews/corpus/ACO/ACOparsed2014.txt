The game itself is actually not bad. Is it better than previous assassins creed titles? No. Although I enjoyed the game, I feel that I was not really connected to the character enough and I also was confused why there are no missions in the present world. Some people may not like that but I feel like that contrases the story more. I also feel like the story mode and the whole game was too short. 80 bucks plus tax and I finished the game in the 25 hours. I was a bit disapointed.
