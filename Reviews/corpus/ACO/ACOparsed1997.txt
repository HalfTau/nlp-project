I am a massive fan of the Assassins creed universe. after a few games that let me down i was skeptical about this one. But OMG..this is the best AC game ever! straight off the bat you can tell that they actually put the time and effort into creating this brilliant game instead of pumping one out every year. I love that they re designed the combat system to be more RPG. It works very well.Visually it is just gorgeous. iv spent hours just exploring and taking ingame photos lol. its truly amazing. its the witcher 3 of AC.if you havent bought it yet youre crazy
