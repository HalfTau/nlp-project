Great graphics. Good gameplay. And certainly an award winning game.I awaited a long time for a good AC game. Black Flag was great addition to the franchise. But after that Unity and Syndicate was good but not great ones. The story line was weak and gameplay was satisfying. If one have played the entire series would know that Unity and Syndicate was just like a vacation project for Ubisoft team.Then the first official leak of ACO popped up. It was something legitimate and promising. Its looked like Ubi really put a great effort into the game. As been said and advertised it was a beautiful piece. A place Ancient Egypt so ancient and yet beautiful. I did liked the new theme and sytle. It is a game changer with a plenty of RPG elements nailed into it. It took me a while to set up for RPG style. So many side quests and unique locations to visit, tombs to explore and puzzles to solve.The theme of the game is really set well. I am neither good in History nor Geography and Origins taught me most of it. The Egyptian cultures and the great desert. Well I came to know that there are 3 types of desert Yellow desert made of sand White desert has a huge range of salt rocks Black desert with only rocks in it.Overall I am very satisfied with the game. I do recommend to visit every location to feel the beauty of Egypt. Afterall its an OpenWorld game.
