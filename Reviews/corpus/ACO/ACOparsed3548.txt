so i loved this game as i have most of the AC games, didnt mind the RPG elements being pushed farther, one thing i kind of hated though and i need to get this off my chest. at the 7580 point whenother than that one gripe i loved every bit and was dissapointed when it was over. will probably get dlc story content just to get some more
