I refunded the game almost 30 minutes into the playthrough because i understood its not what i want from an AC game. Its more focused on head to head combat, with tons of fighting mechanics, however the lack of housing and structures doesnt allow for that crosscity parkouring or being able to assassinate someone from the sky, and that was something that really drew me towards the AC series of games. Perhaps im being too harsh on the game without feeling all its colours. Or perhaps this is just a different side of AC games that the developers are trying out.In conclusion this game didnt make me as intrigued as AC III, with the wellmade parallel between the frontier and the cities, or the teamwork mechanics of AC unity.This kind of gives me some red dead redemption wannabe vibes that im not really liking.
