Feels dry, wasnt nearly as awe inspiring as previous versions.Im not sure what the idea was with it.... 70 of this is work.But im obliged to play because Im a series fan. The cash shop is quite disheartening as well. UPlay rewards was enough. Now big name games utilize micro transactions? Seriously?This is definitely my least favorite of the entire series. Not impressed.
