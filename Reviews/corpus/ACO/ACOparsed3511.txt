I bought this game dispite people complaining about performance issues. My cpu is deff being worked. It is at 100 and the temps float just below 90 which is ok in high end laptop cpus. The gpus are running below 60 so my overclock on both the cpu and gpu still hold up. This game looks amazing. I am glad i spent the money.i7 4980HQ quad core 8 threads32 gigs of ddr4 1600 mhzfour 128 gig m2 ssd in raid for speeds 1500nvidia gtx 980m 8gb in sli
