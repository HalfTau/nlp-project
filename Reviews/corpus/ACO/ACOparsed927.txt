Gorgeous game, combat got some getting used to but now I really like it. Story is unfortunately nothing special, but its enough to keep you interested. If nothing else, just exploring is very fun. Playing with a xbox one controller which I would strongly recommend. Ive always been interested in ancient Egypy so looking forward to the history tour mode coming later this year.
