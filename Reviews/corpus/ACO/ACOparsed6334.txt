Played only a bit as of this review but seems to be a step up from the previous AC games so far.Some of the old bugs and quirks still do exist but the combat, world design and quest design are all a big step forward.Performance is perfectly fine around 5060 FPS on a 1070 and i73770  2560 x 1080 Ultrawide works perfectly fine too.Not a masterpiece but certainly a GOOD game.
