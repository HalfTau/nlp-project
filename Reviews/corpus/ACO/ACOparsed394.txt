I actually really enjoy it, the fact that the game has a typical RPG levelling system with gear you need to upgrade and game areas that will utterly kerbstomp you, gives a really good sense of progression.  None of this Elder Scrolls style go wherever you want nonsense which takes away a lot of the sense of accomplishment for finally reaching that last zone or getting to your next milestone.The combat is pretty enjoyable, though some weapon perks make some weapons a little OP,  almost Dark Soulsy in some respects but a lot more responsive and forgiving.The graphics are simply stunning, though no matter how I change the graphical settings it seems to struggle to maintain 60fps.Pretty much all of the content is voiced, even the most mundane of side quests will have you actually speaking to people with unique dialogue.There is microtansactions, although they arent as egregious as some other titles in recent history, no loot crate BS, you buy exactly what it is you want just dont buy Drachmas, the conversion rate is horrific.   If you hate foraging in games you can buy resources and skip the whole hunting side of things, but it will cheapen the game a bit.Im not even half way through and Ive been enjoying just doing my own thing, roaming around, taking over camps as methodically as possible, doing side quests, farming gear to sell and collecting all the outfits I can.Overall 8/10    Definitely worth picking up, but try to get it on sale.   Take every opportunity to undercut any company that includes microtransactions in a full priced game   I mean...you can always get it another way..
