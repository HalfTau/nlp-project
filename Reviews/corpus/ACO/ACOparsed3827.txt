What the actually  ubisoft Im a huge AC fan but you guys are s for this DRM t anticonsumer non sense take thatoff im getting 100 cpu usage on a i7 7700k how is that even possible? Even on low settings remove your antipiracy bs so people who bought the gane can enjoy. DO NOT buy this mess until Ubisoft stops being so god damn greedy.
