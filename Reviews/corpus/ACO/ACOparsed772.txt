This game  is a must have if you have not played the previous assassins creed games which will make you intrigue on how the hidden ones/ assassins founded and thus making it the first history of the game due to the previous games being buggy and  outdated compared to this latest release.my only con would be the DLC/season pass which the price is too much for a DLC with just the costumes that you wouldnt be really needing at all in its first release, sad to say that i feel being force to buy the season pass and the future DLC for a content to be open for me to continue playing the story. but i must say i think this game is9.5/10.
