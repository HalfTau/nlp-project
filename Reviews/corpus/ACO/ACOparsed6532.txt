In the begining I was pretty much disappointed when I started playing this morning due to static sound glitches, cluttery movements on mountains, fast mouse movements, 25 fps, movement when fighting allot of people etc. But after about half an hour Ive changed setting according to my requirements and voila I got 50 average fps along with nice mouse movement and so far I am now getting less and less bugs/glitches than in the beginening. Also I am playing it on My laptop with Nvidia gtx970m and Intel i7 6700HQ on very high settings with allot of tweaking in the graphics settings. I have also tested it on my PC with Intel i7 7700k and Nvidia gtx 1080 and I am also getting like 80 average fps on Ultra settings with some minor frame drops to 5060. So For the newcomer I would highly suggest taking some time to tweak you settings here and there to get better fps and to remove any sort of glitches before playing the game.Now for Gameplay and Graphics. I liked graphics so far as it seems like older titles Syndicate and Unity to be exact, but it is not in comparison with Witcher 3 in graphics. Now the Gameplay is also smoother than before but there are a few glitches in movements on mountains, edges of the buildings and while fighting allot of enemies together like 810. Also the clipping of horses and camels are not right as when I face them towards the wall they cut through it which is quite funny.Overall definitely an improvement on the previous titles and a must buy for a fan of Assassins Creed franchise.
