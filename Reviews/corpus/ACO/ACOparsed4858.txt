Visuals  8/10  Scenery is beautiful, the cities are well done although some are kind of a pain to get around. Character models are nice.. but some are very generic, however with so many NPCs I can understand that part.Combat  7/10  at first I liked the combat style a lot, very assassins creed meets witcher.... however once you find your favorite weapon... it gets repetative.. sure you can switch to a different weapon, however it will most likely not carry you over your most powerfulLoot  I like the variety of weapons and armor.. kind of sad that the armor is pointless except for look.. but some of them are kind of awesome looking.Crafting  4/10  kind of basicSkill allocation system  8/10  my favorite of all the AC gamesStory  6/10  I might give this higher once I finish the story, but so far.. nothing is drawing me into it. The voice acting is very well done.. would have liked more character development though.Content  8/10  so far, a lot of side quests and areas to explore.. however some are very repetative, or fetch quests.Stability  2/10  I played 19 hours just fine... the CPU usage is annoying.. but wasnt effecting me.. nor did I have FPS issues.. but all of a sudden could be cpu I crash or go black screen frequently..As of right now I can say.. get the game as it is fun.. but nowhere near perfect.. but cannot recommend it until the performance issues are addressed... hoping it gets fixed so I can at least finish the story.once stability is fixed Im sure it will be I would give it a 7/10.. possibly 8 once I can finish the story portion.
