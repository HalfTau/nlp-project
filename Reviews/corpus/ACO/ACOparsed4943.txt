I read the reviews on dropped framerates and I see it occasionally in game but it has not once messed up a kill or interrupted the game. Syndicate was a mess that had to be manually set to even run. AS Origins has done better job.Now to the actual review. Spoilers I am a huge Assasins Creed fan. I like the world, the timelines, the interactions. Lately though they have lost their touch. Unity was immediately forgettable and Syndicate was almost as bad. Origins seems to be getting back to their roots. They did away with the dreadful Helix system and moved  back to the Animus and single modern day character which instantly drew me in more than Helix ever did. The main character is complex with relationships that are intwoven into the story. In addition bringing back PreCursor tombs enriches the world in a way that Unity and Origins just failed to. The horse riding system is the best I have seen since since Red Dead, and the amounts of mounts and weapons is impressive.My main issue is that they did away with the free running aspect. That was a central aspect of the game. Now it is extremely difficult to run up and down buildings. In addition you can kill yourself again by jumping off high places even though you are aiming correctly. I thought this was eliminated in AS 2?Overall if you like the series and arent hung up on a few small graphical issues then you should buy it.
