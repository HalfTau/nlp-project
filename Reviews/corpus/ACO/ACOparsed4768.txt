Assassins creed origins is a third person open world game with a massive world, and a ton of quests. Lets put it simply, I love this game. From the sands of Siwa, to the moat city of Alexandria, there is an overwhelming amount of content! I can say that this is easily one of my favourite assassins creed games. Its so fresh and beautiful you can almost smell the air of egypt. Im not going to spoil the story in this but I will say is Julius Caesar did nothing wrong. The enviornment is stunning, the people just doing their daily business or walking around the streets is beautiful, the combat is indeed thrilling. The only complaint for me is the FPS but thats just because I have a 970 and cant get above 50 fps in any game. Its one of those games, like shadow of war, that gives you purpose to keep playing and grinding for that new cool weapon or shield or even bow. Overall Assassins creed origins delivers on many promises from the past games failures, and delivers on every technological level of gameplay, and the combat is so smooth and different, kind of like mount and blade warband, how its hitbox detection.Thanks for reading and my final verdict is a wopping 10/10, rarely have I played such a great game with such historical accuracy. Enjoy the weekend. D
