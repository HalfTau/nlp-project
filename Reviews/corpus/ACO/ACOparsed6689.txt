I want to open this up by saying I have been a long time assassins creed fan, and have played every single one except syndicate. That being said this is the last time I will ever preorder, or even consider buying another ubisoft game at launch. I have a monster of a system, gtx 1080, 4.5 ghz and all the ram Id ever need and im getting 60  70 fps with dips below 20 in combat. Im not unfair, I wouldnt downvote a game if it had at least a few redeeming qualities, but in addition to the optimization the cutscene audio and video stutters from the 3 ive experienced so far. Its a damn shame because if the launch wasnt so bad this could have been the best AC since 2, but this feels like another unity.Oh, and its the first game Ive ever tried to refund.
