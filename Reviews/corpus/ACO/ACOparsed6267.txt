Ubisoft, a game studio that consists of hundreds of developers, makes games faster than people can play them and is motivated by greed. Unlike Bethesda and CD Project Red, the game giant does not concern itself with making the best game of the year. For that matter, they do not even concern themselves with making their games original or good anymore. Furthermore, I find such a detailed, intricate, and developed ingame store for real money in an offline game for which I already paid 60 dispicable and offensive. A few skins is fine by me but this game offers more than skins. Weapons, Armor, even skill points and level ups can be purchased for money. This is not how I remember Assassins Creed nor wish to, my Assassin campaign is now done and I will be thinking twice before buying anything Ubisoft ever again.As for the game itself, it is a polished and quality product. The graphics on higher settings are simply amazing. The world is huge  perhaps the biggest in all AA games. However the story has failed to captivate me thus far and quests feel repetative and boring. I do not enjoy games that start with a go grind up some gear quest. The combat difficulty is extremely easy even on hard and at 6 hours in I see no new or original elements. The game feels like the last 3, perhaps this is a plus for those of us who do not wish to learn new mechanics and strategies but I was hoping for more than just a new map and timeline.
