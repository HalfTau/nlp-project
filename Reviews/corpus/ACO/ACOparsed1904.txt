Far cry and AC hybrid. Didnt like the leveling and combat. Enemies of lover level are too easy, while enemies of higher lever are too strong by HP and damage. You have to hit them for a very long time to kill.  NPC interaction seems to be limited by engines possibilities. FPS drops on my decent config. Few nice new ideas. Bird is awesome.
