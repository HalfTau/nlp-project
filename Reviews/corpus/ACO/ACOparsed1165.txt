Not a fan of the series but this game has blown my mind  it has so much content and the graphics are so detailed and beautiful to see at the same time. To be honest never liked the series but I loved this one and I have to mention how huge the map is, this game also made me stay overnight for some days, definitely 11/10 and the story is very good written
