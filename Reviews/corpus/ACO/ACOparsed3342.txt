The best Assassins Creed Game yet. The changes to combat as well as many other areas definitely help this Assassins Creed do better than some of the predecessors in the series. However as of this moment there are still some issues with stability and there are very little optimizations that can fix them at the moment. Currently I would give Assassins Creed Origins an 8/10. Hopefully with continued support the game can possibly have the score increased.
