the world This is the first thing you will notice when playing the game.most of the time you will only stare at your screen for minutes and leave youin awe because of how beautiful the world of egypt and the photorealistic graphicsthis game has, I mean WOW!combat is massively improved compared to the other titles of the series.It has a strategic feel to it as you have different weapons for different fighting style.story is fine but the phasing is rushed.The main goal of the game is about revenge which is very cliche for an assassins creed game although through out the game they showed the revenge of the main characters quite well.You really dont feel the emotional connection with each characters besides Bayek and Ayathe phasing of the story is rushed especially at the end.most of the characters are just there for the sake of having a character to progress the storyIm also confused on the sudden realization of the characters at the end that they should become an assassin.And also what the  is up with Aya suddenly learning how to speak rest in peace in italian right at the end? it feels so out of place.Despite all the things that I said about the story I still recommend this game because it has improved every aspect of the game compared to recent titles of the series.
