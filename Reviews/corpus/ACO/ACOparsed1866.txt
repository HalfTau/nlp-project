I am actually surprised with how good this game actually is, in my opinion. Yes there is one thing that really bugged me. Well two actually. One being the controls are alllllll very new and completly different from past creed games. But thats an easy fix with remapping. Secondly, there is no sprinting. So far, other than that it is a really good game. So far for me that is.
