I cannot recommend this game until Ubisoft removes the invasive doublelayer of DRM that kills performance. Im on an i5 an 980ti, framerates should not chug down to the 30s on High settings whenever I take a step. PC buyers beware, corporate DRM strikes once again to eat up your CPU cycles for no reason other than pointless greed.Otherwise, great game!
