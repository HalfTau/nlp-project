this game will dissapoint you on any hardware you have, ive played this game with a 970m and a 1080gtx and both of them have left me underwhelmed in performance the game it self a mash up of assassins creed, witcher 3 and a touch of dark souls  and the result is another mediocre open world rpg that doesnt live up to the expectation of any of these franchise and despite it having a longer development time the game is still full of bugs not to menchion the story is generic and bland and the charecters are as uninteresting as could be.the story also sucks .the mission structure is grindy and repetitive.Despite all these conplaints there are positives the combat feels great better than ever and maybe the worlds charecters blow but the open world itself does not it is a amazing recreation of Ancient Eygpt.Movement also has never felt better as you will rarely find your self being screwed over by controls . Hunting in the game aswell is fun for a while but soon turns into a chore. Overall the biggest problem with this game is its fun for about the first 15hours but after that you never experience anything new and the game just becomes extremely boring so my score out of 10 is 5.5/10 on pc and 6.5/10 on console and overall i would recommend you go play either witcher 3 or assassins creed black flag over this game but if u have nothing else to play this isnt the worst thing to play i would give it a neutral if it was a option between yes and no but its not there so im giving it a no
