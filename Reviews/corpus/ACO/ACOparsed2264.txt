AC back in its glory. Ive played them all, and I felt the series really lost its touch as of recent, but this one really put them back up there.Finally we are brought back to an awesome stage cant get much better than ancient Egypt for all you history/AC lore nuts, a revamped combat system that is no longer brainless counter attacks, tons of RPG elements that have rewarding progression and a talent tree with tons of spicy ways to murder your targets and/or that clueless gaurd. Theres a bunch more, but those are the glaring positives with this new title.Ubisoft finally found the right turn to take this series and you can really appreciate that after it all seemed to be going downhill. Only downside is the anticheat software clogs your CPU usage. I have a i7 8700k OCd at 4.5ghz and I randomly am at 100 CPU usage. Hopefully they get that fixed cause it can cause a little bit of stuttering when I have programs on in the background.TLDR AC is back baby, revamped everything but still its sneaky stabby self at its core. If you enjoy AC, youll love this one.
