instantly problems with the sound when people having a dialog, no sound at all or if there is sound its very quiet and its like they are in a cave speaking..The reason why i recommend this game is besides the sound problem during dialogs is that its a good game overall so far, the combat system is a little bit more advanced then previous assassins creed games, a bit harder i must say.
