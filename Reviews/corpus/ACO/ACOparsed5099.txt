This game integrates multiple features of other great gamesWitcher 3/Dark Souls and delivers a fantanstic action RPG expepiernce. Some of the highlights include1. Massive open world with meaningful side quests and explorationsWhatever you do have a purpose tied to the specific region or the big picture2. Interesting and well paced main story I havnt finished yet but about 75 there, love the characters so far 3. Stunning visual of ancient Egypt with temples, oasis, desert and of course pyramid You can play just to take photos for hours!4. Dynamic combat with stealth, tools and different weaponsa bit different than other AC games thoughAnd there are some small things like your voice/footstep sound changes according to the outfit you wear, day/night cycle for solving papyrus puzzle which truly shows the attention to details of this game.Overall i rate it 9/10, the only negative thing is the subpar optimization of CPU, which isnt as bad as most reviews sounds hereI still got 45 FPS in high setting with a 3 year old machine. Ubi is already aware of it so hopefully they will deploy a patch to address the issue soon. Dont let those guys steer you away from this wonderful game!
