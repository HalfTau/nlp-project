First of all, my specs playing at 1440p averaging around 64 fps Intel i54690k OCed to 4.6 GHz GTX 1080 8 GB DDR3 RAM 500 GB SSDI love Singleplayer Action RPG. Ive played all of the Assassins Creed series and some similar games like the Middleearth series.Coming back after taking a break for a year, Assassins Creed Origins shows how beautiful a game can be given enough time. It offers a huge range of graphics settings for different PC specs and a benchmark feature for everyone to use.ProsConsOverall, while this game has its flaws, I genuinely think that this is the best Assassins Creed game yet. Ive had so much fun completing the game to 100. I think this game is already in a better state than it was during launch week. Hopefully, the game gets patched as time goes on so that everyone can truly enjoy the game. Thumbs up!
