The game isnt optimized for PC yet, you need some killer gpu way above recommended to run this game, the GPU Drivers arent ready for the game either in the process of trying to fix the game i broke other games, even with turning the settings down to low it still only reached 45 fps and frequently dipped to 20fps with my R9 380 4gb and my card wasnt even being fully utilized only 2gb of the vram was even in use. So i returned the game in doubts of the drivers/game being fixed right away and went and picked it up on xbox, runs better and found tons more items that i didnt notice on the pc version because half the time the buttons didnt register right.
