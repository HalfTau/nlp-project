Really, really good! Absolutely loved it. Took me 27 hours to finish the main story and I wish I had more time to spend on the game as theres so much more to do. Missed a lot of sidequests and a ton of POIs, some crafting left to do as well...Totally recommend to everyone who likes RPG games. This is not a regular Assassins Creed, this is a true RPG now. Even has a sell unnecessary items button!
