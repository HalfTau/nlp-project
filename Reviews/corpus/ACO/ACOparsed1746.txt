Hello, whomever has graced my review with their eyes,I just got everything done in AC  Origins and wow,if you call yourself a deep and hardcore gamer,and havent picked this game up yet,youre doing something wrong to yourself,and I dont try to control people often,here is why, I am telling you to give AC Originsa great, fuaking chance to outright impress you!Intro  Piece .Year after year, Assassins Creed after Assassins Creed, while they had their pros and cons, they were really moreless the same system and run, now while this Assassins Creed handles quite close to that build makeup, they have tapped into a new way to handle the games cores differently, by their inspirations with other games, one being the critically acclaimed, masterpiece done by CD Projekt Red, known as The Witcher III for example, wed shall get into that deeper into the review, as for bugs, I havent noticed anything pertaining to such, however I will say, bugs are a system to system basis, additionally, I didnt notice any stuttering on my end, however my complete run was done on quite highend hardware, then you probably have, however I also may play higher than you, at 3440x1440, however at close to Maxed Settings, that being clouds and DOF, off, I avgd my 75FPS  75Hz, quite nicely.Core  Changes .While in this game you still tend to loot chests, and hunt people down, just like you did in the old setting and game overall, they have improved on the AC core, I wont say every change, however Ill say that you are more connected with how you want to play and that translates really close onto how you build the very hero in this story, as they have improved on the Assassins Creed Sydicate Level up and skill tree RPGelement system to a more detailed extent, let me say, if you want to upgrade and spec every skill, you will be doing a lot of, loot hunting and xp farming, however these are not required for you to beat the game, you just cant outright go and hidden blade, everyone you see, unless you upgrade that weapon to legendarygrade, additionally, how you use Eagle Vision, you now have a more detailed system here, where you take control of an Eagle, which also can be upgraded through two ways, viewpoints and the perk tree, that allows your Eagle to mark better overall and improve senses, these are just a few changes that I have come to notice that are major changes to the AC Formula and one, I definitely welcome and hope becomes home to Assassins Creed to its very last entry in this amazing series.Game  Play .While here, everything runs quite the same, even the gameplay has changed for the most part, outside of Eagle Vision discussed above!, how you fight in how you built yourself up ingame, will force most people outside others, away from the stale norm this series has come to find itself in, and into a combat system that I feel flows quite well, outside of the combat system found in Assassins Creed Unity, however only in smoothness, for Assassins Creed Origins combat system, is quite more defined and has quite more depth, such as the difference in how all bows and swords ingame, are cutup into subclass, which further favours your playslate and overall taste, additionally I will say however that In Assassins Creed Unity, I found myself using Parry, in Origins, I found myself using dodge, mainly due to how Parry flows in Origins, I found it to be a waste of time as parrying now requires two inputs in a semifast2fast combat setting, although given that, I say that you tryout, Assassins Creed Origins, out for yourself and see what you prefer, I can handle myself in both and adore both, that is just me though.Story  No Spoilers .You take control of two characters in various moments in the games 49 BCE, Ancient Egypt setting, they are both driven to become killers, when a certain group does something that heavily effected both of them, hence vowing to hunt them down, however while the core, Assassins Creed, Formula still existed within the game, the Origins for the seriess ingame doctrine gives old players, like myself, a fresh story with new twists and reveals to behold, for others, outside the Assassins Creed and its massive fandom, I honestly, cannot say enough, getting into the series now and playing from the ground up, would make for one great overall experience, due to how you being fully fresh will let you go up the timeline, as if you really were a hopper in history, overall, the story, while I found it weaker than AC Unity, has earned my taste, and I give this story, a clean, 8/10, given the characters, and how their various moments and stories together are all told, and how the Origins of Assassins Creed, unfolded .Content  PresentationIf you want a game that isnt online and will last you quite some time, about 100 hours for everything to be handled, then you have found your game, if you want a game that will test how long you can exist on one game, you have found your game, the game has events from time to time, where you fight certain, giant bosses, there are some giant bosses ingame additionally as well, whenever you want to play them, and you get legendary gear for overcoming them, however they are not easy, given how now we have a nightmare, above hard, difficultly in addition to enemy scaling to your level, we are reaching  Dark souls difficultly here, side quests, looting, tomb raiding, and Arena horde modes, I hate the races though haha!Now for presentation, while I thought Assassins Creed Unity was nice, Assassins Creed Origins on Patch 1.10, the current latest, and overall, has turned and taken Its rightful place as being the best appealing in visuals and overall detailing given the attention to detail in Assassins Creed Origins characters, musical score, and detailing of the setting presented in Assassins Creed Origins itself, you will not be disappointed, and I would recommended that Ubisoft takes two years to release an other Assassins Creed, if we get another Assassins Creed Origins.Ending  Note .Take the name, Assassins Creed out, there is no reason for any hardcore gamer out there, or just an openworld, RPG, fan, buying this game, you shall not be let down, and you will connect with the characters and possibly find yourself, finally playing, other Assassins Creed ones, such as Assassins Creed One for example, and, we have Steam refunds to help you, shall you distaste the game, or ran into any gamebreaking problem, not that you should in my honesty and personal experience, for any Assassins Creed fan, massive or not, buy the game.That is all  Thank you!Written By  NoctuaVenVK!
