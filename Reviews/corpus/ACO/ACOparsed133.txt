This is a AAA game. Yes, lots of fun, lots of open world, lots and lots of combat, lots and lots of game story, cinematics, and everythng that goes along with been a AAA game.But what it offers in the game department, seriously lacks in the ability to just actually enjoy it. Even with the great graphics, the complex story and the really really really open world playing. It some how just seems to be lacking something. Dont get me wrong it is a good game, and certainly very enjoyable, but it gets tedious rather quick, especially when you end up doing the same thing again and again... and again.So yes, a good game, a fun game, but not a great game. Im not recommending this, because in truth, AC Syndicate just seemed better.
