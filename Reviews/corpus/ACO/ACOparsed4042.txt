This is my fault. I have virtually every AC game. This one is not ecception. Its crap.Runs like dog Complete dog Even for Nvidea users.I have a 1070 gigabytei5 6600kMORE than enough to run this pile of crap.I can run the NEW Star Wars battlefront 2 ing 1440p maxed settings 60fps lmfao.This pos i have to put at 1080, all medium mixed with 1 or 2 high, and all low. to get at least 4557.Now aside from the game running as well as a turd the game play is equally as boggling.its the SAME DAMN GAME since day one. You can skin and animal... wow cool bro.You can tame an animal... wow cool bro it dies in like 2 seconds in a fight.You can be in eqypt but FEEL LIKE YOUR PLAYING THE SAME DAMN AC GAME over and over and over and over and over and over.So once again this was my fault. I should have seen this coming and saved my ing money.Worst purchase decision of 2017will sit next to all unfinished AC games.Pile ofChange name from ACreed to RinseAndRepeatCreed.pos/10 off Ubisoft.
