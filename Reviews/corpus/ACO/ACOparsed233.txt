A needed change to the formula.ProsNew fighting system works wellBeautiful environmentLots of customizationUseful in game camera modesBoobsConsMissions still feel repetitive. Go here, kill everyone, grab object or person, return.Story is still rubbish. Hasnt moved anywhere great since AC2. Lacks anything new.Enemy scaling feels weird. Youre an expert warrior of the highest degree, yet a single blow from a guard can kill you if youre in an area above your skill level.Stealth seems to be lacking. Cant shoot an arrow while kneeling so youll find yourself springing up from bushes getting yourself shot.Guards have awful AI. You can be in a restricted area and walk right up next to them without noticing. Sometimes even sprint right in front of them, but they lose interest as soon as youre out of sight. Or they come across a courtyard filled with their dead coworkers, only to just carry them off and continue with guarding.Still a fun game, and Id recommend it. But its still lacking in certain areas. Glitches are rare, but hilarious.
