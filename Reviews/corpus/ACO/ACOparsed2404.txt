I was excited for this game to come out. Once I got it I couldnt get into it, the beginning seemed like something I had done before. BUT, after the intro and once the title showed something changed. There was a sudden shift in the game from something I have played before just a new setting, to a whole new experience. The storyline is fresh to me at least, the controls are new but I found easy to get used to. There isnt much else to say about this game other than it is the first Assassins Creed game since Black Flag that just made me want to play it for hours without stopping. I really liked Black Flag.I hope this review helps.
