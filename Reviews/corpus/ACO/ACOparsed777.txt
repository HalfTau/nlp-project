Having played more or less all of the Assassins creed games I can say this is by far the best one. This game has a massive and immersive open world, and like the Witcher 3, It is full of content. Even if it doesnt have Gwent. I feel Origins is no longer a fully stealth based game, Its an open world RPG with an improved combat system, and has over 100 unique side quests. Not to mention the hours of exploration to be had. I wholeheartedly recommend the game to anyone who loves AC, anyone who loves a great story, and anyone that loves an open world.
