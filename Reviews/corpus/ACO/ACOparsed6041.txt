Waiting on my refund, I seem to have bought this game by mistake.I meant to buy that new assassins creed game in egypt, but somehow I ended up buying this. Its not very good. Its clunky, the animations are horrible, and like a lot of games recently it ruins the simple pleasure of murdering people by adding lots of stupid numbers to it.Sorry, the number on your bow is 3 and the enemy has a 5 next to his name, so that piece of sharpened flint you just put through his skull at 150 feet per second only reduces his Alive Number to 120. Youll have to make a lot more numbers pop out of him before he dies. that  Real talk, all I want to do is stab people and shoot people. And when they get stabbed I want them to react in a way that is, if not actually realistic, is at least realistic according to my civilian hollywood understanding of how people react to being shot and stabbed. And they dont do that either, because this games animations are awful. How the camel riding animation got all the way through the dev process without anybody involved saying why does this look like somebody stuck an egyptian dude action figure on a camel action figure and wiggled them around? is a mystery to me.I know theyre doing the numbers thing so Ill buy their loot boxes or whatever to make my numbers higher, but I only buyfor games that are fun. This game isnt worth it.Dont buy this game, at least at full price. For 30 bucks and with a smaller scope to match it mightve been one of those perfect 7/10 action games. I can get over the number but not for 60 bucks.Anyway, wheres that new assassins creed game? Is it out yet?
