First things first, nice return ubisoft in AC series , and bad boy ubisoft cause you have dont optimaze the game well...The game is good for sure, nice story not uber, the change in gameplay  specially in melee combat  at first seems strange, it more like Witcher 3 and Dark Souls, then the last AC but thats good cause you feel the dificulty when you gonna fight boss enemys or the phylakes  some sort of bounty hunter that chase you  you really need to concentrate to defeat this ones and have your good reward  they drop probabbly the best gear in the game . Love bow and arrow skill tree, we can see some horizon things in there. The New Eagle Vision its nice , you control the bird and scout what you want to scout bad guy, resources etc, and you can upgrade the bird when you go to the sychronize points soo he cna detect easly what you want or need, its a pure AC RPG experience from the same director of Black Flag in Egypt , its Good and Nice and make your spend money worth, it need some polish here and there but the base its very good.The BAD, no its not micro transations, they exist, but more in a form of cool weapons and good loking suits, yes you can buy better weapons , resources or ability points BUT YOU DONT NEED IT , and they dont bored you like in Shadows of War.The real bad thing is Optimization, you have HUGE FPS drops specially in citys, this is a HEAVY CPU game, so if you want to play in 1440p or better with 60fps or better you really need to wait for a patch or have a Top End CPU, cause if you have a 980 or even a 970 you can max graphic without lose many frame 5 at the most.Conclusion AC Origins its a Good game, RPG experience with many hour of assassinations, exploration, grind  not heavy grind , you can hunt, you can fight in arenas, you can explore the ing pyramids  and you will be well reward for that , you have a bit of fantasy  giant Snakes , Ubisoft create a new good base for the future FINALLY, we just need a good patch and this will be the second best AC ever after Black Flag, will be Very dificult to beat that one.
