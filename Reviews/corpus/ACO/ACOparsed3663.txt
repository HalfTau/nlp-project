Having one of the most impressive open worlds of any game Ive played, with amazing visuals and an insane amount of attention to detail, on top of fun gameplay for both stealth and combat sections, a really good story, and a soundtrack comparable to the ACs of old, this game is a great purchase for people who stopped playing after the let downs of the games after 4, or people new to the franchise. This is, in my opinion, the best AC game weve gotten since Brotherhood.Performance wise, I havent had too many issues keeping the FPS stable, and it helps that the game has an option to dynamically lower certain settings as you play to keep it at a target minimum FPS. The CPU usage however does leave a lot to be improved on. So long as Im paused it doesnt lag my system at all, but as soon as I return to the game programs like Discord start to lag hard. Dont let that dissuade you from getting the game however, it is necessary to point out though.Overall, Id highly recommend it.
