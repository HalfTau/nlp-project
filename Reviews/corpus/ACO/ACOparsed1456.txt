not much of a stealth game which is what i want from an assassins creed game, its pretty much a  cookie cutter action adventure game that tries to copy the witcher 3 in every possible ing way. quit copying other games Ubi and make an assassins creed game that positively resembles the assassins creed franchise ie good story, stealth gameplay
