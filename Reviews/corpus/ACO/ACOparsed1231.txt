This game is a solid foothold on the series after a long rabbit hole of garbage.  If you enjoyed the OG game, and really liked Black Flag.. you will absolutely LOVE this game. Tons to do, tons to see.. the graphics are breathtaking. Exploring every nook and cranny  as in all adventure games  gets to be tiresome but just hit level 21 think max of 40 and I cant wait to keep playing. The leveling is normal, anyone complaining about not being able to 1 shot a red skull... that is how the game is built. You are supposed to come back to that area to find some dope loot. Apparently the way to go is doing that camel boys quests when you can, seems to update a couple times a day? Not sure how that mechanic works, but have gotten other yellow gear from him besides what is on the store. I HIGHLY recommend this game to any true AC fans. If you are on the fence.. jump on in boys. The combat is a little different.. could be just me getting back used to playing with mouse/keyboard/hotkeys, but still enjoyable. You cant just dodge and parry everyone. I like it. First real review of a game, just because I am a fan of the series and tbh.. the games did start going to dog Played basically all of them that came out on PC or console handhelds. There are some bugs, but none break the game. I, again, HIGHLY RECOMMEND the game. Check the emails when you play the chick outside the animus about the game finally tying into the movie Spoiler alert?hit level 27 finally... Just figured this out. If you shoot an arrow through fire, it catches fire... ING AMAZING! get your sniper skill on the left tree to guide your arrow... Spoiler after spoler  sorry. Thisis amazing.
