Great Assassins Creed, it is easily one of the best from a technical aspect, game mechanics, story telling and varity of things to do in the world.ACOrigin, Assassins Creed 2, ACRogue and are my Top3 of AC games now.The Game also connects perfeclty to AC1 and 2 in some ways and really shows interesting ideas how everything could have started! A very nice Prequel game!Only the performance could have been better in cities with alot of NPCs or detail in it.
