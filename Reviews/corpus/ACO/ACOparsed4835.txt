This game was amazing up until the end. The end is so unsatisfying and not paced well at all. The beginning and middle sequences were well paced and polished. Once you get to the 10 final missions cutscenes and story details dont make sense and it seems like they rushed to finish the last act of the game. I wouldnt buy this game. The main enjoyable part was the early and middle story missions and sidequests. Exploring was fun too. The combat is definately harder than previous games but it is very buggy and the ai sometimes instant kills you. This is probably the best map out of all ac titles definately a step up from the rest it just sucks the story got terrible towards the end of the game. SPOILERS! The modern day is definately better than the t first person simulator in blackflag and rogue. At the end of the modern day segment the main character meets Desmonds dad and they leave the Cave and the game ends there. We dont know where they go. The ending to Bayeks story is pretty much what you expect, the creed is born, him and his wife kill everyone involved in their sons death, and live happily ever after
