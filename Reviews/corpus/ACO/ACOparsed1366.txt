Highly Recommended!!!Probably one of the best games in the series of ac. Lots of aspects of the game such as combat, stealth, side quest,eagle vision are new and intresting. Previous ac games had boring and repetitive side quest whereas the situation here is completely different , the side quest actually have different story for each one of them causing players to actually care whats happening. The main story line is also very engaging ,bayak makes it even more intresting .Egypt looks beautifull,pyramids are stunning , the  graphics are stunning. Overall this game gave the ac series a new life.Would rank it as the best of all ac games.        9.5/10
