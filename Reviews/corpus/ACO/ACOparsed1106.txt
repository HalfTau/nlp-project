Ubisoft actually made a good game for the AC series.In short Its an AC game that took strong influence from the witcher 3 without ever getting close to its brilliant storytelling and character design as well as overall awesomeness but making up for it with an excellent combat system and the immersive world that ubisoft has become great at over the past years.PositiveMemorable and believable worldexceptional on foot combat great parry mechanic, good weapon variety and gameplayimproved story and questdesign compared to other ubisoft games even though the story and characters never reach the greatness that the world design deservesbossfights and numerous exceptional human enemiesmeaningful progressionnightmare difficulty provides a challenge unlike EVERY other AC gameReally amazing world so good i had to mention it twiceNegativeHorse combat is awful, being on horse vs non horse enemies is a free win. Fighting horse versus horse feels sluggish.There are still a ton of repeating activities but they are mostly optional with the exception of the save person X quest type that pops up too often.There are bugs, some of which stop progression for sidequests until the game is reloaded.Ubisofts usual DRM t and the inevitable paid DLC3 Bossfights were only playable shortly after release Sobek and the other gods. Why not make these permanent? Cutting content to reward people who can afford to buy everything on release is pathetic.Does not seem to run well on ultra high settings even with top end pc components, one of the patches possibly made the game look worse to compensate for this issue.
