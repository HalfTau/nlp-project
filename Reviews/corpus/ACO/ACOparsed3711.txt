90100 cpu usage all the time no matter how low you turn the setting or how good your rig is. Wont get patched because its no optimisation issue its just overzealous, poorly implemented antipiracy software that will turn your cpu to ash for no good reason. Theres no point even reviewing the game itself because despite the fact I enjoy it the performance struggles are beyond frustrating and this is with specs just above the recommendedFacts Maxed out settings 1080p versus everything as low as possible including resolution lol netted a 10 average fps difference on the benchmark. Proof there is nothing you can do within the settings. The game will run at flat rates depending on where you are 70 if youre in the middle of nowhere desert, 4050 if youre in a denser area like forest with animals and such, 3035 when your in a populated area where 50 of the content is.Either SLOG through the game at low fps and risk blowing up your computer... oroff. That is the choice ubi gives its customers. Another laughable display from a company that hordes high potential franchises and somehow manages to shell out some kind of trash every single time, even when they wait a whole extra year between releases to make something that isnt a reskin!Comparing this game to something like Witcher 3 makes it perfectly clear that some companies just shouldnt be in this business. If a game 2 years older can look better while functioning WAY better and being more immersive and more fun that has more depth, better story AND storytelling with larger quantities of meaningful content and a better consumer friendly business model what does that say about this game and this company?
