This may be the best Assassins Creed weve been given in a long time.The 1 year hiatus was defintiely worth it for the huge quality jump Ubisoft put out for this game.Im a huge fan of Black Flag and this game is simply fantastic in its gameplay, world, etc.Bravo Ubisoft for proving the doubters wrong.
