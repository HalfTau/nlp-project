Great game, even better story. Im not sure what problems some of these people are having but it runs great on my PC.i76700HQ processor 2.6 GHz8GB DDR4 RAM512GB SSDNVIDIA GeForce 960M graphicsCombat is greatly improved and flow naturally unlike past AC games.Edit, with over 100 hours in, I still love the story, game play, etc. I only wish there was an option to not fast forward to the future to the scientist at the dig site. I understand they did that to link this game to others in the series but Id prefer to go through the whole story then visit the present at the end, if at all. Fortunately you only visit the present a few times so its not that annoying.
