I have an r9 280x with an fx8350 4ghz with 8GBs of ram the exact recommed specs.The game ran at 16FPS on medium until crashed after about 15 mins, So much for the year off Ubisoft.Anyone who wants this game my advice is to wait a few months, preferably when it goes on sale to pick it up.To UbIsoft this game looks to have potental from reviews and those who got it to work though one year extra didnt seem enough. I will happly pick up the next AC game if it comes out in about four years or so but for now I cant call it anything close to good as its not anything close to playable.
