I have a mid range I54960 with a Nvidia 980 GPU. My machine just came back from the shop with a new power supply and an otherwise excellent checkup. This game is a mess. Extremely frequent crashing. So frequent that any long or multipart mission is inevitably interrupted and often reset by the crashes.
