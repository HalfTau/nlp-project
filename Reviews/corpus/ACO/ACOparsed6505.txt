Havent played for too long, but I do smell a GOTY contender here.980Ti and i7, 60fps in all areas on very high settings. Besides a few npcs getting stuck in walls, no bugs witnessed.To everyone complaining about performance issues, try upgrading your graphics drivers or get a better toaster.The game itself borrows a lot from witcher 3, in terms of quests and exploration, which is a good thing.The story seems alright, and Bayek is actually a pretty likeable character, unlike the majority of past AC protagonists.The combat feels a bit weird at first and takes some time to get used to, playing on hard provides an actual challenge like in Dark Souls.
