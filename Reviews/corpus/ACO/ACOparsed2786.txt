Assassins Creed is back! It is noticeable that the development team had extra time to develop this game. Gameplay is really good. And I personally think this is one of the best games in the Assassins Creed franchise. Ubisoft looked closely at other games like The Witcher 3. The combat system looks wonderful. There are some little bugs. I had a mission where enemys kept spawning instantly after killing them. I really like the Egypt approach in this new game. Also the map is huge and the are a lot of sidemissions  to play.Pros Finally Steam achievements! Great combat system. A lot of sidemissions. Nice gameplay. Huge world/map. Other approach Egypt.Cons Moderate voiceacting. Artificial intelligence. Graphical bugs.8/10
