Amazing game, would reccommend getting even at the high 60 dollar price for new games. The graphics look amazing even at low settings, the combat experience is great, its balanced it doesnt feel like you are way stronger than the enimies, or way weaker. ALSO THE STORY LINE IS AMAZING, BEST ASSASSINS CREED EVER
