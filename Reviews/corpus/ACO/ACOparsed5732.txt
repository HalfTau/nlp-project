To start off I have 14 hours in now and Cant wait to get back in,My PC SpecsCPU QuadCore i54690kGPU Nvidia GTX 1080RAM 16 GB DDR3Resolution 19201080 60HrzI didnt realise I played till almost 1 Oclock in the morning, Is was some awesome combat michanics and a Destiny vibe with the weapons smith, My FPS is in the 70s  80s but over 100 in any menu. With the cut screen its in the 40s fps, Ive never seen it gone below 60 while playing most of the time, In the beginning it has had some 1 second freeses But that could be cause Its a new game?, I really recommend this game for those looking for and epic adventure.
