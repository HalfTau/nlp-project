Origins was an okay game that had the potential to be a good, even great game. While the game is beautiful, this aspect is, unfortunately, its best quality. The dialogue is redundant and there is very little character depth. The quests all seem to follow the same general pattern infiltrate a barracks or outpost and assasinate the commanders, rescue some NPCs and loot some treasure. While this is fun for awhile, the developers could have made more effort to increase variety. Overall, Origins is a B game that had a lot of potential to have a better narrative and deeper character depth.
