I love Egypt  Assassins Creed, so I was looking forward to this! Husband let me get this for my birthday and I just love this game. So beautifully done Ubi!Only cons are the microtransactions. Why not do community events or updates with mini quests to let people get new interesting things once and a while? plus keep the game alive a bit?
