Ive always enjoyed the AC games for the most part, but this is the first time since ACII where I felt actively immersed into an AC storyline.  I was completely taken by surprise with how emotionally involved I became with the main characters and their journey.  Few games have as nuanced of character arcs as the main characters in this game.  The ending was truley bitter sweet.  Its been quite a while since Ive felt as satisfied with a games ending as I did with this game.  The AC narrative has gotten so complex with years of games, that it might be intimidating for new users. ACO in its skillful handling of its mature storyline in combination with its intelligently evolved game mechanics is a fantastic place for new users to start.  For gamers with an interest in narrative based open world games, this game is highly recomemended to all game fans.
