Running at 1440p, max settings on a GTX 1070 with and average of 61FPS. Also using dualshock 4 to play. So far, no crashes, freeze, etc. As for the game itself, best Assasins Creed since the first one came out in 2007. Combat system is good, RPG elements give a sense of purpose to exploration loot acquasition, upgrades,etc.
