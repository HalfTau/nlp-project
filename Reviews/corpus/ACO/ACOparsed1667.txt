As an Assassins Creed Series fan, i can say that i really like this game. Origins is just what ubisoft need to make a comeback. It is something fresh. The rpg element, the combat, the story, these are great. The rpg element makes changing weapon really does something unlike previous game where you can barely feel it. The combat is something new, it is more hard to master, whick makes it really fun to play because you want to master the combat in this game. But there is one thing that bothers me. The lock on to one enemy is really annoying when you want to change target, because Iam using a mouse, I dont know how it works using a controller, but when youre using a mouse changing a target is really hard. You can run without holding a specific button, so you automatically run, the control is awesome because when i play i havent had any mistakes like accidentally climbing a building, because there is specific button to climbing. But in cinematic view you can no longer walk like a badwhich makes me really sad. But overall is great game.
