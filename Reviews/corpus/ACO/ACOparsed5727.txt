Ive played most AC games, and after the first few it seemed like I was doing the same thing over and over. AC Origins definitely switched things up and made it better and more fun. The world design is the best in any game that I have played recently. The loot and rpg system is also a welcomed addition to the series. I cant say much about the main story line because I have just been running around exploring and doing side quest. I play on an I7 cpu and 1080ti with 60 locked FPS. I have had no drops in FPs at all, and would say this is worth the full price.
