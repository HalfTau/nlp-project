After playing this game i would say it could have been a bit better, it runs decent as the port isnt that good, the game world looks stunning with great looking textures, the world is packed with peoples, animals, collectibles, etc.Bayek controls surprisingly good with very easy prompts, i would say its really well done. Stealth is a bit tricky but with practice it will get easier as their are lots of areas to hide  lots of tricks in Bayeks sleeve. Combat is fluent  easy to master but some skills are required to improve the combat ability more, eagle vision replaced by Senu the eagle drone is job well done, its controls are easy to understand  improvise in tough situations. It has different mounts like Camel  Horse which can follow the road on will allowing Senu to survey the world which is a unique.Conclusion The players who are die hard AC series fan they should definately get this. My score 7/10Optimization needs improvement
