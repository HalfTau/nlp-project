I dont normally do reviews, but this is By far the best assassins creed i have played since black flag, no issues running this in 4k at 60fps, it looks absoloutly AMAZING, combat is a bit tedious but once you get the hang of it its a awesome combat system, If you havnt played any assassins creed titles, or was let down by previous titles, assassins creed origins will definitly put your faith back into the series, well worth every cent!
