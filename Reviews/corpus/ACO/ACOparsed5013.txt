We wuz kangz.Some really major improvements and differences in the AC series with this one. Though my i74770k is about to eat itself the whole time, i still enjoy a great 60 fps 1440p experience. Most to all of this game I enjoyed, and I better since I rarely buy new games nowadays P.I would recommend this to anyone who has a great computer and loves egypt themed games.
