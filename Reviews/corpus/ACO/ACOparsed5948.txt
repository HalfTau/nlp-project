AC Origins makes some amazing changes which is why Its the first Ive purchased.Changes includeLoot SystemLeveling / Level and RPG systemStreamlined Combat  ControlsDue to these alone its a must try. Give it a try, and support them if you enjoy what they did. If youre like me and hated the same copied game every single year, youll enjoy this. IN addition to that it goes back to its route with ancient weapons and fighting rather than future guns and filler garbage.Would definitely recommend to try it.
