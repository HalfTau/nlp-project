It offers a new concept of playing AC series game, and the stealth is still an important part of the game. The gameplay is awesome.However, it is simply too buggy. The game crushed at least 10 times in my 8.4h gameplay and 4 of them were system crushI need to press the power button to restart my gameit is extremely annoying and devastating to the immersion.So it is definitely a good game, but for those who want to buy this game, I suggest you should wait a month for some official patches released.
