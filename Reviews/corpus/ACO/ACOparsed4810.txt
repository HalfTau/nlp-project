Noone will pirate the game if it runs so badly noone is INTERESTED in the game, HAHA! Ubisoft.To be clear, Running the game at the Ultra preset only makes me lose like 12fps of the max fps, and 34 of the min fps range compared to the Very Low preset. Thisis borked. Talking like Ultra  90fps with 4260 in town, Very Low  100fps with 4567fps in town. Constant near if not 100 cpu usage.I54690k16gb DDR3GTX 1070Win 7Running from SSD
