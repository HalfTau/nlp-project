Hello, I would just like to say that game looks so amazing, its a nicely optimized. Dont listen to the guys who are talking crap with thier crapy components. I have 6600k i5 with 16gig ram and 1070 gtx gpu and the gameing is running very smooth on very high setting with stable 60fps. Game gave some crash errors at first launches but i figoured out and updated my graphix driver and it work perfectly. Played about 8 hours and never got a single issue. Nice game, nice graphix and nice story. Cheers!
