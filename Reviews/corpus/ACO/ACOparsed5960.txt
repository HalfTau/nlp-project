Most of the negative reviews are about how the game performs on their computer. Besides bad frames, this is quite a solid rpg adventure. And i hope that future AC games goes after this formula. Its the right way to go IMO.I just hope that ubisoft listens to the community and continues to update and make the game be the best it can be.
