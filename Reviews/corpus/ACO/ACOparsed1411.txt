This game is amazing. I generrally dont like rpgs, sidequesting, or grinding. This game, however, makes it enjoyable. THe main stryline is pretty simple kill the members of the evil organization that is influening the king, but the world is so rich and vibrant, the story feels a lot stronger than most games that meerely use their setting as a backdrop instead of following through. Egypt is beautiful and lush. There is so much to do in an area and the sidequests are incredibbly intresting. Normally I skip quests unless I need the XP to level up, but AC origins has made the quests so interesting that I sometimes neglect the campaign to figure explore the area. A prime example is Letopolis, If you only complete the story quest then the total time spent would be about 15 mins, but one of the sidequests tells you the lore of the city which is way more interesting then the predictable plot twist in the scarab arc.Story wise, its a generic revenge story. It definetly feels a lot more in depth then Unity or even AC 2. Bayeks son is killed and he wants to kill all those involved. The villans are fleshed out and interesting and add a lot to the story. Bayek is an interesting character. He is a man, unlike the proteagonists in most AC games who are boys. There is a clear difference in the way Bayek carries himself compared to Ezio, Arno, or even Conner. His personalty is far more mature and centered. This makes the conflicts less emotional and more cerebral. Bayek already understands that the world cant be changed by the flick of the blade, but he doesnt care. He isnt a naive child, he has seen evil and he wants to protect the innocent from it, not change the world.Overall this game is an easy 8/10 there is tons of content and an immersive world. The quests are sometimes stupid, but the pay offs are more than worth it.
