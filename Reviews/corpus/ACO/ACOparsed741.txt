This game, man this game is BEAUTIFUL the scenic views is amazing especially when youre on top of the pyramids or the great lighthouse the views are absolutely breathtaking, The story is very well done and extremely though out. The cons however the game is extremely grindy the level cap is 40, but i like the grind but the grind might turn off people from the game, but if you think about it the hours of fun wouldnt be the same I beat ac3 in about 6 hours this game took about 70 hours so it gives you more fun. I also like how you upgrade weapons with different rarities and such. all in all my rating is about a 8.5/10.
