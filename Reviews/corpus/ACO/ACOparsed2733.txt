I finished main story and most of side stories , just not everything yet and it took a lot of hours of playing a good game , I enjoyed playing assasins creed , I enjoyed graphic and gameplay , even it gets repeat but which game doesnt after 100 hour of playing , I would recommend  this game to everyone who likes Witcher like games such as this
