Pros A interesting story plot, and engaging side quests. Only a handful of quests did I find myself skipping the cutscenes Beautiful world and environment. Seriously, Ive been taking so many screenshots, its so pretty Mounts! Gotta love mounts. Makes traveling and combat so much better Less stealth needed, no more sneaking around every single city out of fear youll be attacked. Now you only have to worry about restricted locations and sneaking through those Puzzle solving and working for a goal, rather than just running up, looting a collectible, and running off again.Cons has some graphical bugs a lot less after the new patch! and nothing gamebreakingOver all, I am really enjoying myself. I get a stable 55 FPS on my computer, with everything on Medium, clouds/water effects on, and textures on High, with my setupIntelR Core TM i54690 CPU 3.50 GHz, with 16 GB installed.graphics card is Nvidia GeForce GTX 960
