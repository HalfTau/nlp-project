Went in with low expectations, came out extremely suprised. This is easily one of my favorite games released this year. Not going to lie, it has some performance issues, but an overall great game. Just remember to leave AA on if you want to use the photo mode, it may be fixed by now, but currently, using photo mode without AA, wont work. Anyway, super good game, definitely recommended!
