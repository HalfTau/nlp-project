Awesome game, I am partial to the assassins creed series as I have enjoyed every single one, this is one of the best looking games I have ever played a complete graphical overhaul. Not only can my fairly mid range PC run this game maxed out locked at 30 fps but can run it on High at 60, this game is surprisingly well optimised and the gameplay is fantastic, the combat is completely reworked and is much more engrossing and challenging.
