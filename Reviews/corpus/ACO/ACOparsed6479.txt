After playing this half of my day this game is gorgeous.And im really big fan of this seriesPos.Open World Is really big, i can say this is biggest Assassins Creed in their fanchiseFighting is changing now this time its more challenge as they said. last time in Unity its didnt work out well lolThe world is looking alive such as vulture eating corpses, all animals have their own food chain.They were adding little details too, like When u whisper to distract people Bayeks move mouth too. i know that some people always look main character mouth haha. The blood float in water. And wind also make it more realistic like Watch dog 1 in E3 lolCons. im big AC Fan but you know every game isnt perfect at launch Low FPS af, i got 1520 fps all times even i got over recommended spec The game eat a lot of my memoryAlthough this game make me mad at Frame rates but overall the game is near perfect if the game isnt great performance. I hope developers team will hear us and patch game soon 3
