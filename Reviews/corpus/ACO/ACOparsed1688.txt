This is the first game Ive paid 100 for in the past 4 years and I dont regret it. I just got done with the game I done about 98 of everything. I have to say this is one of the most fun games Ive played. When I got near the end I didnt want it to be over. Ive only felt that way for two other games Witcher 3 was one. As I progressed and my guy got stronger I found myself moving up the difficulty level. This is not common for me as Im not the best player. By the end I was playing Nightmare mode. I cant wait for the DLC to come out! I highly recommend this game, well worth the money.
