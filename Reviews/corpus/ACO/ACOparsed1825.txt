one of the best open world game in the AC franchise with an intersting storyline! Improved combat techniques, parkour, character customization  Including facial hair . It runs smooth on my i7 4.0 Ghz, gtx 1060 6 Gb video card but the game could be better optimized for an even better game play! Had no issues with the game and yeah i completed the entire story but thanks to Ubisoft we have daily missions which gives us some top notch weapons and we have more incoming in early 2018! AMAZING GAME  worth the while
