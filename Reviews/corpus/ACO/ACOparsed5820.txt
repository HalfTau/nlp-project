PROS Huge open world to explore  no pointless collectibles. The new side quests offer a wide variety of stories to be told, along with wellthought out objectives. New loot system is a simple yet effective way of obtaining weapons and supplies. The main story does a great job at showcasing the birth of the Assassins Brotherhood. Loveable characters, each with their own unique personality. Revamped combat system adds challenge to picking off your opponents.CONS Lag spikes sometimes occur  performance is not very well optimized. There are a lot of bugs in the world but most of them are not gamebreaking. Microtransactions Come on Ubisoft.Conclusion In my opinion the game has revitalized the series bringing in a plethora of new features, a vastopen world and aloveable cast with a deep storyline. All in all, the game is worth the 60 and I highly recommendit to any fan of thefranchise.
