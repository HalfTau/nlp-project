I was hyped for the game, I was hyped for the setting, I was totally a fan of taking a 1 year break although I already loved Syndicate and in the End the game is even better then expected and so far I do love the story. 92 hours ingame and slowly closing on the end, although I let the story sit for a long long time as I just love doing all the side missions and how the game just looks.
