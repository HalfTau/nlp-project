So far, its a very good game. It reminds me a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn and The Witcher 3, and thats never a bad thing.The gameplay is very enjoyable, though it needs a little of getting used to especially for old AC fans, but once your start holding the grip of the battle and exploration systems, the game tends to be very interesting.Im just starting it, still in the region of Siwa, so the story hasnt really unfolded yet. Im not sure of who Im killing, who Im helping and why Im doing those things. As a good book, the start of the story unfolds slowly. Lets hope it is worth it.Also, if you love Ancient Egypt, as I do, and always wanted to feel how itd be living in that time even if this game is timed at the ending of that period, this game is the perfect place to do so.I havent encountered any killer performance or technical issue so far aside from a classical Ubisoft bug when I got inside a freaking pillar. My build i57600k GTX970 16GB DDR4 RAM. I can play the game at the highest setting at 1080p, and it looks awesome. Reaching 60fps on normal circumstances and dropping to 45fps under heavy load.On the bad side, microtransactions exist just as they did in AC Unity and Syndicate. They are not intrusive at al this is not Shadow of War. Also...DONT SCREW GAMING. DO NOT BUY MICROTRANSACTIONS. SaveGaming.With that, I must say this is the best AC game in a long time... at least in the feeling aspect. Lets see how it develops with time. This is just a first impression, after all.
