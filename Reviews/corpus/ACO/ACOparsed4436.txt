Awesome game, I highly recommend this game to anyone... although you will need a strong PC to juice all the glory out of its beauty.My RIG is a i7 6700K 4.0GHZ, ASUS ROG 1080, 16 GB RAM. My game runs buttery smooth.I dont understand why other people with equivalent specs are having so many issues... maybe viruses, and or outdated firmware... not sure but its easy for people to point the finger at the developers which isnt fair.The attention to detail, the graphics and fighting mechanics are all superbly done!!
