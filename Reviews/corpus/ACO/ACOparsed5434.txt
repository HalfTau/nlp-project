Having a blast with this game so far. Heard theres two layers of drm thats only bad thing. It may or may not affect performance. Game runs pretty good on gtx 1070 looks great I have no complaints.Gameplay feels a lot like blackflag you can definitely feel the difference between this and other AC titles. Would definitely pick this one up if youve skipped the last few titles. Feels good like Ac 1, 2, and Blackflag. 9/10
