A very enjoyable Assassins Creed game, the setting isnt quite as interesting as the predecessors, since its 80 percent covered in a desert. But the developers managed to make the most of it.The story itself is fairly simple and straightforward, but it does a good enough job of keeping you engaged. Bayek is a likeable protagonist but isnt on par with Edward Kenway or Evie Frye. The other characters are pretty forgettable, and I feel like Ubisoft could have done a better job at fleshing them out a bit.The new combat system is interesting, completely different from what we had before. I would describe it as Dark Souls Lite, its more about positioning and timing, getting an opening to attack the enemy, rather than the easier and more repetitive combat of the previous titles.Performancewise the game is very demanding, but I feel like its justified based on the experience it delivers, and not a case of a bad optimisation. And it got a pretty amazing photo mode that is porobably more addictive for me than the game itself!
