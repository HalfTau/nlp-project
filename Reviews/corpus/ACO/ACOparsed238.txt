Assassins creed origins PCGraphic  8.5/10story  7/10gameplay  9/10OVERALL  8.2  MUST PLAY AND HAVE Great gameplay, very HUGE map, MANY things to do, GREAT boss fight, almost perfect. This new assasins creed now adapt some of RPGs system, theres leveling, abilities to obtain, crafting material to get stronger equipment, hunting etc. Its fun, enjoyable, addictive and very highly accurate of how the past ancient egypt is, just like the assassins creed 2 on its reissenance era in italia.  it has promising stories to tell, but too bad the narative of the story is somehow Flat some how intriguing. Maybe the lack of background music that made the main story is kinda mediocre. Instead the main story line, the story On all side quest is very intriguing each has different story and different perspective about how the people of egypt at that time lived and what kinda happened around that time. the main story is still good but it should have be better than that.The game run well on my PC with some FEW REALLY STUPID BUG trust me when you found it, it will be silly LOL 144hz monitor, core i7 8700k, gtx 1080 ti amp extreme, 32 gb of ram 3200mhz clocked at 16
