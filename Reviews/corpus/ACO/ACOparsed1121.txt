I have a pretty high spec computer, 1080GPU and an i7 CPU. No any issues with any other games, but Origins crashed my computer four times, to a BSOD, even with all the settings on ultraLOW. The fourth time, my computer got stuck in a BSOD loop and I ended up reformatting the whole thing.I have been refunded but holy hell was this a poor PC port. I would highly recommend the game on a console, but not on PC.
