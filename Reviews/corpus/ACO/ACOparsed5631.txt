Best of the best. In love with this title. Its a nice mix of Witcher 3, Tomb Raider, Hitman, and all the AC goodness of the past. The world is beyond massive. Kudos to the team that brought this to us. Well worth the full purchase price coming from someone who waits to buy the last AC on a steam sale. So good!! !
