I have played all of the main series games and have honestly enjoyed them all to some extent or another yes, even 3  Unity. Origins refreshes the AC formula enough to justify yet another entry. The RPG elements are sufficiently addicting and, once I got used to the gameplay changes, I found the combat system a little bit more interesting than most other entries in the series.My main quibble with the game was the progression. If you play a lot of side quests, like I do, then you will outlevel the game pretty easily. The main quest storyline itself finishes around level 3536, even though you can level up to 40. Theres really no way to win with this situation either. Whether you outlevel the main quest or come back to the side quests later, you will find a fair amount of the content trivialized.That being said, there is a lot to do, and, even after all of the hours I have put into this game already, I still have some things to wrap up two of the war elephants, the elite version of the 2nd gladiator arena, and most of the chariot races. Plus, Ubi is supporting the game with the timed trial of the gods events. So far, they have been good for getting me back into the game long enough to kill an Egyptian god for legendary loot and checking a few items off of my todo list.For me, this game is a 9/10. Despite the progression issues, I have enjoyed the game quite a bit. As for you, it really depends. If you hate Assasins Creed games, then this probably wont change your mind. However, if you have ever liked an AC game, then this one might rekindle your interest. If you have never played one before, then this is a perfectly good place to start.
