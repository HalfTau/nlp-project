This negative does not mean the game is bad. It is indeed good but missing some Assassins Creed factors, for example, the synchronization progress has diappeared and theres no more secondary objectives during missions, which really disappoints me. Change of controlling style is somehow annoying since I love the ones from Unity and Syndicates. The same thing happens to the combat mechanics as well. I got used to the combat in Unity and Syndicates and its long gone now, no more easy executing assassination actionsmaybe its because Bayek was the first Assassin and dont have that skill to do so? I feel bad about that anyway. Its a good game afterall, but I feel like its a different IP now. Honestly I enjoy this game, its like playing a Witcher 4 or something like that, but its really not the Assassins Creed that I want.
