Definitely recommend.Pros  Beautiful game. Gameplay has been quite enjoyable. Good storyline.Cons  I found the keyboard controls were counterintuitive and awkward. I reassigned a bunch of keys to my gaming mouse.Also  when gathering supplies for crafting, there are only icons used to tell you what you need without a legend. Some look so similar I find it hard to tell what is required.
