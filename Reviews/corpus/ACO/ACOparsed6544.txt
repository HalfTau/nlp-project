Where to begin where to begin. I open up the game and press start game, instantly brings me to the action. No Hello Initiate! t or anyof that crap. Instead it instantly takes you to the main character Bayeks story and his struggles during the modern day. And I hardly noticed any bugs due to me admiring the scenery the characters and the dialogue.  Recommended by me.
