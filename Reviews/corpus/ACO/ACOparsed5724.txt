Loaded up and the game set me to medium loaded up the benchmark to see fps instantly at 40fps it started going NEAR the town down to 14 up to 25 down to 20 up to 40 down to 30  STAGGER   freezes for a second. So i decided to put quality to lowest possible and i had a max in town of 35 fps, and now i loaded up Witcher 3 and put quality to ultra 20 fps WITCHER 3 High quality was the same as origins LOWEST QUALITY POSSIBLE well actually no i had 40 fps on high so it was better  medium quality SOLID 60 FPSI got Witcher 3 GOTY edition for 20 WAY MORE WORTH THEN THIS GAME FOR 60If youre thinking of buying it and you have a REALLY good PC go for it i might go for it if they fix the optimization, but right now i want my money back.my specs Laptop  gtx 1050 4gb vram i5 2.50ghz quad core 8gb ram
