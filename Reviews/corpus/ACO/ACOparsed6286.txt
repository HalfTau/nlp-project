this game is very good so far. much more diverse then the last games , no question their. but as much as i like this game i do have a  complaint that i think is easily fixable. first the combat. the new combat is great and a much needed change from the last game. but somtimes dose not have the best looking animation. the game needs more kill animations for takedowns
