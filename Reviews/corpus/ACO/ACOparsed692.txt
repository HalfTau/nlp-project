Assassins Creed goes Bayek to its Roots and is better than ever. AC Origins takes everything good about the series and expands on it. Eliminating the past baggage that has previously been dragging this series down. The controls are better than they have ever been and feel truly next gen, no longer feeling like you have a stick up yourand much more like a  fluid, freerunning Assassin. The combat system has also received a much needed overhaul and feels so natural. You can really feel the weight of the weapons within the gameplay. From light, fast duel blades to a slow and powerful Axe. Stealth remains almost the same but now it is optional which means no insta fail, tail this guy and dont get seen bull missions thank the gods. The main character is actually likeable which hasnt been a factor since Ezio in my opinion. Now the best part of this, the setting, Ancient Egypt is truly breathtaking and it takes a while to get used to how good everything looks, many times I have found myself wondering off just to see the sights the excellent photo mode just extends this even more, you are rewarded for exploring and there have been some great side missions and storys throughout this game and I soon realised that the extra time developing this game was well worth it, it feels complete and not rushed. I glad to say this game can easily hold its place next to brotherhood and AC 2 as one of the best and I fully recommend it.
