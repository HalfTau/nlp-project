Its great and I would recommend it. The best part of the game was that, when I was deciding to buy it I was thinking about the gold edition because of the season pass and that weapons pack and all so generally what happens when you buy a weapon pack, it helps in starting the game but after leveling up those weapons become useless. Well this doesnt happened with this game the good thing is that you can upgrade your all bought leagendary weapons to your players level. There are many new features in this series as well which will you will really like because as I am too an assassins creed fan from the begining and I liked them too. Just try it I would not spoil things for you. All the best.
