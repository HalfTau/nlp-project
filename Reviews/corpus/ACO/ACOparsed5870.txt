Now i have been really exited for this game. And when i started playing 2 days ago i was shocked. Personally I think this is the best Assassins creed game so far. Alot is changed, but I think it has made it better. Dont hate this game just because its Ubisoft, because its really good.ProsReally large and detailed mapLots of good sidequestsImproved and better combat systemAmazing main characterYOU CAN ING SLIDE DOWN A PYRAMID!Really good main story so far, this review is written when i have passed 20 hours.Cool weapons, I like the bows.Good and detailed skill tree.Well I could talk about this game all day long, but as you can see I have nothing bad to say about this game. Yes there is some bugs, but not game breaking. And the first patch isnt realeased yet so we cant blame them.By far this game is a 10/10Edit  Just finished the main stoy and I have soon 100 the gameStill 10/10Nominated this game
