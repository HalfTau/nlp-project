A nice open world and it looks like they took a look at the Witcher 3, In a positive way. Certainly an improvement over the previous one in the series.The combat seems more honed to range combat instead of melee. Which can make it feel a bit easy. But still enough variety to make melee combat as well useful. Didnt find my self to use a lot of smoke and other gadgets.Ancient Egypt is a great setting and the stunning view from atop a pyramid is great. The variety of scenery with some mountains and marshlands gives it a nice variety.
