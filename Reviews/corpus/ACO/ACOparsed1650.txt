In essence, Assassins Creed Origins is much the same game as the original Assassins Creed, which came out a decade ago. Its a formula that people like to play, and its certainly been honed and improved over the years. Origins is, then, undoubtedly the best iteration of this formula yet . I love it because there are opportunities to just go off and do my own thing. I can hunt animals for resources that can then be used to upgrade my gear. Or I can fight trade caravans and steal their gear. I can just stroll around and enjoy the world. But the game itself makes a lot of compromises with its alleged openness, in order to guide the player through a coherent experience. Origins and Unity  2 games that are 10/10 and they cannot be changed .
