i would have LOVED to play this game...but like EVERY SINGLE UBISOFT games its always about the bugs and poor optimizations...like CMON guys you all took a YEAR off assassins creed and you still didnt learn from your mistakes stop rushing a halfgame should have taken another year off instead. but i do however like the new combat system its alot more dark souls like and alot more face paced. But as i said before this game is good and all but Optimizations and bugs is whats giving me a thumbs down. also im pretty sure microtransaction is obviously also a horrible king idea for a SINGLE PLAYER GAME. People seriously needs to speak out agsint these type of companys. WHICH this is also another reason why i dislike the game i SHOULNT at NO point be basically told that hey man you can totally BUY this weapon or item with REAL money and it helpos you progress OR YOU CAN GRIND yourself to death in order to proceed. i can understand if this was in the case of multiplayer game but for a SINGLE PLAYER game? wtf is that t?THERE SHOULD BE NO MICROTRANSACTIONS IN SINGLE PLAYER GAMES PERIOD.
