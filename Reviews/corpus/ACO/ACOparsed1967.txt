the game play is awesome the story is fun the new combat system is great but the game crashes all the time. i haveintel core i7 4790  3.60GHz, 8GB DDR3 ram, NVIDA GeForce GTX 1070 and it still crashes. i cant play the game in the lager cities because this game takes up 100 of my CPU even if i close every other app on my computer, turn all graphics to lowest and cap FPS at 40 game still crashes beacuse my CPU is at 98100 all the time.
