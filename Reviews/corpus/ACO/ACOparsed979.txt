Im far from done with Assassins Creed Origins but Ive loved every minute of it so far. The map is detailed and full of entertainment  enough to genuinely keep me from hopping from quest to quest. The cities are beautiful too. If youve not played any Assassins Creed game since the third, dont come into this expecting an Assassins Creed game. The series has changed since then, but I think it has finally found its feet again with Origins, a happy balance between the freedom of Black Flag and the true AC experience of the Ezio trilogy.
