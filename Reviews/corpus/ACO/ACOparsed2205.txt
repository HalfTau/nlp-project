After playing for about 30H I think i can say that the Break Ubisoft took from the AC Series did good.The Graphic is great, I mean I play it at Ultra High Presets with a GTX970 and about 4555 FPS on avg.Story seems to be good so far, even though it is more interessting in exploring the world or just trying out things
