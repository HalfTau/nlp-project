Im currently 29  hours into this game when Im making this review. Assassins Creed Origins, The newest in  the series. A massive open world to explore the depth of Egypt and its ancient history. If you are a HARDCORE  fan of the Assassins Creed series then I think you will  be little  disappointed as this game does not follows the traditional AC style but i think you will also enjoy the RPG style new AC mechanics which is completely different than previous ACs and i must say I like this . For me the last good Assassins creed game was AC revelations. I kinda liked black flag also, unity was totally forgatable i didnt touch the syndicate . This game is really a fresh start of the series and for me after lost all hope on AC franchise.Anyway here is my pros and cons of the game.PROSBig open world with alot of sidequests and places to explore Photo mode Amazing Graphics awesome combat systemplot is advancing  very well so far skill tree is awesome as well CONSsome little bugs etcFinally i want to say that  the HYPE was real  UBISOFT did  a good job taking one year gap  it was WORTH IT.  overall the BEST AC  FOR ME AFTER AC REVELATIONS
