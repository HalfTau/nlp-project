Love this game, I take off my hat for Ubisoft, because I did not believe they actualy deliver this game as promised. Graphics are awsome, combat feels dynamic. So many quests to do and they all help you understand ancient comunity. Almost endles sites to explore. If you have a lot of free time and love ancient Egypt, this game is for you.
