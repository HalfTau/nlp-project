Full with DRM that slows down your game, 100 cpu usage literally creates a virtual machine for your pc to run the game in, which unfortuanly pushes back a really good product.The game looks awesome in medium settings, but due to DRM I have a CPU limitation and I can not push to the high settings, even if  I really wanted to. I also have many fps drops in the first 5 minutes after starting the game due to the same problem. I must only have the game open so I dont have problems with fps drops.So far, I have tried to complete all the side quests, different tasks in different places, the only thing I found to be repetitive are the optional events, which usually give very good loot.Awesome combat system, Souls Like, and since I was playing Dark Souls 3 before this game, it makes it even better.This game also talks a lot about Egyptian mythology, I learned things I did not know, and often used google mid game to search about a god that I never heard of.Theres an ingame store that you can buy coins to purchase items that affect the game, shame most AAA tittles are adopting such an antigaming tactic.ProsCombat SystemGraphicsSide questsWorldEnvironment ancient EgyptDifficulty game feels better in Nightmare modeConsHorrible DRMPerformanceNo hood On / Off animationGrindy upgradesMicrotransactions
