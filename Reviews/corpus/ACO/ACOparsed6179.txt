Sound doesnt workGame runs at 30 fps on a GTX 1050 at low settingsGame bugs out and crashes 5 times within the first 20 minutes of gameplayUses Uplay, the most broken thing since Games for Windows LiveWill never buy another Ubisoft game again. Im sick of paying 60 for a broken game when I could spend the money on an indie game with an original concept and developers who care about the actual game instead of stealing money from their customers with t paid DLC. Assassins Creed used to be one of my favorite series ever, and Im disgusted to see it fall this far.Thanks again for nothing, Ubisoft.
