The best Assassins Creed game since Black Flag.You can spend hours roaming the different environments in search of a new weapons or crafting materials to better your character and its exciting when you find that shiney new loot youve been wanting.The new combat system actually made the game challenging instead of Press E to counterattack every enemy you come across and instakilling them.The map is HUGE, and thats no exaggeration. The map is divided into many regions which you unlock when your travel through them for the first time. This uncovers the region on your map and you can now see points of interest such as villages and towns throughout. The story doesnt take you through all regions, so exploration is promoted to see what is within.People complain about optimization and fps drops ect because of the DRM. For me, Ive had no issue, the game runs smooth for me at high settings and Ive had only a few crashes due to my own faults.SpecsOperating SystemWindows 10 Home 64bitCPUIntel Core i5 6500  3.20GHz41 CSkylake 14nm TechnologyRAM8.00GB DualChannel Unknown  1064MHz 15151536MotherboardASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.
