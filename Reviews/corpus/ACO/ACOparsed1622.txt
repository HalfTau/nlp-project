Im gonna start off with what I like The gameplay is very good, and I love the setting and atmosphere of the game. Its altso nice to see a new way of progressing your character with xp, levels and abilities I havent played other AC games in a while so I assume its new to the series.However, the writing is an atrocity to the art of storytelling. There is very little context for what is happening, and the characters that I have encountered so far seem to be without depth, including the main character. The Dialauge in the game is bland and short, which is perhaps a good thing, seeing that it makes me focus more on the gameplay than the story.If I had known what I know now before buying this game, I would certainly not have paid full price for it. Sadly I am not able to refund.
