The Good Egypt setting, moving into Sinai soon... I wonder if well see a Jesus Christ DLC Exploration is really fun makes you forget to play the game at times Fighting styles stealth, open or hybrid, ranged or upclose, all fit well with the game mechanics and AI behavior, none feel forced Senu Quests and sidequests are very rich Mounted Combat and Dem Bows Good menu design and a GPU healthbar! Minimalist UI war elephants, taming lions, shooting rampaging hippos, underwater croc fighting and petting cats Mystery Bare chests andeverywhere lvl cap 40 before DLC but no ability cap I think The Duat battle Lots of fire involved photo mode for my epeen VERY SMOOTH PLAY. Only had two glitches in 40ish hours of play one was a hyena glitching underground, cant even remember the other one because it was so minorThe Meh Cleopatra is unbelievable as Cleopatra wheres the milkbathing, semidivine beauty filled with seductivity and a regal fire approaching sasha fiercelevels? Layla bit just before the Weighing quest felt underproduced and forced, luckily it was short enough sidequests feel irrelevant main quests should be more difficult and sidequests should have been used as modifiers per regional target assassination quest and you quickly lose track of them if youre rushing to explore like meThe Bad Climbing in corners am I missing a control here? is nearimpossible Ultima characters, cutscene and items after exploring what I thought was an epic ancient site wish this was optional or removed entirely, it came out of the blue, broke immersion and I have no interest whatsoever in Ultima cant dismantle/sell gift/store/club items clutter, immersion  see Ultima point   would much prefer a legendary chariot over rare items in the storeSo, better presentation, content and setting, but a bit less quest structure than Im used to from an AC title.8.5/10, would hallucinate in the Desheret Desert again!
