IMO FAR better than the Witcher 3. AC, like WoW, has been the inception of open world games and maintains the very best in that dynamicability. The immersion scale is off the charts with this one, they really nailed Egypt beyond all imagination plus a surprising level of high tier graphics on display I seriously thought they wouldnt bother but this is almost as good looking as Unity.The biggest drawback is the level scaling, its ripped right from the Witcher as most new elements are but it didnt work then and still really sucks now.GOTY for me, right ahead of Nier Autosexbot.
