good game but be ready for glitchy rendering and shity fps. my comp can run it on high graphics for about 30/40 min before having this problem. same thing will happen on low setting. this seems to be a problem a lot of people are having. this needs to be fixed. huge disapointment especially after spending 100 on glod version. i feel very cheated by ubisoft.  when this gets fixed i would be glad to change my recommendation.
