I have been a follower of this series from the very first game. I was getting worried about the series for a while with Unity, and though Syndicate was good, it wasnt good by Assassins Creed standards. AC Origins brings the feel of an Assassins Creed with a fresh new feeling. The combat isnt perfect but it is a massive imporvment from everything before. the characters and world are so much fun to explore and there is plenty to do. The main story is a good one, it keeps the players attention and made me want to finish the game. Even after that, I have continued exploring the world.If you are an AC veteran skeptical of buying a new game because of the recent produtions, I would say this game may be the one to get you back in the saddle.If you are new to Assassins Creed, this is a very good game, but still play at least the first three games because they are more than worthwhile.AC Origins is a very good game, and it doesnt take long to see how much love Ubisoft put into this gameA warning however It will suck your time.
