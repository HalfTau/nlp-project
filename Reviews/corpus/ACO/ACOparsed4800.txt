I dont know why so many people are having problems with performance in this game, yes the cpu is getting overused while the gpu isnt working as hard but im getting 6080 fps 4050 in large cities and im playing with a mix of high and ultra settings.im running this on an I5 4570 and a geeforce gtx 1070 but i guess the performance is a little individual seeing people with 1080 TI s and I7 s are getting big issues and lagspikes.The game did get an update yesterday for people with Nvidia cards, tho it seems like that wasnt for AMD and that might have fixed performance a bit for Nvidia cards.Gameplay wise i really like the bits ive played so far and i think this game is worth a buy if you like open world games!
