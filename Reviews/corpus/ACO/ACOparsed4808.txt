Bought this and got 40 minutes out of it. Let me put it this way the other reviewers arent wrong.My system isnt top end by any means, i5 3570k, 970, 16gb ddr4 but it beats minimum and should allow for at least 4060 out of medium settings. What I found is that it didnt matter what settings I put it on, I would always get 4060, even out of very high. Kind of odd, but the stuttering and random drops were pretty frequent annoying. I hadnt even been to any major cities yet. The performance is just all over the place regardless of settings.Then we get to the infamous CPU usage. Its all true  what others are saying and regardless of your CPU, this game will run it into the ground. My CPU is aging at this point of 4 years, so having it run at 100 max high performance for as many hours as I want to play isnt really viable for me in the long run, out of the sake of selfpreservation for my machine.Best way to sum it up Yes, the game is fun. It looks beautiful, and the bit I got out of it I definitely wanted to play more. I didnt actually want to refund it. Sadly, the poor technical performance mixed with this DRM means that its just not worth playing it right now. Im not sacrificing my machine for the sake of preventing pirates from playing the game. Especially since I bought it legally.
