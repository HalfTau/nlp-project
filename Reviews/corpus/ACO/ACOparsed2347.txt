Never played any of the Assassins Creed before this one, and I think it is a pretty good game.pros good story, welldesigned stealth/battle system, nice costumescons side quests have nothing to do with the main quest, just repetitions of killing someone, looking for stuff, gathering resource. There are hardly any stories in those side quest.
