Ok, after 2 disapointing games they made one that is actually very decent. It runs smooth, havent had many bugs or anything even while using AMD gfx.Why you should consider purchasing this game1. Really beautiful. The world is huge, detailed and full of exploration. Im running on a mid low comp and still getting 35fps average. Optimization could be better since as I said, Im running this with a AMD card.2. Lots to do. Even if you dont play a lot of sidequests, they still offer a lot of content. And I mean a lot. You will get good playtime, even if just wandering around the deserts or sailing up and down the nile.3. Actually very liberated gameplay. You can basically do the missions however you please. You can be sneaky or do them by force.Why you should not purchase this game.1. Heavy on DLC promises, lots of buyable gear and stuff.2. Very grindy. You cant freely exlpore without being the appropriate level. In earlier games you at least could just do the missions not having to think about leveling up.3. Main story is very long and repetitive. Side missions make up most content. Not very many longer side missions.Other than that, if you enjoy the AC franchise, its worth the time and money and the team making this has actually made a decent game. If you dont like the franchise, but like games like skyrim or witcher, its a decent game, get it at a sale or something.EDIT Spoilers ahead. The ending is so cringy, it was sloppy writing and ideological t. The game still is a good game but the Main questline is soo sloppy and forced.
