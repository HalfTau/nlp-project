Ahh, Assassins Creed.Oh, remember the times of Black Flag? Good times eh?Then came the failures, Unity, Syndicate, etc.Everyone thought the franchise was done.Then this game came by.Ive been playing the heck out of this game, I cant stop, Im obsessed, had it for the last 23 days and already have 20 hours, thats a lot for me considering my sleeping schedule waking up at 10, going to sleep at 10.30.Boy, do I love this game.I love it when youre holding your breath whilst your hiding in the bushes while that OP enemy is walking past.Or when you sabotage the brazier so you let the enemies spot you for them to end up in a fiery death trying to light the brazier.Or when youre trying to do a quest but you get breath taken by the amazing views.This game amazed me, I didnt have amazing standards for it, but boy is it good.Now, this game isnt all willy nilly as it still does have flaws, the story line for example, its a bit...Well, it is an Assassins Creed game so keep that in mind.It still is great.Another thing is the time it takes to complete, I havent finished the game, but everyone seems to take around 30 hours, this was a bit of a turn off for me as Im used to games like The Witcher 3 that take 100 hours.So it is kind of sad for me to see that my gameplay on this is coming to an end, as they dont have multiplayer, which kind of sucks.Im still giving it a solid 8/10 though, it deserves it.Luke
