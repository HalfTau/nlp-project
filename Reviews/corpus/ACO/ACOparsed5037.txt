No problems with performance or bugs yet i5 4690K, GeForce GTX 1060, 32 GB RAM.  I thoroughly enjoy the RPG elements incorporated with the stealth gameplay.  Controls took a little getting used to, but theyre intuitive enough that it didnt take very long.  Wonderful story, music, and graphics.  Worth every penny!
