I dont really do many reviews, but I wanted to give my support for the game here with a thumbs up.A massive open world to explore the depths of Egypt and its ancient history. 40 hours in game time with all main quest completion and still didnt got bored playing it. Insanely beautiful Scenery, characters, animal,infractures,pyramids and everything is really extremely well done.The story is not very big but it will touch your heart beacause its soo deep and insanely well written.It also marks the begining of THE CREED The Brotherhood.huge open world map, millions of quests, tread one meter and you have another thing to do. A completionists dream or nightmare, whatever  Overall i strongly recommend this game you will have dreams of it definately P
