Refunded after half an hour.It would have hooked me in if it werent for the stuttering and hitching  why is it blasting all my CPU cores at 100 in an empty room at the start of the game? No matter what I try, I just cant get 60fps locked even on lowest settings at 720p. Ridiculous on a 6600K and 1080ti.Waiting for a crack instead, but would repurchase if Ubisoft removed the DRM. Its obvious the layers of DRM are killing the performance of what is otherwise a really interesting game. As it is, the stuttering problems kill immersion too much.
