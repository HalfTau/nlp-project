Just installed my Aorus GTX 1080Ti Xtreme Edition and expected to be able to smash this games fps, when i started, it was smooth when i was in the desert, but when i went into the city, my fps dropped to around 40 which is completely stupid, even on the lowest settings i was barely getting around 60, so without a doubt ill be refunding this game.
