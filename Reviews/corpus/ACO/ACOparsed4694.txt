Where to begin??? I have played the first two Assassins Creed games and also Black Flag,  I thought they were pretty good games, but I happen to like this one so much better. The open world part of the game makes it so much better, and I love the RPG aspect in the game also. To me it plays much like Witcher 3, which is probably one of the greatest games ever made. So far I can not complain at all about this game. Side quests are good and it runs so smoothly on my computer. If you are a fan of Open world games like Shadow of Moridor and Witcher you must give this one a try. Loving this game so far!!! !
