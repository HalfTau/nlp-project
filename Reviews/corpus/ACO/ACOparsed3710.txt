Beautiful game, Completely new fighting syustem. No more button mashing. A little taxing on the CPU but my Intel 7700k is able to handle it. Only con i would have is the lack of SLI support. With a game this beautiful, i dont know what ubisoft was thinking to not have a profile at launch. 4k or bust!
