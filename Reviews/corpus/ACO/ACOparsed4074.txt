So far it runs extremely smooth, no dips at 1080p maxed out on a 980Ti and 6700k both overclocked  1480MHz and 4.6GHz respectively Cpu usage is around 7080 but then again, temp doesnt really bother me since I have a watercooled CPU so yeah.Great game so far, the graphics are ing brilliant, theres a lot to explore and I like the combat, to be honest.
