This has to be the best AC game ubisoft ever made. It doesnt crash, its optimized superbly, and it addicting.The controls are responsive similar to MGSV if youve played that game.The world is HUGE and full of life. It isnt big for no reason, there is so much to do in the world and every location has something different to do.The main story is pretty good and takes place during the Ptolemaic Dynasty real history.Customization is fair, you choose between what sword, bow, and shield you want to carry at the same time on your back your character can look really cool with what shield looks compatible with your outfit.There are also fun ship battles from AC4 but without the ability to upgrade and free roam in one, only some missions.This is a must buy game for singleplayer fans   9.5/10Also set the difficulty to Nightmare if you play the game for the first time, it gives you a fair challenge and makes you want to play the game sneaky.
