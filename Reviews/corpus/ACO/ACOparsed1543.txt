I have been an Assassins Creed fanboy since Altair ibn LaAhad and the Ezio days, and even when they killed off Damian, and even when some of their games just didnt make sense and was buggy coughUnitycough I still stuck through it because I just loved the plot and playing style. To me, the last great AC game was Black Flag and before that Assassins Creed III the one with the Assassin Connor and after that I wasnt sure where the AC brand would go. It was worth sticking it out and waiting by the franchise as Origins truly gives me that same feeling I had in the early days and it truly another masterpiece by Ubisoft. Rolling back the years to the time before Assassins and Templars, playing as an Egyptian Medjay is absolutely enthralling. Exploring ancient egypt the new kingdom and an updated combat system, which is also extremely simple to master, I truly love this game. I am not happy about all the microtransactions in the store, but at least its not one of those games that throws them in your face all the time. Its cool to have microtransactions, but there should still be a method of buying DLC content with ingame currency. Other than that, and of course the fact that I cant run ACOrigins on Ultra settings due to the shear resource hungriness of the game mainly due to the AntiCheat system used its a great all around game to play. Even with the lowered settings, the graphics are still impressive and the world map looks to be the largest to date. So I would definitely recommend this game to anybody!
