This might be the best game Ubisofts ever done. Its definitely their first game in the last five years, I wanna say, that has some distinct character to it.I think weve gotten three technical masterpieces on PC this year Resident Evil 7, Wolfenstein 2 and now Assassins Creed Origins. Its one of the best looking games Ive ever played. The animations are incredibly well done, the world actually feels unique, which has been one of my main complaints with Ubisoft games lately, the lighting and shadows are drop dead gorgeous and it just FEELS like youre there, two thousand years ago in Ancient Egypt.I really dig the new combat system, its really similar to games like Breath of The Wild and Dark Souls, although not as deep as Souls and not as enjoyable as Zelda, in my opinion. Movement is so much better than in previous titles, your character controls great and the horse and camel riding mechanics are super enjoyable and fluid.I havent experienced that many bugs and the games been running fine for me at 1440p, and its utilizing my system to the max, which is what you want really, even if it means some drops from the target 60fps, consider just how great the game looks.Im honestly shocked by how good this game is. Its shaping up to be one of the best games Ive played all year, and definitely the best Ubisoft title Ive played in the last five. If youre a fan of games like The Witcher 3, Metal Gear Solid V and the latest Zelda, this is kind of a mustbuy, in my opinion. Its genuinely great.
