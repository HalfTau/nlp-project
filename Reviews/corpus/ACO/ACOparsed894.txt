Yes! I didnt have very high expectations of this game, but Ubisoft has indeed made Assassins Creed great again. The graphics are great and it performes well on my system. Egypt is a great setting, and the open world map is huge and fun to explore. Great story, great mechanics.. This is in my opinion the best Assassins Creed game ever made so far. I highly recommend this game. Good job Ubisoft Montreal.
