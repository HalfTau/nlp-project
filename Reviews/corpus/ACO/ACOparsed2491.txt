Bayek feels like his own character rather than an Ezio wannabe. The story starts off super confusing, but kinda makes sense when you play farther. It also helps to know some of the history of egypt at that time. AC Origins is a massive upgrade from ACU and ACS. I hope to see the next AC game follow Bayek again.
