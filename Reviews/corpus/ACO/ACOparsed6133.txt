I really like the crafting system, hunting, and the way gear works. The mounts could use a little customizations but its fine. I didnt follow the game at all during development but Ubisoft did catch my attention when they took a break from the series. I felt the next Assassins Creed would be one to jump on and Im glad I did. The Game Map is huge... Lots to see, Iv found myself just exploring more than half my playtime. The sand, the animals, just, so, life like.. I couldnt stop, Cants stop taking screenshots. Lots of cool in game secrets, burning bush, something falling out of the sky, maybe even Aliens... i look forward to finding out.The story so far isnt bad, the graphics are some of the best Iv seen yet, running at 1440p on Max Settings. 980ti SLI,  i76900k,  32GB RAM using SSD no OC on. Locked fps at 60, very smooth graphics. I can do 144hz, I doubt it will run as nice.
