As a huge fan of the first trillogy of assassin creed that fell off after black flag, it is nice to have a assassins creed game that touches on the first civilzation again, besides all the assassin stuff this was the cool back story that kept me into the games. However there is a lot of times within the story you wonder why a certain character is only a 1 panel character while other side characters like apolodonos are more rounded out even though he is in a few cut scenes, and the ending with layla is a great throw back to the firsts game ending and without spoiling any more, the game play makes up for some of the story problems with the additions of new fighting mechanics the game feels fresh and new, by taking a page out of the dark souls combat manual. the open world is beautiful and vast, though there are some areas that are vast wastes of space the oceans at the top of the map. on the microtransaction problem, the micro transactions really dont do anything helpful that you cant do with an hour of grinding, there in game currency isnt hindered, i had 12k before i was buying boxes from reda, just sell the random items you get instead of dismantling them. the drop rates are high for items so i never found myself in need for money.Overall its a nice jump back to the assassin creed anthology 9/10PSLate game is lacking but more free content is supposed to come.
