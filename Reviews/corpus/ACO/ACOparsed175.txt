Chemistry of this game is  Dark Souls  Witcher 3  Assassins Creed  AC Origins.I would say that Ubisoft made quite good amalgamation out of these 3 masterpieces.I dont complain about Uplay, because when you get achievements, Uplay rewards you with uplay coins and you can buy extra outfits, quest,  weapons etc.If you play on nightmare difficulty, kill the archers first!On nightmare difficulty killing gods its easier than killing elephants, weird ubisoft... Combat system is incredible improved. You need to play a while in order to understand and feel how to fight. Moreover, each type of weapon creates different style of fighting. Weapons can be cursed, which means it reduces your HP to 33 but increases your damage about 200, but you need to be caucious. Also they can be poisoned or on fire, i like poisoned weapons, actually there is a lot of fun you can do with poison.About FPS, if you want to get better performance and good graphics, then go to Options  Graphics and set AntiAliasing  Adaptive, then set Dynamic Resolution 60FPS and very important turn off Volumetric Clouds, and also shadows no more than medium. Constant 60FPS. it worked for me GTX 1060 6GB OC, 8 RAM. I really dont care about clouds in Egypt.P.S. you have a lot to see and a lot of screenshots to make. No boring at all.
