As I weve come to expect the story telling in Origins is brilliant. And the world is massive with a huge number of things to do and bad guys to shank. Unfortunately the game is let down by poor quality control in some cases. Some animations are seriously wonky, particularly assassinating any sitting or lying character with the hidden blade. Theres also a couple of terrible spelling and scripting errors that Id chuckle at and move if found in a side quest on in an indie game but to in the main story questline of a AAA title costing 50, I find completely unforgiveable.The character design looks great overall but the fact the archery bracer, which is upgradeable and therefore has its own tooltip,  wound up on the wrong arm is a pretty big oversight at this level.These failings aside theres plenty to recommend the game. Origins is pack full of seriously beautiful locations to climb all over and the fight coreography is fantastic.
