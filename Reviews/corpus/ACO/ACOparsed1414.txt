The models and props are so glitched around that it destroys the whole atmosphere. It clearly is made for fast players which run around and loot everything they see. It isnt suitable for anyone that seeks a polished singleplayer adventure. It feels very rushed and unfinished and the graphics arent even as good as i thought. It is a mess of a game...
