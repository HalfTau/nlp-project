So after now passing the 2 hour mark and the refund time i feel i can put a review outAll in all the break between this and the last AC is notable personally i havent suffered from any game breaking glitches, havent noticed any random NPCs spawning on each other looking at you Unity. The controls are fairly solid could be better but it feels that the character goes were i tell him to go and does what i tell it to do fairly solidly.Performance, i havent had an issue with everything maxed out with a gtx 1080 and i76700k cpu sits around 70 fps with the rare drop to 50 fps at its lowest and it was very brief.The loot system is a welcome addition adds that level of desire to actually loot everything and be rewarded for doing so.All in all, i would reccomend. However if you didnt like AC before not entirley sure that this would change your mind, its more of the same but expanded on systems that worked.Edit 1 typos.
