The Assassins Creed franchise has become great again. Origins has taken the old AC DNA and recoded it into something new and fresh with inspiration from some of the best action RPGs around like the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, Dark Souls, Shadow of Mordor, Zelda Breath of the Wild and Horizon Zero Dawn.The graphics are the best I have ever seen in an open world action RPG to date with stunning draw distances, textures, lighting, water and terrain. The world is alive with people, animals, predators, patrolling soldiers and ambient sound / dialogue. The map feels huge in scale and variety from towns, wetlands, open desserts, canyons, mountains and tropical oasis. The map is filled with points of interest to discover including ancient tombs, pyramids, fortresses, sunken crypts and palaces. The viewpoint system returns but is a mechanic that this game needs just so you can witness the beauty of the game world and fast travel across the huge distances.Combat is totally new for the franchise and is heavily influenced by Dark Souls and the Witcher 3 with dodging, rolling, parrying and take down animations.Stealth is still pretty good and feels similar to how stealth works in Shadow of Mordor.There are only a few negatives such as slight FPS drops due to heavy CPU usage and DRM. You must run UPlay alongside Steam but you do receive 2 lots of achievements. I have witnessed 2 minor visual bugs but nothing else. The collision detection isnt the best so expert a little clipping.AC origins is 90 different and better than the last AC game Syndicate and is definitely worth playing if you enjoy the other open world action RPGs i have mentioned or if you just enjoy single player action and adventure games. 8/10.
