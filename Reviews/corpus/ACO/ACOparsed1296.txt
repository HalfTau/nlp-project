Ive played 5 or 6 of the AC games and this one is by far my favorite. In fact it is my favorite open world after Witcher 3. Its gorgeous, combat is the most interesting in the series I think and it takes a lot from Witcher 3 open world gameplay. Lot of things to do and places to explore I feel sad not having anything more to find in that world count 60ish hours for all achievement and visit everything and a bit more if you want to absolutely do everything.Only disapointement was the rather bland main story and lack of strong story telling as is often the case in open world ubi games like these.Nonetheless Id recommend if you like that kind of big immersive games and want something to fill the void after Witcher 3.
