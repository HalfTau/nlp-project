Firstly its really starting to annoy me with people saying it has performance issues, i have been playing the game for over 50 hours now and have had over 80 FPS with ultra settings everything max and it never dips or lags even in big areas like alexandria. Now to the game.ProsBig map i mean absolutely huge and vast with different areas even spots where a white desert meets an orange one.A massive amount of stuff to do i mean i have just finished the campaign and still have a crap ton to do.Beautiful game the graphics are absolutely amazing everything about the game is perfect graphics wise no popping or missing textures.Much better combat system.The animals and npcs are brilliant with animals feeding, hunting and eating and not just sitting in one spot doing nothing but waiting for the player. Soldiers in forts, outposts etc will take roting shifts where i watched someone who was a sleep get up just as someone was going to sleep and then proceeded to man the post on the wall which became unmanned, adding to realism.The general enviroment, when travelling through the map you can see wind pushing sand across the floor like it would in real life and there can be the occasional sand storm which can be seen from a far distance away.The lighting for one is amazing standing on a cliff looking down at a city in the dark is amazing the lights flickering with the stars above best i have seen in a game based in the past.And finally the general levelling up system is great you start off slow and it is a bit of a grind in the middle but one past the middle the game is much easier you can eat through bases once too hard to do so giving you a sense of accomplishment and phylakes very hard bounty hunters looking for you i found i was hunting them than them me nearer to the end of the main quest which made hunting them fun.Cons There arent any the game is bloody brilliant from the story to the graphics well worth it and with the plans to add an entire new section to the world based on rome gives you something to work towardsI am running a GTX 1080 and an I7 6700K, I aswell had no issues on start up once downloaded the game loaded straight away i started the game and i was off no issues at all.
