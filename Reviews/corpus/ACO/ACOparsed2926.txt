Couldnt play past first five minutes of game, refunded, have above the minimum requirements and couldnt even play past literally 5 minutes of ingame Ubisoft support was not of help.. would love to play game if they fixed issues with CPUs, will maybe try again sometime when on sale.. in that case if game is playable will change review..
