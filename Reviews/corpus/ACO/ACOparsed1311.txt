Having played Witcher 3 for over 400 hours I was always annoyed I could not go across mountains and such like, I have played ACO for around 150 hours and I am not a third way through exploring, being able to climb nearly anywere and exploring temples cites , I even watch woodworks cut and saw through wood and carry on doing thier things.This is one of the best games I have played because it has every thing I enjoyed in a game .I have never play any other assassins game,  but this.This is only my opinion and no one else, I just wish there was more of this type of game which has such great detail and to me interesting content, its makes me feel as though I am in ancient Egypt, I love it .
