I really wanted to play this game. And every since the assassins creed 2 i have have faithfully invested in this series. I want to say a lot so ill make it simple. just bear with me. So how is it now? I want to say great. But it just looks that way. also, somthings missing. I know if i go back it wont be good for me. so i stay with Origins. Everyday i look to play trying to feel whats missing. Its changed. A lot. I cant argue that its bad. but it doesnt make you feel that important. It just wants to impress you with its design. And that is all i see. I try to pretend to be beyek the protagonist. And i cant. Im just not that assassin i use to be. Im sorry i wish i could say im going to quit on this series but im not. The fact is i love what i miss so much that i will chase it until the end to get it back. No matter how many time i have to play this crucial game. I say no more.
