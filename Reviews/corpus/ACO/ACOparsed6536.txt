Couple of hours in and Im really enjoying it.World is big and diverse, lots of side quests to keep you busy too. The change in how the game plays from other AC games is brilliant. The game is very brutal too.Running at 70fps in 1440p on an i56500, GTX 1080  16GB of RAM  I have not experienced any performance issues so far.Finished the main story line of this game. World is beautiful, character development is brilliant and it brings about a solid story that explains the Origins of the Creed. 100 recommend this game.
