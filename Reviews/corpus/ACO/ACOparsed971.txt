The game itself may be pretty good for UbisoftNiveau. But the way its ported and how it feels when playing is disgusting. One of the games with the worst input lag Ive played until now. I like how Ubisoft tried to make up for old mistakes. But honestly this kills the game for me. I cant play it longer than 30min in a row because I cant aim at all if I wanna do stuff with a bow. And you can tell me now Get a Controller whatsoever. But if I wanted to play games with a controller I would have bought a console. I dont like the feeling when aiming with the controller, I just cant get into it. And aiming with M/K is almost impossible because of the ridiculous input lag the game has.The CPU UsageIs just stupidly high. How can I play The Witcher 3 on highest settings with 60fps constantly, but I cant play this game on MediumHigh settings with 60fps constantly? I can barely hold them over 45.My rig may not be the best, but not that bad to run such a game with such a bad performance.My rigGainward GTX 1060 6GBIntel Core i5 75008GB 2400mHz DDR4 RAMWindows 10 Home
