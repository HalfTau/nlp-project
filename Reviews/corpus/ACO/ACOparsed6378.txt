Having played every Assassins Creed game not the mobile games in the franchise, I wanted to write a review for Origins.My RigProcessor i54670k CPU  3.40GHzRAM 16 GBOS Windows 10 64bitGPU NVIDIA Gigabite GeForce GTX 1070 G1 Gaming 8GBPerformanceI was worried when I heard that ACO would have the same system specs as Syndicate, as my PC and Syndicate did not have be best relationship.  The game ran fine, but the optimization was poor.  However, I can safely say that the extra year they spent in development did them all kinds of favors.  ACO runs incredibly smooth on my machine with everything tuned up to High.  I dont see a terribly huge difference between High and Very High, so I went with High to add to the Performace over Quality.  I have yet to encounter a single bug, glitch or crash.GameplayWow.  Just, wow.  I think ACO may be the Black Flag Dev Teams way of teabagging the rest of Ubisoft and claiming their supremacy.  Its an incredible game thus far.  Combat is very soulslike with a large array of different weapon types, and therefore ways to approach a challenge.  Ive so far counted four separate bow styles that each bring something different to the table precision, speed, etc.  Everything is very fluid, and feels natural.  Its possible to call your mount while in combat and transition from fighting face to face, to firing arrows while sitting backwards on a galloping horse.StoryStory is harder to write about as Ive only had eight hours of gameplay at the time of writing this, but also because I believe people look for different things, and are drawn to different stories.  That said, Ill let you form your own opinion.TLDRACO may very well be the heir apparent to the title of Best Assassins Creed Game.  I highly recommend it.  Try it for a couple hours, and if you dont like it you can return it.
