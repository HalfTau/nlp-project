this review is not going to touch on my thoughts and experiance with the actual story.i gotta say im have been enjoying this game so freaking much. seeing alot of people calling it a knock off of the witcher. like  that is somehow a bad thing. the world is HUGE. i cant be certain but it seems bigger that the witcher base game. the combat is fun, the leveling system is a much needed add on for the series. no longer can you just OP your way through absolutly everything. you need to plan a route, and really get your sneak on. the AI is much less predictable, and you can easily find your self in an OHquot moment. the parkour is ing wonderful. i had maybe 12 instances of bayek not doing exactly what i wanted him to do. the sceneary is amazing, and you have so much to explore from caves, tunnels, underwater, ect. plus there are so many side quests and various other elements that make this game an absolutly great experiance. this really is how i always wanted an assassins creed to be.my only downsides are naval battles.  they were a big hit in black flag so they reintroduced it. but it feels forced. thank god they are few and far between. loot boxes. sure you can get things with ingame cash from a specific merchant, but im just against them in general. a few other little nit picks i wont bother to mention.this really is a must have for any single player gamer out there. and i say that as someone who has been talkingon assassins creed for the last 5 main titles. it has its flaws, but the joys that await you in egypt will over power the down sides.
