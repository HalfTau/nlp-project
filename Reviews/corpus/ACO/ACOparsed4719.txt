I actually love this game and for me it ran perfectly on day one. But the newest patch that released yesterday has entirely ruined my experience. Constant stuttering now and significant pop in and flickering shadows. None of this existed before this patch. Once this issue is fixed I will update or remove my review. Besides the horrible performance the game is amazing. One of the best open worlds I have ever seen.
