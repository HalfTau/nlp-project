Ive been ejoying this game and playing it at my own pace.  There are times where I would like more side missions but there just isnt much side missions near me.  Although 23 hours into the game, Ive completed over 30 missions already and have reached level 20.As far as DRM/performance goes, I dont notice much stuttering or massive frame drops.  This game is well optimized and a really good port they did.  FOV slider right on game release too so thats a huge plus for a lot of people playing on PC.The biggest problem I have seen is that it really does peg all 8 threads to 100 and then goes down to 60 on 6 threads occasionally.  Im guessing its easy to blame the DRM but it hasnt slowed me down.  I turned down the AA to low so I can have a higher average frame than the 90 I was getting when it was at high but that was the only performance issue I have had.  Of course, I have a higher end CPU so I dont notice it much or if any at all.  I wouldnt be surprised even if the DRM isnt the issue at all either as this game generates so much of the world around you for a more smoother gameplay experience.  Going from the hawkeye view in the sky, going far then going back to Bayek wouldve taken a quick loading screen if it wasnt optimized well enough but it doesnt.  Overall, Im happy with the performance Im getting from this game.Otherwise, the game itself I enjoy it a lot.  Would recommend it to anyone.  You will have to play around with settings a bit for lower end systems.  Either turn AA completely off or put it on low.  I personally havent seen a huge difference between high AA and low AA so I left mine on low to average 120fps instead of 90fps.Current system7700K  5GHz16GB DDR4 32001080 Ticustom loop for both CPU and GPU
