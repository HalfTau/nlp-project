I was a bit worried about the mixed reviews. The cinematics/cutscenes often tear up at times and are not as smooth as I would have liked, but the gameplay made up for it cause it was solid for me. The graphics itself is gorgeous and I havent encounter any bugs/crashes so far.Summary Performance wise its great  everything worked out as it should be. Had no problem with anything else other than the cutscenes. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future! It wouldve been a great launch
