At first I was disappointed since the whole game world felt kinda bleak and bleached. Colors were really mild and NPCs felt shallow and environment was kinda simple and empty. However story started developing and suddenly whole game seemed to take jump forward. So I was happily suprised.SPOILER ALERT! !However I strongly disliked that at the end of the storyline you are forced to play with different charachter than the one you have been honing and developing all the way till end. No weapons you collected and nurtured. no moves and skills you selected through gameplay. Garbage move!This felt very weird and it makes one wonder if UBISOFT was doing this only to get some social points by empowering female character. Also at the end where totally diffenrent character than what you played 90 of the game takes the end credit by actually starting the Assassin Creed brotherhood it feels like the glory was stolen from you i.e. from character that you played all game long.For all those that think after this that my grain was because UBISOFT used female character for endgame I can say that its not the case. I would have happily played female character from the get go if that would have made it possible that I could have ended game with the character I was playing all along.SPOILER ALERT! !I have played all the previous AC games and liked them all. Same goes for ORIGINS.
