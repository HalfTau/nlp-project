i7 5960x 4.5, titan x, 64 gigs ddr4 ram, twin ssds. after a few ini tweaks run the game at a stable 6090 fps avg with lowest spike being in the major city that starts with ax being 4550, overall i gota say this is probly the best ac game of recent times the seiers has had some pretty bad downfalls but this is diff one of the better once.. below is my thoughts and ratingsGFX 8/10 its a great looking game but with no sli support and multi issues i cant give it mutch highergameplay 9/10 its not really a stealth game like the old acs u can kinda forge how u wana play threw the talent trees. the boss fights could be better/harder. also the game is now more of  a ARPGsounds 5/10 u can see some bad lip syncing in this game some sound effects are ?able at best for whats going onquests 6/10 due to its the first ac that focused more on being an rpg i gave it some leway but the format for quests is a bit on the bland side of thingsmap 9/10 its pretty to look at good detail and rather largereplayable 9/10 due the the diff ways u can build ur hero and diffent ways of playing i could see this as being pretty replayablehardness factor 2/10 liek i said before the boss fights are pretty unnoticable at times iv killeda few with thinking they where just a plan mob rofl then it went to  cut seenfun factor 8/10 other then boss fights u can have a lot of fun in this gamefinal thoguhts. this game is a bit taxing on systumes due to how it was ported and barely changed for pc. a few ini tweaks i saw a decrees in cpu useage by a lot went form 90 to under 60 and fps shot up. not sure how long itll take ubi to fix the port related issues but they did say there working on it im sure the ini isnt the only issues as even i should have high fps then what im getting. i hope they add sli support but that may be a long shot at best. while i recommend this game id wait for a few updates for them to fix the game first D
