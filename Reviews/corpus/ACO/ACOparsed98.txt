WOW were do i start.this game for one is probably my favourite or at least second favourite assassins creed game period, its classic AC while reimaganing the core mechanics and system in a much appreciated witcher 3 wild hunt style.the combat is awesome and challenging and very remanisant of for honor.the main protagonist is 3D and actually enjoyable to play as, the story is excellent, the world is excellent, i would seriously recommend getting this if u have a good PC and if its on sale 50 is pretty heafty.however there are some little issues i have its pretty difficult to run on medium PCs the leveling on NPCs is half , easy to kill when the same or 2 levels above you, impossible like physically when 3 levels higher, so your easy kickingor dying. the customization needed more of a unity and brotherhood system other than a lowkey black flag crafting and outfits, it needed the individual customization of your outfit, like your hood, your tunic etc and on top of that a dye system. the armour as it improves looks diffrent, i think it would of been better to find, buy and craft your own armours.still no manual hidden blade usuage, i wanna see that blade! finally and this is more of a wish, the game is so big and awesome, with a for honor combat system, perfect for PVP. no multiplayer or coop. and this game would do verrrry well with a multiplayer.compared to other open worlds aco is a step in the right direction, its more of a zelda breath of the wild that game was veryyyy overrated but still good btw but not quite witcher 3 and miles from skyrim.how ever saying that i would definantly give this game a 9/10 for development of the series giving it a great step in the right dirrection but also rekindling the assassins creed flame flawlessly.and as a game in general an 8/10very ing good!
