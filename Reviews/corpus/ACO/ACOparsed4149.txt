one mission that stands out as frustrating. steal a food cart. fine. night time stealth op steal cart find that said horsecart has no reverse get stuck in shop. 3 times same thing with different brilliant bugs including 100 guards spawning simultaneously., suicidal civs and others. 4th attempt getting frustrateddoing stuff carefully run my card over designated end point and it ends up in the river. as i think damn it apparently doesnt matter mission complete. apparently i hit e in time for the mission to be a succes. all in all this is litterally the onlyfault i found in it. its sort of like a hint of simpler witcher a decent rpg and a really good assassins creed it rpg. buy it if your rig handels it.
