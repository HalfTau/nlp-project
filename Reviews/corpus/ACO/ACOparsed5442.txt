13hrs in and im only just getting started. Ubisoft actually released something good. Not without its quirks but overall a solid contender for GOTYBest in AC yet the scale is massive. Wasnt a fan of the RPG stuff at first but now im warmed to it. Combat isnt superb but its improved a lot.Just not a fan on the paywall tactics. Will finish this and then wait on the DLC to drop in price because no way will i pay for extra levels that should already be in a 60 game.If your a fan of AC this is going to tick all the boxes.If your not this is the game you have been waiting for.Buy it but wait for DLC to drop in a sale. Dont support this ethic.
