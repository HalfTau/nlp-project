After having finished the main storyline, I was left a bit unsatisfied. The story at some points felt like it was missing something. People showing up, who apparently know Bayek, but who I had no idea who they were. And the game also still has the same issues as almost all AC games clipping clothes.That being said, the gameplay is well improved. If you have played Witcher 3, you will recognize quite a few similiarities. However, it did add quite a bit of original AC flavour to it as well, ending in a product that I can heartily recommend. Not least of all because the map is gigantic, with exploration definitely being worth it. The combat system works well and having various legendary weapons, helps you get through any situation.It does have microtransactions, but I played mostly in offline mode the first week, so I was never bothered by it. You get 200 Helix credits for playing the game and 500 for buying the seasons pass. Make of that what you will.All in all, I had a lot of fun with this game and got sucked right into the world of old egypt.
