Ok well at 30 hours and next to no story quests done here is my first edition review.This game blew me away. When i first heard of origins i was crushed. I didnt like the setting or the fact that i thought it was gonna have magic from the reveal trailer with the giant snake.i have found out that that snake isnt magic but i grew exited as the time approached and the information leaking from it made it sound like a truely great game so i preorderd the gold edition and pre loaded it then i palyed it for nearly 3 days doing every side quest i could come upon and so much loot hunting. The game looks great. it runs pretty good at launch it had problems runnign smoothly but that seems to be mostly taken care. Im exited to continue my adventure and for the DLCs to come next year.
