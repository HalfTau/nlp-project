The game is pretty good so far, but Ive had some bad gamebreaking issues like massive stuttering with my Steam Link earlier when playing the game.I really think its Ubisoft using three different DRMs, Uplay, Denuvo, and VMProtect, 2 of which negatively impact CPU usage.Also worth mentioning that during the benchmark when not using the Steam Link, I only got an average of 63FPS with no Vsync and my refresh rate set to 144hz. This game is either being weighed down by the three layers of DRM, or simply unoptimized. I have a GTX 1070, an i57600k, and 16GBs of DDR4 RAM. The optimization is more of a joke than PUBG. At least with that game, I could play at 60FPS.Its also impossible to refund the game now due to trying to get it to work without stuttering or running at 30FPS.Ubisoft, fix yourEDIT I got Assassins Creed Origins refunded. Thanks Steam support!
