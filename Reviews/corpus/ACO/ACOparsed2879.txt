Fantastic game as far as Ive played. Was worth the 2 year wait. I would give this game a higher score, but it has the classic Ubisoft technical traits. Bugs, glitches, frame drops, terrible optimization, etc. My game crashed multiple times, falling through the map, getting stuck in places and needing to restart the game, no clipping through walls. Damn Ubisoft can write a story, create a beautiful setting, and deliver gameplay, but they cant code basic laws of physics. Still worth playing if you dont mind this once in a while.
