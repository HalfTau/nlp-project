Love the game, Story was short but sweet. But I dont like the fact that you pay for a triple A game with a triple A price. Then all of the cool things are locked behind a paywall. Money gain is super slow and theres no base money accumulation like some of the previous games. There are a lot of things to  incentivize you to buy the damn helix packs real money. I dont mind that, but I finally found a damn loot crate in an Ubisoft game with that stupidboy merchant. Although it doesnt use helix credits but uses in game currency, which brings me back to my first complaint with the super slow money gain. It would be easier to buy the helix credits to buy the money packs and be done with it. Now leveling up your cool weapons uses the in game currency but to level up a legendary weapon is pretty pricey. Im going to not recommend this game, as it is starting to show some of that EA greed.
