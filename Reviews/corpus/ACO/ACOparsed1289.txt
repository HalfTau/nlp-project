So Firstly Assassins creed is back and its huge, I now have 28 hours played on this game and i cant get enough even though i havent scratched the surface. The last Assassins game that gripped me like this was brotherhood so its been a while.The game runs really well on my machine4670k/980ti with zero crashes,giltches and/or other wierdwhich is a nice surprise, The graphics are truly spectacular and i keep findind myself in awe of some of the vistas.So far the story is full of intresting npcs and im finding myself itching to learn more about the story which seems deep and meaningfull.In a nut shell if you like Assassins creed and have been put off by the recent games this really is a return to form, The combat has been overhauled and in my opinion for the better, the story is deep and meaninful, the graphics are spectactular, and you can climb pyramids whats not to like?
