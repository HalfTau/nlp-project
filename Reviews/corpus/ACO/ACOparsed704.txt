Despite all the hate for Ubisoft, I feel like they nail this game toperfection and its good that they dont follow the yearlyrelease pattern anymore . Now lets start up with its graphics. Thanks to AnvilNext, Origins looks darn amazeballs. Often do I want to just stop what I am doing to enjoy beautiful scenerie. With their new Photo Mode, i can take pics with ease. As for bugs I havent encountered any up till now, tho there are frame drops when entering cities but then again thats just me being nitpicking and stubborn for not tuning down graphic settings. Gameplaywise, the game has turned over a new leaf. This is the first AC to contain RPG elements, it isnt supergrindy like their other game  Division so dont worry about farming youroff to get what you want. Oh its also has RNGesus, bear that in mind. Last but not least  the story. The story itself is a roller coaster of different emotions.All in all, Id highly recommend playing this
