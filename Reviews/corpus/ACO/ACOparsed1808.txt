Eh... its not necessarily bad, Ill say its the best Assassins Creed so far, but it leaves me with the same problem as all the rest. It gets old fast. Sure this one is open world, but it boils down to the same activities and the grinding for gear upgrades and level requirements forcing side quests to be necessary didnt help.
