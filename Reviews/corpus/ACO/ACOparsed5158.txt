Assassins Creed Origins has become an addiction within the first hour of play. The theme of Egypt is fantastic, and does so many things right. Climbing up Alexandrias lighthouse is something I never thought would be thing Id ever be able to do in a videogame, but here I am today.Storywise, for someone who has not played previous games in the series it easy to follow enough other than the real world experiences. The sidequests so far seem original and fun also.Combat is great also, very cliche to say but compares to games like Dark Souls and The Witcher 3. Crank thatup to hard and have fun is my recommendation.Overall its an outstanding expereince and a shame so many people blindlessly hate. I will say there are issues involving CPU usage and store items, but for a game it is solid, and fun. If a game isnt fun, why bother.
