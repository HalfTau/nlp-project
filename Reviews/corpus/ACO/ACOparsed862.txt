Taking that extra development time compared to previous entries in the series clearly shows. This game is so much bigger and better than Syndicate and Unity but to be fair that one was awful. In fact, this is my second favourite AC game, behind AC2, and followed by Black Flag.I must congratulate the development team at Ubisoft Montreal for creating one of the most detailed and lively open worlds I have ever seen. So many variations of deserts, cities, lakes, hills, mountains, different Greek and Egyptian architectural monuments recreated to perfection, including the iconic Pyramids of Giza and The Great Sphinx. And of course, each region contains many unique side quests and points of interest allowing you to get immersed in this world.One problem is, as someone else said, this game has more protection than the president, in the form of many layers of DRM, which can affect your experience negatively. My CPU is 100 maxed out all the time while playing game, but luckily the frame rate rarely drops below 60fps, although I do get stutters from time to time inside big cities.
