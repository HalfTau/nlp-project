I bought it because I thought I might enjoy it.I started downloading. After about 4 Hours it was ready to play. Then it startet installing something for 5 minutes. Okay no problem any game does that in the beginning I thought. Then it opened UPlay. I need to make an Account. That was a little bit anoying but fine, didnt take long. Then I finally start the actual Game. I play on PC and since I know this game was made for consoles I pluged in my controler. When the UI loaded it was glitched out, constantly switching the cursor between a normal Mouse cursor and a different one I asume it was for the controler. I could not use my mouse or my controler with that glitch. Its starting to get anoying So I unpluged my controler and restarted the game. I was finally able to use the menu. I clicked on New Game I choose Normal as difficulty. It started loading.... loading....loading....And it crashed. Not a good first impression at all I thought. I restarted and tried to load the save again. It did the same. Only this time ti did not actually close the Game. It just showed me a black screenwith exacly 42 fps for some reason and nothing else. I checked the Task Manager to see if it was just loading really slow. It was not. So I killed it. I tried a third time. I sarted a new save filemaybe there was a problem with the first one?. And it did the same. This time I left the black screen on for 15 minutes. Nothing changed and the Task Manager showed me that it was dead.I am using the newest Windows 10 version and a standart PC.I actually wantet to play this game but instead I wasted 30 Minutes of my life4 hours more if you count the download trying to start this game.
