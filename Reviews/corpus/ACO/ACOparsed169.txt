I think Im getting bored of this game which is dissapointing. I honestly believe this was a well needed breath of life into a franchise thats been going stale. Yet its got a couple of issues that honestly ruin it, in my opinion.The first of these issues is how corny the sidequest writing is, everything feels like a perfect world where there is a perfect Bayek shaped hole in a problem, where he can show up to stab someone or steal something and then everything will fall into place and the people he tried to help will be unquestionably better off for it. Its just so corny and perfect and a fake feeling world.The second issue, which reinforces the first, is the levelling system. People and creatures a couple of levels above you are near impossible to defeat. At first I thought this would be a benefit to the game as you arent going to be the baddest baddass all the time. But Im afraid I was wrong. I found a vulture who I could spend all my arrows on to reduce its health to 2/3s. If I stood still for long enough for its simple attacks to hit me, it would takei 90 of my health. It didnt feel very believable. Now the biggest problem with this system is that all the quests have a recommended level its the level that the enemies in that quest will be set to. So far this is all pretty normal, BUT Im afraid that the main story quests are spaced too far apart in level and require significant grinding to level up to meet the recommended level for each consecutive story quest.Every time I want to proceed with the main story I have to stop and go looking for side quests for a few hours. Its immersion breaking, it kills the pace, it drags things out artifically and the side quests just arent strong enough to keep my attention or motivate me to sit through them for the main story. I feel like Im being punished for wanting to play the main story, or like Im being tested.
