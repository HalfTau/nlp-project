In a nutshell... this plays more like an RPG than an AC game. It feels more like Witcher 3 than Assassins Creed. You dont even get the Hidden Blade till about 6 to 10 hours into the story, then you see why all Assassins in the Brotherhood has their ring finger cut off Make no mistake  this is truly an origins game. You get to see how the Assassins learnt their craft... sneaking, Eagle Vision, etc. Yes theyre rudimentary in the game but thats cuz this is the beginning of it all. You dont git gud like Syndicate. Plus, this is 49 BC, technology is at best, Bronze Age level.The only gripe I have is that while I can rebind the keys to anything I want, both keyboard and gamepad, I just cant seem to get it to be the same as previous AC games... so in the end I gave up, reset to defaults and learnt the new layout. Which, frankly speaking, contributes to the feeling of an RPG game instead of an AC game.
