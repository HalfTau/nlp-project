This game is probably the best Assassins Creed to date, and this is coming from someone who likes all of them.The world is massive, immersive and extremely detailed. This game allows you to explore the entirety of Egypt, from the lighthouse of Alexandria to the tombs inside the pyramids of Giza, and much more. I actually learned a lot about Egypt playing this game, and found myself looking up on Wikipedia every second thing I found to learn more about it.The story is also pretty good. Its a bit weak at the start, but it gets better as it goes. Some people say its confusing, but I personally didnt have any trouble following what was going on. You play as Bayek of Siwa, as he seeks revenge on a secret order who secretly controls the Pharaoh Ptolemy. My only complaint about it is that you dont really get to see the actual creation of the Assassins Creed until the very end of the game, and its limited to a cutscene.On the gameplay side, the combat has been considerably improved. Its no longer the press Y when an enemy looks at you funny system that every other game from this franchise has been using. Now its a hitboxbased combat system, in which you have to manually dodge attacks and look for openings to strike your opponents. Also, the baddies dont attack one at a time anymore, which makes the combat more challenging and at the same time encourages stealth. Theres not much to say about stealth, though, as it pretty much is the same it has always been. I wouldve liked some improvement there, but if it aint broke, dont fix it, I guess.All things considered, this is a great game. Absolutely recommended.
