Im a fan of Assassins Creed and was really excited for this game. I installed it and treid playing, but it wouldnt last over a few minutes without crashing. I never got passed the loading screen. I meet all the system requirments and everything, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I tried many different things for several hours but nothing worked. I ended up having to refund the game without even getting to actually play. Assassins Creed Orgins looks like a really fun game. Sadly, I will never know. What a disappointment. I hope no one else has to deal with this problem.
