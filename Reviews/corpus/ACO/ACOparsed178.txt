Okay, everyone, this is a little piece of my mind to whoever wants to buy this game.I love  enjoy Ubisoft games a lot they are amazing ... but I will never buy Ubisoft games on PC ever again ... I will stick with PS4 or Xboxone X with this company ... I have a supercomputer that is worth 10K its should work with anything and it does with every other game I have on PC with no problems at all but I had to stop playing this game because of the big problems with it, its unplayable on PC.This game is amazing when I started it I loved every aspect of it but after a while of going through the extream LAG  the inability to record my gameplay because of the 100 pc usage WoW I had to stop playing it half the way I put 60 hours in it without any satisfaction because of the PC problems again its unplayable on PC.I do recommend the game its a 9/10 but I do NOT recommend it on PC 0/10... AVOID...AVOID...AVOID buying it on PCP.s  if you want to record and play the game with little problems you have to have one computer to run the game and the other to record the game and this is unacceptable to me.Thank you everyone have an amazing day
