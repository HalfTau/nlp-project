I play all the AC games from the first release date and every game have different feeling. Some games can be better from another one but the gameplay of this game is different from the others because of that AC have different place in games. And Origins is very good with graphics, story and gameplay which is producers change it, make it harder. But maybe for the next game crafting system will be different and more options can be added which we can decide it. Still thanks for the perfect game and view of Egypt.
