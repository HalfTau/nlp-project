The combat system feels so much better compared to the previous instalments.Beautiful graphics really immerseses you into this huge open world, no intrusive UIto remind you constantly of a path you should take or somewhere to be exploration comes more naturally.RPG elements feel good, getting better items and level progression is always fun.Definitely a huge improvement from the last few AC games.
