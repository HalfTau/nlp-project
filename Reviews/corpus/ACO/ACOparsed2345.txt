I would love to play this game but the stuttering in game is insane and makes it unplayable, I have tried changing every possible setting but the FPS is still the same, cant get to 60fps even on Low setting.In the report, by Torrentfreak via PCGamer, game cracker Voksi reveals that Origins uses two layers of DRM. We already know the game uses Denuvo, but Voksi says theres another DRM being utilised on top of Denuvo called VMProtect. This makes Denuvo incredibly difficult to bypass, but the trouble is that it comes at a cost of about 3040 of CPU power.SourcePC Specsi5 6600k 4.5ghz16gb Ramgtx 970z170 hd3pEditPS bought this game on sale, but Im afraid I have to refundUpdateBought the Game on Game Awards Sale, All I can say is the game is pretty running great on my system, after the recent patches.
