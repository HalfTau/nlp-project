I really appreciate this beautiful game. I havent played much because ive just bought it 3 but i know the story, im glad to have bought the gold edition and im glad to say that this could be the best Assassins Creed  ever.This is my personal opinion because i LOVE the ancient Egypt and every time i walk in the game i cannot go through without doing a photo. Very good job Ubisoft!
