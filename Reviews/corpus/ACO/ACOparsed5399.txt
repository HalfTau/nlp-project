Okay, i gave this game a chance.  I really did lol.. its a beautiful game, I love the setting but it feels like the division and wild lands mixed with assassins creed. Im running this game on ultra, it only crashed once, and im not really hearing any sound issues most people have had. It has the regular Ubisoft bugs all assassin creeds had but nothing too serious for me.One thing that gets me is that everyone is saying So many side missions oh my god this game is so ing amazing yet 95 of the side missions are going to release Abdi in a cage in some tax collection camp. You talk to the guy who starts the mission, walk about 15 feet and youre already in range to use your bird to instaspot abdi in a cage. You sneak in, and when you get to the cage its one of two things that happen. A, you carry abdi out of the camp and set him down right outside the zone, he gets up and runs away, why carry him out then? OR B, Abdi feels the freedom in the air and b lines it to the nearest exit alerting every single guard in the camp and gets wrecked, so then you spend about 15 min fighting off the camp praying to god the big boss Phalix or however you spell it doesnt show up and one hit ends the mission for you. The last 5 of side missions are alright with fighting Animals ect.Also gotta love oh my god its RPG style open world, nut in my pants lol yes its open world, when i heard there were Romans in this game yes, i nutted and went right to the area where they were as a level 20. I get there and im walking down the road and a dude riding a horse attacks me in one skull bashing swing and kills me, Yes that was awsome but why call it an open world RPG when you cant even explore that part of the world until youre a level 37?Also no hidden blade combat? I was really hoping they would bring it back. This game seems like its just going to get boring real quick.
