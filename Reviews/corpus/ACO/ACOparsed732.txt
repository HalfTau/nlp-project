This game surprisingly quite long. After 68h playing it, I still havent finish it yet. Theres so many mission in this game around 100 maybe and 90 of it was a side mission. The panoramic view is so frickin beautiful and makes you appriciate more the dev that built this game. Some bug here and there like flying horse and stupid AI but those bug are minor. Overall, I enjoy the game, but maybe I didnt finish it.
