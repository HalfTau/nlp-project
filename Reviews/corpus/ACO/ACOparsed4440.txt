This game is fun for sure. I do recommend it if you have a power PC. As it is now, it is very hard to enjoy the game with an average PC build. Game crashed twice in 1 hour at High settings. The game looks too good to play on a lower graphic setting.Edit After more attempts at playing the game on lower graphics, I can say this game is not optimized for PC gaming. Consistant overheating and crashes. Recommend skipping if you have loweraverage end PC specs.
