Wont say anything other than whats already been said.If you want to steal, steal from the best. Take open world from witcher 3, add some tactical fortpost clearing from mgs 5 and combat from dark souls, throw a fairly original setting on top  its AC Origins. Doesnt follow the AC recipie book too close, but it turned out to be a pretty good mix.Probably, the most well done open world by ubisoft. Very immersive, beautiful, varied, always trying to distract you with outposts, hidden treasures, new sidequests, places to explore. Almost all side quests are unique and interesting. Build around teaching you something new about customs, beliefs and lifestyle of 50BCE Egypt. Open world is the core of this game, the best part.Its so vast and thought out that main storyline feels like an afterthought. Its short, rushed, barely introduces any characters before throwing away or killing them. Marketing leaned pretty hard on Cleaopatra and Caesar, how theyre going to play a major role. They dont. Barely show up a couple of times and oh, look, main story is already over. It wasnt bad, just short. The origins part of Origins is worth playing for. Watching how the brotherhood came together, what circumstances and decisions led to it was interesting. Also, Isuancient aliens storyline and modern day storylinewith a first character that has a voice, name and a face since Desmond are back. For those few of us who care  it was good, and a good sign of things to come, hopefully.So I recommend it, its close to being perfect, aside from short main plot and couple of bugs.
