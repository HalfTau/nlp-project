This Game is Fantastic!when i started with the story i thought, oh okay this revenge road agian, cool cool. but a few hours in it became clear it was evolving and turning and is now the best story i have played in a loooooong time.the gameplay is amazing, took a while getting into since its a brand new system for the series but now its secound nature and i find my self lost hours upon end hunting and exploring and truely interested in reading all scrolls and learning about the world. Im 18 hours in at this point and i cannot wait to jump back in, and see just how deep the rabbit hole is!i have explored about 510 of the map and i still find stuff i have passed and missed, the map is EXTREEMELY LARGE! you wont belive how huge is its untill you stand atop the great Lighthouse of Alexandria and so far away it seems impossible to reach can see the Pyramids of Giza and everything inbetween is open to explore.
