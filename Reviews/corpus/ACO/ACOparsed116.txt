If you havent played any of the Assassins Creed games, you must play this one. Ive never seen such a huge map and so many things to do in a single AC game yet. The fighting controls are unique considering the other games where you had to be more defensive and wait for your enemies to attack before you could retaliate. Theres so many cool things to do, explore, look for, discover, fight for, fight with, etc. The upgrade system is genius in my opinion having to actually hunt for your materials and such. Ive put a bunch of hours in the game so far, and Ive yet to completely discover it. You can spend countless hours playing without even realizing it. Sure, some might say it gets repetitive over time, but who doesnt love to be an Assassin?
