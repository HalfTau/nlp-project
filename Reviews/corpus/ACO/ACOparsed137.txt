Soooo Assassins Kangz edition....Well 1 for diversityDoes include black peopleHowever, Julius Caeses is not black, which is wrong because the Romans where ruled by black people. 1000 for historical inaccuracy.Okay, so what are my real thoughts?I would describe it as refeshing but not an assassins creed game, but that isnt a bad thing. This is an open world loot based rpg. Calling it a rpg is a bit of a streach but it is the best thing to call it.How is it not an assassins creed game?First off the combat is completely reworked. Its combay system closely resembles Witcher 3 or Dark Souls, but it isnt as hard as either of those games even if you put the dificulty to the max. The new combat system encourages the player to use ranged weapons and to fight out in the open. Whereas the previous games made combat abit slow to encourage players to stealth the game. This came also has fun and interesting side quest, unlike previous games in the series.ConclusionThis game truly surprising in the best of ways. Its an Ubisoft game with an open world that feels alive. If you go into it expecting assassins creed then you might be dissapointed, but if you go into it wanting a Witcher like experience with some assassins creed elements then you will probably enjoy yourself.7.5/10 GOOD
