Wow, just wow. This game blew me away, and continues to do so. Ive dumped about 50 hours into this at my time of writing, and couldnt be more pleased. This is the best AC game since AC2. Definitely worth the buy  60.That being said here is a list of pros and cons.PROS1. Beautiful grahpics Ive taken many more screenshots in this than I have any other game2.The side quests are just as interesting if not more than the main story, guaranteeing more play time3. Level system is dope4. Sneak system works well5. Smooth gameplay with a variety of setting manipulations6. Hunting system was niceNow for the CONS1. Stroy was fairly short and didnt really elaborate much, and not very good character development.2. The combat could use some tweaking, seemed dulled down from the previous ACs3. The locking on system was atrocious and not even helpful4. More skills shouldve been added some shouldve been carried over from previous ACS5. Not a very memerable soundtrack6. A lot of repeated Hieroglyphics on the walls, wouldve been cool to actually decipher the messages as an easteregg6 and a half Only 40 levels7. Paid DLC8. Paid DLC9. Paid DLC10. Paid DLC11.
