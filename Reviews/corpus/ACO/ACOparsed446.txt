Having mixed feelings about this game. Is the game itself good? YES! What makes it difficult to recommend is the performance. Gtx 1060 with 6gb vram, 16gb of RAM, i5 6th gen and major stuttering and lagging on medium settings. But when its working its beautiful and super fun. When it dips, it really dips and it takes you out of the experience. Love the game, can I recommend it in its current state? No.
