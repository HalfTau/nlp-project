I really love the actual game Assassins Creed Origins..........but I hate that I cant play it without constant framerate stuttering in crowded urban areas due to the multiple layers of DRM Ubisoft has put in this game.  First of all, the game suffers from classic Ubisoft PC port CPUheavy suboptimization... so the game itself is relatively CPU bound.  No bother, that wouldnt be a problem, even with the Denuvo 4.7 DRM which is used to prevent piracy.  Denuvo version 4.7 has still not been cracked and is protecting several other highprofile AAA titles like EAs Star Wars Battlefront 2.  That game is running in Frostbite 3, which is also a relatively CPU heavy engine, and it runs buttery smooth on my rig on ultra 1080p at 60 fps 100 if I uncap.Whats my PC build you ask?i7 6700k skylake OC 4.6 GHz16gb DDR4SSD installMSI 1070 8gb OCSo yeah, whats causing Assassins Creed Origins to still run relatively  in crowded urban areas like the Alexandria, etc?Its the second layer of DRM that Ubigreed has placed into the game on top of Denuvo 4.7...which let me restate is perfect on its own for protecting the game from piracy as it has still not been cracked after months.  This second layer of DRM is called VMprotect.  VMprotect activates every time the player creates any kind of input.  Press a key, move the mouse, move the character, anything generates calls from VMprotect.  This is why high end, overclocked processors are still being pinged at 100 load by this game regardless of the graphics settings causing framerate issues abound.Ubisoft just cant not  a good thing up.  Please, no one remind them that they make Rainbow 6 Siege.  I think they forgot that its their product, otherwise they would have done something to ruin it by now.  Oops...
