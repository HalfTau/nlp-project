I do not post many reviews and i Own A LOT of video games. This in my opinion is the best Assassins creed game of all time and possibly my favorite game of all time. Definatly top 5. I was totally expecting a grind fest but i was pleasanly suprised. I have played 150 hours so far and have finished about 75  of the game and I am still enjoying it. The map is huge and complex with many layers. There is nothing like climbing The Great lighthouse of Alexandria fighting guards on the way up and then diving off. It has blown my mind with beauty and diversity. nothing feels cut and paste and the diverity of areas you travel to is refreshing. The Story is good and the added element of the phylacs hunting you keeps you on edge most of the time. good job ubisoft you got it right this time. My grade 9.5 out of 10
