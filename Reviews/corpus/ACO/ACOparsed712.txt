I held off on ACO because I didnt care for Assassins Creed 3, and Black Flag felt like theyd lost what I like about games like Assassins Creed 2. ACO turned out to be everything I wanted! Its a lot like the Witcher in depth of side quests and in map/character progression, but has the polished stealth that youve missed from the series for so long. Exploring the world feels exciting and immersive, and I found myself wandering around exploring with glee any time I wasnt in a quest.This is the greatest Assassins Creed game I have ever played and scratched both the open world RPG itch AND the stealth itch all in one go.
