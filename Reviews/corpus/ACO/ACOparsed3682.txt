For me this Assasins creed game is equal to Black Flag, which is different from the other games in the series like this one but if you ever wanted a pirate game  that was it.Origins does an amazing job of turning desert landscapes into colourful vistas with amazing areas to explore, interesting quests and characters and a revamped and rewarding new combat sytem  once you have got the hang of it.As for the PC port itself, im running 16bg of RAM, 980TI Strix and an i5 overclocked to 4.2GHZ, playing at 1440p at a steady  4348FPS with an xbox controller is a welcome bestofbothworlds scenario compared to consoles.Fantastic game so far, would definitely recommend.
