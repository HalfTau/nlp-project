100 Absolute dogturd encrusted garbage. Installed the game and it doesnt launch. After having it crash over and over I go to the forums. Followed fix recommendations  Uninstalled, reinstalled on primary drive... STILL CRASHES. I dont understand how it is this difficult for these overbloated wealthyAAA game companies to get their software to work. If you cant handle porting to PC then just leave it on the consoles.
