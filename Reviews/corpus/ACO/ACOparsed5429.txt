I like its overall concept from a ac point of view, gameplay was good with combat streamlined a bit, however walking over stones was less grand with the charater getting stuck in unusual bolders or ledges. didnt like how the jumping action seemed to me a bit unrealistic. models were well made with a view to authenticity. Story seems the strong point in the game, but im concerned there is little replayability. as just one day and im already 5 done. thats not exactly worth 59 dollars base price. i would like to see some better tuning with the graphics as well. I think modern gpus can handle 2k textures.
