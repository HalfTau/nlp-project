A beautiful game with an addicting upgrade system. Origins is easy on PC  I found the bows were OP from the start so I could cruise through most main missions and take out some Phylakes endgame enemies about 20 levels before I should have been able to. I revisit this game when I want casual gameplay in a nice setting.
