I wasnt sure what to expect really when I bought this game.I really love the Witcher 3 and I feel that this game tries to do the Witcher 3thing, but not as good or as well puttoegther. Its also missing the key element which makes the Witcher 3 so engaging...the choices.Nevertheless, its still a lot of run. The animations are just great and I found the overall experience great.But its no Witcher 3.
