To be honest I didnt have that big expectations on this game because of ubisuck... but this time it seems like ubisoft did something for the game.I never liked Assassins Creed like that.It has great graphics and I finally have no feeling of lag at highest possible settings like I had in the over games before.The map is huge and you can spend much time exploring it.You dont need to collect uselessto progress completion percentage of your gamesave.The story is interesting and it even expends to the world outside the animus what we didnt see in the last AC games.Although I often glitch in obstacles when fighting around with my sword or jumping somewhere but thats just ubisuck and soon you get used to it and know how to get out of that sticky situation.All in all I can say this time to ubisoft Thumbs up! Finally you didnt ruin all our expectations!Oh, I forgot, you did because most people thought you would doagain as you mostly do D
