AC AND FAR CRY ARE MY FAV GAMESIf my Intel Core i76800K reach 100 its only tell me one thing, UBISOFT QA team did louzy job again, this product should never been realsed to the market with such a high CPU usage.Update CPU usage dropped by 2040 which is good. I found so many bugs there isnt enough room to describe them all Floating objects in the south desert area are all around seems like this area didnt tested properly, this also happen in some cities.anyway a studio like Ubisoft should deliver perfect Quality Assurance and its not what you get in this game.
