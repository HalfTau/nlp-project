Ive put 50 hours into this game now and can say without a doubt it is my favorite AC title... and to the people talking about  frame rate and lip syncing, dont blame the game for the fact you are probably playing this on console or an outdated PC. I have never had any frame rate issues or issues with character models of any kind. The amount of detail in this game is ridiculous. Now storywise, or in terms of an all around RPG, there are better titles such as The Witcher, sure. For an Assassins Creed game, this is miles above what i would have expected by far and it is certainly a step in the right direction for Ubisoft. I have 100 all of the AC games except for Revelations cause its and am looking forward to 100 percenting this one as well but it will be 200 or 300 hours more until i get there. There is so much content in such a vast and beautiful world. This is definitely a game you should pick up if you are even thinking about it.Show lessREPLY
