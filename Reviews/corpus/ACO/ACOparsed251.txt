Surprised to say that this game really has me hooked. Not only are the graphics great but the mission layout and pacing seems to be perfect for me. The side quests are done so well here. You can tell that just about each one had some love put into it. Even though some are short and forgettable, a few will have you saying, No way this is a side quest! due to the fact that it feels like an amazing setpiece. Overall, if youre on the fence with this game, just buy it. Its pretty damn good!
