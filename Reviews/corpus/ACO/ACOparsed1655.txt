My first impression was great,the game was good in the early stage,the story was interesting. WAS. then the turn came.. I needed to level up via sidequest for the main quest.. But the sides was so  boring and repetative..I put like 20 hours when i realised that.. From that on my motivation flew away to play the game. I rushed through the main story and thats all.I dont like Bayek at all..neither Aya..Worst buy for me in the year.PSThe game still unoptimized afAt max settings i get like 7080 FPS but for no reason sometimes it drop down to like 510..cfg i7 6700k8gb ddr4 ramstrix 1070
