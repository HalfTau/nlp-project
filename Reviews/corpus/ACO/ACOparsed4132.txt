Assassins Creed Origins is a masterpiece, Ubisoft seems to make the franchise breathe fresh air again with the new installment. Ptolemaic Egypt is a beautiful place to be when Roman and Greeks and Egyptian fight for power in a land where sand is a problem for everyone.Let me list the pros and cons now.ProsBeautifulArt Direction is AA lot of Side QuestsLoveable Main ProtagonistGood Voice ActingLots of CustomizationHuge skill treeCombat is challenging but rewardingOrigins of the AssassinsDetails to Environment destructibility fire, melee, animal beserkReal Eagle VisionHuge Open WorldDevs gives monthly updates and new customization  events.ConsTerrible PC port100 CPU UsageStutteringMouth Animation syncDev taking their time releasing Critical PatchesMost of the cons are fixable through setting the game priority to Normal on TaskManager.Other than that, they really made an old franchise feels brand new again with this installment. It feels like an RPG now unlike previous games where you instant kill enemies by countering them, etc.As a Wild Hunt fan, this game surely made me feel like home although theres a lot of differences.This in an update of my previous review which i gave it a thumbs down unrecommended. Its actually a great game with an ambitious developer team behind it. Now if they only release patches ASAP im sure the game will be more enjoyable. At the time im typing this review, there is still no news about the PC 1.05 patch which promises to fix the critical bugs and optimization, while our console buddies already got their patch out few days ago.Current score 9/10
