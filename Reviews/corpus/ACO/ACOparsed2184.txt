Based on having played all AC releases, Origins by comparison, passed the thumbs pass/fail just barely. OK, its beautiful and Senu and the Camera adds are cool. Technically its friccan perfect. The new game play is fun in a rampage kinda way yet numbingly repetitive.Bayak never seems to get anywhere. Arno had his profitable pubs and cool stuff upstairs, Kenway had his Ship, Island, Island home, Daughter and Fleet, Jacob and Evie had their train and brilliant friends, Shay got power and a career motivation. Bayak remains a poor slob through the entire game and even his wife leaves him with scant explanation. Whats the bloody point of all the hacking and slashing if you get nothing to show for it?Whats scary is that it seems that they spent that extra year developing software that places repetitive hacknslash, from simple to epic, all across the beautiful landscape. Its fun in its way but doesnt feel like AC to me. The random groups of hostile animals and bandits seem like they were lifted directly out of Witcher. The new game play feels like it wishes it was as smooth as Wolfenstein.Admittedly, I still love and play Unity and wish theyd just add more DLC to that, and loved Black Flag and Syndicate. However, when playing Origins I cant help thinking, Have the people who made this game ever played AC?Aside Id hoped the AC Egypt would have been set during one of the more interesting early Dynasties or of the New Kingdom period Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, Ramesses II  III, Etc. or even during Alexander. The Cleopatra/Ptolemic period was dull, she picked the wrong Roman boyfriend, Egypt was already in serious decline and needed Rome far more than Rome needed Egypt, there was never a military occupation, and Egypt just gladly became a province and breadbasket of Rome after one battle betwen Roman commanders and not Romans and Egyptians. So the Origins story just seems blah, blah, blah made up to me and I cant get interested in it.
