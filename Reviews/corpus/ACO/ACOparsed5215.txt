While i did enjoy the beginning of this game, once you get to the Alexandria it appears the frames start to tank BAD in some cases dropping down to 25 fps or worse. It seems that its due to the double DRM that Ubisoft is using in this game making it so you need a high end CPU just to play it properly at the time of writing this, i get they want to protect their game but using Denuvo and Vmprotect just kills the performance all around and is really anticonsumer for anyone who paid for the game, all their DRM protections are just meant for antipiracy but in doing so makes their game really  at some parts. Im using a i7 4790k CPU paired with 2 1080ti video cards in SLI and 16gb hyperX ram but needed to turn the SLI off for better performance. While trying to stream this game on youtube using OBS much of the time the captuire software cant even do it properly due to the fact that it runs the CPU at 100 so much of the time, just recording with OBS and not streaming is a bit better but still has its share of problems, due to the high CPU usage there parts of the game that dont capture properly or just straight slow to a crawl while desyncing the audio and video. Being a PC enthusiast experiencing what i have with this game so far and from what ive read from other people online use a CPU with more than 4 cores if you plan to stream or record since youll need the extra CPU power. If you are just playing for fun with nothing else running in the background an i7 or AMD quad core should be ok but you should still be expecting frame drops.Verdict Would i suggest this game in its current state? Yes, only if you HAVE to play it right now, but if you can wait a bit for Ubisoft to get theirtogether it may be for the best. The game itself is good and i have no regrets about buying it but the fact that Ubisoft would do this to paying customers makes me kind of mad. Given the fact that they totally deny that their double DRM is the problem and try and brush it off like its nothing is really scummy and shows they could care less about the ones buying their games.
