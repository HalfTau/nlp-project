Honestly one of the best AC games to date This game is ing beautiful, everything looks amazing, from the dunes, to the water, to the cities Great level of detail of the egyptian architechture, clothing and way of life. Ubisoft did their homework Story is great. Characters are likeable, main character included Fun side quests/tombs/etc. Best climbing system in an AC game so far. Not as much weird stuff happening as before, and you cant climb accidentally anymore. Enemies can  you up on hard difficulty Good looking outfits and gear Eagle Camels Meteor showers Pyramids Your arrows move in your quiver Shotgun bows Combat is hit or miss. Good for the most part, especially when fighting a single enemy. It becomes kind of awkward when fighting more than 2 enemies though, and the lock on system is a bit clunky. Also would have liked more finishing moves.Still more fun and engaging than the combat of the previous ACs Loot is good. I would have loved to have a bit more variety in item tiers though. Legendary weapons should be... legendary. Give them a new moveset or something to make them more worth your effort to find them, not just a stat increase. Game runs fine for the most part, but I did experience some stuttering, especially in big cities and cutscenes. Crashed on me once while trying to open a fanmade screenshot on the map. Other than that performance is great. Enemies are a bit too stupid when you are stealthy. There are no patrols to make you change positions, and enemies dont gather up in groups to make it harder for you to kill them silently.9/10
