Never thought Id say this, but origins is the best assassins creed game,  The thing that beats this game is ac2s soundtrack.  Ubisoft spending two years on this game instead of one truly made it a masterpiece.  Only complaint is the framerate, torches, water, and crouded areas drop from 60 to 50 for me.
