Okay so my last review of this was received as well as a bowl of so let me put it in a different light.This isnt my first AC game, that was AC Unity. I had fun with Unity, even after all the bugs, glitches and whatever. I liked playing it.I did not like playing Origins. For starters, it crashed the first time I tried to play. I didnt even get to pick up the controller. Once I relaunched it, it was fine.  Now once I got into the story, I was a bit confused. Why was I going after this guy? Because hes an . Lots of people are s Ubisoft, what makes him special? ....personal vendetta? Now, it could very well be an attempt to hook the player into the mystery, and Id probably find out if I played more but it just didnt interest me. The voice acting was meh Bayek had the same tone for finding gold as he did talking about the main antagonist Ptolemy.I bought this game on recommendation from my best friend, who is significantly more critical than me. Since he absolutely LOVED it, I thought it must be good. I wanted to enjoy this game. I looked forward to playing from the minute I left for work to the minute I got home. But I was disappointed. I played about an hour before it hit me that I was bored. I had more fun playing that buggy mess that was Unity, than I did playing this game which clearly had love put into it. But someone, somewhere, dropped the ball and it suffered for it. I was excited for this, but like most Ubisoft games, it wasnt what was promised.
