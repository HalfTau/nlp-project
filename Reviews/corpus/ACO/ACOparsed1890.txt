The framerate itself seems fine. However, for whatever reason theres MASSIVE amounts of stuttering. i couldnt look 360 degrees around the starting area without it being a stuttery mess. Ide have to guess this has to do with Ubisofts latest and most intrusive DRM to date.Another good game ruined by Ubisoft.
