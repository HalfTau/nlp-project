The Game is playing Fine for me besides the 40 CPU usage but other then that im not dealing with issues the only thing i can say negetive about this game is the Button layout they should had left the unity or syndicate button layout. Having to make my own and running to different layout issues was overbearing. Besides that the game play resembles Witcher3 this game is good in its own rights but i wish they didnt teak layout.
