Great gameplay, probably the best it has ever been, awesome living world, great side missions with exciting stories.On the other hand, frame drops during cutscenes which is absurd, really fast paced storyline, without spoilers, its just speeding through and ends rather abruptly but still provides a little satisfaction, leaving more for the hopefully inevitable sequel to THIS storyline. This is my favourite AC so far, I would love to point out that the main protagonist is very good like Ezio but is in no way a rip off, in Origins you get to go up close and personal with the main character more than ever.
