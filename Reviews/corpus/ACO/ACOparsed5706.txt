A honest review from a hardcore creed fan 17 hours inThis game is damn near perfect. Forget the hate and play the damn thing, believe me, youll be amazed. 6 hours in I recieved the hidden blade, whereas the average player recieves it two or three hours sooner. Why did it take me so much longer? Because I was so lost in the beautiful world that Origins showcases. Yes, there are flaws with performance, and the optimization 100 needs work  but this game, looked at as a game and not as software, is absolutely phenomenal. If your specs are higher than the recommended specs which are for 30fps then buy it now, if not, wait for a patch or two then buy it once you know your system will be able to hold steady frames.
