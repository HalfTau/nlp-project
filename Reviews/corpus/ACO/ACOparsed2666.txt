It was ok.The  Positives. The fighting system was greatly improved. You cant just counter everything to death anymore. You actually have to spend time sneaking around and strategize how to take everyone out. That is until you unlock the sniper arrow ability. Then you just devolve into a sneaky archer like you did in skyrim. I really liked how you can upgrade your equipment so that you can keep using an old item. The graphics was pretty good. For the first 20 hours or so you would be hooked by the breathtaking sceneries.The negatives. The story was bland. I had trouble seeing Bayeks motivation to hunt down the Templars after the few who directly caused his sons death were dealt with. The rest of them were bad people but they had nothing to do with his sons death. Is Bayek seriously going to kill every single  on earth? Then he would have his work cut out for him. The world is just too big and not interesting enough. By the 30 to 40 hour mark, I was just doing the same type of thing over and over. Grab the 100th treasure here, take out the 40th garrison over there... I was constantly thinking Oh my god, when is the storyline going to be over?I didnt have any CPU issues while playing this game, so I cant complain on that topic.Im going to recommend it just on the fact that the game is not bad. Its not that good either. Just mediocre.7/10. ACTUALLY 6/10 for including microtransactions in a single playing game.
