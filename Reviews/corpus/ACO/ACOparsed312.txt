Sorry for the late review..But Ubisoft is finally on pace with its Assassins Creed Franchise..TBH, both Unity and Syndicate was a huge let down for this franchise, but with Origins, they regained their position..Performance on lower end rigs is a bit bad, but overall optimization is definitely a 1..Well Done Ubisoft..Expectations have been met 3
