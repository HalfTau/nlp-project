done this episode pretty well. It seems like game designers took notes from.Egypt is recreated into great details and world is huge. In comparison to,uses mostly great cities or empty countryside as place of an storyline and scenario switch places quickly so I was not able to get familiar with locals mostly generic scheduled people. Would be nice to have more small villages with a lot of hand designed side quests and people with deeper personalities. Also game play time of main story line could be longers.The new combat system is much better than previous one and on hard difficulty it was challenging. RPG style, skill tree is pretty good I combined my skills mainly to assassination and archery.I get almost 0 bugs. Also, I have a quite powerful machine so I cannot judge problems with performance on recommended macines.As a wholeis a great step in the right direction, and nice fresh start in series.
