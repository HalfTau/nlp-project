Definitely the best Assassins Creed to date. Is it without its shortcomings and bugs? No. But it does a lot of things right and has managed to keep me engaged for 40 hours now. I couldnt finish AC III, or Unity, I thought Syndicate had some cool ideas but ultimately I didnt love it. Origins however is spectacular compared to all previous titles in the franchise. Best way I could describe it is a poor mans Witcher 3  and thats a hell of a compliment.
