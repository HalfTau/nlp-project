Great expirience,I love the history of this era and Alexandria is crown jewel of this masterpiece of art.The gameplay is solid and there is much to do. Game is well worth the price in my opinion.Also I love the fact that you can change the dialogue language in Ubisoft games without chaning audio, great tool for learning languages at the side. Im currently studyiung Spanish and this has been great help expanding my vocabulary.
