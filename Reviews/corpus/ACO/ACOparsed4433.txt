The game crashed once and was hilariously buggy. Characters should not walk in place. Let alone 10 of them. Absurd framerate spikes and drops. Massive blaring noises where sound stutters. My PC does not run into problems running any games. This one is different. It looks beautiful, and is potentially amazing, but the version on launch is bugged to hell.
