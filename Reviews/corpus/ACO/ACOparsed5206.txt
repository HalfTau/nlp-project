Spent my entire time playing stuck on the splash screen that appears when you start the game. Very pretty splash screen though. I have also invested much of my day off scouring forums and ubisoft support for a resolution with none in sight. Only to come back to the store page and see other reviews dumping on the self inflicted performance issues. soooo i think I will request my refund and get something else. To many new games coming out to suffer this tragedy any longer.
