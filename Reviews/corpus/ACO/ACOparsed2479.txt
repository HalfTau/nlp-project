After spending 119 hours in the game and getting all of the achievements...heres my twocents worthIm a huge fan of the Assassins Creed series, and was encouraged to hear that Ubisoft was going to spend extra time on the next game of the series...with the hopes of rebooting the series. While I did like the last game Syndicate...the series was starting to feel a bit long in the tooth. Each game seemed to just be a slight iteration of the previous game.With Origins, the games mechanics and overall feel has been changed...and Im happy to say, for the better!I wont go into all of the details of gameplay, graphics, performance...etc that the other reviews are doing.But, I will say that if you want a fresh Assassins creed with a good story, and fun mechanics  dont hesitate to get this game. It will introduce you to a very large, lush world full of amazing moments. I look forward to seeing what Ubisoft will be doing next with the series.
