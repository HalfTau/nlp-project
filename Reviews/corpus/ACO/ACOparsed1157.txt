3 thoughts on Assassins Creed Origins.1 AC Origins is a reimagining of the AC formula to modern standards of Open World RPGs. They finally scrapped their old formula and spent a year off to finally polish the game. While the DRM issues are still apparent, it does not hinder the experience. I am playing on a GTX 1060 laptop and I have enjoyed the game.2 The Story is uninspring. Do not expect an original story but youll still play it regardless of the story as the gameplay is much much better than the previous games. Who followed the AC stories? None. It does not matter as the gameplay is great.3 I recommend this game if you have enjoyed TW3, HZD, BoTW and any other Open World Games. You can see it borrowed heavily from TW3 but it adds its AC flavor making it a good game.Overall 8/10
