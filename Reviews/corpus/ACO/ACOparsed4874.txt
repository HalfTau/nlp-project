Did not enjoy, the starting zone was extremely boring, got a wierd bug where the music turned randomly up to 500 and blotted out all speech even with music disabled.  AI seemed pretty  too, if you dont take the path and someone is following you/you are following someone they can get glitched into things and fall through the world...refunded.
