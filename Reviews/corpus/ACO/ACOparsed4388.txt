I log into my Uplay account, start the game, and my computer crashes first thing. Second try, I could barely manage to stay on the title screen since that took 70 cpu already and when I actually started the game it crashed right away. Third try is the charm I thought, and even then my tiny bit of hope that I didnt waste 60 euros on steam without good reason got crushed. I have all the required system requirements, I even have better hardware than needed, and this game still completely wrecked my cpu. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT IS FIXED!!!!! !
