I found this game actually really well done. This is my first assassins creed game on PC, so, being used to controls from console, I thought the keybinds would be awkward. Additionally, I had heard issues with preformance. I got the game anyways and Im so glad I did. It runs very well Ive got a gaming laptop however and the controls took some getting used to, but it would be absurd to think I wouldnt need to learn them. I highly recommend this game to anyone whos enjoyed the previous games.Rating  85/100
