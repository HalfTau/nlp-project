Note this review is primarily regarding performance.I was very hesitant to buy this game based on the optimization issues that were brought up in a myriad of other reviews. However, I am happy to say that they have either fixed it, or the past reviewers had some serious strangeness going on with their rig.I am currently running very stable on ultra high settings  and my rig isnt beefy or top of the line  in fact aside from the GPU, the whole system is around 5 years old. CPU usage is around 20 stable maxing out at around 4553 during intensive scenes. GPU usage is only half of what my card has even in Alexandria.TLDR you do not need a top of the line system to run this game  do not be afraid if youre not rocking twin Titans or some absurdity.Again, I am running very stable with the followingNvidia 970 GTX STRIX  4gigs VRAMi7 3770k quad 3.4 running at 4.2GHz CPU is about 5 years old now16gigs of RAMNow putting performance aside and getting into the actual game. This game is absolutely beautiful. If you enjoyed the environments and scenary of Blackflag you will love it. Im still scratching the surface of the story, but so far it is quite engaging, and I dont have any strong critiques on that front.The game itself has all the makings of a fairly decent game. It has exploration, a rather extensive skills system, and crafting / upgrades.Note If you crash on start up, check your sound settings. Ubisoft does have some weirdness about their games noping out if you have the sample quality set to above 96000 Hz.
