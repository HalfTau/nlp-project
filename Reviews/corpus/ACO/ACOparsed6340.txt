DONT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE REVIEWSmost of the negative reviews are complaining about having to use uplayduh, and i have not had any crashes or glitches.The game run flawlessly and has better optimization than syndicate. Smooth as butter and amazing graphics. Story is very good so far and you feel immersed in the ancient egypt loreI was a huge prince of persia fan and this game feels like a combination of prince of persia, the witcher and assassins creed.
