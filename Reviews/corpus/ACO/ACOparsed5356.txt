This game looks great but unfortunately I cant recommend it in its current state. I have well above the minimum specs required and cant even get a stable 30fps on the very low setting. Apparently AMD video cards struggle more than NVidia with this game, as well as the high CPU usage due to the antipiracy software.Hoping for a compatibility patch that would increase performance but Im not holding my breath.
