At first I wasnt sure if Id risk that much money on an another AC game, since Ubi decided to use the franchise as a cash cow. However, Im glad I did, as it returned my faith in the series.The gameplay combines Assassins Creed and some elements of Far cry franchise, which blends together quite nicely. No bugs so far, and the only annoyance I can name is the consolitis  everything is bound to just a few buttons.All in all, the game continues to provide hours of enjoyment, whether it is from doing missions, exploring new areas, hunting, diving or just picking a random direction and going forwards until I find something.
