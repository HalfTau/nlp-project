I do not at all doubt that others are having performance issues, however, Im not experiencing them at all. I read that some people with a 1080 and decent CPUs are having dips to 15 FPS but I am running a 1080 and a 7700 and have encountered zero problems. The game is a lot of fun and the free running feels effortless unlike Syndicate and Unity. Combat is refreshing and is reminiscent of The Witcher. World is massive but some quests feel kind of weak. Overall 7/10, pretty good.
