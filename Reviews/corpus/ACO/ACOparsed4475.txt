I love all the AC games but im not a blind fanboy to the stale taste it was leaving with its over used formular and rushed content,I have many reasons to say why all the games are great games but this is not the place,But Origins goes to show how a gap instead of trying to hit a yearly target can work wonders, Lets hope theres no AC next year and they focus on one of the other franchises that they need to bring back to life, Splinter Cell im looking at you.
