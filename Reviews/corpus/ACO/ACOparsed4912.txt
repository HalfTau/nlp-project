Ive been an AC fanboy for the longest time. Each game has improved mon the gameplay, but not all have been a change big enough to truly rework the series. Now, I have to say that his game is a flawed masterpiece. The performance is decent, but the gameplay and the story are where the reals at. The msuic drags you into the world, and Its never gonna let you out. Please buy this game to show Ubisoft that we do, indeed, appreciate change.
