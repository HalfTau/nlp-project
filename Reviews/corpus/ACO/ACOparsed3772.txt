This game was a HUGE Letdown. I expected so much more. I had just finished playing Shadow of Mordor and figured that with 2 years of inovation in the field and so much time after the last game that this game, just released when I bought it, would look better or at least not worse.I wish I didnt need to constantly rotate my camera to lock onto an enemy before I can strike him. I really tried to give it a chance. Unfortunatly, I shouldnt have becuase after 6 hours of play I couldnt stand it any longer and asked for a refund. Denied. I didnt intend to lower the rating of the game, but its mine now forever and I suppose I should let you know that even with a 1070 GTX the game cuts and tares like crazy. The controls and camera were just not intuitive. So sorry ubisoft, I also deleted the Uplay Program that is required to pay to win.
