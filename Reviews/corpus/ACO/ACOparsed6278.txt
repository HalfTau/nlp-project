So i bought this game only recently, And onced i had installed it after the long 2 hour updates i started playing it.My mind was blown. It feels so.... Different compared to other assassins creed games. Its like black flag all over again the excitement.. the fun is back.So what have i seen so far during my 2.3 hours playing...? Well not much i only recently finished the first main mission that leads to the town. Ive been so distracted with all the side missions that well even before i start the second main campaign mission ive already reached level 5.I started to develop my character as well a ranged bow man. That one deals the real damage.. taking out people in one headshot with the predetar bow is well amazing. especially if you hit those really long range headshots yes ive taken the aimbot off and so should you ya loser!!! !But even the mellee combat is way better. sure people say that the lock on system isnt there anymore well.. it is. But you dont need it anymore like in the past games.Now lets continue about the well known ubisoft buggies.Are they there? yep. are they bad? nah. Ive only encountered about 3 sound glitches that lasted not even a second. And further maybe 1 or 2 textures. is this bad? nope not at all. any game has these.Now my pros and consProsSound? is amazingMusic? is perfectSide missions? they are amazingStory missions? probably too i dont know been to bussy with side missions to find out...Bows? perfect gameplay so farMellee attacks and shielding? works perfectly fineGraphics? Look beautifullGameplay? well its amazing i havent felt bored at all yet. you can light your arrows on fire at fires for an added fire effect that burns hostiles for some time DConsafter liberating an hostile camp you know the whole kill soldiers and captain stuff.. you will get no messaging saying its cleared or not.. a bug maybe? i dont know.less funny it needs more horrible bugs..conclusionIts worth a buy from me Yes im a mack fan love his youtube videos and pretty good reviews. If you are just like him and me and are really critic about games movies etc. than you will still love this game!rereviewso ive played it for 10 hours now. I have seen minor bugs that were just plain funny to see. bodys glitching out etcThe whole base non completion was a bug since its popping up every time.new things ive learnedIts way more diffecult than the older ones. I barely got my assassin hidden blades and even those do not kill all targets in one go. granted i do play on hard mode. but it really feels hard. ive died allot. your not really a bullet deflector anymore so to say.all in all i still find this a worth a buy,If someone has further questions they can always write them below in a comment!
