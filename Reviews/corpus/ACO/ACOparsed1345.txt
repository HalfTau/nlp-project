I went into this game with expectations of something akin to Unity, a buggy mess that would yet again disappoint fans of the franchise. I could not have been more wrong, this game is exceptional. As a player of all Assassin Creed games up to this point barring Syndicate I can safely say this is at least top 3, with it being a contender for 1. All the aspects of this game come together to make a unique Assassins Creed experience that feels like im playing a Witcher game. All difficulty levels are applicable for most types of players with NIghtmare being fair, but punishing. If you enjoy the Witcher and/or Assassins Creed I recommend you buy this game.
