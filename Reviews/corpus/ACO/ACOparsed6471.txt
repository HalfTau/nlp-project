Will not launch.Update 10/29/17Fixed my problem, it seems that the game has been requiring me to install it on C drive, and I failed to heed it before.Curious how this would happen.DetailsAfter a number of different attempts to fix this game e.g. running it in compatibility mode one thing came to my mind. I have in total 4 physical HDD/SSD devices installed in my laptop, and they are divided into 3 drives. My C drive is a raid0 of two 250GB SSDs, and the two others are assigned each with one single physical device a 1TB HDD and a 1TB SSD. Before this I have observed that my game process always freezed on the splash screen without any actual error given to me, hinting at a data loading problem. I reinstalled the game on C drive, and the problem was gone.This harddisk thing maybe the cause of the bug I as well as some other people encountered, but I lack the technological methods, nor skills, to investigate further. It is my hope that Ubisoft may address this soon enough.Update 10/29/17You have an eagle.I love birds.I take every previous negative thought back.Thumb up.
