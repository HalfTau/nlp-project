When I open this game it runs fine, the menus all work. As I soon as I start and get past the opening cutscene and get to the actual gameplay part nothing happens. The character just stands there and I cant move him or the camera. I can open the menu but cant actually play. Ive tried both mouse and keyboard and controller, nada. Ive tried everything and I have a top of the line computer that can anything on ultra and yet this game wont play.tldr lesson learned, this is the last ubisoft game I buy
