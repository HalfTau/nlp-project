The Optimization needs works,the story is way better than the last 2my opinion,may not be a cinematic when it comes to the assasinations like the ones in syndicate or unity,but it gives you freedom to perform them and play around,not so linear,the world is open and the open world category actually means it in this game theres a world out there and is open for you to explore from the get go,overall it deveserves the 9/10,I recomend it,51 hours into the game,havent done the side quest to have stuff to do and go around like the assassin of the people just like I did for the witcher 3,I knowIm not your regular reviewer,curator,just a fan of the series that wanted justice and this is well fair and set ups some good trilogy hopefully,one thing the present story is there but they made it not to deep missions wise because ppl out there didnt want to get out of the animus,present story is boring dont complain now,to me the present story gave meaning of why me the player is reliving this memories,anyways,aya and bayek are waiting for you if youre willing to take the leap,you wont feel bad,thanks for reading.
