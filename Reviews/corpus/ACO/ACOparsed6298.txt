Runs like sht on AMD. The usual. 60fps with vega 64? not even in medium. Fck you Ubisoft and nvidia gameworks.the amount of issues this game has is amazing. Freezes and random crashes every 20 minutes. Who the fck tested whether this piece of sht of game run on pc properly?and yes, my hardware is over the specs, ryzen 1800xvega 64 lc, all drivers updated. Ridiculous and next to unplayable.
