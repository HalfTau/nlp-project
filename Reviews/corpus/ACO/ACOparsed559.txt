i bought this game when winter sale. after 100 hours of playtime, finally i can finish this gamethe story is really good, RPG element in this game is good but i hope they can make crafting and enhance system for the weapon  in this game. as always ubisoft always have funny bugs in their games.ill buy this season pass if ubisoft give discount for it
