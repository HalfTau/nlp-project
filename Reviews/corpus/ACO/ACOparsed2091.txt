Played the game for a few hours and realized it makes my pc run like it is about to catch fire. I have a 1080TI, 8gb of ram and an I72600, win 7. Tried everything I can think of and the game turns my pc into an oven. Love the bit Ive played of it but had to request a refund. May purchase down the line if the issue is fixed.
