The game is just beautiful. I love the game play the characters and the story line. The open world is truest huge and it feels alive with all those little side quests and details. The combat is different yet satisfying. It might take some time to get used to but it definitely becomes fun once you mastered it.BUT.... I have to stop the game altogether. Even though It was one of the few games that got me hooked up for hours , I have to stop playing cause its pushing my cpu to 100 and its just too risky. This is probably the last time I have ever purchased any Ubisoft game. I gave a long break to this company and thought I can give them one more chance with this game . Its just disappointing
