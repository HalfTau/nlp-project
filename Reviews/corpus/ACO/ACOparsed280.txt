This game is wonderful. huge world with plenty to do the side stuff is fun and has some great stories. The graphics are breath taking, and it runs very well. i know this isnt the case with some people however i have yet to have an issue. if you liked any of the other games then you will like this one. if you are new to the ip then this is a great one to start out on gameplay wise. story has some parts that may make you scratch your head but nothing a youtube video cant solve.
