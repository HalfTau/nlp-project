Well they were pretty serious when they said they were inspired by the Witcher 3 with this game. Combat has a fresh new reapproach which you will I either hate or love, its definitely better than the beatemup that came from the games like ACIII. Sidequests dont feel repetitive. The world feels surprisingly luscious even for it being a desert. The character actually looks cool without a hood for the first time Hunting feels vastly improved on. The blend of being able to upgrade stuff yet seek new loot is quite nice and on top of that the levels actually mean more than just restrictions to new zones. Achievements are on steam for once too. The game feels like it has legitimate changes throughout from your actions, bodies just dont disappear because you walked around the corner, you can even find npcs around the world from side quests that theyve done and they evolve with the world, talking about what youve done for them and such and even for assassinating a higher figure you now have bounty hunters after you. Still some aspects of the naval combat which feels a little more refined than before. Performance isnt quite the best but I can still manage between 50 and 70 on very high with a 980 Ti on 1080p. I have a 5820k and it hasnt exceeded 60 usage. The combat feels a little wonky at times in such that he doesnt quite want to dodge the way you were intending, darting right into the swing. Stealth feels like it was dumbed down for the worst, no more crowds, and the animations for taking down someone takes forever compared to the older games. Microtransactions, but hey atleast theyre shoved in your face only once this time I guess
