This is more a thank you letter to ubisoft than a review. I played every assassins  creed  games except for rouge. This is hands down the best in the series. Sure , ubisoft used mechanics from other games like shadow of mordor, for honor, and the masterpiece witcher 3, and excellently implanted them in origins. This game, is on the same level of the witcher, beautiful , addictive, meaningful quests, living world. A job well done. Thank you.
