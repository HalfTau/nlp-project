This game was a lot better than I expected it to be, lots of side quest to do, only down side is that youre forced to do some in the beginning, not everyone will like that, but I dont mind.If you do a lot of side quests throughout the game, by the end of the game youll be too high of a level, so everything is kind of easier than it has to be.One thing that gets repetetive is the camps, there are 3 types of camps, level 1, 2 and 3, but whats good here is that they dont look the same, but the concept is the same, loot treasures, kill captains and commanders.I remember one thing I hated about Black Flag is that every area felt the same, everything was really green and just felt the same, so this was something I was worried about as its the same people who made this game. I feel like they nailed it in this game. Each area is differerent, at least I havent seen areas that remind me of somewhere else in the game. Only thing is a few houses in a city which might have the same interior designs, but thats nothing really.Not sure if I missed anything, to sum it up, one of the best Assassins Creed games Ive played in a long time. If youre an Assassins Creed fan and have been dissapointed these last few years, then you wont be by this game.
