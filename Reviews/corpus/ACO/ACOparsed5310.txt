After several updates and various new drivers Nvidia the game is somewhat playable far from perfect but playable. But with the map size and level of detail this game has to offer, I can forgive the occasional stutter.In an 8 hour session the game only crashed once, compared with the 23 per hour I was experiancing previously which is clearly a huge improvement.With the game working in its currently state Id reccomend this game to anyone, wether youre new to the franchise or an old fan it doesnt matter because theyve more or less redesigned the game. Its so much more than the old game with a fresh lick of paint that we became used to.Edit After re writing my review Ive experianced something thats just way over the line. My saved data from the past 2 days had completely disappeared. This is the last time I buy anything Ubisoft related on PC.
