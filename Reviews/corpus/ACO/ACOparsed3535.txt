I played nearly every AC game so far and it is safe to say that AC Origins is a disgrace.The company behind this game is either unable or just simply do not care about the customers because the game is going to get sold anyway!They took 2 years to release a game full with gameplaybugs which exist since day one of the campaign examples character getting stuck in haystacks, houseedges, terrain, etc. various glitches where the character can not be controlled quests dont get finished even if everything was done properly this are only some points which i experienced.The Story was very disappointing and bland, in every stage of the game you could anticipate what is going to happen next. I mean for 2 years of development this is truely a joke.The only positive aspect of the game is the design of the vast and varying landscapes, but there where also some serious mistakes with the enviroment examples huge gaps in the mountainstructure and objects, animals people stuck in the air etc,..furthermore in my opinion the new RPGCombatsystem does not belong into a stealthgame, also the fact that when you are lower in level and you assassinate someone and the NPC stands up after your assassination and fights you feels very bad.In my point of view the decision to implement such feature in this genre is very questionable, but oh well at least they tried..........................................TLDR I dont reccomend buying this game simply because the game is unfinished and lacking in every aspect!
