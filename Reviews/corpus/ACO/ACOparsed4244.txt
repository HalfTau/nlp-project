Im around 50 hours in and have just completed the story. The open world is great, and the game systems are fun albeit a little repetitive. Theyve obviously gone to a lot of effort in voicing and animating all the supporting characters and fleshing out the game world so I cant  fault them for that.I did find the story a bit lacklustre for the inanimus parts and youre looking for a strong modern day experience or a continuation of the ailing story then you wont find it here.Id still recommend playing it, youll definitely get your moneys worth, I just wish the core assassins creed scifi story was more solid.
