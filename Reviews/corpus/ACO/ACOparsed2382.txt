Assassins Creed meets The Witcher 3.If youre a fan of open world game play and not being restricted down one path then youre in the right place.Having played only AC2 / AC3 this is game is a vast improvement to both. Theres loads to do in the game and Im 65 hours in and the story line is complete with just side quests to do.Theres 40 levels in total excluding DLC which can easily be obtained via side quests and main story quests.I bought the Deluxe pack, the cosmetics for the horse and Bayek look good but added mission isnt worth it imo.Pros Graphics at 4k are great Combat is fun Decent storylineCons More variety needed in missions. Additional end game content needed. Different cosmetics for horses / camels / Bayek needed. Not enough to do in tombs, challenges etc.The Witcher 3 is cheaper than this with more to do, so Id wait and buy on a deal if possible.
