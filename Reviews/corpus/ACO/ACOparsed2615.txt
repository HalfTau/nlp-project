bravo ubisoft, i will still never buy another online multiplayer game from you guys, but that being said... so far i have really enjoyed this game. very beautiful and i like how the combat is actually a little more than just combo jumping. really interesting landscapes and a fun time period to take part in. you managed to rescue yourselves and this franchise with this game. feels like a game that is worthy of a AAA price.
