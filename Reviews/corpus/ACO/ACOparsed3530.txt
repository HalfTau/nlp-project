Even after updating my pc hardware im still having issues with this game. Found on internet that maybe the problem is the Windows Storage Spaces pool, which is funny because my entire steam library is installed on it and literally ZERO games have problem with the storage, ONLY ac origins. I found a possible solution online that requires moving the audio files to C and creating a virtual link, but im keeping my review negative because its not acceptable that an AAA game is release with that kind of limitation, not everyone is able to enable developer mode on windows and run command lines to fix a poorly released game
