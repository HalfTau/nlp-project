So... Its very different from prev AC games, there are alot of issues that sort of over shadow the pros of this game and I cant recommend the game if its not on discount but that doesnt mean that it is a bad game. The world is huge and beautiful but when it comes down to mission design, combat and stealth I started to see the problems. Very clunky combat mechanic, almost non existence stealth system and weird spongy enemies with how they oriented enemy levels are just breaking the immersion. My thumbsdown is purely because of the cost of the game and its design flaws, If it was 40 then sure but 60 for this?
