Games good so far, micro transactions are for people who need literally everything obtainable in the game?? You can completely ignore that its single player youre not gonna beat another player because you bought a sword for 2 its ing singleplayer. Yes, its dumb but unless thatactually hinders my progress in some way I could care less.What I really dont get it why the microtransactions werent really talked/ed about by everybody on youtube, reddit, etc.. like with Shadow of War Better game imo
