i have been watching reviews for the last 5 days to decide wether i should or shouldnt buy this game.as a typical Egyptian, i couldnt resist the Ancient Egyptian atmosphere in it and took the shot and bought the game.i will start this review and say that i am a huge fan of witcher 3 and was afraid that ACO can be less interesting than W3, BUT, i am absolutley glad that i was wrong, ACO is simply brilliant ! i am 3 hrs into the game and couldnt stop myself from posting a review to admit how beautiful it is.The graphics and atmosphere is not just amazing, it is CHARMING !!, every corner in the map is really breath taking especially if you ever visited Ancient Egyptian temples in Egypt, living this era letterally brought a tear in my eyes. beautiful. plus, the graphics and the world design is way better than W3.The story, for me at least, is better than the W3 story, i love it and find it more interesting and realistic.i havent done much world exploring but i can clearly say that it will be really interesting, hunting animals on my mount with bow and loot em on the run, chasing enemies transporting elements,  enjoying the temples and monuments, some times i get lost just running around messing in the world rather than doing the actual story .The combat system isnt as smooth as W3, BUT, its not far from there and i still enjoy it and it is challenging.Crafting is a little bit less complicated than W3 crafting system but i dont see this as a problem, personnaly, i prefer the simple crafting system cause i always get lost in the complicated lists.in the end, i do recommend this game, and this is the best AC game in the series, thank you so much Ubisoft for making it in Ancient Egypt, made me love it a million times more.10/10
