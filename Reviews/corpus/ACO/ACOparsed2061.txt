Assassins Creed is the kind of series where you can never tell going in whether or not its going to be good or not, thanks to the overall quality of the franchise constantly vaulting between good and bad almost randomly. Because of this I didnt initially have much hope for Origins, but ended up pleasantly surprised.The Ubisoft formula is still wholly intact if youre here because of your lifelong passion for climbing towers and controlling animal populations to make handbags then youll be right at home. Alternatively, if you like having fun, you can do that too, because this time they decided to add another layer of game onto Assassins Creed by blatantly copying as many things as they could from other, better franchises, by which I mean mostly The Witcher 3 with little bits of MGSV.The overall system of progression, the formatting of the sidequests, and even a lot of the general UI feels like it was copied from Witcher 3s playbook, and while the more RPGlike presentation of the combat might turn some people off namely the people who were hoping to go in and mash the counter button until they can chain execute 20 people in a row while eating your controller I think its overall a pretty welcome improvement. The action combat feels like its at least trying to require some skill and timing now, and the stealth has been improved with some new tools despite some things being a little silly, like the new ability to curve your arrows trajectory.It is slightly dampened by the sheer size of the game and its map, however, and it seems clear that they didnt have enough of an idea to actually justify how big the games world is. While in the games Origins copies the sidequests are practically a reward of their own thanks to the characters and stories, the quality of the ones in Origins are as varied as the overall quality of the series theyre a part of, with some of them being great and some of them barely being worth starting, let alone finishing. Theyre mostly passable, but by about 3/4 into the game I was ready to just start riding from one main objective to the next because you can only save so many wives husbands or children before it starts to sink in that most of those husbands use the same models and most of those children have the same voice actors, and that most of their stories are just excuses to stab some people. Some of the side quests from the previous recent games have been dropped as well, like the murder mysteries, which I thought was disappointing since I actually liked those in the last two.The main questline is generally more interesting than most of the series campaigns, and though it does have some pretty bad padding near the end its not overly offensive, and certainly not as bad as AC2 suddenly grinding to a halt until you collect 30 codex pages. Bayek is a pretty interesting protagonist, and while I didnt really like Aya you thankfully only have to occasionally deal with her and play as her even less. The same applies to the obligatory shoehorned modern day segments, which are barely even in the game at this point, though if youre the one person out there who actually still cares about that then theres various things to read out there too.Overall, this new formula is better in some ways and worse in others, and I think in a setting that could offer more variety in the sidequests it could be great. They definitely seem to have thought that their idea was better than it actually was and overstretched the game because of it, but I think the year gap in between this and the last Assassins Creed paid off in a lot of ways, and Im looking forward to seeing how they can improve on this new style. Its still not as good as any of the games they copied, but its a welcome start towards making the series feel like more than just a colorbynumbers yearly sequel.
