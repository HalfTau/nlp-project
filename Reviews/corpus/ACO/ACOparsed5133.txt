The game itself is enjoyable, side quests are meaningful and rewarding to do and the new combat system is better than in previous assassins creed games. The story had grabbed me and i wanted to see more and know what happens to the characters involved, but with the glowing praise i give the game i cant recommend it because of the poor performance of the game. Random frame rate drops litter the game, and it isnt an issue of turning down the graphics settings, that actually doesnt affect anything, i get the same frame rate on very high and on low settings. There are rumors of being 2 pieces of drm integrated into the game and is causing CPUs to run at 100 and thus cause performance issues and possibly damaging computer systems. So until Ubisoft removes these drm programs i am giving this game a negative review and highly recommend boycotting assassins creed origins even if you are desiring to play it greatly, ubisoft needs to be shown they cant do this, wish i knew about this drm crap before i bought it.
