This is the best Assassins Creed in the series. Yes, better than Black Flag. If you love The Witcher 3, youll love this game. Performance quite good. I use highmedium settings medium for shadows and grass, and it runs on 60 FPS smoothly on i5 6500 and GTX 1060 6GB. FPS only goes down to 4050 FPS when on Alexandria. And yes it looks beautiful.
