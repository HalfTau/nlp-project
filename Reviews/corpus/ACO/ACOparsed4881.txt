Though it seemed to me from video reviews that this would have been a fun game with great visual appeal, the performance and visuals of this game ended up being worse than games 3 or 4 years older than this title. There are completely unexpected fps drops, despite my hardware exceeding recommended specs. This is the first game ever that I have requested a refund for. I really wish that ubisoft would have gotten their act together for once. Only buy this game if you have a beast of a PC.
