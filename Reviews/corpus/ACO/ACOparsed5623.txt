15 hours in, I feel comfortable saying that Origins manages to actually feel unique. So, a few things I like1 I absolutely love having Senu, she is invaluable in planning attacks on forts and outposts, spotting wild animals and tracking soldiers.2 The crafting system/upgrading mechanic is deeply rewarding in allowing me to build a story around my favorite weapons and playstyle.3 While its a little irritating, the skill trees are nice for further enabling specialization.And now, some things that are not on my list of fun and enjoyable things.1 The lockon system and the removal of counters make fighting somewhat maddening, especially with false locks.2 Not being able to assassinate animals. This is less of a problem with predators, but is a real pain in thewith the animals that try to run away.In all, I would definitely recommend getting Assassins Creed Origins. There is a lot to do, and the fun details overweigh the downsides.
