Restored my faith in the AC Series.Whats good about this game?A beautiful story with a beautiful environment. RPG style story, Im glad its inspired probably by the Witcher 3. The side missions are fun and levelling up isnt that bad compared with witcher.You gotta grind to play the story as most require a good high level to play but its definitely fun to do the side missions. Players have to craft gear as well and I love the variety of options we have for combat. Theres spears clubs and crazy stuff enough for everyones favourite preference. Plenty of land to explore, plenty of side missions to do, and its really fun to play!Ive played every AC game and after Black Flag this was the only game that Im enjoying a lot. The story is wonderfully written and the endings gave me goosebumps with the new Ezios Family music.Bayeks story is a quest for revenge and it feels great to meet the iconic historical characters.Sync spots are also not bad, earlier it used to be sync or no vision on map!! Now its much better.Theyve thought about a lot of minor details in the game such as guard rounds and desert illusions.Graphics are absolutely stunning and the draw distance is probably the best Ive ever seen in a game. Im glad Ubi kept their promise and didnt downgrade anything much this time.Whats bad about this game?The denuvo  vmprotect DRMwhich takes some hit on performance and leading to dropped framerates in cities.Kudos Ubisoft you finally made a hell of a game!Overall rating 8/10
