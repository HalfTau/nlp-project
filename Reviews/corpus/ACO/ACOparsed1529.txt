I dont usually write reviews, but since assassins creed was a franchise I really liked, i felt I should do it.The gameplay is good, although really different from the previous ones. Some things could be criticized, since you feel more like a warrior than an assassin in this game. But considering the creed wasnt already created, it is justified.About the optimization, I have nothing to complain. I have a gtx 1060, core i7 6700k and 16gb RAM and it ran fine at 60fps 1080p with everything but antialiasing maxed. I dont know how it is in lower specs though.Why would I give a negative review then? Because of the modern time story. I know there are a lot of people who dont like it, but, for me, the story of assassins creedmodern. Just like the story of the matrix was outside the matrix. And the simply dont advance anything in the game. If ubisoft wants to launch a spinoff, fine, launch a spinoff. But continue the story. FInish it. Calling it a main entry and advancing nothing is looking down at those who have followed it for the story and I cant agree with that.So, there it is. It is a fun game if you want it just for that. But because of what they have been doing with the story, its a negative review for me.
