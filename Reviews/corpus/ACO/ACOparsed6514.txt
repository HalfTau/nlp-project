Ill sum this up by saying its a welcome change to the franchise.Looks amazing, plays great, and plenty to do and see.9/10ConsThe story of the protagonist is a bit bland early in the game. You are the first assassin and somehow in the first 2 minutes of the game you have all his skills through out the game.Would of liked to see how the skills are learnt by questing, each one unlocking a new skill and adding to the overall story of the first assassin.
