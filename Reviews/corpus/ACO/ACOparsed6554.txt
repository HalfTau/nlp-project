First Impression ReviewThis game is so much better than all of the other Assassins Creed games combined, Lets get that established first .I did not had high expectations for This game, since I disliked the other AC games, because of combat, instant failing mission, if you dont play by the book.Much less freedom when it comes to how you wanna do missions.And because, I didnt wanted to see any videos about it, afraid of the potential spoilersBut in this game ACO.Combat is a mix of souls parry, blocking, weighting your options and a bit Shadow of War like, action wise/boss wise.And the awesome skill treeswhere you can get cool new moves, and tailor your Assassin To your liking.It Also has a nice Loot system, with the usual RPG Color Codes i personally love seeing a purple or orange item dropI really really enjoy it, and I love Ancient Egyptian Lore, architecture, weapon  armor styles From That era.So for me its the perfect setting.Havent played for that long, so cant say anything about the story yet.Will update Review when finished with the game9/10  just for all the love they put into this title.This is the fruit of a decades worth of passion, experience, games, trail and Error.And now it stands at the top of the pyramid pardon the pun.The sigle best Assassins Creed game, ever made. Maybe the best game From Ubisoft ever? pSorry for the ramble at the end. WILL UPDATE REVIEW WHEN COMPLETED
