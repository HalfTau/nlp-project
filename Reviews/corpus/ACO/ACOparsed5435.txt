The game is awesome, Im sure everyone is aware with the glitches, bugs, bsod issue including the fudge packed DRM that uses a majority of the cpu utilization. Including the hilarious animal glitches, lol.  Either way, when the bugs and glitches are gone and hopefully solve the DRM issue Ill finish the game in peace.
