Sorry for myenglish afterall XHuge world Has the Roman Empire More stuff to do than in A.C. Shtcade New lore about the Creed Has a loot system You can have strong weapons without having to pay for them with real cash LootBoxes are bought with in game currency, gold you get around the map Grinding is easy and doesnt take a lot of time, dont be a puss Stealth fails hard Combat Minor glitches Changing the target when fighting is not working that well Hello Microtransactions D I dont know if iam being a dck but here it goes a thing that made me a bit mad...  To me it seems like they rushed the main missions, i mean the story goes very weird and faster after some point, like they were out of time to make it more charming and attractive to players, its like youre doing some quests etc and out of nowhere youre going after the main villain lol.
