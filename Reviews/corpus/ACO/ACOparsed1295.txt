I bought this game and I played it for 40 minutes and decided to refund. I cannot recomend this game for the prise that it is selling for. The game has weard mechanics, and the controllers are weard to.I like the overall storyline of the game like ive always done with the assasins creed series but I cant say i liked this one.
