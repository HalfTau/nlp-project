. Ubi worked one more year on Assassins Creed franchise and its worth,Ancient Egypt is just 100 i wanted to see and in this game i saw those 2 years of working of the Ubisoft. Unique game A lot of work from the part of the Ubisoft. Game wasnt made just for money like they did before... Very, very big map On my i5 4460/gtx 950/ 8gb ram/windows 10, i run the game on 1080p 2040fps lowmedium settings and its a little awkward but its playable.1.2. CPU usage 100....If you dont know what game to buy, buy this one
