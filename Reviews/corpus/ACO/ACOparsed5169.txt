3 major points1 Storyline is good and it seems that 2 years of work from Ubisoft paid off2 Combat is poorly optimized, no improvement over the last chapters of this series, even a downgrade in some cases.3 Is a Ubisoft game  Bugs, loud screech happens randomly when some sound are playing or during loading screens, freeze during loading screens, getting stuck in walls, NPC freeze during quest, dropping under the map and the list goes on.I cant recommend this game, for the frustrating gaming experience during fights and the bugs expecially the lound screech you hear at random. On the good side the storyline is good.
