My opinion?Beautiful world ,a good and decent combat system a bit like dark souls mixed with Witcher 3,overall i liked  the amount of details that was applied on this world,A.I mining their own business ,world progressfully running day and night cycle ,a lot of diversities.Even the Animals act aggresively and cunning at time which is really astonishing.Anyway If theres pros there will be cons,the problem is that i have a Gtx 1060 and over 16ram running on this pc but still at some point in some area when i reached, the FPS started to dropped from 60 to 20 which really bugging me at times breaking my immersion to this beautiful world that they had offer,hopefully that they will fix it soon to wipe out this tiny issue.Overall its a good game ,really enjoying the Main quest and side quest as wellsuprisingly the side quest its well written at times and it doesnt feel boring at allInteresting side quest ive taken my time to go exploring the interrogation point area and the places unknown from cities to desert  and to swampy area ,often excited what will i find and puzzle solving a good approach as well!  causing you to explore even further to solved the puzzlesA great achievement i must said if you manage to solved it! Welp i cant really give a final verdict for this game until i finish it ,but if you like Assassin creed franchise and exploring Ancient Egypt era ,grab it while its fresh! if you cant afford it now,just wait till the price to dropped during special occasion,so thats about it ,have a good day and peace out 3
