This game is incredible, there is a big, awesome and beautiful map to explore, that is very distinct in diferent areas. There is a lot of diferent weapons with distinct attacks, where you can choose the one you identify most. Certainly the mechanics from the game arent equal to the others assassins creed games, but that is indeed a good thing. The combact strategy was increased and there was an improvement in the skill tree.You should, totally buy this game! !Side Note The best difficult to play with, is the nightmare, it isnt really that hard, but at the same time, brings a combat more challenging to the game.Why are you still here??? For Gods sake, go buy this now!! !
