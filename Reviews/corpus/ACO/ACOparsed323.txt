I didnt know what to expect coming in to this game, due to the last 3 AC main titles not living up to expectations. The developers at Ubisoft have saved the Assassins Creed franchise with this game and have raised the bar for the series not seen since AC Revelations. Assassins Creed Origins in my opinion is the 2nd best game in the entirety of Ubisofts beloved historical adventure series just behind Assassins Creed II and tied with Brotherhood. This new story takes you to Ancient Egypt in 49 BCE as Bayek of Siwa, the last Medjay protector of Egypt. A harsh background story, and a thirst for revenge leads Bayek and his wife on a quest to take down an ancient order behind the corruption in the Mediterranean. The best storyline after Ezios trilogy. AC Origins has the largest and most live open world in almost any game Ive ever played besides Skyrim. There are numerous side quests, activities, and tombs to complete in the world of Egypt. It will definitely take atleast 100150 hours to complete all locations and quests excluding DLC content. Making this Assassins Creed title into an RPG was a risky but brilliant move by Ubisoft, and it greatly benefitted the quality of this game. The new combat and item crafting systems make the realism of the world stick out, especially as it makes hunting absolutely necessary for upgrading items. The graphics of the game are amazing, and I was able to run it with minimal frame lag using an i5 processor and a GTX 1060.Overall I would highly recommend this game if you are a longtime Assassins Creed fan or new to the series.9.5/10
