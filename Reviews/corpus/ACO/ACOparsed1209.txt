Check the minimum system requirements before buying guys.This game is a serious resource hog. The minimum system requirements asks for afrom Intel but afrom AMD. The rest is pretty standard. But why in the world would you need to use more processing power than video or ram?!? I have no idea. It only requires 6GB of Ram and 3GB of video but asks for a 6 core 3.9GHz processor because its AMD instead of Intel?
