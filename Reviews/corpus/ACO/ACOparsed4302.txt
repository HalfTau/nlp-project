So this is the first time since AC1 that Ive instantly fallen in love with a game in the series. Ive read the negative reviews, and I think most of the problems come from running it with the settings too high for their computer. My specs are i7 4930k 3.4GHz, 16 GB ram, two Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan SLI and Im running the game mostly on the high settings with shadows on low, and its running smoothly. At the lowest I get around 4045 FPS, which is what Id expect at this point.You have to understand that I really disliked most of the series after AC2. Everything was a buggy mess, the handling was terrible, and no matter what I just couldnt bring myself to finish any of them. This one though? Holy mother of god its brilliant. The combat is so much fun and challenging for all the right reasons. The parkour mechanics are smooth and satisfying. Literally the only bug Ive run into so far is the Missing Worker quest marker bug. Im not even all that annoyed by the modern day parts, which used to be a huge turn off for me.I wish they could go back and bring the previous games up to the standards of this one, because the stories have always been fascinating and did not deserve to be the buggy messes they were. Literally my only complaint is the use of Uplay.
