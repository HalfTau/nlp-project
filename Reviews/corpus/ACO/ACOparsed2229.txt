I was extremely hesistant to buy this game. I havent played anything in the series since Black Flag years ago. So far I am pleasantly surprised. It feels like a combination of Red Dead, Far Cry, and what I remember to be familiar about Black Flag. The views looking out over the landscape are amazing and it looks like the map will offer a great variety of terrain. Im looking forward to spending time exploring what this game has to offer. So far it has been worth giving the series another chance.
