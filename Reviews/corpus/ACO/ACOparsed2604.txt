After playing this game for a couple of hours I gotta say the hype was real! Totally worth the wait. I quite disliked the past assassins Creed Unity and Syndicate so assassins creed Origins was a pleasant surprise. It feels like we went back to basics. This one surely is upthere in the ladder with AC2.It is a beautiful world and incredibly big. You can tell they paid attention to every single detail to take you back to the ancient Egypt. There are a varity of weaponry that adapts to every players playstyle. The side missions were pretty fun to play and you can actually get great awards from them.Although, pretty much everything was awesome there are a few thing they could have done better like the hit combo attack. There is not that much variation and the assassination animation is not that great either. They could have definitely worked on that a little harder.Overall, it is a great game that I totally recommend. You will have an awesome experience playing it.On a last note, even though I think Assassins creed is a great concept I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers. Ubisoft should not make another AC. Go out on top!
