Controls are clunky, and its so repetetive. The main quest is uninspiring, and the side quests are nothing more than frustrating fetch quests on repeat. A lot of quests go like this Go to this island and find these three things. By the way, the island only has one of the things you need to collect, and the other two are hundreds of miles away, despite the island being big enough to hold everything you need..Nothing really innovative. The combat has been revamped, it tries to be like Dark Souls or The Witcher but the controls are just too loose and unrefined. Sometimes youll hit a button to do an action, only for the character to either not do it at all, or only do on the third or fourth time youve hit the button. This is especially annoying when youre trying to parry.You also have some invisible stamina bar. You can only block and dodge a certain amount of times, but theres nothing telling you how many you have left, so fights end up being very hit and miss.The lockon is very clunky, often times I found it would lock onto an enemy, and unlock itself without any button prompts. The character you play, Bayek,  will sometimes not even face the enemy, even in lockon mode. This makes it especially frustrating when youre trying to block enemy attacks. You ideally want to backpedal from the enemy, with your shield facing their attacks, but the game makes you turn and run, which cops you a nice stab to the back.The bow and arrow lockon is also frustrating as hell. The aimassist feature when youre playing using a controller makes it so you aim right in the middle of the target. Most likely, youd want to aim at the head, which does significantly higher damage. The frustrating thing here is if you aim up towards the head, the game pulls the aiming reticle back towards the middle, so you have to do a very fiddly and precise time trying to aim at the head. This is difficult enough, but try doing that on oftentimes moving targets, or on horseback. Its less than ideal.
