9/10 Mechanics10/10 Visuals7/10 Main Quest way too small, good thing they have tons of side quests plus some new DLCs coming upOverall I highly recomend this game! Even though you never played an AC game before or havent enjoyed it. This is, like they say, a new beginning. One of the best aspects is that you can simply explore Egypt. Secrets, hidden stuff, the monuments... there are so many stuff out there to explore.On the other hand, lets be honest, it doesnt feel like AC anymore BUT still, very enjoyable. Its new stealthy mechanics and direct combat is very nice and smooth, you can dodge, attack, parry, overcharge attack, charge with your shield, many many stuff. You have sh tons of weapons which is good, you can be agressive, defensive you can even prefer attack speed instead of an overcharge attack. There is just a large variety of weapons.
