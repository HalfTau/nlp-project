I FEEL SO GOOD TO BE PLAYING AN AWESOME AC AGAIN!Ive just played like 30 of the game so Ill update when finishedWell, for the reviewI gotta say I wasnt expecting much for this game... But dayum!Gameplay is all new but its really good and FUN! It still has that Assassins Creed feeling!Parkour for itself is more simple, but ok.And now there is A LOT of new mechanics like swim underwater, special abilities and much more!The leveling system is fun too, wich makes you experience more like a RPG game.Well, graphics are beatiful, locations are stuning, map is HUGE, it brings more that old exploration experience, much more rich then some of the latest games of the franchise...Im really enjoying the story too, but cant say much as im in the beginning...AND THE BEST THING IS THAT THERES NOTHING OF THAT ABSTERGO BS THROWN AT YOUR FACE!its much more discrete...For Assassins Creed fans, PLAY THIS!For the rest, watch some videos and play some previous games
