Took a look at the criticisms of previous games and made an obvious and effective effort to change. Runs well. Looks great. Side stories are varied and interesting. Main character is more mature and you actually care about them. So far from the two regions and 14 hours I have played, I can recommend this game to any assassins creed fan for sure. If you have no previous history with the franchise and you have the money and want to take off on a long story rich adventure? Pick it up and give it a shot.
