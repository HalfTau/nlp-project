This is by far one of the best games i have played in a long time.I have played many of the assassins creed games and this is the first one i have actually managed to finish to the end.It brings back the same great feel of assassins creed, while giving that something new.Graphics are what you would expect a game to be in 2017.. ing amazing.The story kept me playing for days on end. the leveling aspect kept me doing side quests to be able to further myself into the main story. so the game didnt seem to quick.. but still not bothersome.I purchased the special edition where i received the extra itemsa nd skins.These weapons are OP and I used them 80 of the game.The main thing that at first through me off a bit was the lack of stealth requirement.If i wanted to sneak around and assassinate everyone i could.. if i wanted to sit up high and snipe everyone i could..  if i wanted to blaze in riding my horse to glory i could..    so many ways to play and enjoy the game. Everyone will develope their own playstyle.I al lvl 3440 and have 36 hours into the game.I have beaten the main story line, but still lots to do and more people to murder..see you on the other side assassins.
