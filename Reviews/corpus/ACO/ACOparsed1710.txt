Its in the name. Origins. Back to its roots, literally.This game makes all the previous Assassins Creed games look like trash, which they do, and resets the entire series with a snap of its finger.There is no doubt that Assassins Creed Origins is the BEST Assassins Creed game so far and continuing in this direction will definitely bring money into Ubisofts wallet. Its not the most perfect game of 2017, but its a god damn fun one.Kudos to Ashraf Ismail, and I hope he gets to work on all future games in this series so that they will turn out to be equally amazing. If I had to give a score, Id say its a 9/10.TLDR This game is good.
