Im a huge fan of the assassins creed series since the first game. In all honesty ubisoft has been making halfgames since ac unity and havent been handeling the customers well in my opinion. I really dont know what happened with this company but their priority should have been to take the time to put together a stunning game that works correctly day one.  I hope for someone it worked perfectly but for me it didnt do that at all. The story is very sorry for me and the only reason i went against my better judgement and purchased this one was because it about egypt and they would beable to pull from alot of interesting things which i dont believe they did. The story is straight up sad and lack luster. The world may look pretty but i have a 1080ti and im run 40 frames on ultra so to me its nothing to brag about. This will be the last time I purchase anything from this garbage company and I feel like the people who wrote these posts dont play too many games or are paid.
