Stay away from this one if you run an AMD setup. I know any AMD users should already know to stay away from ubisoft games, but this one is really attrocious. Im running an FX8350 with an R9 390 gpu, should be more than enough going by their system requirements and reccomendations, but i cant even get over 25 fps on medium.
