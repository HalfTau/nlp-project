This game is simply excellent. It is a perfect return to form for the Assassins Creed Series. The gameplay is a mixture of The Witcher 3 and previous Assassins Creed games and it works. The game world is absolutely massive with a lot of side quests. There is very little filler missions. Gone are the days of collecting feathers.The game does have its issues. The main gripe I had was that it was running 4 layers of DRM. Uplay, Steam, Denuvo and VMProtect which is really overkill with DRM and all this DRM can be killer on an older PC. I am running an I7 6700 CPU and did not notice 100 CPU usage. Mine ran at around 60 but it will be different from PC to PC.I highly recommend this game to any gamer. It is must play.
