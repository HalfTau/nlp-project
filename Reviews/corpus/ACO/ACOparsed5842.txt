Great game, 8.5/10 if ancient ejypt interests you and you like action combat RPGs you going to like this game.Stunning visuals and reasonbly well written quests lead to an enjoyable playing expericene for me. Im 13 hours in and am taking my time and still have a long way to go before im done.  If you havnt played witcher 3 yet then maybe play that and all the expansions first because this game is very much along the lines of that.It benifits from a powerful PC but i have no problem running it on the aging 3930k oced to 4.5ghz and a titan x maxwell same as 980ti  1440p.Turn off adaptive AA as it adds stutter into the game which is an issue even with a gsync monitor.  Without the adaptive AA the frame pacing is good and very tolerable even when it dips into the 50s so i run on maxed out settings apart from AA on low.
