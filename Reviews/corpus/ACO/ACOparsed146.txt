Visually beautiful and set in a very large explorable setting, AC Origins has been a joy to play. Im probably a bit over halfway through the game and have put in around 35 hours of play. In my book, that makes it worth the AAA sticker price.The RPG elements are a welcome change to the franchise. The missions are story rich and generally make up for the go to x, kill y, and collect z, missions.
