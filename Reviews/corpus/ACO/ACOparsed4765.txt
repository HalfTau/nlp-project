I have played AC since AC1 and  stopped playing it when i was done with black flag. I have to say playing the game for few hr, it exceeded all my expectations in terms of story line, hero, missions no more routine Ac3 missions almost all missions are unique. the map is huge. the crafting system is great and easy to understand, and the graphics is a beauty playing it on med. setting on gtx 960 4gb. 60fps all the things you imagined doing with Al Tahir and Ezio in previous acs can be done and more in origns.you will enjoy the game and you wont regret buying it
