AC origin is one of a kind.Yes, Ubisoft did fked up on the previous AC series but for this one, Im just falling in love with the Egypts.Here are some of the reasons why I love AC origin and willing to spend every pennys on it.1st   Riding horses and Pakouring, they are a lot easier than the previous versions.2nd Combat system are way different,Its like Dark Souls and Witcher 3 combine.U can use some abilities and yet u have  to be careful about how u control ur character.3rd  The Map is HUGE!!!!! IF u think AC unity and Syndicate maps are huge, Origin has a map which is way bigger than those  2 Maps combined4th  Graphic and Gameplay Its eye porn guys .Red Desart and Pyramids under the Dazzling Sun,introducing u with the 2 Civilizations such Rome and Egypt.Amor, weapons and  Mounts are legendaries.Gladiator fights and horsing racing are included.5th Stroy Stories and side quests are 10 out of 8.They are not perfect but yet still great.Im not going to write too much  about stories as its going to be like spoilers.Conclusions, JUST BUY IT!!!! OVERALL RATING 10/10
