Still havent fixed the Logitech Sound issue that makes all cutsceens have no sound, Recanted their HDR support for pc, Are claming that the 100 PC load isnt due to their stacking DRMs even though everyone knows it is exactly the reason. I refunded this game until its optimized and even then... youre better off finding another way to play it if you want to not explode your pc, as at least then youre by passing the 100 drm load.And this is coming from someone who has 873 games in steam. So its not as though Im someone who has a problem spending money on games. But when its clearly an afterthought as it seems most pc ports are nowadays, Then they dont deserve my money.
