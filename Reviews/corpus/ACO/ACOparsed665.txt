I really wanted to like this but after playing Witcher 3, its just not enough to recommend this.Pros.Beautiful world.Plenty of quests and activities.Cons.Terrible performance and optimzation.Quests become a chore very quickly, collect things, kill someone etc.Boring main characters, did not relate or feel for them at all.World feels empty, compared to alot of other open world games.Ive loved most AC games since the 1st game, but this game feels lazy and just copypaste of every other game.Witcher 3 is a great example of imo best rpg ive ever played, a world filled with lots to see and do, every quest feels like an epic part of the adventure.My biggest gripe is the performance of the game engine, i run a i5 3570k4.5, 16 gb ram, 1070ti all runing on an ssd.I can run most games at solid 60 fps with high settings, but ACO just dips for no real reason to 3040 fps from 8090, even in the desert with a few trees around, main city are even worse.If they ever fix the performance, its still just another boring clone of every other open world game.
