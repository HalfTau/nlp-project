Full of potential but did not deliver. Refunded after  2 hours of gameplay.Pros Lots of weapons Game runs smooth, maxed fps on ultra, 1440pCons You can climb almost anything including flat surfaces, not challenging Combat is clunky and weird due to the level system which also effects the health pool, the super ability, tall grass everywhere, etc. etc. Theres no challenge because you dont have to plan your strategy. Graphics are cartoonish. Despite a lot of positive comments about the graphics I actually do not find it to be that good. The level of detail put into the environment / characters is really nice though. The cartoonish style just kind of kills it IMO.
