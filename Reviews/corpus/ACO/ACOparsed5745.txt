I have managed to fix my FPS problemsThe gameplay is entertaining, the exploration is kind of forced as there is a recommended level to do certain quests and tasks, i.e taking on a camp, the main gripe i have with this game besides the micro transactions, but sadly they are becoming the norm in AAA games Im not one for stealth, yet i do find it enticing and fun, i havent had proper fun in an AC game since Black Flag.Microtransactions like this, Shadow of War, Battlefront 2 Ea and Cod are inexcusable and slimy, weve already payed full price in this case, more, in the Uk full price is 40, maybe 45, but that is pushing the boundaries and to have an ingame currency that can go up to a full priced game, is rediculous, do NOT pay any more money into this, even saying this, I know some people still will, fuelling the furnace of bullsht.
