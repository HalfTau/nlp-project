The game looks ok. Using a gtx 1080 ftw and a 7700k at 4.0ghz the game struggles to maintain 60 fps in populated areas, cpu usage for core 1 is 100 all the time, which makes fps go down. I have played 67 mins of the game and if there is no update within a few days for the high cpu usage, then ill be asking for a refund. The game for me is playable but it could be much better with my setup and i dont feel like giving 60 to  a lazy company that doesnt optimize their games or try to fix them. Ubisoft has been a console company for a very long time now.
