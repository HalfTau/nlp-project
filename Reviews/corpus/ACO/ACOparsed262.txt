For all the incredible graphics, this game itself is surprisingly mediochre. The combat is improved for an Assassins Creed game, but its pretty standard for most games out there. The story is also serviceable, but nothing too exciting. The tomb raiding and assassinations are fun for the first few times, but just get repetitive and boring after a while. This is not really a bad game. Its just not a good one either. You might enjoy it, but if youre looking for something fresh and exciting, this is not it, in spite of the promising graphics and setting. Personally, I was disappointed with the game itself and got a refund, but I can see how some people might enjoy this one.
