Ive always have been an Assassins Creed fan, all the way since the first game. The concept of an ancient war between the Templars and the Assassins intrigued me so much that I had to play it for myself, I wasnt disappointed when I did. Since then I have always been an AC fan through and through. However the recent additions to the franchise disappointed me very much, and have almost lost hope in the games entirely.Then came the announcement to Assassins Creed Origins, not only did I have the same feeling of curiousity I had when I heard about the first game, I also had hope that this was a type of salvation for the series as a whole. I wasnt disappointed at all.This game brought back so many memories of me years back when I played the first game, I honestly couldnt have been more happy to see the revival of the series of games that I have held dear for years.Of course there are bugs here and there, but I am very confident that it will be fixed eventually. It honestly hasnt really affected me much at all and I still do have fun! The new controls and concept for the game certainly has reinvigorated my love for the game and my curiousity on how it could lead the series forward.In conclusion, I reccommend this game for the fact that this is a revival of the game series that I, and many many others, have held dear to their hearts for many years, and hoping it will do so for years to come!
