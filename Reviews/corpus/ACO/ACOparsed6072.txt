Im not really sold on this game.The world is amazing, a lot to explore and do. I always want to give it another try just for that.But my biggest problem with is the combat, stealth and leveling mechanic.I have played every AC title that ever got released for PC except for Unity and must say, I miss a lot in this sequel.Stealth is almost nonexistant. Often I was hoping to be able to simply drop down on an enemy or take him into a mount of hay. But no, the leveling mechanic makes it so, that you cant assassinate everyone. This gets especially annoying, when nonlethal kills stand in bottle necks you HAVE to pass trough to get to the objective.Once you are in combat, you cant use your hidden blade anymore. You cant surprise an enemy when some500 meters away spotted you, even though the other one has not seen you yet.You cant drop down on a target when you are infight, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.The leveling seems pointless for the most part, since most of the skills are just loot during a kill, get XP when you smash somebodies skull in with ability X or  Do 2 more damage with meele.Combat is clunky at best, I was often unable to dodge a blow even though I was out of its range. Combat against 2 enemies is a pain in theand dont get me started on elite enemies. Theyre not a though fight, theyre just annoying. They break an attack or defense with a single kick and I have no chance to recover.Maybe Ill drag this one trough, just for the worlds sake, but Im starting to doubt it.
