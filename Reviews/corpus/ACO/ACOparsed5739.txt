is an open world RPG set in ancient Egypt. Like nearly every AAA game,is being sold for 60 euros, but is it worth it? Lets find out.Egypt is an interesting setting for an open world game.Theres lots of stuff to do. Every area has a bunch of side quests, animals to hunt, loot to find, etc. And of course theres the main quest.The story is somewhat interesting.Gear and abilities work well.Mounts are OP. Need to kill a pharaoh? Just run over him with a horse. Who needs assassins?The game sometimes crashes for no reason or gets stuck in loading screens. CPU usage is also off the charts. This is what happens when you pile DRM on top of DRM.Microtransactions in a 60  singleplayer game. Well, at least the games true ending isnt locked behind a paywall. Im looking at you, Warner BrothersThe combat is a bit messy but not too annoying.If you are patient, I suggest you wait until next summer sale when the full edition of the game will probably be on sale. I myself paid the full price of 60 for the nonDLC edition and I think I can safely say that I will get my moneys worth of enjoyment. This is my firstthough so I dont know how good it is when compared to the earlier titles.
