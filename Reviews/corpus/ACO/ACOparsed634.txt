tldr This is GOTY stuff!Most recommended!This is the best AC to date and possibly the best openworld game from Ubisoft.The setting is fantastic, there is a lot of variety in environments and an interesting mix of cultures.The Art Direction is mind blowing, visually this became one of my favorite games of all time. Lush, vibrant colors and environments. The eagle view is pure love!  Also, photo mode.The story is interesting, the protagonist is very likable and cool, and the modern world part of AC is kept hidden, so it does not distract.It plays good.Overhauled combat system  less gamified world made it more immersive. An exploration and adventure, rather than going by a checklist. The attention to detal is really nice. Some of that stuff are gimmicks, but they add to the world. Animal behavior, simulation of some NPCs/locations day/night cycle, patrol routes and so on.The world is big. Not huge as in GRWildlands, but enough to provide dozens of hours of play time. Variety is good enough to not complain about. Only annoyance are horse patrols / caravans  these seem to spawn all the time luckily, they mostly ignore you.Performance / stability is good.Im playing on old PC and it holds up MUCH better than most recent AAA games.Didnt have a single freeze/crash in 36 hours, no major bugs either. Occasionally notice NPCs spawning right behind you or teleporting at ladders, thats it.Seriously, I would recommend this game to everyone, even casual gamers, just for sightseeing alone. This one is a precious gem that will withstand years of time.
