Note this review is purely based on the gameplay, and story. Not the performance, given i have yet to run into any performance issues with my system game runs fine on the highest settings however I am aware there are isses.I am really impreseed with the improvements, and gameplay change up. That ubisoft has pulled off here, its nice to know that they saw the error of the rinse, and repeate series Assassins Creed was becoming.I have found my self enjoying the story, and becoming immersed and engaged with the characters which to be honest i have not been able to do since AC3.Bayek is a wonderful main character that brings alot of personailty to the game and its easy to root for him and become invested in his journey.The new focus on RPG elements such as leveling up a skill tree and building your assassins to tailor to your play style is rewarding and had further dept.Egypt is a great place to place this story, the world can honestly be breath taking at times I really enjoyed walking into my first large city and the pure attention to detail was heart stopping.I have yet to beat the game but overall i would recommend giving this game a go
