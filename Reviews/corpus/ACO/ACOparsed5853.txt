game loads but wont go past title screen, mouse cursur just flashes continuiously but doesnt move and I cannot select anything. I have to control. ALT, Delete to bring task manager up and quite game. Unistalled it twice but still have the same issue!Not impressed!I have an intel I7 processor 16 gig of ram and a Titan GTX graphics card with 64bit system and just waisted 60 quid on a game that doesnt work!Far from impressed!
