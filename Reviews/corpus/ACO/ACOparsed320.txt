Best AC game, period. Story is amazing, gameplay is the best it has ever been. I did not come across one bug in the 80 hours that I have played. I also want to say that the side missions in AC are usually woeful, and I was very hesistant to take on any of the side quests in Origins, but Ubisoft have really outdone themselves here. Side quests were just as interesting, and actually tie in with the main story!10/10
