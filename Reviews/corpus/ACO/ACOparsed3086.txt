This game is just amazing, huge world without any loading, and it looks so amazing feels like you really are in ancient Egypt. It was good that Ubisoft took a year off and it certainly helped. The combat is great  if not sometimes frustrating . Story is okay, the new protagonist  Bayek  is great. Overall guys the game is so much alive than previous AC games. Hope my review helps you  first time reviewing a game
