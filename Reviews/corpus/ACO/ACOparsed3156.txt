Absolutely amazing and gorgeous game! I havent played much of the other Assassins Creed games, but Origins definitely makes me want to play them. My biggest complaint the few AC games I have played is the whole modern world storyline with unskippable cutscenes. Im about 12 hours into Origins and thankfully only had one brief cutscene in the modern world. Frankly I would be just as happy if the entire game took place in Ancient Egypt. Graphics are amazing, story and side quests are interesting and feel like part of the world and not just your typical RPG kill 10 rats or annoying fetch quests. It does not feel grindy at all, there are no loot boxes that Ive seen, and the store items appear to be mostly cosmetic and can be completely ignored for the most part. I read a lot of complaints about performance, but my system is built with VR in mind and performance on Ultra has been smooth, so I have no complaints. Its worth it for the graphics alone!
