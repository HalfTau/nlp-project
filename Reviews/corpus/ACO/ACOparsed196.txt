I have the Gold edition of the game. This was an absolute joy to play, far more so than I was expecting. I have over 100 hours total clocked, and Im still not done with it. The gameplay is fantastic, combat is more involved than previous AC titles, movement is pretty fluid, and clearing the maps is one of the things I look forward to everyday. Bayek and Aya are very compelling charactersamazing voice acting for Bayek specifically. I love the first half of the main story, but I feel like they had a very specific ending in mind which they steered towards, but there wasnt enough appropriate buildup for it midwayonwards, so it felt incredibly off for me, like there wasnt enough supporting moments for the decisions made at the end. On the other hand, theres a refreshing amount of variation to the multitude of sidequests that I really liked.The game also works well with Steam Link and Steam Controller, despite needing two clients to run Steam and Uplay. The only downside Ive encountered is if your Steam Controller somehow loses connectivity no battery, turned off, etc, the game needs to be restarted for it to be recognized again. Apart from that, everything ran smoothly. I bound photo mode to the left grip for easy screenshots.
