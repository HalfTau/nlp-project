An honest suprise to the Assassins creed franchise.Pros  Good game/swordplay Game looks amazing, solid 80fps 24/7 Side quests can be interesting Can pet catsCons  Story does start to get uninteresting after awhile, but it gets better if you manage to slog through it Not alot of things to do after finishing the game, that might be just me
