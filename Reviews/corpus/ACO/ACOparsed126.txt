I have a 4k setup and this game runs like hot garbage. I couldnt figure out why untill i found an article that shows even with. So if i want to get good 60 fps with my build, i have to drop to a lower resolution which gives evrything a jaged edge even with maxed antialliasing. Why make a game like this that cant even hit 60fps on the PC platform? literally all of my game time has been spent in the benchmark tool and now that i know why i havent been able to get good results, because the game cant do it to begin with, i feel cheated. Whats the point in making the game only playable on lower resolutions?
