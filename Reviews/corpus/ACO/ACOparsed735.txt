AC Origins is a surprisingly competent RPG. Its fun, not too grindy, and has tons of really interesting secrets to explore. I played with an original xbox one controller, making the bumperbased combat a pain. I got used to it though. Overall, a gorgeous and fun experience. I did encounter some considerable performance issues in cities, especially Alexandria. Turning down clothes details on NPCs helped somewhat and I literally didnt notice any difference in visuals.
