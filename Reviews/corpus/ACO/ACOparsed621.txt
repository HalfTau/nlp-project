beautiful looking game, i think the combat is fun, lots of intensity in the character you play and so far the story isnt too bad, i havent finshed it yet, this isnt an assassins creed game, it doesnt feel like it, its nothing like the others, instead of shockingly awful combat like every single ac game, this one is fun, its like the witcher 3 but i like ac origins alot better, but this game runs like absolute frame drops all the time, and this game is constantly ing freeze every 2550 seconds for about 59 seconds, it has made the game unplayable for me, until they fix this freezing problem, dont buy the game as its legit unplayable, i ing hate ubisoft so ing much and this problem makes me ing legit angry, farcry 5 better not be inglike farcry 4, ill be so ing angry if it is,  me dead, im loving rainbow 6 siege tho, like alot, its my new csgo/pubg loving playing that and i really enjoy wild lands too, great games, bit off topic there but fix this ing game, as its fun and looks beautiful,  u ubisoft, suck my mums
