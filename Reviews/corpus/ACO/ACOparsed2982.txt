I feel that the new Assassins Creed Game brings a new light to the series with a more RPG style to it. The biggest open world in the series so far and it takes you to back to where the assassins began. The combat has been completely revamped. The graphics are really good. Also who doesnt want to be able to ride a camel or even a Unicorn through Egypt.
