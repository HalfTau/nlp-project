Proscompelling storygreat characters, well designed and with great personalities, almost look sound and feel realIts the goddamned ORIGINS OF THE PHUQEN ASSASSTITIES , THERES NO WAY TO DISLIKE IT...Unless...they dont let you kill or get laid with Cleopatra, which makes me feel like I wasted a on of time, thinking I would just play as the guy who made the Order as we know it... lets you kill Caesar in a Shakespeerian way tho
