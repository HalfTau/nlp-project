So I was worried about the feedback and reviews id heard about AC Origins from those lucky few who got to play it before I did. Ive played all the previous games, have all the merch, statues, weapons etc in my office/youtube recording room so its safe to say im  a fanboy.....that being said  the earlier games had their issues. The number of times id run to a ladder for an escape only to run part way up the wall and back into the clutches of my pursuer. Not this one. The game mechanics have been tweeked very nicely, the story is as good as my fave  Ezzios and the extra tweeks theyve added like the periodic God fight missions make this a well rounded game.As per usual the graphics and the landscape of the era are recreated amazingly and the ability to take pics of some of this and upload it for others to see is a brilliant touch too!Quite possibly the best AC game yet....ill be playing this for a long LONG time to come i feel.
