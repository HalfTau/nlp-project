I have been a AC fan since the first game, but the later games such as Unity and Syndicate i have not completed them. I grew tired of them quickly.But now Assassins Creed is BACK where it belongs.This game is really beautiful first and formost.And as a lover of history i find the periode really interesting.The combat and gameplay is a bit different, more action less stealth but i dont mind.Roaming the desert and exploring the pyramides and tombs is one of my favorite things to do.So if you are a true AC fan you need to play this game
