I have a geforce 1080, 16gb of ram and an i7. I play at 2k. This game stutters, if this doesnt bother you then Im sure the experience is fine. Unfortunately the stuttering didnt start til highly populated areas and I went over two hours so I cannot obtain a refund. It is a beautiful game however its just not optimized well enough.Update Took a lot of messing around but the game is nearly stutter free. This is likely the best AC game yet other than Black Flag. Being able to explore inside pyramid tombs is pretty mind blowing for me. Thanks for the response ubisoft and thanks for the great game other than alexadria killing my computer.
