This game surely brings the name of Assassins Creed back up after some let down. The controls using Xbox controller are a  bit weird compared to previous games  but can get used to in some time.The story is neat, simple but interesting, tonnes of sidequests which seem somewhat repetitive, very interesting secret locations and mysteries.The story is most enjoyable if done continuously because the number of side quests can take your mind off it.The graphics are over the sky on ultra but it eats the CPU like hell.Game is definitely worth the price except Deluxe and enjoyed every moment of it.Looking forward for more AC like this!
