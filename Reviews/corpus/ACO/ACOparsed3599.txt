I have played many of the Assassians titles and Origins is my favorite up to this point. 10 hours in. If you have like the previous titles you will love this one.I have not experienced any of the issues with my CPU. I am running an AMD 6 core 12 thread somewhere in the 3.7Ghz range. I am running graphics at High.I think the biggest thing is to do your research before buying this game. If your computer cannot run it, then dont waste your money hoping you can only to find out you cannot and then complain about it. been there done that. Arguments aside that Ubisoft is dumb for using their taxing piracy software and their monetizing gameplay, just know what you are getting into before you buy. a suggestion for Ubisoft. You could help with this issue by either patching for those of us who shell out the cash for this game, or offer a benchmark program to test before you buy.
