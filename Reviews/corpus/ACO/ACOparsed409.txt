Never really liked any of the other AC games but this one, being open world and all, hit the spot for me. Also like how they simplified the gearing and crafting where you dont need hundreds of different materials and how they are fairly easy to obtain. Good performance over all, dont think Ive encountered any bugs yet, and the game looks beautiful. So far I dont mind theres no multiplayer, you can play it at your own pace and by the looks of it theres so much to do that itll last for atleast 50 hours.
