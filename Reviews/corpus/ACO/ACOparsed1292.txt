 I had fun! graphics and effects are wonderful! huge areas to explore... ... and still lots of hours left for me to explore quests are different compared to the old games and dont feel slow, because... ... questNPCs are moving fast! the different type of bows the levelsystem I know its necessary so you dont go ahead and kill everything, just do the main story and dont see anything of the world, but you cant kill/oneshot sleeping enemies with your hidden blade if theyre red or above. Youre a really great assassin / midgame 2230 leveling / sidequests wa slow. 120 was fast and 30 has plenty of quests as well youre a personal taxi and have to carry lots of NPCs out of enemy baseso climbing is still a hitormiss and walking felt quite slowo upgrading your equipment gets boring in the endgameo most assassinationquests are like prequests  boss is in a base  skip to night  kill stuff and then kill him.o the three missions on a boat felt unnecessaryo the main character was ok. its all about revengeo bosses hit quite hard but were easy with light/warrior bowso loading hints were quite funny / interestingif you like AC, get it! even if youve skipped some of the latest games because heck its always the same  this one was definetly better!
