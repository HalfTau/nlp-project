I just bought the game yesterday and was really excited to have some experience of this merge open world map of ancient Egypt but after I installed the gane when I tryna open it its just crashed for no reason really disappointed about that I cant even take a look of the game and not only me theres too many peoples in the community having same issues and I just refund it today and got my money back but really wish that steam might take some step on this crash/bugs and fix it so everyone can play it
