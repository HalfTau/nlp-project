Assasins Creed as always been my favorite video game series and they were starting to lose there touch i actually loved unity though. I was extremely sceptical at first, taking the year break was definitely needed and this game made it all worth it. Learning about the origins of the creed and how it all began and doing it well makes this game one of my favorite assasins creed game of all time.
