Since Assassins creed bortherhood I was waiting for a good assassins creed, and it is finally there. The world is beautiful, the characters are well written and the fighting system is better than the previous one. If you dont pay attention to the story that is basically the same revenge story that weve seen in every assassins creed and that could have been written by a 12 year old, this is finally a very good assassins creed.
