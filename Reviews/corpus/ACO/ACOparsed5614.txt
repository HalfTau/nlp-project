So far this game has felt very refreshing compared to Unity and Syndicate. The franchise thrives off ancient history, and its good to see it go as far back as it has. I have played all of this franchise excluding Liberation, and I can recommend this one on the level of the first 3. With a gun to my head you couldnt make me complete Unity or Syndicate. You wont have to ask me twice to see this one through to the end.
