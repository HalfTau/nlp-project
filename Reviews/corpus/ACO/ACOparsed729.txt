Where do I begin. The game uses a new mechanics system and already this makes the game so much better, my favourite part is the auto sprint and crouch features which make the game a lot simpiler in a way. Plus they have a new addition of the bows. There has always been a pistol or something along those lines at hand, but the bow is a real necesity where as the pistol was just something you used to get some quicker kills. Another excellent aspect is the campaign. The campagin draws you in as the Assassins Creed series usually does, but the campagin in this game doesnt dissapoint with the awesome story and the enjoyable memories. Another execellent feature is the Mount feature. The mount feature allows you to call a ride from anywhere anytime, you can choose between the horse the faster option or the camel the stronger option to take you and help you around the whole map and through your epic adventure. My next favourite feature is the Senu feature. Senu is a bird that you can call in to be your eyes in the sky. Senu will help you find the objective, collectibles, resources/animals and even loot chests. Plus as you progress Senu can even harass and distract the enemies for you so you can get a cheeky assasination or get one step closer to your objective. My final favourite feature has to be the graphics. This game defiantly has hit the bullseye with the graphics capabilities. I run the game with a GTX 1080 and a 4K monitor and I have never seen an assassins creed game look or feel better. With vibrant colours and awesome blood affects might I add, this is a beautiful game. I get a stable 60200 fps on highest graphics settings and 4K. Overall this game is a perfect addition to the series.GraphicsMechanicsCapabilitiesFeaturesCombatStealthCampaignTransportBoatsPeople can swim finally!Map SizeEnemies do not hear you when you are running behind them
