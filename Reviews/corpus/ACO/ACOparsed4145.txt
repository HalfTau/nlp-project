Specs GTX 1070 Founders Edition, I7 7700K, 32gb 3200 DDR4 RamGraphics Visually this game is stunning to me but may not be for others. There is so much detail that has been put into this world that its easy to get imersed in the game itself. There are some glitches that can break that imersion but I have come across none that are game breaking in my play through so far.Gameplay Outside of the new combat system most will fill right at home when it comes to the formula of the game and its controls. The major change they made this time around is the combat system. Gone are the days of guards sitting back and you pick them off one at a time. There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to this new system but once you have it down you are set. The side quest have also seen a bit of an overhaul and this game is full of them. No longer are they boring chores to work through rather some have interesting stories of their own. These storeis themselves add to the imersion of the world as well further ingrossing you in it.Concerns Other users have been pointing out performance issues and I have seem to be lucky in that I have not had many. My specs are listed above so you can compare parts to performance. This is not to say that I am running around at a consistant 140 FPS but I am not dipping below 80 so I will take it.  With more action on the screen comes slight drops but nothing that ruins the game.Conclusion Based on what I have played so far I can reccomend this game to not only my friends but anyone else. If you are looking for a world to get lost in then this will be the game for you. Be sure though that you have the time to sink into it as doing everything that there is to do requires a lot of time from what I have seen so far.
