I really miss the original game, it was all about killing. I dont wanna go hunting or having ship battles and what not, I dont wanna find medicine for random people that I dont care about. There is MMOS for all that kind of stuff, I want to lurk in the shadows and find a way to kill a high value target. I want that cool sword fight style that the first one had. I had high hopes but I guess this game is not for me.
