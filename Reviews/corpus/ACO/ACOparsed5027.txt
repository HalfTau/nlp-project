Well gameplay is good, combat fun, subpar story but when is it ever good, main char is ok, but after all the time I put into it suddenly just framdrops, npcs dont load, invsisible buildings, missions missing objectives, game freezes when starting missions. Unplayable right now.Edit, Original review was negative Actually getting fast support to fix the problems Ive had was welcome. Game still was disappointing in terms of story but I finished it thats gotta be worth something. cough ac3
