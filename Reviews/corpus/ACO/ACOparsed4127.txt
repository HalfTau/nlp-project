Looks fantastic, gameplay is fast and responsive, combat is heaps better than Unity ever was. Bayek seems like a good character, and the Ancient Egyptsetting is AMAZING, and the map is huge with ALOT to see and do! Well worth a try if youre a fan of the series.Also, I finally found out who desecrated the ancient pharaos tombs Bayek!
