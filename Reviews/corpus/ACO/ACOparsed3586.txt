If you like the AC franchise and had a good time with Witcher 3 then this is the game for you. ACO combines a lot  yet not all  of the good things from previous chapters and many good elements from the Witcher. Graphics are stunning yet a bit too sandy... I understand that this chapter is in Egypt but the fact remains that the realistic location characteristics are limiting the versatility of the game. The mechanics are quite good yet not very sofisticated. Remember that as your character develops you will be able to get a lot more abilities that will make fights more interesting  like slow motion bow shooting while jumping of a building. The trading, inventory, upgrade system is rather . Every upgrade will set you back an x amount of coins either it is for 1 or 40 lvls upgrade. Makes upgrading almost impossible for every level. Cap is 40. After 40 you only get to earn abilities per level but no more levels. The sea fights  like in black flag  are only story related and you basically cant jump on a ship and start chasing romans. All in all a very well developed game, not as well as Witcher was. Lets hope that the DLC will expand the world in Rome or in Greece so we can see something else than sand in the background.  The main story while very interesting is too short. The good thing is that you will not be able to finish it before reaching 35 but that doesnt  make it long. They just have scaled it like that. The side quests are all unrelatable and they are all about the peoples struggle... a little originality wouldnt hurt. All in all 8/10. Graphics 9/10. Gameplay 7/10. Main story 8/10. Side stories 7/10. PC optimization 7/10 High end CPUs are burning at 100 for unknown reasons yet..... Do not expect to get anything over smooth 80fps on ultra. The game is not optimized for more than this.
