Undoubtedly the best game i have ever played in years.Ubisoft made a good game out of it this time, its kinda different than AC4 and other AC games i played but it worked well.I just love everything about it tbh, the visuals are spectacular, the side quests are fun too, and so on,blah blah..  give it a go and you wont regret it.
