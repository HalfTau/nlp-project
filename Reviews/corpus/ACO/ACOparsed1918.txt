I love exploring ancient Egypt and boy is it beautiful.Im having a blast exploring this game even after 60 hours.I havent even reached max level yet, I just keep doing side mission after side mission.Besides that, I stopped doing missions and just started traveling to uncover new territory.Its fun, its action packed.
