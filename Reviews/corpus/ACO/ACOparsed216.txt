Well...I am going to be honest in my opinion about this game....POSITIVE POINTSMassive open worldAmazing weapons and skillsGraphics are the same as the previous titles...Sliding down the pyramids is amazing...Storyline is short but amazingMD is goodEnemies are cleverNEGATIVEThe world is way too big with activities being one far from the other...Same sidequests over and overGame becomes boring at some point...Unoptimized as heck...Microtransactions aint worth it...Season pass works like..AC THE HIDDEN ONES DOWNLOAD CRASHESControls are a little dumb...This game is giving us everything on hand...which I find boring...Way too much WITCHER 3.....Combat system is boring....There are only 3 different moves for each type of weapon...And the Rage just makes those moves go faster....I give it a 8.5/10.
