I havent really played any assassins games in a while. i thought they were geting cheezy and the story was kind of getting to wierd for me, so jumping back into the series with this entry I did not know what to expect. i had heard good things about it so i tried it out and i was quite impressed with the game. lots to explore, side missions, and interesting main characters to keep your attention. a couple of problems with the story and general mechanics but nothing that really disrupts from the enjoyment of the game.  i think it is a good return to form for ubisoft and hope future titles get the same level of attention instead of being quickly developed and released so there out by the holidays
