Id say this game is really good, it was the refresher to the series it needed to be, and its really wellformed. Its a fullon RPG, which scared some people, cause they didnt want to lose any assassins creedness, and I dont think it did. Gameplaywise its a lot of fun, some of the best in the series, and combat is a blast. Its got a fair share of bugs, most of which are hilarious, and the optimization is a little shakey I think, I have to play it at a lower settings than I should, but that should be fixed soon. I definitely recommend this game.
