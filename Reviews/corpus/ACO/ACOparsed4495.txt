This game has similarities to how The Witcher 3 plays. Im really loving this game right now and will probably be the first Assassins Creed game Ill finish. Out of all the AC games Ive played this went to the top after a couple hours in  surpassing Syndicate and Black Flag.As with most Ubisoft games, weeks after release its still full of bugs so take the review with a grain of salt.Now off to the desert my friend!
