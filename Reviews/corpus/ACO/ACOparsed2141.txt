ReviewBased on my own Opinion .So its time to write a Review aswell. I played Assassins Creed Origins for arround 60 hours so far !A time wich is important to give a full review ,If you dont understand anything its maybe about my bad English. Lets get started .1.Positive1.1 The central storyline is for me one of the best in the entire Series .Closely Followed by Brotherhood and 2.A good mixture of different tasks. Some quiet  and some with Action.The Story gives you a good imagination about a life as an Medjay1.2 The Sidequests are not bad but there are some  are quite the same and boring. But There are so manySidequests.I am sure there will be the right for you .The EP in the sidequest are huge in my Opinion but its takes a bit time to reach higher Levels.1.2 The Drops you will find in cases are different from rare to common.Some weapons are locked until you reach theLevel. A good feature .Its a good motivation to keep playing and doing Sidequests.1.3 The World in Assassins Creed is insane. With many big citys and big deserts. So far there was never an big regionwithout something to look for. I played the game on medium Settings and still there it blows my  mind .1.4 The Combat System is one of the biggest differences to the other ACs . It takes a bit to handle it but it makes a battle more intense and difficult as before.Negative.1.1 Senu is not a complete failure . Imean its awesome to fly with him . But sometimes he cant find the easiest things.Later with upgrades its getting better.1.2 I personally miss it to use the Hidden Blade in Normal Fights not only as stealth Weapon.Assassins Creed Origins 9/10Koda
