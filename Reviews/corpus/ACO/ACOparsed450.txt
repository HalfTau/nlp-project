Game ReviewStory was pretty good. Bit slow in the middle but the end resolves everything well and has some nice touches. The music is amazing. Best in the series IMO. Some people seem to not like the new combat mechanics but I havent played an AC game since Black Flag and this felt new but still familiar enough. The world is huge and there is plenty to do. However it can get a bit repetive. Overall a solid AC game and Im looking forward to what the next one in 2020 brings to the table.Technical ReviewI actually upgraded my PC for this game. I waited a month for patches to help with optimization but it didnt come until a few weeks ago. I feel like the DRM software running cause some of the problem. But the game as an open world is impressive, so it could just be the engine is really CPU hungry.If you want 60fps and dont have a 7th8th gen I7 with HT I would hold off on getting this game. I am curious to see how things improve if the DRM is ever removed.
