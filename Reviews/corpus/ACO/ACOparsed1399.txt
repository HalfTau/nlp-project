Combat SUCKS. Im all for improvements but this no longer feels like AC at all. Its like playing a typical hack n slash. They took the Assassins Creed out of Assassins Creed Origins. Combat feels frustrating, clunky and repetitive. The player no longer feels like a professional killer with smooth tranitions and parry moves, instead it feels like you are playing Murrowind or something. TRASH. Refund requested,
