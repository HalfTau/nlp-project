The small things make the veteran player of AC realize that Ubisoft is trying to change AC into something new and they are doing great at that front. It is fun and refreshing new experience. Few things need to be optimized but overall they done the job splendidly. At least to me. Though the grinding for experiences and some of the craft material, not really quite fond of it but it is quite okay overall.
