A breath of fresh air is where i would start withg AC origins, taking a year out seems to has seemed to give the francise a breath of fresh air, really good story and a gorgeous setting, however a open world that I found a little to big at times,  apart from that the main protaganist is really interesting and enjoyed playing his story.
