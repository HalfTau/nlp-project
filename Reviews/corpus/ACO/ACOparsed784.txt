Nothing much to say except this was magnificent. AC wasnt always my favourite game series, Ive only ever finished Black Flag and Rogue, but this one grabbed me right from the beginning and gripped me right til the end. I put an insane amount of time into this game, into getting 100 completion those final two achievements will forever bug me though and it was a hell of an experience.Jawdroppingly gorgeous, fantastic VA, engrossing story, fabulous combat system, and an enormous world to explore and discover.This was fantastic and if it truly had any downsides it would be the shocking sysabuse it had. CPU usage was off the charts, for no good reason, and had near constant stutter/hitching during cutscenes, as well as frequent performance drops in towns. Thats a shame, and even though I was eventually able to eke out a fairly constant 60fps town traversal notwithstanding with the terrible framepacing and the frequent drops to 40s and 50s on my 4.3Ghz 3770K, 16GB RAM, and a GTX1070 OCd to 2Ghz, it should still be improved significantly IMO. I can imagine people on lesser systems being seriously frustrated and having to cap framerate to 30 just to get a decent experience.I wholehearted recommend the game to anyone who loves AC, anyone who loves great stories, and anyone who gets a kick out of huge open worlds.
