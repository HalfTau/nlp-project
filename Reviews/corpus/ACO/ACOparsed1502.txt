Visually the game is amazing, definitely one of the best games Ive seen this year. Although Ive only played a couple of hours the game itself looks like theres a tonne of hours to pour into the game, the storymode seems solid and its right to say that they may have just revived the AC franchise. Kudos Ubi.
