I highly recommend the game. One thing I found with playing with keyboard and mouse it can get really laggy while in combat or just moving around in general. I decided to switch to playing with a console remote and everything runs smooth. Other then that I give the game a solid 9.5/10, great story line and a whole bunch of side mission you can play with.
