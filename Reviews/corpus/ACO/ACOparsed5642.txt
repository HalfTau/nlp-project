Graphics for this game is huge disappointment. At maxed settings on GTX 1080TI it looks like original AC game, so being that this is Origins the developer decided to take it back to orignal graphics. Game play is not as smooth and the game itslelt is not as polished. After 2 hours of play, I am done. If you like beautiful looking games, save your money. If you are die hard fan, buy it.
