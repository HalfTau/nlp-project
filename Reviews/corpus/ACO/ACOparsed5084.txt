I have an I7 6700k processor, 1070 Asus Rog Strix GPU and 16GB of ram, not sure the exact speed at the moment and the game runs anywhere from 70 to 90 at any given time and of course inside crypts I get around 110 constantly. The gameplay so far is great along with the story and level factor. The only complaint I have crashed about 3 times in the 8.6 hours I have played. For being a Ubisoft game, I think a few crashes for a new release is pretty damn good
