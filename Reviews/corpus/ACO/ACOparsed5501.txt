I didnt want to listen to some of the post. But i have to agree, that this game is not optimized and crashes. I have two machines that go above and beyond in meeting the specs and this game just wont run well and crash. Not wasting my time an rather go back to games that just work, I was excited to play this and i am sure the game is great, but just a bad PC port.
