Ive played the game for about 20 actual minutes. The other 60 minutes on record is waiting for the game to try and load properly.As all the other reviews say, the DRM/VMP is hogging cpu usage and causing the game to run very poorly. The 20 minutes I did play were enjoyable, up till it stopped working.
