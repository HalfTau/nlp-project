One of the best game Ive ever played! !This is the by far, the best RPG game Ive ever played, just behind Skyrim. Both the graphics, soundtrack and the world are beautiful. The characters are tons of fun, and each have their unique, well written story. The sidequests are very well made, and there are plenty of them with different objectives and stories. This is one of those games, where I have actually enjoyed the sidequests just as much as the main story. And I really enjoyed the main story.You play as Bayek of Siwa And a little bit as Aya, Bayeks wife, the last medjay whose job is to find and assassinate The order of Ancients, and to put Cleopatra back on the egyptian throne from her brother Ptolemy. Youre also tasked to protect and help the people of Egypt as you explore around.Theres one thing I dislike about this game, and thats the climbing controls during combat. Climbing during a fight, is quite frutrating sometimes, but I dont do it often, so its not a huge problem.I love this game, from the soundtrack and the story, to the people and their peronality. I do recommend that you play with a strong computer, to get the best experience. This game, is worth the money. 9/10
