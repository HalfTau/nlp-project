Almost 20 hours into the game and I still cannot believe how beautiful it looks. The world they created is a feast for the eyes  if you have the horsepower to run it. The world and gameplay is full of details, quest are OK voice acting could be a bit better imo.Im playing with an xbox controller, since the game was clearly designed for it. Auto aim and lock on helps, but takes away a bit from the gameplay. Still, I really like the combat system. Using parry end dodge can feel quite rewarding. Only thing I miss is decapitations like in Witcher 3.If this is were ubisoft is going ... im already waiting for far cry 5 and/or their next games.
