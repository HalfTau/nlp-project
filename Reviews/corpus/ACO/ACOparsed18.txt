Very, very nice visuals and well made world. Feels great exploring it.But not challenging even on Nightmare.If youre planning on buying and want a game that pushes you to use your stealthbrain I WOULD NOT recommend this however. The only difficulty is the artifical one that comes with enemies being higher lvl than you and you wont damage them properly.Will still recommend for being excellent in almost every other aspect.
