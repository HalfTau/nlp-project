just started.. completed the frst sequence in abt 6 hrs.. I took my sweet tym.. but one thing I can say is that the game looks damn gorgeous and pretty optimized for a wider range of pcs.. I could get a stable 30fps on my 750ti  900p at high settings.. the controls takes a bit time to get used to it but its pretty easy to master it if you have ever played any third person rpg combat based game.. any AC fan would love it.. Cant spk for others cuz I still hv to find out wat this game offers.. Am pretty happy with the product..
