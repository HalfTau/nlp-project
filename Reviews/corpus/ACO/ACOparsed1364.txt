I am a huge fan of Assassin Creed so when Unity and Syndicate fell flat, I was very sad. Ever since Assassin Creed III, the franchise has struggled with storyline. When they said they were taking a year off, I had high hopes that they would work on the storyline a bit more, specifically outside the Animus.Thankfully, they did!In AC Origins, you have a story inside the Animus that grabs your attention and keeps you pushing forward to find out what happens next. Not only that, but we have a new character outside the Animus to learn about and develop. That combined with the level capped areas and new gear/craft system, I was very very pleased.Pros Great storyline to keep your interest. New gear/craft system that is easy to keep track of. Level capped areas so you dont get overwhelmed with how much side story/treasure hunts etc. there are.Cons Ive always loved the combat in AC. This time Im not impressed. The change in the combat controls is clunky and I end up relying more on stealth than I used to. Autorun horses glitch easily and tend to run over small children. Still a few glitches that need to be worked out like follow missions where the NPC just stands there for five minutes.
