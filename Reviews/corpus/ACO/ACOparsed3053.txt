I have a GTX 1060 which I overclocked, and I am getting around 1020 FPS. There is something wrong with this picture.Update The FPS is much greater after the upgrade, but this game is not quite catching me. It is fun, and the scenarie is cool, but there is something missing. It feels almost like a grind to the new level, and then there is another place you need to grind.UpdateI upgraded my computer gangster mode. Everything is Ultra GTA Online, Fallout 4, Subnautica, etc.This game runs much better, but not perfectly very high CPU drain that everyone is experiencing.After about 20 hours or so Ive found the game to be kinda boring. Repetitive. Not much going on except to explore, gain achievements, whatever. Feels like a grind.Get it on sale for the ability to hang with the pyramids.
