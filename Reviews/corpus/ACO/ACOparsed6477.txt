The game isnt Assassins Creed, its a game with running around and doing side quests and crafting items for better use, I dont recommend if youre a true Assassins Creed fan, combat is meh, I miss being able to mess around and climb large structures, this game is a very flat landscape. Assassins Creed Origins is a open world desert, dont buy this game unless all you like doing is side quests to hit the recommended levels.
