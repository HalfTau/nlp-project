like many others have said... its hard to review this game. The game is fun, huge, and worth it. Not the best not the worst. the fighting, stealth, and climbing are nothing special. Yet, id recommend it for the the size of it all. One of the few games out there worth the 60.00. HOWEVER, with my cpu being bogged down by the anti whatever, and having to play at medium settings with an EVGA GTX 1080, i5 6600k, and 32gb ddr5 of ram a little much but meh... i can not in good conscience, in this games current state, give it a good review. Their is no reason for this ubisoft! Fix it and let me enjoy this visually stunning game as it was meant to be enjoyed! Will gladly change the review once you do
