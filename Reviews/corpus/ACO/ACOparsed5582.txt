This is my second go at this review, I really need a middle option because simply recommending ACOrigins or not doesnt cover how the game has performed for me. As far as gameplay and story are concerned everything seems good, unfortunately I can not say the same for performance. I am changing my recommendation to Yes, but I have reservations.Initially I didnt recommend the game because my i56600, GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB system was having severe performance problems related to 100 CPU usage. This is something I consider unacceptable on a system that comes in above the minimum recommended specifications. Eventually after a few hours of trouble shooting I managed to get to an acceptable level of performance by having Environmental Detail on its lowest setting and using Adaptive Sync at 30fps. It is important to note however that this does not solve all problems and the game still freezes for seconds at a time, this is in the opening area, I fear getting to larger cities in case the game performance drops back down to unacceptable levels.It would seem that now is the time games are going to push CPUs to the limit instead of graphics cards and that is a good thing, but it feels as though the development team have gone too far too fast with this game. i7 processors are nowhere near the norm for the majority of gamers and it feels like they have tried to push gaming forward by ignoring what i5 4 core/4 thread processors are actually capable of.They have made a good game, this is not in doubt, if they had made a good game that performed well at the minimum specs they published it would be so much better.
