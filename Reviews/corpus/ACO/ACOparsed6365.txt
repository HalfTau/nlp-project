Game will not launch, and I spent hours following all the troubleshooting steps I found on the Steam Community forums for the game and on Ubisoft forums.I gave up and requested a refund.I dont trust Ubisoft will treat PC Gamers with any real respect and get these issues worked out in a timely manner. I will revisit when and if Ubisoft satisfacturaly works out the bugs and there is 50 Steam sale on the game.
