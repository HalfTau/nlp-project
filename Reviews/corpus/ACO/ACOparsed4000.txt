It is the first AC since AC2 which I really liked.UPDLet me try to explain why I dont think AC4 isgood. AC series generally try to create some personality it the character we play. OK, AC1 was a sandbox with parkour before it started to be mainstream, scenario wasnt the main focus. But for AC2 they came up with a character who tries to make things right. I can easily identify myself with. Thats why I stormed through AC2, then Brotherhood, then Revelations. It was a little sad to let Ezio go.In AC3, though Connors story was tragic, his motivation always felt a little childish. They tried to create drama, but it was too artificial if such can be said in regards to computer game. Now, AC4. For me it was difficult to sympathize Edward, it was hard to understand what all this suffering is for. Kills, has fun with money, plunders, has fun with money. Repeat if needed. He is very shallow for the most of the game. By the ending they tried to show how good he became, how it all transformed him into a better man, but it was too late to repair all this impression. If this moment happened in the first part of the game, maybe AC4 would have fallen into liked category, but Im not sure.In case of Bayek its easier to see good person in him, to see what he cares for and why he struggles so much with his vendetta. It made me wanting to see what else world has prepared for him.And it is interesting how Bayeks story will continue to unfold in DLCs.
