DONT BUY THIS GAME, never thought i would say this to an assassins creed game since im a huge fan but this is absulutly unplaybel, many bugs, NPCs not rendering, map not rendering, suden FPS drop, even tho i have a GTX1060 and an i5 7400, played the witcher 3 on this pc on ultra and had 5045 FPS, on high i got a solid 60 FPS, this game is not finnished nour optemized.Disappointing.
