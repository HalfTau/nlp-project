I was really hyped about this game, only to be let down by 100 CPU usage. My CPU is an I77700k and can run every game ultra without breaking a sweat except for this one. I chose to refund this game at the moment, with hopes to purchase it again when a patch is released to fix this CPU performance. Otherwise, the game was beautiful and seemed to be fun  unfortunately I couldnt actually play the whole game. I would recommend this game but cannot due to the performance issues holding it back.Edit 1 Still no fix from Ubisoft except for the one hotfix they released saying it would increase performance. I picked it up again to see if its any better CPU isnt reaching 70 degrees anymore which is nice and seems to be hitting 90 instead of constant 100 I guess its something? Gonna keep holding out to really enjoy this game until its fixed.Edit 2 Im now almost 50 hours into the game at the point of writing this. The game still runs 100 on occasions, but the heat output is very low relative to what it was prior  less than 65C at most times which is perfectly acceptable to me Probably shouldnt be due to my liquid cooling setup, but whatever. I absolutely love the game and recommend it at this point. If your rig is beefy like mine, then defintely pick up the game and enjoy. On the fence about the 100 usage? Remember Usage is fine, heat is not.
