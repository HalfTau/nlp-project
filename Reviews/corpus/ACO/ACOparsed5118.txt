My first Review in STEAM, even though I have 100s of hours As many people have said, I really enjoy the concept of the Game, is like a free spirit game enjoy the view.I have a 6700k, GTX1080 ti,SSD,16 GB RAM and 4k 28 inch Monitor  spent the money to play games at 100.My game ranges from 35 fps Alexandria as far as I am to 60 fps dessert or low populated area.Based on the above and what I can achieve with other games, I cant recommend this game because of the layers of protection. All my cpus are at 100 all the time and my GPU is sleeping.How can I game not run at 5060 average fps, or even how is advertised when the layers of protection will not allow the game to run properly no matter the graphics settings?Personally I am really disappointed with this approach, and every day I play this game I feel more and more incline to ask for my money back.Why would I play a game that stress test my cpu every day? Answer No idea.
