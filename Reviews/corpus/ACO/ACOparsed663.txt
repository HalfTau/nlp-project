10/10The story was insanely good. which is what I mostly look for in assassins creed gamesTheres ALOT of things you can do after beating the main story as well.Graphics are on point.Controls are a bit hard but I changed mine so climb up would be spacebar, crouch would be ctrl, and dodge would be my mouse scroll which made the game much better for me.Theres almost no bugs that I encountered.The leveling up system, different types of weapons that you can use and upgrade throughout the game, the abilities, everything is smooth and great.Dont hesitate to buy!!
