Great game and much improved from previous titles since the Ezio era, I have had frame rate problems too but seems to be much more stable on high. When I load up the game it starts off bouncing all over but settles after a couple of minutes. Havent had the issue with the cpu like others have said but i do have an I74790k so i think its an I5 issue.All in all a great game but it has been poorly ported when it comes to running it.
