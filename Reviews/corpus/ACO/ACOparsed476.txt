This is simply one of the best Assassins Creed Games and brought about the same emotional and adrenaline rush as  Assassins Creed 2 , Brotherhood and Black Flag previously did. Origins has one of the best open world Ive ever seen in a game, with mesmerising graphics, the main character Bayek is in league with Sir Ezio Auditore you feel for the character, lots and lots of side missions, very good progression system, best combat mechanics in Assassins Creed till date, excellent loot system, tons of activities to do in game, the main storyline is impressive, the character voiceover is excellent, music to boss fights, I just cant stop write praise about this game. 70 hours of gameplay and still I dont want to leave this wonderful world created by Ubisoft.
