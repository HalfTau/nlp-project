AC ON THE RIGHT TRACKOverall a vast improvement from the past formula. You can tell that Ubisoft did their homework on the setting and added a lot of detail. It feels accurate, the cities and overall world you are in feels alive and lived in. As I played it became apparent they borrowed some stuff from other games like Witcher 3  with more extensive quest stories and the way Bayek can investigate for people.The combat is vastly improved and is made to be more dynamic and quick. You no longer have to go through lenghty nonanimus sections, Ubisoft understands that you want to get back into the action, so it never overstays its welcome.I highly recommend this game, the setting is interesting, the story is better than the past AC entries, the combat is much better, and it rewards exploration with little hand holding. Dont get me wrong, this game isnt perfect, but it is a step in the right direction. So if you like to explore, and immerse yourself completely into one of the most interesting time periods of humanity, you wont regret this purchase.
