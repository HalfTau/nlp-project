Origins is Ubisofts attempt at a new AC formula, and boy is it refreshing. The way you experience combat depends on how you build your character, the graphics are gorgeous, and the story isnt bland for once. Despite numerous technical issues in regards to framerate and CPU usage, the game still runs fairly well. However dont expect to run it on maximum settings at 60 FPS until further patches address some of the issues. If you can forgive some of those things, underneath you have what is quite possibly the rebirth of the AC franchise.
