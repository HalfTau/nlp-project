I had no expectations when I bought this game, but when I started playing the game I fell in love with this.This game has many bugs the major issue I had while playing the story is the frame drops at the cut scenes but Im sure that Ubisoft gonna solve this. Other than that I really enjoyed the story and exploring the Ancient Egypt.
