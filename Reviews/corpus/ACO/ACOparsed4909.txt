From the sheer amount of things to do to the vast open world which is very much alive, this game aims to impress just about anyone who spends just a little time with it. The combat at first is a little clunky but with time I adjusted to what it was expecting from me. Very pleased with the game so far and I keep thinking about it when Im not playing. Thats always a good sign.
