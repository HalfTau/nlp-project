I love this game. Many of the recent installments of Assassins Creed were not up to snuff with the rest of the series. This game makes up for the poorer offerings, and how! The graphics are beautiful, so much that they give you a camera to take pictures of ancient egypt and the surrounding areas. The immersion level is fantastic. The story engaging, even emotional at times. The villains are the types you just enjoy sinking your blade into. I cant say enough good about this game! A
