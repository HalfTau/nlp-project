As someone who did a very thorough playthrough of the game, I enjoyed it very much. I never had a huge issue with previous Assassins Creed games, but this one reinvents and changes up the game to make it just fresh enough with a familiar concept. Gorgeous graphics, interesting side quest, loveable main character and a good main story.If I must find a few things to criticize, that would be maybe the length of the main quest, and some of the dialogues of the notsoimportant characters main dialogues are great.
