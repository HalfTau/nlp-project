Its no Witcher game, but it brings a lot to the AC franchise that kept me from leaving this game half way through like every other AC game ever. It certainly has its ups and downs, but if the franchise continues on this path Im all for it. The map is is large and beautiful, and the combat is good with varied weapon types and combat styles. The best part about this game is the exploration, the tombs to the outposts are all very well crafted and fun to explore/traverse. Overall it is a welcome addition to the AC franchise and I really hope it stays.
