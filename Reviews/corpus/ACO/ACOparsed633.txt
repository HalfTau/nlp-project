Buy it. Its the best Assassins Creed game and a fantastic openworld RPG. I was a reluctant at first since AC kinda went downhill some years back, but Origins sets a new bar not only for the franchise, but gaming as well.Oh, theres tons of micro transactions that blatantly allow pay to win, but its not required to play the game at all
