Im going to be giving this game a Great game, but small gripes to how somethings a handled in short.So, the basics good bits, love the style, look and time it takes place in. The game plays great with and does what its sets out to do well. The event stuff is a great idea for when I get to the level to do it haha, but makes something to look forward to after beating the game. Some bugs I have already experienced but some minor or being able to reset the mission to the checkpoint and simply carry on, which is great forward thinking I find if you get locked do to a bug.A few gripes I have, well the whole pay to get weapons, cash, or crafting mats, let alone after the intro part giving you 200 creds to show you how to pay to win and sort of encourages people to do so with that small taste of 200 creds. But all that can be avoided or ignored if you got the will to do so. Another thing which is Id say a good 90 my fault for not reading in more detail, but the deluxe edition not including the season pass or such, I mean ill get it at some point, but I always thought a bundle or usually the deluxe would have the season pass, but my fault for my presumptions,out of you and me and such.So other than that, and what I can think of at this moment is my review, if there is need to add more later in me playing then ill add in bellow this, but for now, in short, the game is pretty good and look forward to more.
