What an adventure.Assassins Creed has had its ups and downs for a long time. Assassins Creed Origins is easily one of the best, if not the best in the series.  Gone are the repetitive collectible hunts and missions. AC has taken a page out of the open world RPG book and it is better for it.Side quests are really interesting and fit the setting very well. You will not find repetition here.Egypt itself is extremely detailed and seems like a real place, the amount of effort put into the setting is staggering.Leveling the character adds some much needed player choice to the franchise and the revamped combat adds challenge as well.Overall this is one of those games that have to be recommended. If youre a fan of open world games or Assassins Creed games, you should get this one.
