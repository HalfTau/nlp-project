AC ORIGINS this has been on top of my list since the start of the year and it did NOT disappoint. An absolutely brilliant game. The storyline, gameplay, the evolved combat system, the stunning portrayal of ancient Egypt and the beautiful implementation of RPG mechanics is bound to impress you IF you are not hung on on the whole 100 CPU usage matter.Although, it does become noticeable when youre in major cities but generally you spend more than most of your time outside of those cities. Exploring, hunting, stargazing and taking selfies with Senu on top of Pyramids.Earning in game currency isnt really that much of a grind as long as you hunt as you go and sell the animal goods and trinkets from looting as there are plenty of animals and loot out there.Heka chests are worth it but not till you hit the max Level as the weapons you get from it are scaled to your current level and you will be wasting too much in game currency if you keep upgrading them as your character levels up.All in all, took me just over 80 hours to finish the game completely along with 100 achievement and loved every bit it, definitely worth the money.The one complain I do have however is the pricing of the contents.The game itself costs 66.95 which is 87.33 AUDThe season pass costs 48.45 which is 63.20Thats almost 7273 cost of the actual game itself in addition to thatThe Roman Centurion Pack costs 8.45 USD 11.02 AUD and the contents of is not obtainable through Heka Chests as it states onIts kind of hard to look at something with utmost positivity when there are these kind of cash grab scumminess is at hand.But after playing 80 hours and earning all the achievements I must give it a positive. The game itself is really fun and rich with many activities so you will never be bored.11/2017 and still loving it! D
