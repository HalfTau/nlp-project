A game that tried to out witch the Witcher 3. It nearly did it.Its prettier, with better crafting and combat.But Witcher 3 has way better story telling, and it has gwent.This is the best Witcher 3 game since Witcher 3. And the  views from the pyramids are sick, but youll never cry like the Baron, not even when Aya goes full Arya...
