FINALLY, IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.Beautiful historical setting  good story  good side quests  vast open world  DIFFICULTY LEVELS for the 1st time in the franchisemake for a capturing and satisfying game experience even for a pro player like me, which always found earlier ACs to be way to easy and therefore ultimately boring to play. In this game, enemies will actually try to kill you, and not wait around politely for you to murder them all 1 by 1. Melee enemies will swarm you, archers will fire at you with no warning AC 3 cough cough cavalry will hit and run.... you WILL need stealth, as enemies can gut you very very fast.BEST AC GAME, ever.Thank you Ubisoft.
