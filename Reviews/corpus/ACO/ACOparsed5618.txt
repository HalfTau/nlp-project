This game stands out for its beauty which may remind you of the witcher 3 series as it does to me. From the combat style to the progression system to the little things like bayek meeting up with an old friend for a drink or him playing with some kids inside a temple. But where the games familiarity starts to fade away are the side quest which seems to have been written by someone off the street they hire to freelance instead of a professional. The lack of this quality we come to expect from triple a titles has been set aside to save the company money yet they add microtransactions spam you from start screen to buy the season pass as if they were going to go bank robbed if did not purchase something. The cut scenes in games side quest are few and far between you only really start seeing them around the level 20s  range in a greater number. Another thing which made me dislike the whole side questing system, even more, was fact most of the writing seemed boring at best even if was that you were doing deed an honorable like saving a kids sister from gang criminals making him steal for them but the significances was not really there to say. Even some of the quest which made you go off solving some big mystery seemed like it had no effect to what you think to might happen next to point make your actions meaningless. These just a few examples of bad story writing just in the side missions alone. I am as of writing this,  level 23 in all that time it feels like I only just started doing the main storyline a few hours ago since it lacks more information than what little has been given to you. All in all, the game manages to hold interest with the scenery and a few decent missions here and there, the game is not bad the combat is entertaining but this game had the potential to have been more. wait for the game price to go down to get it
