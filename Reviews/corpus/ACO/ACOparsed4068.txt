Very glad I gave Ubisoft another chance. I havent had this much fun with an AC game since Black Flag. This game is amazing and looks great, It is very demanding on your system but a great game.UPDATE after a bit over 20 hours with the game I must say that its amazing.. Great job ubisoft at refreashing the series!! Probably in my top 3 open world games! !
