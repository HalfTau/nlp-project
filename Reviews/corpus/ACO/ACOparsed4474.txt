Easily the best AC game Ive ever played. But, be warned, this game does need a powerful system to run at high and very high settings and if you have an AMD card, its even worse. Id advise doing research into the AMD performance of the game and your card to see if you can properly run it, but when you do, this game plays and looks fantastic.
