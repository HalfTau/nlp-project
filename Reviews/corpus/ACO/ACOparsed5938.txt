This is an amazing assassins creed game but i think there is a big problem with performance. Im using a GTX 1070 with i7 7700 HQ and my performance sucks. I wasnt hoping to play ultra or very high, all i want is high texture and my average FPS is 3040. I know my laptop is not the best, but im pretty sure i can play high texture, and 3040 fps is a joke, Ubisoft need to fix this problem. If the company is not going to fix the problem in 13 days, i will ask for refund.
