I stopped playing Assassins Creed games after Unity. Heard some good things about this one and picked it up on release. Well. They did it. Its the best Assassins Creed game over black flag. Dont get me wrong. I love black flag and black flag is my number 1 pirate game but the combat is better in Origins, the story is better, its just over all a better game. Making it the best Assassins Creed game out now.I have an older computer so I would have figured I would run into issue but I did not. Not saying the game did not have issues for others but for me it ran well. It did have the high CPU issue but I am not afraid that my CPU is going to be damaged. So far my game has not crashed I have had an audio issue that can be fixed by restarting the game that mainly only happens the 1st start up of the day, never had sound mess up mid game.Overall with 67 hours in the game and still not 100 done with it I think its a must buy for anyone that is an Assassins Creed fan. A lot of good Assassins Creed lore in the game that I felt some of the other games have lacked in. Really hope they keep up with this quality of work
