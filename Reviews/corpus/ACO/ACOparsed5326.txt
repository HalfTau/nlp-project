Worst thing is i cant play this game because i have to make a screenshot every 50 meters!Well tbh it has its flaws like every AC Game. There were a few minor things where i thoughtokay why change that or leave that out? like no more crowd hiding or no mission replay...Still the game is awesome! Alexandria has Sidewalks and crosswalks!!! xDDef. one of the better Assassins Creed Games so far though its not much of an old Assassins Creed title anymore.Tips PhotoMod rocks! If you want to do a Steamscreenshot just wait a bit in PhotoMod. The raster will disappear.While in Inventory just presst RTY or LTY on Xbox Controller to change your hair!Besides some normal UbiACBugs i noticed that there is a problem with NPCs EyeTracking. They seem to look always left or right even when you are not around. Enough of that go and buy it now.
