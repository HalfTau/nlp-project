Set in 49BCE, Julius Ceaser is coming to power and Jesus is 40 some odd years away from being born. The start of the Assassin Brotherhood starts here. Using a 980mGTX/4GB,32 GB of RAM, i74600k settings are all on Very High to High. 4555fps stable.Game looks beautiful, i adore the RPG elements in the game. As if I dont always feel like Im playing a traditional A.C game. Thats a good thing. Lead character is a  bad a s s , and I cant speak much of the flow of the story so far being only 2 hours in, Im pretty happy with the theme of the game and the time period.Some minor audio issues, aside, I think its optimized ok, but could be better. If you are a fan of the series, I would most certainly pick it up.
