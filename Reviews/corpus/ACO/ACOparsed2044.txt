Been an off and on fan of AC for years, but eventually lost interest in the series repretative missions and weak story lines... However, they have really hit the nail on the head this time by changing the game into a more RPG driven story.You can also tell the developers have used inspiration from other decent titles like metal gear solid, The Witcher 3 and Shadow of Mordor/War and the results are fantastic. The story is interesting and the missions are rewarding, the graphics are gorgeous, items and weapons are now hard to come by and balanced correctly which means you want to go out of your way to get them, the setting and the enviroment are amazing. I was VERY doubious about the combat before I bought the game, it looked horrific on reviews and it bothered me that much I wasnt going to get the game just because of that, however its actually really good if you turn off the ridic scoring big yellow number thingy. The combat is hard to master and you cant just easly slaughter hordes of ppl like the other games, its very responsive and technical and the finishing moves are awesome. I would recommend this title to anyone, where as before Ive told ppl not to bother with previous AC titles, except black flag. ENJOY!
