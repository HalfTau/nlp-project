Really good story. Great combat. Very realistic and looks amazing. has some pretty bad bugs tho. of course since its ubisoft, ur gonna have to play more to get any extra content, but thats still really fun too. Got it when it was on sale and it is worth everything. definitely recommend if ur in to any kind of rpgs
