Writing this so others have a sense of what a guy who was really trying not to impulse buy this game dealt withIn short, this game is a brilliant return to form for Assassins Creed. I have a GTX 970, i72600k, 16 GB RAM. Running things on High, and did experience stuttering that seemed to be worse in the first few hours than any time since. Even then, I knew I didnt want to refund this game it was too good to ignore. Now I usually get 3040fps and am loving the world and combat and just everything about this landscape. Parkour isnt as good as other games, even in this series.Worth a buy. A worthwhile world to get lost in.
