Not optimized for 60 FPS or mouse and keyboard, and each patch makes the performance even worse than the previous. Constant drops to 30 FPS with video / input stuttering in every populated area on a 4790k / GTX 1070 on both medium and high settings while CPU sits at 100. Youre better off buying it on console if you want a smooth, nonstuttering experience even locked to 30fps the game has major input latency and stuttering issues. Its basically the Forza Horizon 3 of 2017  solid game but clearly no consideration for  30 FPS optimization during development.
