This game has lost a lot of the mobility from the earlier games it feels clunky and poorly made, the controls are very weird i think but i guess they work well enough, even if they are odd. but i realy dont feel like this is a good game, combat is just not good and the health system the enemy now has is the same as just about every other mainstream game today but then there is the level system where a few levels above you your weapons deal 2  3 dmg instead of 250  300 thats just stupid, poison is mad poweful can kill an entire group of enemies in no time. the story is meh standard i guess dont realy expect anything else from the assassins creed team anymore. I somehow feel like this game is just an attemt at an AC game where they decided to rip off mechanics from other games and it just seems less than thought through. But deffinately the combat thats my biggest let down.
