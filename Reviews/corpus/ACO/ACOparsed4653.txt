So this installment is about as close to perfect as you could expect. With about 35 hours in the game so far, I personally believe this is the best of the series. The map is immense, the graphics stunning, and the story line is quite awesome. There are so many side quests, its hard to decide which one to do next. I found the underwater swimming easier to navigate this time around as well as the character movement. In short, it is very hard for me to find a solid complaint about this game that would not sound like nitpicking.
