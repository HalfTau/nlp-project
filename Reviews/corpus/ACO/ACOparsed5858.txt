Ths game s a great example of how a game should progress durng a long series. Action, Adventure, Scenery, Story, its fantastic.As Im now completed the main story, uncovered the map and towards finishing side missions, there is much to be had, the scenery is gorgeous and theres always action. The story has a twist at the end, and as one to love the Romans, it was nice to see Julius Caesar and Cleopatra in the game. Thanks Ubisoft for one of the best ACs yet! I even felt shivers as I rode a camel in the Desheret Desert with the beautiful view and loneliness feeling.
