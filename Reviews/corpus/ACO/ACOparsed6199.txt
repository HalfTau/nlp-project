Using a GTX 970, running on very high, no framerate drops, its fluid in just about all aspects of movement/climbing, combat etc. Havent run into any bugs so far, and havent crashed once knock on wood.  Love the replacement of eagle vision with Senua. It still has your basic AC game aspects that we all love, but with the addition of more things to do, the new combat system ofc, but also the vastness of the area, its not like Unity where your stuck in one city all game. You can actually go to many different looking places, and each place has its own sets of hidden secrets, camps, side quests and loot. Oh and the photo mode feature that lets your share your sick pics with the community, is one of those things that sounds stupid, until you see all the neat things people have taken photos of.This is a must buy for every AC fan, those AC fans who are fed up with the failed past games, and those looking to join in on the AC universe.So far,  a blast. 10/10
