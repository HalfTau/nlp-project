as alwaysthe trailer shows some moments that arent even in the gametoo much action in comparison of what youll really getthe pitch isnt even right about the story SPOILER you wont learn anything about the assassins beginnings, really, its just that bayek and his wife are the first. its only in the final moments of the game that theres references to a brotherhood and a creed. it seems one of the DLC will cover that with more depth...hopefully. and lets not speak too long about the metastory. cryptic as always, rarer than ever but still interesting to discover it can go on for ages at this rate. long lost is the time when in the first assassins creed you could unlock a short video sequence showing a thrilling scene of something important happening in the previous civilisation of the precursors. long lost are the riddles from the ezio era unlocking AWESOME audio logs filled with illuminatilike backstoriestheres not even the word assassins in the entire game until the very last cutscene.OH WELL. still an awesome game.
