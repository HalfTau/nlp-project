Great AC game. Map is huge and the environments are gorgeous, tons of things to do. The new combat system is interesting. The story so far is nice. I Love the RPG elements that where added to the franchise. My only complaint is that the voice acting is a little poor on some of the secondary characters.Performance wise, the games runs well on a 980ti. Max settings at 3440x1440 resolution runs between 3560 fps, no sluttering. Decently smooth experience. Unfortunately there is no SLI support at the moment so I cant take advantage of my 2nd 980ti but once its added its supposed to in a future patch things should be even better.Highly recommend this game for AC fans and new comers alike.
