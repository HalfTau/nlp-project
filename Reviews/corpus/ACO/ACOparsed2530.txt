I dont typically bother reviewing games, but after spending an hour trying to do every fix possible for crashes, I requested a refund. Computer has no problem running things on ultra for any other game, this one crashes my computer completely making me restart computer. Typical of Ubi to release such a crap show, not to mention the 100 cpu issues. I was really looking forward to playing this game, but as of right now, I will not be purchasing this game until all this is fixed, if I even decide to purchase it again. Stay away , just another DRM filled UBI game with no regard for the actual people who spend the money rather than waiting on a crackwhich will prob run better than their actual paid version.
