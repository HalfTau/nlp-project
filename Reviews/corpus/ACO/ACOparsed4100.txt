Im currently 67 hours into this game when Im making this review. Assassins Creed Origins, The newest in one the series. A massive open world to explore the depth of Egypt and its ancient history. If you are a history nerd and a fan of the Assassins Creed series. then I think you will enjoy this game pretty well, anyway here is my pros and cons of the game.Pros Big open world with alot of sidequests and places to explore Photo mode Amazing Graphics Steam Achievements Good Main story with alot of known charachters like Ceasar, Brutus, Pompey and Cleopatra Intresting story from the main characterBayek Alots of Weapons to chose from Chose your own fighting style New fighting Combat system Can  you really up tho, so not a perfect system but its a start Skill tree is cool Guided arrows is OP as  Can pet cats Can tame a ing Lion and go around and kill everyone!Cons Fps problems Microtranscations can buy costumes, mounts is okay. but Buying boosts, exp and money? thats ed up. To much grinding if u dont want to use money to buy idk leather to upgrade your armour then u need to grind alot, more and more when u upgrade more Miss the parkour from Unity tho Xray vision is t Lock on system in the combat system is really weird and not good at allConclusion, Even tho this game has its bad things, it makes up for it for all the good things it has, thats why I will recommend this game!
