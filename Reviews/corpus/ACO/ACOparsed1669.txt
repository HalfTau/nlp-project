85 hours later and I finally completed the last story mission to the main game. Im a bit of a completionist, plus I wasnt in any hurry to finish the game. I like to take my time. What a fun ride its been. Love everything about this game. Will have to give it some time before I decide if I like this better than Black Flag, but I suspect this will go down as my favorite AC so far. Worth every penyy. Gorgeous game.
