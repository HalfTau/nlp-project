The biggest letdown of this game was its story. Its completely uninteresting, with a safe and unoriginal revenge plot. Its shallow and predictable. The series has never tried anything new or fresh in its storylines. The idea that templars/illuminati have had profound effects on the world throughout history, even in ancient civilizations is compelling but its squandered and has never been used to its potential.Here again, the Order of Ancients is your typical binary and one sided bad guy faction full of mustache twirling villains. The entire game the story serves as flavor sprinkled throughout the gameplay, and you never feel a need to know more, or a craving to unravel the next reveal of Bayeks story. Every time I play this it makes me want to play Horizon Zero Dawn, which is similar but has a superb plot.It always feels like the story is about to be lifted into greatness, or some twist is imminent that will bring significance to the struggle. But it never does. Its always bland.Regardless the game is excellent, gameplay and graphics wise. And even if its unoriginal, if the only thing I can think of to complain about is the story, then thats pretty good. Because just about every other aspect is great.
