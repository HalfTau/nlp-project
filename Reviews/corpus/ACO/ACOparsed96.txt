I was skeptical and reluctant based on the quality of every AC game since Black Flag.Put in nearly 100 hours like no time had passed.The story is solid, not great but definitley not bad. The quality of the quests and sidequests is pretty good all around, no complaints and no missions that felt like chores.Combat is pretty damn good, actually  I suggest playing on one of the two hardest difficulties and if you outlevel every area, throw on level scaling. By doing so, you have to approach fort infiltration and the like in a more strategic way. When you manage to execute the strategy well, it feels very satisfying.Above all else though is the world design and presentation. The amount of detail is fantastic, and the variety of climate systems keeps every new location feeling fresh and different. And my god, the draw distances are incredible. There have been so many times that I just sat in awe at the scenery.Optimization could use a little tweaking, but it has gotten much better  I was able to play through the game at a mix of high and medium settings at 60FPS cap in noncities, and 45FPS in cities, which honestly wasnt too bad at all.All in all, I highly reccomend this game. This is, in my opinion, one of the best game worlds ever made and the gameplay and QoL features make it a delight to play through.
