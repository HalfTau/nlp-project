This game is absolutly amazing and gorgeous. I have no idea why so many people are hating on perfomance and everything I have an I77700k and a GTX 1080 Strix and it doesnt get to hot well maybe people need to learn how to build a PC instead of complaining about this amazing game Ubisoft made because I am stunned with what the project team has made in this game. I maintain 100 FPS or more on everything MAX and I have no complaints so far and there is so much to do Ubisoft really did this one right. Also most people rated this 9/10 as well as an 8.5/10 so all the haters please take a seat. The Game throws you into the seat of Bayek and he just is a likeable character with a diverse story with a mulititude of things to do.
