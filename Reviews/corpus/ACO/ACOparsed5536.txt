This is the first time ive been so invested into an AC game since Blackflag. Dont let the playtime fool you, for some reason uplay is ing it up.If you were like me, a hardcore fan of the AC series who was disappointed at the recent AC games, well rest assured that Origins will be known as one of the best AC games to dateThe gameplay is addicting . The new combat system is annoying at first but after 5hrs  you get used to it. The map is also veeeery gorgeous and huge. When i opened the map for the first time and saw the names of all the different provinces of ancient egypt, i was so amazed that i wanted to explore them right away, even those which had a level requirement 10x above my characters level. I knew it would be dangerous to go, but when i see locations named  Black Dessert or  Thieves Land , I couldnt stop myself from starting a Journey into these mysterious lands.The story so far is pretty good, only thing that doesnt impress me is your characters motivation  mini spoiler that you find out in the first 20mins anyways his son being killed. I wouldve liked a less repetitive, less cliche reason for Bayek becoming an Assassin other than wanting revenge, which has been the motivation of almost every AC protagonist. I wish the writers had fleshed this part out a  bit more rather than just going  Oh lets just make his son get killed by a bunch of dudes .Performance wise, its ok. Couldve used better optimization but its not bad. Im getting  35 to 40fps with highvery high settings on a GTX 680Overall, this game rekindled my love for the AC series which i thought was lost forever. would recommend ! !
