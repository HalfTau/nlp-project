Wonderfully fresh distillation of Assassins Creed. I got really tired of chasing around flying pieces of paper and other mindless tassks and had all but given up on the franchise. Im glad I listened to other reviews and took a chance to buy the game. It is all the things I loved about AC and none of the things I hate. The world is huge and diverse, the cutscenes are actually interesting, the story is good, and the gameplay is excellent. I look forward to many, many long hours with this one...
