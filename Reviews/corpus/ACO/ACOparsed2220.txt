This game is beautiful to look at, the story is interesting and I am greatly enjoying the over all experience. I would like to see them optimise the game more because I dont understand why I have other games that easily look this good but those games arent so resource hungry. I am lucky tho as I have a pc thats on the higher end with the fastest gtx 1080 on the market and a core i77700k processor, 16gb 3200mhz ram and the game is installed on my toshiba ssd. I am connected to a dell 27 1440p 144hz monitor and running the game at ultra high preset I average 70 to 90fps and in busy towns it normally runs in the 60 fps range with occasional dips into the 50fps range and sometimes low 70 fps in town. I am NOT running any OC on my components and after a 5hr straight game play on ORIGINS my gpu and cpu never got over 60C. My cpu is cooled by a corsair H90, and my gpu has triple 100mm fans. I do run an agressive fan curve!
