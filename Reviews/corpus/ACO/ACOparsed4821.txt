Great game, run smoothly no problems so far, awesome big open world with loads of stuff to do and explore.Its my first Assassins Creed game ive played so i cant judge if this one is better or not then the previous ones, but for me so far this game has been great, graphics are very beautifull, good story, nice side quests.Worth to buy right now? i would say yess.
