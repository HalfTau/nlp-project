Played just over 60 hours and finished the main story on hard difficulty. Finished almost all side quests that were on or below my level alongside the main quests as I went along. Theres just so much to do and so much to explore in this game! Not to mention how beautiful and welldesigned it is. It is definitely the best AC game in my books
