I dont know theyve fixed the control or not but after not touching ACO for a week and going back again, i feel like the control is more better. Last review was all about a control in one sentense now the controls seen pretty good therefore I will start my review onACO is my first AC game and Ive seen my friends played lots of AC games and I never got into it plus the review wasnt really that great. When i heard Ubisoft announced ACO I thought it just going to be another typical AC based on America, Europe or so on and I as wrong. After seeing all the trailers from the game I starting to think maybe this time is different overall. Therefore I ve preordered the game. And it looks Fantastic and I loving it.
