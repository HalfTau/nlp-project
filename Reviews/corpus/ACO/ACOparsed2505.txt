Absolutely amazing, really great.Lots of variety, elements and huge storysidequests. Fascinating culture aswell. Great mix of an AC game with a game like Black Flag but set in Ancient Egypt. Microtransactioitems are ingame and you can get them without paying. More punishing and rewarding combat system, fun. Must have for an AC fan.
