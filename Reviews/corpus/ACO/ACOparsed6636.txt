So far I noticed an audio bug with the music I turned it off no problem since hopefully a hotfix. Ive played through the first area and did all i could took about 3 hours. The map is ing huge and expect to be the longest AC game so far. The combat is different and you have to actually plan your attack whether you use the bow or stealth kill on top of fighting. Over all im really enjoying and expect to put atleast 100 hours to beat it.Pretty much witcher 3 and black flag combined id give it 9/10 so farHave 3.5 gz i5, 980 GE, 8 gigs ram and get solid 50 fps at 1440p on high settings also has built in benchmark thats helpfulTHERE ARE MICRO TRANS BUT THERE PRETTY MUCH POINTLESS.
