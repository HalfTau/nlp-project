Have played all the AC games and yes including AC Unity oh my Gaad kill me, but loved how the world reacted in origins and specially somehow they i meant ubisoft made the collection of those  things all over the map Fun. loved the new combat mechanics and overall a huge jump upwards from AC Syndicate.
