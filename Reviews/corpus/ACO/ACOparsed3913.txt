SPOILER FREE REVIEWThis game was a fantastic journey Through Egypt and the origin story fo how the assassin and templar war all started.the game gives fresh new air to the franchise in a good way.PerformanceWARNING This game is extrmely CPU demanding the recommended specs are for max 30 fps if you wanna run 4560 you need higher specs. i own an I56600K and some cut scenes had clutters and i suffering a lot of CPU bottlenecking 100 CPU usage in big cities.GraphicsThe graphics are stunning even on medium, the render distance is insane, water feels realistic and the deserts look amazing, there is really put in a lot of detail everything as you traverse.World and NPCsThe world feels alive with NPCs minding their own business while also reacting to your actions giving you some mean looks, you can pet cats, see hippos and crodoile murder innocent people, traveling in the desert in the hot sun cause you to see mirages, when you walk in flower fields bayek feels them with his hands. at night villagers and guards go to sleep if you put something on fire they try to put it out in a panic, being covored in oil then swimming leaves a oil trail in the water!.Combat and gearCombat is now full on action with dodging, shield parrying, slashing and smashing with all kinds of egyptian weapons, combat against humans is smooth and fun while i gotta admit the animal combat can feel clunky most of the time.The game now also uses a loot system from common to legendary gear for you to optain, hunting is back as you need to hunt the diffrent types of animals in egypt to craft a better hidden blade, quiver, armor etcStoryThe story in my opinion was great it started great and finished off satisfying tho the story outside was very lackluster and dissapointing.ConclusionThe game is amazing despite its few issues and defintly worth the time and money in my opinion! looking forward to the DLCs of this game.
