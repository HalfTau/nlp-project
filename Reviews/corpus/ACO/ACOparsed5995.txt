FINALLY.An Assassins Creed game that doesnt give you the been there, done that vibe. The first game from the past few years that doesnt feel like a reskined clone of its predecessor. A game that revolutionised ACs familiar gameplay, and has plenty of exciting new features that work surprisingly well.Interesting new mechanics. Check!Compelling story, intriguing characters and great voice acting. Check!New, rich, nonrepetitive open world. Check!Awesome setting. Check!Improved gameplay. Check!The only things that currently hold this game back are poor frame rate and microtransaction.As of the frame rate, I expect it to be improved by a patch in the following weeks.In additions, many of the negative reviews were given due to the poor PC performance, and not due to the actual quality of the game, and therefore Id take them with a grain of salt.
