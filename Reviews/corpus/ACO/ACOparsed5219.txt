I love your game but I gave up on playing it for a while because of a bug that erased more than half my progress I cant do it again I got to far plus of the other bug that locked my controls for 30 seconds which is a long time in combat. Like I said I love your game even preordered it on pc but I cant play it anymore... couple weeks after two updates and its looking good
