I gotta say, At first I thought itll be a failure like Unity and Syndicate because you know itsbut Assassins Creed Origins turned out to bebetter than what I had expected it to be. The world is stunning Sliding down the Pyramids, Kicking the crap outta War Elephants, The Soundtracks, The Side Quests and The God Slayer Events all these things made my gameplay lovely as hell. I took my time, I enjoyed the scenic view from every high place, Taking photos and capturing the Scenic beauty of Egypt. It was beautiful. I really love the minor details this game has, like Eye reflections, weapons going down the desert, NPCs daily routine, How the arrows catch fire mid air, The Mirage and Desert Hallucinations, all of them. And yes, you can play with catsand make Senu do dem rolls mid air.THERE. I SAID IT!The gameplay isnt that different from the previous installments but the combat style is totally different and Insane. The games got 4 difficulties to offer i.e. Easy, Normal, Hard and Nightmare. The first three difficulties are okayish but the Nightmare mode is where the sht gets real.In Nightmare mode, You can have your a handed to you by some foot soldier if youre just fooling around and not paying any attention.Theres the Enemies scale level for hardcore players.And of course, you dont have to hold E to loot anymore, silly!The game was a little bit buggy before they released the patch.The AI is a bit . Dead body or an injured NPC climbs back to the top after you throw them in the Nile, what the heck? Also, The game will use 100 of all your CPUs cores. It will feed on them. Why?, you ask? Double DRM layer, bro!To be honest, after completing the main story line, I wasnt satisfied with the ending. I mean I expected more but oh well, you cant have everything in this world now, can you?
