I will start this review by saying this game is a very entertaining Assassins Creed game.The overhauled combat is a huge positive from me, though it would take some practive getting used to as the previous assassins creed combat is literally nonexistent as the y are too simple.The world of ACOrigins is vast and alive, it kind of reminds me of Witcher 3.Though Quests can be easily forgotten and some are uninteresting, characters are decent and betrayals are sometimes predictable.Technical issues is also a negative point about this but i am sure patches will start rolling in soon.Therefore, Assassins Creed Origins is my favorite AC game so far since Assassins Creed 2.
