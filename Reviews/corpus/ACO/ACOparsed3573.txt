this is a good return to what it started as and there is so much to see and find so far i am 62hrs in and just about finished ohg my god this has so much crammed in and like said by others it is a very welcome change from the last few AC games i love the easter eggs and little nods to other games and there is the desert scenes which is truly stunning also how they recreated egypt and the lore and even the people plus the camels are truly breathtaking but i am curious how long it took to motion capture a real camel as i dont think it would be easy Ubisoft have done good in this i cant wait for the next one plus i really want to know what the reverse speech is from the mechanism narrators is as i am sure it is something that will link everything and even the next game togetheras like most games i play lvl 30 taking on a lvl3638 npc and never giving up good times20 out of ten just because of the time and effort that went in the amount of hours that went into this and even the amount of hard work to rebuild ancient egypt brick by brick and bring it back to life is amazing
