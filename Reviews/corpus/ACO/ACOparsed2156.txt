A very good step up from the older games of assassins creedThis might very well be the best game in the series.Proscolours are vibrantVery good graphicspretty good optimizationbig mapsome online activities, not like unitys thoughGreat storygreat combat, more difficultymore responsivemovements are more realistic, feels less like a scripted thing e.g you can actually perform leaps of faith wrongly nowexhilerating boss battlesThe Hud has been minimised for immersionThe first truly RPG open world assassins creed, with findable swords, hunting, crafting, and many hidden dungeonsCons? Not manyNeeds at least a high end graphics card to play at somewhat decent graphicsHigh pricepoint as of nowNeeds a good cpu as wellNot very linear, may be a con for someOverall, a solid experience. This is my new favourite game as it beat ac 4. Made by the same team,no less, I feel like Im playing an entirely new series compared to the others. Combat has been improved to a more dark soulswitcher 3 kind of combat, now requiring actual skill to play. No longer can you just 1v the entire guard population. One thing that Im not very happy about is the fact that armour is not customizable, unlike the witcher 3. This game truly brings back the AC franchise after a horrible Unity and a mediocredecent ac syndicate
