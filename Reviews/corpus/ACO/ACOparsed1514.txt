I mean, seems great but uh. 17 fps is prety dopeEDITWelp, I found out how to fix the fps issues to a point, using the almight savior called Nividia expeirence optimizing fixy thingy so I can get the best options with a click of a button. Also If you are getting that one text saying somethin about outdated stuff I just reinstalled nivida and the driver along with it You dont gotta reinstall cuz it already does 4 u.Other than that theres only one more thing... THE COMBAT SYSTEM. Jesus lord might as well remove parry,counter, and shields in all. Whats the point if they can just do some bullmove that goes through your shield and take away 90 of your HP while 20 archers hit you from all angles? I also hate the fact that even if their a few levels higher than you enemies are basically invincible. Legit Im on easy mode just to cruise through and enjoy the game without struggle but the combat system is like its from dark souls.
