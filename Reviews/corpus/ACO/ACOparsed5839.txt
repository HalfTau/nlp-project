Just my opinion. Feel free to have your own, in your review.I really wanted to like this game. I did. But it has so many overwhemling issues in the first hour, I refunded it.ControlsNo run button. no jump button. You can toggle walking, giving you a light jog. You can vault by pressing Alt only when near something they want you to climb.Want to climb a tall building? No problem. Just hold forward and press alt once. Its the most disconnected game Ive played in quite awhile.After finishing the first mission, it forces you to pick a new quest to follow. Picking 1 then jumps you into controlling the hawk. But you can exit that mode untill you complete the objective, which I did. Still couldnt leave birb mode. Had to fast travel to make it stop.Want to constantly have control removed from the player? Just finish any quest or mission! You get to stand around while it showers you in txt about what you just finished.GraphicsLooks really nice at first. Till you stop and look at the world around you. Animals clip through eachother and objects. Some even clip through you. Some landscape details look odd. Rocks that stop you, but can only vault over from just the right spot.During every cutscean, it had moments where it would replay the last few seconds it just showed. Randomly.And the fps issues in towns.Not a horrible game by any means, but if your asking price is through the roof, you better deliver a super polished product. This is not.And who ever is comparing the combat in this to Darksouls, ignore them. This game cant hold a candle to their combat mechanics. Dodge, shield break that works all the time, and attack. Thats it. It works, but in the way a Geo Metro gets you to work and back. It will always get you there, but youd be embarrassed if anyone you knew saw you enjoying it.
