Game looks absolutely stunning as , and runs butter smooth. No idea what kind a pc people seem to be trying to run it on, but damn dude its a good game so far. If you cant handle change though you might not like it, its not the typical AC. Its got a lot of rpg elements to it and a lvl and loot system, but its not a bad thing, it fits perfect. The visuals are amazing, well optimized, not far at all into story yet but so far so good. No idea why people have to hate onjust because its ubisoft, or EA, or bethesda, there just games people, grow up get a life find something else to do, ITS A VIDEO GAME. Also its not ubisofts fault it doesnt work on your ing chrome book youre using at a mcdonalds while you stuff your fat lil neckbeard face, all while fully utilizing youre top of the line VPN you bought late one night in your basement with you moms credit card. Dont shove a cell phone charger into a potato plug it into a wall and start freaking out about ubisoft because theres no image displaying on your microwave ya ing idiots.AMD ryzen 5 1600xgtx 107016 gb ddr4 ram  3000mhza life and knowledge of what a  feels like6075 fps in cities 100fps everywhere elseEDIT Just tested it on my secondary rig thats hooked up to a 57 inch LED 120 hz tv and it runs no problem at allsecondary rigAMD fx 8350gtx 78016 GB ddr3 ramconstant 4060 fps
