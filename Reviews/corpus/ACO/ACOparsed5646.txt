Too many problems to list, certain CPUs  GPUs that ppl report are not supported. FPS issues and basic optimization.  Unless you are part of the percentile that they deem worthy, you might as well give up hope. And since there are many people who are indeed doing every trouble shooting that they can, making sure all drivers and software are constantly up to date, processors that are indeed NOT out of date, but this developer just was lazy to include them in this port and there are CPUs that are supposed to work but arent and even with current games that are coming out from other AAA developers which are better optomized than this game... its players fault, not the Ubisofts, right? There are so many articles that have been written by so many gaming sites which have a long list of issues that is wrong with this port.Ubisoft had so many of its studios working on this game, it shouldve released a better port that exeeded all expectations, we were giving them another chance to redeem themselves, and they let us down.... again. This isnt the first time this company has failed on this level. Its now becoming second nature, and their future sales will reflect it. Heck its happening right now... there are so many people out there checking the waters to see if its worth it this time, since theyve been burned by Ubisoft too many times to date.There are two sides to every coin, and it certainly seems that when ubisoft flips their coin, one side might not be benefitial to half of those out there. Its really become a gamble with these guys as of late. They should make demos for their games before release, like back in the days of yore.
