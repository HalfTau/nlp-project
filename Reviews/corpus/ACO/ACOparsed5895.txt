Refunded before the 2 hour cutoff. AC Origins leans much more heavily into the AC Unity school of design than Black flag or Syndicate. Irritatingly difficult and stodgy combat, finnicky stealth with the bad cliches left in. Guards will often know your location after being alerted even if youve broken line of sight, and assassinations arent guaranteed kills. Not to mention the absolutely tiresome confirm kill mechanic noone asked for, meaning those perfectly timed precision strikes on your target mean jack sht if there are any guards nearby note VIPs always have bodyguards nearby.Characters are pretty flat and uninteresting. Standard hero of virtue fare. Maybe theres some extra dimension added later on, but first hour paints Bayek  as being basically an Altair 2.0Gameplay seems to just want to be a big ol cluster of everything in any other similar open world game. Expect flavours of dark souls, horizon zero dawn, far cry. But theyre just token aspects here and certainly dont hold into a cohesive experience, I feel the game should really have just stuck to the core of Assassins creed rather than just trying to do a pick n mix of elements from other games. Syndicate kept things more tightly wrapped and benefitted from it.Oh, dont forget the usual triple A bullcrap. I still resent signing into uplay and the clutter of whatever the hell club points are. Got a nice fat dialog box up for that the first time I started the game. Huge immersion killer.
