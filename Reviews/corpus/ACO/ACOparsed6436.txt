Wow! this is an Amazing game. I am loving it! Never experienced an Assassins Creed game like this. This is the best thing to happen to this series. Not sure how they can top this game with the next installment. There is no way they can go back to the old way of doing Assassin Creed games.I am playing on my laptop an MSI Apache Pro with 970m Nvidia 3 gig video ram which I got 3 years ago. I cranked up to max detail and runs so smooth for me on 1080p. I have had no issues. I upgraded to the latest video drivers before playing it.I am going to take my time playing this game. I want to enjoy it as along as I can. It really is amazing.
