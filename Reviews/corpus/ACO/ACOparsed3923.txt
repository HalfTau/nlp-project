Just finished it, ending gave me goose bumbs.Loved the game, might be the best assassins creed of the many i played.The combat is so much more fun, it kinda feels like mount and blade which i love too and especially the horse combat was something i used a lot.Minor complaints i have is, that there is no town/ship/greater goal to invest in, i liked that about some of the old parts and that it is quite hard to obtain money and xp after the ending of the game to keep unlocking some stuff.Cant wait for the dlc
