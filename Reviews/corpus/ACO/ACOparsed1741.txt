Masterpiece,Approx 42 hours campaing of main quest and some side objectivesHuge world to explore in wich you dont get lost adn dont lose too much time walkingFor once you get some diffulties in combatsThere are some new game situations and aspects wich are amazingThe game brings a historical aspect and includes some futuristic technologiesIts normal for a game that big, but theres some major bugs in some certain locations and there are some shading difficulties.As for me, it is the best Assassins creed so far and I strongly recommand it to anyone who like games like The Witcher or the other Assassins creed saga.
