In the few hours I have this game I can completely recommend it. I suppose I am one of the lucky ones who was not affected by the performance issues. Overall the experience is new and is easy to enjoy. One of my main complaints is the story, its a slightly generic redemption/revenge story and overall is a bit bland for my liking. Next is Bayek, while he is an enjoyable character I wish they gave him a personality like they did Ezio or Edward. Whilst nowhere as bland as Connor, Bayek is still a character who I wish could be more. Stealth is also a minor problem in the game for me. Other than a new bow mechanic and a refined A.I, stealth has become unrewarding. There is almost no skills that can be upgraded in the skill tree regarding stealth. My final complaint is in regard to the changes the series has went under. Compared to all other Assassins Creed games I find this one lacking in stylish originality and falling more into a generic RPG. The gameplay makes up for this but I am in consistent hope that the next game returns to a more original style. While I understand that games must evolve and change it seems like key aspects of Assassins Creed were thrown away with the intent of making the experience more exclusive. This is just my opinion on the things I believe could change for the next game rather than purely negative/positive comments. Although, other than these few negative comments the game is ultimately refreshing and introduces intricate new systems. So to summarize my review, the game is overall a wonderful new Assassins Creed experience but is still lacking in few aspects.
