Ubisoft took a year off to deliver an experience that woul bring back the series to greatness. In my humble opinion they have succeeded. This release does have some issues but they are minimal compared to what we are used from the past few releases.They bring back the old formula with a few changes for innovations sake. The battle system received a complete overhaul, resulting in a more challenging battle experience albeit somewhat unrefined. Im willing to cut them some slack here since this is the first time they are implementing this new battle system.The visuals and the game world are  as expected  absolutely gorgeous. This games world just may be the biggest one so far. You can spend exploring for hours and hours and still find new places. You got it all, desert, riverlands, temples, tombs, mountains and cliffs, theres naval combat too. The story picks up the pace again as well. Ends that seemed somewhat loose and neglected for the past few titles are picked up and developed further again.There is a system of microtransactions, true. Im not a fan of it either, however its minimally invasive and apart from timesavers and some cosmetic stuff you can just as well get those items with ingame currency.Should you dare to buy this, even at full price? Yes, you should, especially if youre a fan of the series, you will most surely enjoy this very much.
