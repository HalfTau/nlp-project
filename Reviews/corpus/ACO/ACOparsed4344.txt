I like the game but very soon after buying I got bored just because all the repitition. Thats why I like Assassasins Creed Black Flag which had lots of variety and forts and things which you could bring down. Also, I feel that the parkour in this game is not as heavily enfisized as it is in other AC titles. Over all though, the story line is solid and the gameplay is decent, I would reccomend this game if you like a grind.  Hope this helps anyone!
