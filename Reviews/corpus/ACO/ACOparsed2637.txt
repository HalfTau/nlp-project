I could say that the franchise is saved and restored. Lots of improvement from the last game especially the graphic they managed to make egypt designed beautifully and the combat system which is now like a Witcher 3  Dark Soul  more forgiving than dark soul, but also there are few downgrades on the stealth system no crowd blends etc.. And there is.......and always...........a microtransaction..............Stay your blade from this thing..........Hide your money in the plain sight.
