I feel like I am playing a witcher game, and thats great.Quest are not so boring.This new meelee combat is amazing.RPG elements also make me feel im progressing in the game.Bayek is one horny medjay.Bazaar merchant is a10 year old kid.Bows are overpowered in this game, better go meelee route for funsies.Predator bow skill upgrade gives you a US tactical guided bullet shot.Got 14 hours and still in the second area, and theres a hell lot more areas to explore.Pressing F3 and to free cam and take picture is a nice touch, can even change filters.Kappa.
