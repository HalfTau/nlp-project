So. 60 hours in and Ive just finsihed the main story line.. and I have to say Im amazed at it. For every one of those hours I was deeply enjoying myself, with Bayeks character and motives being the most entertaining for a few titles now.Bayeks charisma is something that matched Ezios, minus the immature jokes Ezio would occasionally say which makes sense because Bayek is like 40. However what I really love is Bayeks Jekyll and Hyde personality being a charming friendly guy most of the time, but when hunting, has utter fits of blind rage, like the shocking moment where he.I was going to post an actual, full review but to be honest, I just had to tabout of the game and I really want to get back in take that as a reason to buy itBasically, Id give this game a  9/10, my only real problem was how the begining was quite confusing and that ragdolls hover to the floor when you throw them off the edge
