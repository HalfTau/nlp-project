Not a big fan of these series butson Origins is thethey really made this game one of my favourites. But what makes me like it alot is the fact that the combat was changed so it isnteasy and not everyone can just play it and be done with the story so easily. Aswell as the looting system and outfits it really is worth exploring the map. So honestly 9/10 very impressed they should just copy most of this to the next one they make and ill buy it 100.
