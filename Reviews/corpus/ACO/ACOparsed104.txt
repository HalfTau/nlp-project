I was nervous about buying this game as every negative review is essientially about the game not running well. I bought the game anticipating that it would run like crap and I would have to refund the game. I have the min. req. fx 8350 6core 3.9 GHZ AMD CPU and a r9 290 GPU. I am not trying to record or play anything in the background. The game gets constant 30fps and is playable on high video settings. It is not the best graphics but it doesnt feel laggy to me and the experience is not hindered in any way. I decided to keep the game and have absoluetly loved it so far. Not that far in and I will update if anything changes but this was my thoughts a few hours into the game.
