An immersive world worth diving in to.I expected the desert to make the game a little dull, but they managed to make it work really well, with mysterious dungeons with contraptions from another time, or maybe aliens?It was great exploring the famous landmarks, and the towns felt... perhaps livelier than before. I really felt like an ancient assassin.The segments played in modern time, outside of the Animus, felt bland as usuall. I remember being very impressed with those segments in Assassins creed 3, which happens to be my entry into the series. I would love for them to get back to being more focused with gameplay in the modern world again, as it breaks up the game and makes it feel more fresh. However, it seems that they feel satisfied with what they are doing currently, as it hasnt happened for a while from what I know.It has some good improvements on the seldom touched formula theyve got going, and if youve enjoyed the games in the past, Youll like this one, too.
