Origins is in fact a really beatiful version of Egypt and nothing more. The combat is fixed a little bit but in the final hours the grinding of levels makes everything slower and while the whole story explains the origin of the assassins, they still have the present abandoned and they dont take any huge risk with the story past and present.Like I said the game is beautiful but my experience can not justify that after one year off they still didnt make any major improvement and the microtransactions are here this time to make the final hours of the story more .Full prize should not be something that you should pay for this game and my opinion is that you can take a long time for a huge sale to buy it if you are interested and for those that are not agree with my opinion know this, I use to be a fan of this saga and I hoped that they would take a bigger risk with this one and they didnt the game is flat and the saga has no more future for me.
