Pretty good and the first assassins creed game I actually enjoy. Great setting/world design, solid combat and an interesting story. Sadly it has some flaws that seem to be in most big games in recent history. huge world with a lot of repetitive side quests that are annoying after a while random loot grindy hunting  craftingthis is really just a slog  get 20 of this and 25 of that and 18 of this to boost your dmg, health whatever by a X It is lame, annoying and time consuming. buggy mediocre performance daily missions ingame shop to save time in a 60 game ffs level based. there are games where this works, but in this one it is just completely dumb that the hippo on the right side of the river is easily killable and the one on the left tanks 150 hits. enemys are not reasonably stronger they just do more damage and have a lot more hp based on the level.  lame, annoying and not creative in the slightest.I like the game I really do, but I am not sure whether I will get close to finishing it or just stop playing soon like I did with Nioh.More playtime, bigger world, random loot and crafting grind  better ? Sadly this trend seems to be in most games.Quantity over quality !I am not saying that the game has no details, just that you would embrace these a lot more with handplaced loot and less side missions that are not as repetitive. Crafting is not bad in all games, but in this game it utterly terrible. A useless annoying feature. Same with the levels make enemys more vigilant, faster, just more, better acccurary... Idk, but this is lazyA solid game with some really annoying flaws and an ingame shop that basicly indicates dont want to grind ? spend money. For me these flaws are so significant that I cant recommend this game for the full price. Buy it for 1020 if you want to pass some time. It could have been great.
