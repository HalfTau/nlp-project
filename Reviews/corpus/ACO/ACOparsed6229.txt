I havent liked the Assassins Creed games for a long while now, but this one has brought me back. I love how smooth running up and down walls is without having to hold down a button to do so. Feels far better than any previous game. I run this with a GTX 980 on the highest settings with no frame issues. Dont know what other problems people are having, but none of them have yet to occur for me. It runs great, it feels great and I am very happy with it.
