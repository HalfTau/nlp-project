Good game but I felt no need to play after hitting the level capIt has great Visuals, it runs great and I have no issues besides crashing every once in a while so besides that I had a blast with it but side quests give little to no value money is hard ish to farmJust takes a while Dont know why the updates only focus on difficulty but thats fine just makes me play more strategically other than that its a good game that is a little grind game compared to Destiny, Destiny 2, Fortnite and etc,Just wish the endgame being level cap is better as in need to play after besides storyWhich is really good and maxing skills which I dont really find worth it and the crafting system. Overall I reccomend itThe gameplay alone makes me ignore all of the little things above so its not bad in my eyes
