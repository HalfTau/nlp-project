This is the largest sandbox Ive ever played, and quite simply put, the most beautiful Ive ever played. Every corner is different, between the wildlife, landscapes, and ruins. Just running around, riding your horse, or just going for a walk, is consistently a delight. Oh, and the game is not bad too. No glitches or annoying problems. Its fluid and a great game. Maybe a little repetative, but if you like the grind, then at least you will enjoy the scenery doing it!
