I was on the fence. Not sure why I finally pulled the trigger. I had been replaying the Witcher 3, because, well, I loved that. So, do I like this. Yes. Its great for the most part.Runs well on my my system. i7 6700k  oc to 4.4,  Gtx 1070, and 16gb ddr4 ram,   usually around 60fps on a 1444 monitor.I really like combat, its fluid, and rewarding, alos punishingquests can be repetitive. but overall they are good. Main story so far is good, not great, but good.open world is very intriquing, at times its great, occasionally i wish there were more vendors, or people to interact with, but thats a minor gripe.
