This was a lot of fun! Ranged combat is awesome, melee can be a bit finicky but still improved compared to previous titles. Quest design is much better than any other and feels closer to Witcher 3 in that regard. For me, the game is up there with Black Flag! Sadly the modern day ending is nonexistent. It took me 37 hours to complete the main quest along with most side quests up to level 32. After that I just started doing the main quests. I still have probably 4 or 5 zones to unlock and at least 25 hours of side quests if I want to go back. Well done Ubisoft!
