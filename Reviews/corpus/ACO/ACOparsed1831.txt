game runs fine with gtx 970 and amd processor. but it did crash while i was killing lions...dont know why. game requires to be played on same OS drive like Ghost Recon was. Which is gay. The story is pretty much a simple story of revenge so far. Nothing fancy yet...but as of now this game is pretty much assassins creed but less hype in story.
