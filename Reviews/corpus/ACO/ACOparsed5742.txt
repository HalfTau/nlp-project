As great as the gameplay, graphics, RPG stuff, and Egypt might be, its hard to recommend a game that eats up 100 of your 8 core CPU and is unable to manage a stable 60 FPS 2540 in cities with the recommended specs, even on medium settings.Its the good old Ubisoft touch. With the recommended specs of Origins you can play The Witcher 3 maxed out at 1080p, and arguably it looks better and has more stuff going on in the background.You know why? Because The Witcher 3 was made for the PC. Origins was ported to the PC.Your best bet would be to rewatch all the Mummy movies, BenHur, then knock yourself into a coma and aim for waking up in about 2 years. You will be able to run everything on Ultra, bugfree, all the DLCs will be out, sounds awesome doesnt it?As with Assassins Creed Unity until they patch out the bugs, optimize performance, and new computer hardware comes out that can run this game the way it was meant to be played tm, soft pass.UNLESS you dont mind playing this game on Low/Medium and just dont have any patience. But playing this game on Medium is like buying a brand new iPhone X, then smearing the screen with vaseline and proceeding to use it that way.Its a great game. Just not optimized. Ill change my recommendation to yes when the audio bugs/100 cpu usage/low framerate threads go away. So in about 2 years.
