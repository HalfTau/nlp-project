Amazing game, has a beautiful open world and good combat and quests. Every quest has a small cutscene. Even though at the end of the day every quest is pretty much a kill quest or collection quest its nice when a game makes things a little bit interesting by adding a little story behind every quest. One of Ubisofts best for sure.
