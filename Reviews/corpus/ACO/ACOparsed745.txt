Quite enjoyable, but for me it was a little bit over simplified. I much preferred AC Syndicate.At times it just felt like a grind. Not much variety in missions or locations, and very little in the way of replay value. Theres nothing to think about, and no different strategies to try. Go to location, kill bad guys, get treasure, rinse, repeat.
