Its okay, doesnt feel like an Assassins Creed game though.Stealth mechanics are garbage compared to earlier Assassins Creed titles. Theres only a few stealth kill animations and the world design doesnt promote stealth gameplay.RPG Elements arent executed well and feel cheap/tacked on. Youre forced to grind optional activities to level up so that youre able to play the Main Story without getting onehit killed.The games story with Bayek is decent, though the overarching story that connects the Assassins Creed franchise has almost zero plot development, Theres this whole modern day universe that was built over the years with Abstergo, the Isu and the Assassins vs the Templars yet the plot for this story doesnt advance at all.You get to climb the pyramids though, thats pretty cool. 6/10.
