Assassins Creed was never my favorite series. I far favored games like Fallout, Skyrim, and others. It was such a shame too because they had such promise. The idea of assassins in historical times was always one that would excite me, but these were undercut with poor, predictable stories, glitchy mechanics and long swathes of boring missions. Origins changes all of this. The story captures attention immediately, drawing sympathy for Bayek and setting up the game like never before. Like previous Assassins Creeds, it captures all the historical aspects and events from the time period but makes them personal and causes deep reflection. The mechanics are near perfect. Your character can tell when you want to jump off a ledge, climb up a building, or fall from a great height. Unlike previous games where you could get stuck on a 2 foot ledge unable to make your character jump off, Origins delivers the perfect balance between fast running along rooftops without getting stuck and sneaky walking without accidentally falling off ledges. Lastly the missions. Obviously with a game the size of this, not all missions can be fun and unique, but Origins comes very close. There are small follow missions now, instead of 20 minute long times where you just walk through a town following two people. Pretty much every other mission is unique in some way except for Assassination missions, but those are more fun and challenging than unique. I also love the connection between magic and science, with curses and gods being mentioned often but then turning out to be something mundane. Overall I would give a 10/10, and it is possibly the best game I have ever played.
