Seriously ubisoft? I was really looking foward to playing it but apprently because of the DRM/VMProtect problem I CANT PLAY YOUR GAME. Because of this people like me are having many issues such as  going from 60fps to 20 fps or even worse I litteraly threw money at you guys at full price, I played some with my friend on xbox one and it was great. FIX YOUR GAME AND THEN I WILL BUY IT, THIS IS ACTUALLY A GOOD AC GAME DONT MESS THIS UP FOR YOURSELVES LIKE YOU DID IN THE PAST.
