FYI The first AC I played was AC4 Black Flag As such I dont have an attachment to the original game.... Loved Black Flag to death. Fantastic and moving experience in a unique environment.AC Origins delivers that again, and for a student of ancient history, its environment is breathtaking. Even for those not interested in ancient egypt should be amazed at what a creative team can do with the subject matter.The character design and voice acting is extremely good, even if you do or dont find the protagonists interesting. I couldnt fault the audio direction at all. Very very good.The gameplay and interface and such is better than previous games. Defintely a step up and in the right direction.The controls are also much smoother and responsive than previous games. AC Syndicate did an OK job but previous games were pretty lacklustre in this regard. Origins is a much better in this regard thankfully.Side quests can get a little tedious at times, but there are plenty to be had so theres no need to do them all.All in all, easily the best looking and feeling game in the franchise which is good news seeing as its the latest. The jury is still out for me whether it knocks Black Flag off its perch given I loved the characters in that game so much. If it doesnt take out the top spot its a very worthy second place for me.PS Minimal Abstergo interruptions in this one which, for me, is very welcome and how their done is even better than the usual run around office floors...ConclusionThis games setting and characters are great and very well directed. Side quests can be a little dull but you can ignore those to a point. Some will find the combat repetitive  Increasing the difficulty might help here.I will be sad to see the end of this one Im sure... Im not suprised to see they are making a documentary mode for the game so you can browse it without fighting. It compels you to explore the world.
