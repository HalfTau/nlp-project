Honestly, This game has the best setting a game could ever ask for.But this isnt assasins creed... Its Grind the rpg hack n slash creed.the world looks good and feels like you are in egypt, but im Justgoing to Mention the big negatives thatme off.The biggest problem for me is the hack n slash combat, only cool moment is when you kill the last person and he makes a cool final kill move, but he does the same ones everytime, 2 different ones depending on your weapon.. also the assasination animations are the same everytime.You cant sneak in and assasinate the main target and run, since you have to confirm kill after he is dead. So you have to kill every single soldier first and then kill main target so you can confirm it.Its nothing wrong with giving your character a rpg progression. But you are forced to grind youroff after materials, And its boring. If you dont then good luck assasinating people with one hit.Every level you need new equipment for your level so forget about spending good money on weapons. You get new weapons in every crate you find though.Hey if you dont give a  about combat and assasinating peopleAnd you love Grinding the rpg. Go for it, its got a good story and as i saidBeautiful setting.The RPG has taken away all realism when you need to plant 5 arrows in a enemys head to kill them. Honestly  this game and thats from the biggest AC fan ever.Peace
