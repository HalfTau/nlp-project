I only lasted two minutes because as soon as the game started every single time you press pause to access a menu look at map, change items, clothings, weapons, shields etc which you need to do A LOT in this game, and you have to press B to exit out of a FULL SCREEN ad for the new DLC. Every time. Not even kidding, every single time, whether you accessed the menu just two seconds ago or not, the ad shows up first. Thats insane. I JUST BOUGHT THE GAME I DONT KNOW IF I WANT THE DLC YET OR NOT. The ad literally intereferes with gameplay and takes you out of the world of the game instantly, every time you press pause. The world is broken. We live in a nightmare. Corporations have won.edit  apparently this was a bug and I had an extreme case of whatever this was. Dont care.
