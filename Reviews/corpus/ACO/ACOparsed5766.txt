running on a 1070 card and hitting stable 60 fps on highest settings. game is fun to play, exploration seems more important now than it ever has, cool side missions, voice acting is actually good, new combat system is way more fun than previous x to counter y to insta kill. few audio bugs in the initial cutscenes, only had one crash and that was me just pushing the game to its limits to see how much id have to  up for it to just crash. very enjoyable so far, if youre a fan of the series id recommend it. plus this bayek guy is pretty badass compared to our previous nobodies in the main role
