Let me first say, Great graphics and environmental design. This is one of the strongest points. Its SO beautiful. Huge and immersive world and so much to explore. Runs smooth on High settings with 4060 fps i5 4690k, GTX 970, 8 gig ram here. Awesome animations especially the stealth animation. Coming from older ACs the new combat system feels alot more proactive and its something refreshing which I really like. It takes alot more of player skill aswell, which is nice. Alot more RPG elements which adds to a new dimension of the game, skill trees, leveling up etc. New loot system. Questing is really fun side missions woo!! and not as linear as older ACs. Oh and you can also avenge other player deaths!! An ok photo mode for them good looking screenshots. Ive had some minor audio issues, a buzzing sound on random occasions. Nothing serious. Occasional character glitches, nothing Im really bothered by.So... like I said, buy it if you like the AC series, because this is something new and innovative.
