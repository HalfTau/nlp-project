I finally gave up on this game right at the end because I got tired of how grindy it is. The combat stopped being fun after about 8 hours and despite the fact the main story is REALLY well, youre only allowed short doses of that story because your constantly interupted by the need to do menial sidequests. Again, even some of those are unique and interesting but most are just annoying and pointless. I cant recommend spending money on this game or even time. It looks really nice but it cant follow through on a really good set up. At the very least, the game looks pretty and loads stunningly fast which youll need when the game lies about when an enemys attack can be parried and the main characters are really well acted, but all of that really loses its appeal when youre stuck watching Bayek and some random NPC stand in front of eachother lifelessly and chat about the weather over and over.
