First review ever. Wish it was under better circumstances. I couldnt tell you whether or not this game is good, it tried its damndest to stop me from playing it. After installing twice it finally launched and I started playing the game. Right when I began it said my video drivers were unsupported so I updated. Booted up the game again and I cant even hit double digits FPS on the lowest settings. I meet the recommended settings with some breathing room so I dont know why Im running into these issues.
