Though I am a big fan of the Assassins Creed franchise and even kind of liked Unity, I can say that this installment feels fresh and new. Its kind of like a cross between the old Assassins Creeds, Witcher 3, and Breath of the Wild you can tell it borrowed ideas and implemented them in its own way.Pros The graphics are amazing and the setting is just beautiful. Exploring is encouraged in this game, and with good reason. The story is actually interesting and keeps you moving through the game at a good pace. The new loot and leveling systems are used very well and add to the gameplay and overall experience. The reworked combat feels fresh and more engaging, especially with all the different weapon types. The new eagle, Senu, is more interesting than using the eagle vision of previous installments. PARKOUR.Cons Some people may experience performance problems with this game. Personally, I run this game at 4k resolution scaled down to 70 and the highest settings with an i56600K and an overclocked GTX 1070 and usually get between 50 and 60 fps Character progression can be a grind at times in order to reach the appropriate level to complete the story quests Combat can be glitchy at times if you use the lockon feature. I dont use it unless Im only fighting 1 enemy Map is TOO big? Even finishing the game, I still havent explored many locations that the map has to offer and some areas are just empty desert. It looks nice, but can be a little dry of things to do
