One of if not the best Assassins Creed game we have had.While the older games before and including Brotherhood will remain as some of my favourite games Origins really gives them a run for their money.Visuals are very good and the new combat system is fun to use although I do miss being able to oneshot chain kill a huge group of guards.As for performance I havent really had any problems on my system i58600k 5Ghz  Asus Strix 1080 and can stay way above 60fps Ultra High settings 100 of the time, even in the more demanding parts of the map.TLDR its good.
