I cant play the game because it cant connect to my Ubisoft account for some retartded reason... after I already connected the account and played it once before! This double login t to play a single game is the worst and I AM NEVER GOING TO BUY ANOTHER UBISOFT GAME AGAIN BECAUSE THEY DONT EVEN HAVE SUPPORT TO HELP FIX THIS! If I could get a refund I would!
