Typical Uplay Ubisoft bug fest of terribadnessPlaying on a 2 year old super computer 4790k, 32 gigs ram, ssd install, sli 980 tisPlay it on ultra all, cutscenes for everyone on every system, pc xbox, ps4 are all choppy, coding / optimization is terribalGame has unclosable popups if your drivers arent current making them 3.88 fixed it for now, but the point of a popup with a close window is that you can actually get to that screen to CLOSE itGame has a lot of launcher issues, including today after having put a couple hours in last night oddly just enough to get me past the refund point the game wont start, wont even launch, its just typical launch month garbage from them having to verify files after shutting down each time is a pain.
