Best Assassins Creed game yet but still not good as it should be in my opinion. Map too big and not enough going on as usual in games these days. Incredible lighting, landmarks and beautiful colour. Decent combat, Im not sure if things improved that much with the RPG elements but it adds length at least. Weapons are great although a little limited, taking photos on this can be amazing. Little limited in terms of what you can do in the environment, especially with physics. Nice curtains bu no ropes to climb and lacking many little touches like more caves to explore but overall very detailed.
