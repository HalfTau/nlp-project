Id love to do a reveiw of this game. For the first few hours it was wonderful. The graphics are stunning and the world feels so alive. The fighting has its challenges which is fantastic and I would have loved to have played more if not for the t launching. I got this as a gift for christmas after months of waiting and I finally get my chance to play, only for it to fail launching the second time... and then again and again. 10 of the time it will actually launch, otherwise I get stuck on a black screen, unable to do anything but eventually manually turn off my computer by holding down the shut down button, and tirelessly trying other ways of getting this game to play. My system meets the requirements so dont tell me otherwise. I have reinstalled Ubisoft, checked and integrified my game files, launched through administrator, done a load of updates and still I dont get to play. Be mindful that sometimes on the rare occassion, through the millions of different times that Ive hit that play button  it actually launches and I get to play. How does that work? What is stopping it from playing? Some advice would be fantastic as I would very much love to proceed and play this game when I want... not when it just so happens to work.As a final conclusion  I would recommend this game... just not on PC. It will take you for a ride and screw you over. Ive played 7 hours but I cant deal with the many failing launches. Reinstalling now to see if that helps otherwise Im moving to get a console version.
