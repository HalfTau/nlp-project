Money well spent!!! Jesus Christ what a great game!!! And just the look of it would make you come back to it everyday. I hope that they will make the rest of the games like this. The kind of games that will make you believe that people really care about their product and do a great job. They can take 2 or 3 years to make it but just for the love of God make a great looking game.The updates are worth it, the weapons and the fighting style is great and just in general makes you wanna run back home just to play it more. And isnt that what all game companies want? To make people invest more?Anyways.....what ever comes after this game is probably gonna kick assssss really hard. Maybe WW2 as Im still holding my fingers crossed about that idea. Theres so much in WW2 that could be used. Call of Duty did it and just look at them now
