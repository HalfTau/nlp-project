Lads, is this dare I say the best AC game in the story of the franchise?Ubi did a great job with this one, everything in this game is perfect.The map is HUGE and its beyond gorgeous, the voice acting is top tier and the story is great!!I spent 10 hours just in the Prologue, fml. I get some stuts here and there, but I overall the experience is positive in terms of performance. I play with a laptop that surpasses the recommended specs and I usually have chrome and VLC opened. cI dont know if someone at Ubi will see this review but it doesnt hurt trying could you put European Portuguese subtitles, please?
