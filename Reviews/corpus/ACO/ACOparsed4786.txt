Assassins Creed Origins ReviewI try to keep this review short. I have spent now 40 h on AC origins on main missions and side quest and i had to say i like it alot. Main story was entertaining and i had fun to the end and after that i still have tons of side quest to do. combat feels good and animation is great and graphics are beautiful open world is breath taking but the weapons and outfits gets little boring when they all look the same but that does not mean there are not good ones too. if you are new to this series this is good game to start and if you are not sure just wait for sales but by the end this is great game 8/10.
