This is the first assassins creed game in a long time that has kept me held in from start to finish.  I have roughly 35 hours in the game, and Im still no where near done with all the content packed into the game.  It plays well, and despite the rare bug here or there, is much better a game then the past 2 assassins creed games.  Ubisoft really did well with this iteration of this beautiful game franchise, and getting to watch the formation of the creed of assassins is insane, and fulfilling.
