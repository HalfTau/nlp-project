playing with Xeon E31231 v3  3.4ghz and GTX970.customise high setting with low shadow/fxaa etc.cpu always 90100 usage.framerate 5060, cant even get a stable 60fps.first 45min was ok, then 45min2hours keep having shuttering, where fps drop nearly to 0 and spike up to 60.spiky and unplayable.I always a fan since AC1, and this is the 1st time I bought the gold edition.Play 2hours and decide for refund until they fix the issue.Internet being saying due to DRM and VMprotect causing poor performance on the game, as a consumer I would not support such action.
