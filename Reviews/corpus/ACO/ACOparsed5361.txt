I have tried and tried, but no, I cant run the game good at all. Not even fine. I have a GTX 1060, and a i5 7400 and I cant run it in 60 or 50, NOT EVEN 40 fps, not even with very low settnings. Need to refund the game and thats a shame cause im a big fan of the ACgames. I really really really want to play this game, trust me, but I cant. So, im sure that this is an amazing game, but I cant play it, so I dont recommend folks with bad pcs to buy this.
