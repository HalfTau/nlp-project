overall excellent 10/10 game. liked the loot rarities as well. no loot boxes in the game. you can revamp weapons to bring them to your current level so KEEP you favourite legendary weapons. love the predator bow. love the skill pont tree. also the game is not repetitive as ghost recon wild lands was. although the games map is massive as the wild lands. wilands was excellent too.
