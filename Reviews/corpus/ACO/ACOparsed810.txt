I have been an AC fan for a long time ever since the AC II. Although, the first game was a game changer, the series evolved from its sequel. Over the years, many games, many stories were thrown at us. Many speculations, yet, all got lost post black flag. Unity, Syndicate took different paths, and although they were good games, they were not fulfilling hearts, if i have been clear enough. In comes AC Origins, a title that immediately made me wonder, what is Ubisoft upto now. I just finished the story, a lot more to do. But, I would have to say, this is the most engaging AC game i have played till date. The story wasnt path breaking, but it asnwers so many questions and it also paves a concrete path of more AC games in the future. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the story as it unfolded to more and more speculations. Thankfully, it answered questions along the way, too. So many connections that can be made from the way it ended. I dont want to say more coz of spoilers. But i am thrilled for the next AC games. Please Ubisoft, take ur time with ur games. Coz when u do, u produce a game like Origins. We hope more games like these in future. Thank you! And by Amun! Ur Egypt was jaw dropping.
