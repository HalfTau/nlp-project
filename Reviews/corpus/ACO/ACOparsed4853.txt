I am honestly confused at the rave reviews Origins is getting. I have played every single AC game, and beaten all of them except Unity. Origins feels the exact same except some added grinding levels and loot drops that undoubtedly appeals to MMORPG simpletons along with a combat mode that feels a lot more floaty and janky.I dont even think its a bad game, but a great game? Hell no.
