Ill start this review by mentioning that I am not a franchise fanboy. Assasins Creed never appealed to me because it seemed to be the same thing over and over again.made me start playing the franchise I love the RPG aspect of the game, its the thing that made me purchase it. I really get lost on the map farming resources and exploring. If you enjoy The Witcher 3, youll enjoy this as well. The RPG factor is not as complex but it feels good as it is. Its well integrated and it gives that something that i felt was missing from other Assassins Creed games.I think you get 40 hours of story. i have 61 and ive discovered only half the map/locations.
