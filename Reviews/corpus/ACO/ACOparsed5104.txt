Didnt play such a good RPG since Witcher 3.Im just simply SURPRISED.No technical issues, a LOT of quests which are not repetitive. Everything feels like its the main quest.A lot of loot, but new drops dont really feel like would make an impact. So loot could be made better.Overall, WOW, cant believe there is a game that actually gets close to Witchers 3 quality....
