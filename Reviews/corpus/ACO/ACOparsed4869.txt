My favorite AC since Black Flag which is in my opinion the best in the series. Bayek is a warrior, not necessarily an assassin. This game loses some of the blending and stalking and instead you play a character who isnt afraid to go in loud. You can still play this stealthily, and can spec in the skill tree to benefit that style of play, but you can also play Bayek as a force of nature if you feel like it.Pros Combat system that can be deep. You can be overwhelmed easily in fights, and some of the boss encounters can be tough similar to the legendary boats in Black Flag, but enemy warriors that roam the map waiting to wreck you Removed Batman combat in favor of a more sword and shield slasher Amazing world Gear system similar to Destiny Common, Rare, Legendary You get Loot at a very good pace Microtransactions are NOT abusive. You can earn nearly everything in game and MTs are just there for folks who wanna speed things up, but there is by no means a reason to. Many ways to approach encounters from roof tops or low and stealthy, fast and hard, etc Depthful skill tree Emotionally charged story Less present day Abstergo t Bayeks WifeCons Some frame rate issues in foggy areas and in some cut scenes I do have a 1080 and a 4th gen i7 and 2k monitor, but this game is very pretty and demanding. Id hope they optimize it a bit more Less dense cities, and more open areas. There are dense cities, but it is not a focus. Some enemies the roaming bosses cant really be fought until you are roughly at their level. This is annoying if youre good at combat but Bayek just doesnt do any damage to them and they one shot you. Once you are at their level this pretty much goes away, but its annoying that you are put at an arbitrary disadvantage until you reach their level.
