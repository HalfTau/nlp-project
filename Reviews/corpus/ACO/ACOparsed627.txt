My favorite Assassins Creed.Ive been a soso fan of the Creed series. Really enjoyed III and IV, finished both of those but was feeling burned out in Syndicate, never finished that one. I enjoyed the characters and setting in Syndicate but the mechanics were starting to feel worn.Origins revitalized the series for me. I like the changes in combat, no more waiting for enemies to rush one at a time so you can time the parry and instakill counter attack. Combat feels more involved and its easy to get overwhelmed and beat down by numbers if you dont exhibit a little bit of caution.The setting is fun to explore. One of the few games where I finished the main story line and continued playing to keep exploring. I discovered new areas not because the game mechanics told me i had to climb this tower to discover it but because i wanted to.I liked the main story but many of the side quest were just as enjoyable. Many of the characters involved in the side quest are memorable for the story arc involved in those quest. The main characters were well portrayed as well, with every swing of my sword I felt Bayeks rage.Highly recommend this game.
