This game is amazing Im still early on but have enjoyed every minute the new combat is great, leveling up your character and having a skill tree is done well, besides you most likely need to play a lot of side quest to get up to recommend level for that mission besides that the visuals are great and great characters and its definitely a good game to get right now on sale
