This game is one of the best assassins creed games I have played. Ubisoft did a fantastic job on the open world aspect of the game. The fighting mechanic is new, but once you get the hang of it you get the hang of it and are fine. One problem is that when you use a firebomb on troops, they dont do anything about it, they still go about trying to kill you even though they are being burnt alive.
