What a great game, I was disheartened to come back to the series since playing one of the earlier creeds but this one with modern inovations has made my love for the titles reinvigorated.From story to sound, and the explorable world of egypt this game smashes all aspects out of the ball park. If ubisoft was like bethesda they could remake this title for every platform for the next 10yrs PJust need someone to mash all the cut scenes together and youll have a better movie for the assassin creed titles too
