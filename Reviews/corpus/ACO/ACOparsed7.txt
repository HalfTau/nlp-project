Out of all the Assassins Creed game I have played this one has to be the most complicated and deep. The game is great if you have the kind of rig that can handle it suggest you examine the the PC requirements before buying. This Creed is very deep in storyeven in side quests, offers gear crafting which adds to its complexity and longevity to the game, and also has a very different combat system from the other Creeds. You will also see the origin of important components of what makes an assassin, an assassin. Ive been seeing a lot of comments of those who dont feel comfortable because of the rituals performed in this game, well beware there are ALOT of spiritistic/ritual type settings throughout this game they arent light senses either/plus it IS themed in Egypt. So if you think you might be offended, then you might want to think twice about buying the game. Other than that its an awesome game, decked out in gold! Should deffinately try it if you are up for the rich history of the Assassins Creed 3
