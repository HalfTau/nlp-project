Review of the game itself  Great. Probably my favorite Assassins Creed to date.Review of the performance  Its ok.  Hardcore overutilization of the CPU seems to be making this game runs really bad in the cities. Runs at 100 cpu utilization constantly.Review of the stability  Crashes every 15 minutes. Will update to a positive review when this part is fixed. Really tired of the crashes.Edit  Crashes have been fixed on the patch. Havent crashed since. Still have the hitching in the cities on my home computer 7700k and 1070, but not my work computer Pentium dual core with 1070.Edit 2  Ever since the most recent patch, the game hitches like CRAZY. Its completely unplayable. Literally half of the time is spent hitching. Ubisoft, come on. This patch made the performance FAR worse than prior to the patch.
