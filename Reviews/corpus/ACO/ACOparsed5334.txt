Bought and refunded. Listen to everyone people. My computer has more than enough for this game and my Fps was clipping down to 15 every 5 seconds or so. After about 1520 minutes in the lag and black screen flicker was too much to even get to enjoy playing the game.SODo not buy till they fix the anti piracy software by removing it because it will run like trash.The game it self seemed kind of fun for the five minutes I got to actually enjoy.
