Anyway, after experiencing some horrendous and frastrating crashing problem, I think this game is nevertheless, addictive, badass and wonderful.I think I have to allege that this game deserve to share a place with Witcher 3 and The Elder Scrolls Skyrim. It is absolutely a classical world masterpiece. The reconstruction of ancient Hellenistic Egypt is beyond my imagination, even though I had stick with the traillers and journals before its release. For one moment I even admired the work of Ubis 3D art teams, the graphic detail of this game is ing crazy.The only weakness, I think, is that the plot is still too Assassins Creed After ACRevelation. I did not play ACRouge though... I still failed to catch the Ra of the story. But I did not finish the game yet, I should not come up with this conclusion too early, just mentioning it. And I do looking forward to a wellmade DLC like WatchDogs Bad Blood.I finished the game. It is definitely worth playing as it provided one of the most gorgeous openworld RPG experience. But the story, as I said before, is too bizzare even judged by the standard of Ubisofts scripts... Some cutscenes are awfully animated while some are truly satisfying, but it would not change the fact that the coherence of the story is badly constructed. Either way this is still a wonderful game for its fluent gameplay, good optimisation and nice graphic.During the gameplay I experience multiple crashes and I still dont have it right and I struggle to finish the entire game if you dont believe it, check out my achievements status lul. I discovered that the crashing problem is not a general issue, which is quite sad for me because I cannot get as much information that I need, however it also means that you should not worry too much about the glitchy experience as it happens only to a few people.
