Now whats going on with negative reviewers? This is a good game as expected and close to the Witcher 3 though it cant beat the masterpiece.I played this game for 14 hours now and really found the game promising. It holds u in game that means the game is cool. Nice graphics, good story, good gameplay and combat. Some problems in combat but it is ok for me. So far no game breaking bugs found so that is an achievement for UBISOFT.I will sum up the game in short with my ratings.Story     8/10Gameplay  8/10Combat 6/10Graphics 7/10Audio. 7/10Variety/content  8/10Map size  9/10Over all it is a nice title to play so grab it but make sure that its story line took me only 29 hours to finish on hard difficulty whereas the same thing took me 100 hours in witcher 3 thata means it is only 30 of what witcher 3 is.
