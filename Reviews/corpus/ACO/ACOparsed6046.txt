Now i cn play well on the monitor, but i cant play without lag with steam link.I HAVE to change my feedback,cause the game as become unplayble, there is too much stuttering.I can change the settings from ultra to medium but it always stutter.THE NEXT WAS MY PREVIOUS REVIEWok, until now the gfame is very nice, and i  think that , with a sooo huge map, there will be a lot to do.Good the new RPG way, the game gain a lot, have to say that is very  very similar to the WITCHER now in some dynamics, but the ancient egypt for me is an amazing background.I HEARD someone get lamentation with the fighting gameplay... yes and not. Some fight arent easy at all  i play difficult hard, some enemy kill me fast. But the A.I. of the character generally is little bit low. Well see if there will be an improve, but is not a big deal. This is not a SOUL game. Some enemy are real  , some not.The final ascertainment is about the GRAPHICi Play with a 1060 6gb, and i set on  ULTRA and everything go perfectly. never had a problem until now. maybe is not 60fps, but my settings are at top. Also if i dont know why nvidia GeForce Experience say that the optimized graphic for the game is medium ... WHY !?!?!?!?!? i let a good vote, ill see if i have to come back...
