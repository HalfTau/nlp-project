Gameplay is really nice. The combat system is actually better than previous assassins game. And the graphics , the way Egypt is potrayed truly feels like u are visiting Egypt. So far  the game story is interesting and i liked it. I liked it so much thatafter playing for 1 hour i went to sleep but couldnt sleep, kept on dreaming about the game and again started playing, thats how addictive it is.  On the rough side, there are major fps drops especially in cities and stability issues. Although, the optimisation by involving dynamic render resolution is not as good as that of gears of war 4 but still its okay. If u crank up all the graphics option to max u need some serious gaming hardware. Hopefully future patches will settle this game issues.P.S  U can check out some of the screenshot from the game here.Update Fps drops are now fixed for me after latest patch 1.05 and stuttering which was present earlier is gone now.is also gone.
