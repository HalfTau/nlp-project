Well, I didnt think Ubisoft was capable of making AC good again, but i was thankfully wrong. In what seems to be a suprising but good turn of events starting with The launch of Watch Dogs 2, Ubisoft has succesfully managed to create a fun and enjoyable experience that is well worth the price of admission. I would go as far as to say that this is singlehandedly the best game theyve ever made. Most if not all the negative reviews on steam have to do with performance related issues, which seem to be varying and not affecting everyone. on my Rig 1080ti, 4790k, 16gb ram I am playing Fluidly with 55  90 FPS at 3440x1440 Maxed out. This game is seriously on some next leveland im pretty sure Ubisoft got some new studio heads because this game doesnt feel like the  bland Ubisoft open world. Bayek is a cool character and the voice acting is phenomenal. Im at level 28 and It doesnt feel grindy at all, and apparently there are microtransactions for some outfits or something, if thats ur cup of tea. Longtime fans will love it and anyone looking into the series should start here.
