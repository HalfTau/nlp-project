Assassinss Creed Origins is a fun revamp to the AC series. There is a huge map to explore and many things do to. The main story missions have many different gameplay mechanics and are very fun.ProsGood UIBig MapFun explorationsFun missionsRevamped combatCool outfitsGood gear systemAwesome PhotomodeCool secretsEvery town is differentConsSide quests are boringProgression past level 30 is very slowBayeks wife is more interesting then himReapeated ambient voice lines get annoyingVerdict This game is very fun and is worth every penny. Side note This game departed greatly from the typical AC polish, so dont go in expecting AC4 but in egypt, go in execting the witcher 3 in egypt.
