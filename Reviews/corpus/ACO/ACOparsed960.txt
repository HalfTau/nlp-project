Look. Youre gonna read reviews here, good ones, bad ones. Honestly? None matter, mine included. You cant get a proper feel for AC origins until having played it. I was a bit jaded after syndicate, Ill admit. The lack of response in movement was on par with AC II. Parrying was a nightmare, etc. The thing is, I always liked the franchise, particularly the parts where they incorporate history. Consequently one of my main issues I feared upon buying AC on sale, was that it would be a letdown, something that... Bored me? Black flag, Rogue, Unity. Those caught my eye. The attention to detail was sublime, and the fact rogue tied together AC III and AC IV just sweetened the deal even more. Im going to say this now. You will not be playing like you have before. There is no freerun trigger action or scrambling for the nearest bush anymore. If you fear there will be more fantasy than mythology, Im here to assure you now that no, true to AC form, its stuck to history, Albeit an alternate version. If you play this game, do not expect traditional combat, expect a challenge. The world itself is designed to kill you, as are a majority of the humans and wildlife which occupy the various lands of AC Origins. To be blunt, you have to give this game a chance if you are a fan of the series. There are a lot of new mechanics that just change the potential games to come as a whole.
