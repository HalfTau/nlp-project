This propaganda at the startup for the gameSick of this propaganda appearing everywhere, it has started to have the opposite affect that is intended and instead of making people aware or happy to read it, it gets them annoyed and fuels hate. As a result I am not recommending this game, nor will I any future developers who dont know their place in the gaming industry.Game developers should develop games and not promote their political agenda. A job better fit for political and ideological groups. As far as I know, Ubisoft is neither, but a video game publisher company and they should keep it at that.And for thsoe of you who dont understand this review, its for the best, consider yourself lucky.
