This game is amazing! Is it perfect? No. But It definitely brings to franchise back to the board. Graphics, story and gameplay feels so good. Im sure Ill do every single feat this game has to offer. I have a GTX 970 g1 Gaming overclocked to 1500Mhz and a I7 4790k overclocked to 4500Mhz and to mantain 60 fps in average I set everything to high but AA which is set to medium. Graphics still look pretty cool like that and If I try harder Im sure I can get more graphics out of it. If youre a fan, just buy this game without a thought and If youre not, buy it anyway lol.
