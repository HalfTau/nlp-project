7/10, not recommending due to poor performance on PCGood Controls are improved compared to most Assassins creed games combat is pretty fun and well paced interaction with loot and world locations is quick and easy cutscenes are skippable beautiful game and worldBad story is forgettable with mediocre dialogue predator bows are overpowered randomly will encounter overleveled enemies inside of lower level area in the world that you do zero damage to CRASHES and poor performance in cities
