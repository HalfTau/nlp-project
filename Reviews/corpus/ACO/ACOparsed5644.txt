Wow...very disappointing. Glitches out from the very first load screen, mouse cursor and controller pointers just goes nuts. Get into the game and its unplayable. Dont get it, what a waste of money.After some help I was able to resolve the cursor problem, tuns out the wheel I had connected was causing the issue. I have never had that happen before but now I am actually able to play so I will post more about it as I progress.
