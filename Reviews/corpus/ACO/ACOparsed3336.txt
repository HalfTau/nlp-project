A Triumphant return to the series!!I am only about 18 hours in and I can strongly say this game is abosolutly amazing. The gameplay especially combat has been reworked it almost feels kind of like Dark Souls combat in a way because you have a heavy and light attacks. Also the main character Byak is the best assasin since Ezio and I am bery intruiged by his story. This is a game I always cant wait to play at the end of the day.CONS1. The locking system during combat doesnt always work well in areas with lots of enemy mobs.2. The game is very taxing on your system make sure you meet all the minimum requirements maybe even a little more if you want to hit that solid 60fps3. The game does have a loot system where you can use real money to purchase loot boxes BUT I have yet to feel like its required to get the more  powerful items. As of right now I belive you can completly ignore this option like I have been doingPros1. Great Story2. Great Gameplay3. Character deveopment is awesome4. Combat is very rewarding and reworked5. Beautiful massive open world6. Great new RPG mechanics for the Assasins Creed franchise
