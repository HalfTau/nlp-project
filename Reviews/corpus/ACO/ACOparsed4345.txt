This is definetely one of the most beautiful games Ive ever played. Its also a very fun game to play. There are lots of activities and lots of cool stuff to do. Side quests are not as elaborated or meaningful as they have promised, but they are absolutely better than they were in the previous games.So far, I havent encountered many glitches and even though my rig not as good as It used to be 2 years ago, the game still runs smoothly with the all graphic options on either high or very high.Im sure youre gonna love to roam in the ancient Egypt, walk through the streets of Alexandria and so on.9/10
