Im incredibly excited for this game, the only issue is I cant play it because my framerate is so terrible. Its at a consistant 10 FPS during gameplay but jumps back up to 60 during the cutscenes. My laptop definitly reaches more than the minimum requirements so I have no idea whats going on. Im new to PC gaming so if anyone could help me I would really appreciate it.
