The game is enormous which was a nice surprise when I first checked the map, but as I started to clear more and more regions, I realized its all just the same. Just a wasteland of sand with way too many treasure locations that serve no purpose other than a small amount of exp. and satisfying a completionist. The sidequests started off as interesting and different, but after the sheer amount of them became slightly boring and redundant. Which thankfully cannot be said for the main storyline, which personally I found quite interesting. The idea of this game was interesting, but I think in the future it should be quality over quantity.
