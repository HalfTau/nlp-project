I personally gave up on Ubisoft after Unity. Syndicate was okay but I was not very impressed with the game. The exta year they took made a huge difference as this game is great. Lots of things to do, exploration, hunting, side quests and a beautiful world. I cant believe I am saying this, but good job Ubisoft. The AC series has been redeemed and I feel like this should be the final game in the series. It makes sense since this is the origins of the Creed.
