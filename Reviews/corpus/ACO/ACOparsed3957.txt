This is the first Assassins Creed game since Black Flag that hasnt felt like a beta test of an expansion held together by string and sheer refusal to die. It feels fleshed out, the protagonist is more than serviceable and honestly it feels how a game from a company like Ubisoft should feel.From the recogniseable were multicultural, we promise opening message Ive been presented with a pretty top notch game so far.I hope it doesnt go to crap in the middle/end, but honestly this game makes me wonder why Rouge, Syndicate and Unity even happened.Still a pity that we have to deal with DRM and Uplay nonsense.
