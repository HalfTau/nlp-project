Yes it puts your CPU under some heavy load but it runs very well for me 60100 fps depending on area.No crashes, no freezes, butter smooth. I guess most negative reviews are from people with potato pcs or pcs full of bloatware and outdated drivers /shrug.The game itself it probably the best AC ever made.
