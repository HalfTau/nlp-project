From what I was able to actually play, it is a decent game. But I cant even play 2 minutes with out the game crashing, some times it even crashes when booting up the game and getting to the main menu, I have done everything from reinstalling it, running as administrator, making sure everything is up to date, and even changing the GFX settings to low. I have an I7 6700k and a GTX 1080 with 16 Gb RAM and it still crashes for what seems like no reason. I dont recomend this game until they fix this garbage of a PC port.I will update this review to a good one when I am able to play this again.
