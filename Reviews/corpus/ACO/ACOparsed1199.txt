At first i was really excited to play this new addition to the AC series, but i was met with nothing but dissapointment.The game itself flowed well, and played nicely... when i could get more than 50 fps. It is so poorly optimized that i couldnt bare to play it. After some reading, it seems that ubisoft loaded it with multiple layers of DRM eli5anti pirate software and it eats up 90 cpu. So, even though i sport a 1080ti, it was practically unplayble because it pinned my CPU at 100 usage, bottlenecking my pc to the point of unplayability.TLDR If you dont have a 6core CPU, dont waste your money, and you will have a bad time.i56600 OC to 4ghz1080ti16g DDR4And could barely sustain 60 fps in the most ideal situations.
