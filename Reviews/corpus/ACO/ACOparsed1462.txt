First, I thought its my pc problem,but im using 32gb ram, win10 gtx 980. i7 core, I even format my driver reinstall win10 just to play this game, but trash just wont run, it deadlock my computer everytime i try to play it! Total trash! Uplay sucks! It only happen in the Uplay game. Even Hitman is the same, deadlock my computer everytime i play it! But not witcher3, not mass effect 3, not COD WII ! Just any Uplay game!PS I reinstall win10 like 5 times, got the latest graphic driver, C, Direct X, Phy X, It just keep deadlock me in game and force my to restart my pc!
