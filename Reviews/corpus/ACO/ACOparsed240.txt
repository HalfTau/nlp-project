Prosbeautiful enormous landscape showing desert and life withinOpen world to explore from very early gameNice music to relax riding the horse or camelwind, sand and sound effects are very accuratecons.your ride has to movement modes, either super slow or super stupid runningcombat not quite so interesting,bad accent, personal didnt feel like listeningAI as stupid as ever from ubisoftoverall, with some glitches, game is very much playable, but I think I will not finish main story, instead will push on to side missions and explore all over the map and be done with it. This series should stop now or move back to multiplayer unique gameplay style with improvisation. out of 54 hrs, Id only finished early mustdo missions and spent rest of the time exploring the map.....
