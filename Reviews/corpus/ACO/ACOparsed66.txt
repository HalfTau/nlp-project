The game is pretty fun. Took a minute to get into. One thing that frustrates the hell out of me and other players is the hood and beard. You dont know you can toggle them on and off until you wonder half way through the game why they have not changed. Why the hell did Ubisoft do that, I dont know. You cannot do it right away but later. There are people who finished the whole game not knowing that. What stupid fools that thought that up need to be fired. Otherwise, game is pretty awesome.
