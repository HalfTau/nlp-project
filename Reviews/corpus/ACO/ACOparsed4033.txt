This is an okay Assassins Creed Game. I can totally spend all of my hours on this game. I already put about 25 hours into this game and it is fun. The one thing that has been just destroying my enjoyment of this game is all the CRASHES you get with this game. I cannot play one game session without it CRASHING and it seems the father you go in the game the more CRASHES you get. The last CRASH I got I was only playing for at most 15 minutes, than I tried to load it again and it just CRASHED as soon as the game loaded. This is absoulely infuriating. If you can handle all of the CRASHES this game gets than I would suggest you get the game unless you are a hardcore Assassins Creed fan because this is the Fallout 4 of the Assassins Creed series. This game is very much slip streamed.
