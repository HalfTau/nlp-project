A fresh take on the AC series and boy is it refreshing. The fully fleshed out RPG elements combined with a more open and free moving combat system have rekindled the fire in Assassins Creed. The extra year clearly did the game a load of good, and should ubisoft follow this pattern in the future we can expect more excelent finished feeling games such as this one.
