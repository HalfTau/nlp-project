Now this is a real legit review after waiting until now to buy it and see what everyone is talking about. I was soo excited it booted up after installing, but while playing Im experiencing stutters and my system is hella beefy. While some parts of the game run smooth others are really jagged and the first part into fighting the first enemy made it an unenjoyable experience. Currently returning until this game goes on sale sale. As in its current stat I would not recommend this game.
