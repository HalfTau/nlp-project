This game made me realize that ACIV wasnt as good as I thought. This game recaptures the feel of ACII, and it works great.Black Flag is still a good game, but it lacks the AC flair that ACI, ACII, and now Origins has.I love the fact we finally have a protagonist again too.The new combat mechanic is way more fun, but assassinations are a pain in theI give it a solid 9.5 out of 10, and highly reccomend it.
