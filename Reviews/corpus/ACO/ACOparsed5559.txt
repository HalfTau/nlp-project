another Pay to win game.Upgrade weapon is a joke, spent 1500 to upgrade from lv1 to 10 and need to spend another 1500 to upgrade from lv 10 to lv 11.The Hidden blade is way too weak, Level is everything. You cant even kill an enemy when he is asleep if your level is lower. Still like the way it used to be, even if your level is low the weapon is poor you can still kill the enemy with proper strategy and some luck. Now? No way. Just spend money to buy resource to upgrade your stuff and boost your exp. So disappointed.And the storyline is not appealing at all, I forced myself to listen to their boring conversation for 10 hours and after I am fed up, WTF is this story about? Learn something good from Witcher ok? The story is the spirit of an RPG game, not fancy maps and modelings.Yes, the map is huge and beautiful but it is really really boring. If you want to push the main storyline, you have to complete so many boring quests, basically saving some random guy.
