AC origins is the goty 2017 for me, the gameplay change drastically to RPG system like HZD but still had its unique assassin gameplay and its a LOT of fun, there is a lot to do in egypt like hunting, sidequest, infiltrate a fort, exploring tomb, etc and egypt is a goddamn gorgeous place.AC  Origins is one of those game that makes me playing 10 hours nonstop, the others are uncharted 4, Persona 5 and Bioshock Infinite
