fantastic game. i rarely buy games at 60E, but after reading few reviews, and watching few medias around, i decided to call for Santa. that game is definitely worth every penny. the map is absolutely gigantic. visually mindblowing. well optimized i play on ultra with a medium/ medium high rig. 7700, R9 290 4096 and 16 gig DDR4. the content is huge. i have 130h, and i still didnt discover 2 regions. the animus is reduced to the minimum stupidicus secularus theory . the gameplay is great. you can go almost anywhere, climb everywhere. you can ride horses and dromaderies. the level of details is just mindblowing. it seems almost every location on the map has its own scripted scenarios. kids saying hello to another peds, people praying, dancing etc.. you can start up any camp fire on the map and this is awesome. you can stop in the desert start a fire, and crouch near it. and the hero will start moving his hands around. simply one of the best games i ever played2 small tips to increase performance. deactivate vsync, and set shadows to lowest dumb option
