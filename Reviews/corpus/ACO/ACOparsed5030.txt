Took me 38 hours. Easily the best AC game, solid 8/10. Learning of how the Assassins Brotherhood and the Templar Order were born was great and the stories behind them were amazing. You also find out who The Father of the Understanding is which was neato. The fighting is back to the OG style of dodging and timing, making it more realistic and fun than the constant blocking and parrying.Very much enjoyed, a lot to do once youve finished the main quest. Well worth the full price.
