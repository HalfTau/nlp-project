Excited about this game, happy to see it make some dramatic change from the pass and especially happy to see it go more open world than before. And I refuned after 1.5 hours.This game is just unfinished. I am surprise I read little to no review saying this point, and that this game get a positive review make me question gamers expectation of quality.TLDR, this is another Mass Effect Andromeda.Just youtube the animation on the very first camel that you can mount in the tutorial. If you do understand quality, you will know what I meant. The animation here is just horrible. I can surely find some green light alpha indie game that do animal walking cycle better than what is done here.The same horribly low standard is consistant across the board. Hunting, combat, quest, path finding, NPC reaction, you name it.And my 1080 ti on maxed graphic setting is nothing like the screen shot here. Its just flat and unpolished, lacking attention to details everywhere.Suprisingly the game is rather bug free, I have encounter little to none of those audio/graphic problem that floods the review here.Maybe I am expecting a AAA game experience that makes me didnt enjoy any seconds in my 1.5 hours play time.Anyway, just buy the game and try. If you have some higher standard you wont get addicted and accidentally pass the 2 hours of norefund timer. If you do then you probably wont have much problem with that then just keep playing. There seems to be no game breaking bug yet.Btw, I was very much fear that the game would be ruined by lootbox like shadow of war, turn out thats the least of the problem. I didnt even reach the point of the game trying to make me buy loot box with real money to speed up my progress.Again, I cant understand why this game can get a positive rating review. Please let me know if you do know.
