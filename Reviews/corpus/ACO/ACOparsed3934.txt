Easily the best Assassins Creed Ever made.. Combat style still could use a patch or two but otherwise almost flawless. The difficulty is harder than the old ones but makes it much more enjoyable! The leveling system itself is not as bad as I thought it would be. Makes it fun to upgrade your gear and just destroy people... The Phylakes make it fun and so epic taking them down... Highly recommend even with the lack of multiplayer. Gladiator Arena is epic. Could see the DLC being great for this game. BTW I have the gold edition and was worth every dollar..Side Note. I run 7700k and gtx1080 and have no problems running the game at 100 fps plus... The people having problems is just a hotfix they need to do because I have the same specs as the guys having problems and im good.
