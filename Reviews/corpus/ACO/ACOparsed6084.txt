Absolutely beautiful game! The sense of freedom has never felt more exciting in an AC game. I wish we can have social stealth back, but other than that I have no complaint so far.UPDATE Over 60 hours in now and I have to say this is definitely one of the best AC games ever created. Heres why1. Living WorldThe world actually feels alive because all the little details the devs put in. Every NPC, no matter if theyre friendlies, enemies or animals, has their own schedule. They work, sleep, hunt, eat, socialize, fight, travel and they almost never despawn. One little suggestion... After you finish a mission, dont just leave. Use your eagle to mark the NPC you were helping and follow them around. Many of them actually have interesting things to say when they get home. Does that help the gameplay? No really, but its the little things that makes you feel immersed, and AC Origins is full of things like that.2, Revamped CombatThe combat, though could definitely use some more polish and added animation variety, is overall very challenging and interesting. The AI is defiintely better as well. Less stupid stuff, and more interesting attack/dodge pattern. I hope Ubi will keep going with this direction in the future.3. Photo ModeYes, I said photo mode. I love taking pictures in this beautiful world of ancient Egypt. Bite me.4. WritingWhile the writing for the story is still quite mediocre, both for the main story and the modern day, but I feel like the writers at Ubi put a lot of effort into character building in Origins. From the main characters to some random guy you need to protect for a side quest, their attitude, purposes, personalities are all very well done. I can hardly remember anyone from all the previous AC games side quests, and thankfully thats not the case at all for this one.
