 Stunning graphics with beautiful scenery Huge open world to explore lots of quests and activities Rewarding fun stealth or not gameplay with difficulty levels adjustable during gameplay I experience regular frame drops and screen tearing although Im running with recommended settings for my GTX 1080 Ti with a GSync monitor additionally, the mouse is slow to react at times unless I change the process priority to above normal or high  both seems to be due to minor optimization problems. The cutscenes during quests, especially side quests and there are a lot of sidequests with unnecessary cutscenes are among the worst Ive seen in a long time horrible voice acting for virtually all nonmajor characters Bayek, Aya, Cleopatra Personally, I would prefer if one could swap the tools more easily. De facto you can already swap them at any time now, so why not make it easier than to go to the gear page first?
