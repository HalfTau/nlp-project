Hate to admit it but this game saved the entire franchise completely. The new parkour system I love, the combat system is good but can be tweaked a little, the open world is unbelievable, the scenery is unimaginable, the history is oblivious of course, and last but not least, the character build up is surprisingly good. This was Ubisofts greatest comeback by far.9/10, Im unexpectedly impressed.
