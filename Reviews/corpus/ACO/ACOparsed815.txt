Ive played every Assassin Creed game, and was really looking forward to this. Unfortunately, BSODs were so frequent I couldnt play it. The only other game Ive had this problem with is Wildlands another Ubisoft game. From the little I was able to play it looked good. For anyone else, I hope your experience is better than mine.
