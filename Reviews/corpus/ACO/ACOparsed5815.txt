I was thinking if i should buy this...i never liked assassins creed games expect black flag..that i loved ...when i heard this game is developed by the same studio i was interested...when it launched reviews were mixed...bad performance..poor combat etc. .But others said that combat is actually better and performance is good...so i was confused...after few days i decided to buy it...I DONT REGRET IT !! combat is good ..but bear in mind that i didnt like combat in older assassins...PERFORMANCE is amazing..very high settings  i5 4690k  GTX 1080 and i am geeting nice and mostly stable fps...sometimes it will start to stutter for like 2 sec ...but only rarery..that actually suprised me as cpu is working 100 almost all times ..GRAPHICS are really amazing ..but that is in most of games today..exploration in this beautifly detailed world is just  GREAT...STORY ..well cannot really judge story as i havent completed it yet..but side missions have certain depth and arent just go there , kill that ..because i said so.BUGS..no breaking bug for me so far..no CTD ..some visual bugs here and there.GAMEPLAY is decent...control scheme is weird ..but you can customize it to your taste.STORE is there but it is not in your face ..like in some recently released games...So far , it is GREAT game ...from view of someone who dont follow assassins creed franchise.
