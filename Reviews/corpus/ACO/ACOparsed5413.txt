I really love this game!!!!Huge open world and lots to explore and do with a great story.However I must admit you really really screwed up the charriot racing! The idea is great and it is really fun. But 1 if you get knocked off you are basically d as you cant get back on without smashing space key and even then you will come last in the race as you can never catch up. and 2 You have made it really really easy if you are in the top 3 positions to die. What I mean is if you are either 1st  3rd position the racer behind you constantly tramples you or smashes into you until you get eliminated. Now I know this is the point but it happens far too fast to even make it worth attempting.That is probably the only negative thing I must say as everything else is extremely fun and enjoyable, even the fact you cant just kill whoever you want as some characters have levels so beyond yours you know you have to work up to try and defeat them.Anyways great game just 1 majorup is all there is.
