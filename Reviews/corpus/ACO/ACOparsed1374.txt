First time purchased the series!Play it for around 3 hour now...all is well except the climb part...kind of off, maybe it was because it is all yellow/orange mountain?And the control is new...need to adjust and get used to it...But nice too, the change of hit buttons to RB/RT do make sense.Will back and finish this when free, hope all went well then!And the view always so real and nice and beautiful, well done UBISOFT!!!!
