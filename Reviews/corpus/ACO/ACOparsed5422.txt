Have a Uplay account already but the password didnt work. They wouldnt send me a recovery email with the new password even though it said that is what it was doing. Made a brand new email just to sign up so I could play this game. Tells me that my account has been suspended due to too many attempts at a stupid username I need for this brand new Uplay account. Try to log back in and it says that THAT password is invalid. No support and just an endless loop of trying to recover an old password and a password I literally just created. By far the worst time Ive had trying to play a game. Really is a shame and Ubi wont be getting rid of this riduculous and pointless Uplay so I wont be back to try this one out again.
