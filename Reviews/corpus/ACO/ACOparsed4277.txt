Far Cry. The Witcher 3. Assassins creed. If you like those games, then this will be the time of your life!This game revolutionizes the franchise by completely changing the combat system, letting you freely explore a gigantic open world, as well as having a very likeable protagonist in an awesome story!It has now forgotten its roots however, as you can still very much sneak around compounds, stealthily assassinating enemies one by one, hiding them in the tall grass or climbing to the synchronization points at the top of the world!They have, however, replaced eagle vision with something much better An actual eagle!!
