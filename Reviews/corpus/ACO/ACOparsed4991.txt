Guys, guys,.. be more righteous. This game is absolutely georgeous. Certainly there are some issues to polish, but on the other hand it can be lived with. I saw your problems about FPS dropes. GTX 1080 had about 11 FPS? WTF.. It isnt possible. I have got i7 8700K GTX1080ti RAM32GB and at resolution 1440p ULTRA ALL it is around 7090 FPS all the time. Gsync hasnt to be set on. The game has dropped down to windows a few times but the last save is always at the last point of progress. This game is must be. This and Witcher 3 are the best.
