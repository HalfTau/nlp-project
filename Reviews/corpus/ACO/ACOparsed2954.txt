A very welcome additon to the Assassins Creed franchise. I wasnt sure how I would enjoy this game as the last few were not very good in my opinion. But after 80 hours in this game I found myself finding new things to explore and do, and the content that Ubisoft is still pushing out for the community is very nice. A very well done game!
