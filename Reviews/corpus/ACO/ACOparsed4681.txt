Best assassins creed game to date in terms of game mechanics.Story is okay.. nothing spectacular. Still preferred Rogues story to this one, but its exploring an area of the setting never before visited, so it feels somewhat fresh at least.The game has a lot of neat minor details that makes the game world feel alive and lived in, which is very welcome. didnt encounter any bugs or crashes trough my playtrough except one guy that I murdered and whose corpse then decided to fly off towards the sun like Icarus.Eats up ALOT of processing power, some are saying its poor optimization, some say its the 2 DRMs the game has. Not sure which it is, but I couldnt get it to stay stable at 60fps so I instead ran it at 30 and pimped out the graphics as much as I could. It remained stable at 30 troughout the game. But ..ew.. 30. I need a new rig!Actually think this one is worth the full asking price, but make sure your rig is well above the reccomended specs, or youre going to be stuck at  60 fps like me. Might be worth waiting a few weeks until they release more optimization patches or remove the DRM when its served its purpose.
