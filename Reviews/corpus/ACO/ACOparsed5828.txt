Spoiler alert  You kill 2 of your main revenge targets within the first hour or so of gameplay.  I accidently stumbled across the second while exploring and just swung my sword wildly, won, and went through the confirm kill scene.  Ive been seeing a lot of other reviews say youll go through the main campaign in about 10 hours worth of playtime.The cut content is very strong in this one.  The team might have taken a year off to revaluate and revamp the series, but its still more of the same and Im honestly sad they couldnt make it a little more interesting.  The looting is a nice touch, Ill give them that, but its not quite enough to go past the mundane nature of the gameplay.Wait for a sale, honestly.  It might be worth a pickup at half price, but 60  the season pass and the other DLC thats incoming aint worth it.  Cmon Goobisoft, you guys can do better than this.  God I hope Farcry 5 isnt this bad although, who am I kidding?  It will be.  AAA Titles, ladies and gents.  Welcome to the suck.
