Good game but for  sake uplay, I cant get into the game because it keeps failing to synchronize cloud, synchronize save, synchronize achievements FOR  SAKE FIX THIS. Once again the game is pretty nice at this point and for me no performance issues but I cant get into the game, when synchronization fails it says that the product has problems activating on this account so Ubisoft, fix this and fix Uplay.
