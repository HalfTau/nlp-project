The gameplay elements and overall structure of the game is impressive, and it is obvious that Ubisoft took their time with this game. However, the game experiences framerate drops that cause lagging and freezing for minuites at a time. My specs are above the reccomended, and I am running the game on low settings. I have not experienced this with any other game and this only started after I have played the game for a while.
