Easily my favourite Assassins Creed game, love the RPG elements and the freeroam, Ancient Egypt looks amazing and has many places for you to explore, and in the process, learn about it, As someone who likes to study egyptian gods occasionally in their free time, this game put in effort to give them their rightful place.Bayek of Siwa is a well written, interesting character and is very well acted, I feel attached to him and his plights, the supporting cast is also well done.Only 1 negative for me, the random NPCs that wander the streets needed more voicelines, they repeat themselves way too much, to the point of annoyance, otherwise Im happy with what Ubisoft did with it, theyve restored my faith in them, for now at least.If you expect a normal Assassins game, leave this one behind you, they tried a new direction, which is closer to a JRPG feel, skip this if you expect to perfectly sneak and assassinate everyone though technically you could, its really not build to play that way, however if you enjoy RPG games or just want to try something new, give this a go, at the very least, youll see some beautiful sites, and at best, youll have one heck of an adventure.10/10 , Unless we get an Egypt/Bayek sequel then Assassins cant get any better than this for me.
