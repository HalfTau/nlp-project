I seriously dont get all the negative reviews. My game is running at 7090 fps in the desert, and it only drops down to 50 to 70 in the cities. While there is room for improvement, it doesnt lag that much At least for me than other people say.I think the game is great, with many improvements over Unity or Syndicate. And people seem very blinded by the apparent fps problem, despite the finely written story and nice gameplay.Bossfights are great. The fighting is very responsive and it feels nice to hit and swipe. The weapon system is all out great, and i highly enjoy the rpg style system they changed the game into.4.5/5My PC specsi57500 3.40 ghz cpu1060 6gb gpu16 gbs ram
