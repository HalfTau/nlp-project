I wish that Ubisoft sold a game these days that isnt filled with optimization issues. As soon as I bought and downloaded the game it crashed not even a second into the first title screen. I have tried every solution I can find on the internet and NONE of the them work. I still have not had a chance to play this game and I am very unhappy about it.I have all the recommended equipment too1070 GTXi7 6700k32GB ramwindows 10 64 bit
