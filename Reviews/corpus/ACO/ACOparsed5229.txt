This game seemed to be very good, however, due to the the performance, i cannot recommend this. I played 3 hours ish and steam was kind enough to refund me due to performance issues. The majority of my 3 hours were spent tweaking the graphics. I ended up at low settings getting barely 40 fps, at best, with a GTX 1070 and an I7.After doing a bit of research, its been stated the performance issues is a CPU bottleneck which is true in my case mostly due to the DRM. There are not one, but two different DRMs attached to this game. A quick google search will tell you this will eat up 3040 of your CPU.Factoring out the performance issues, the game seemed to have promise. However, I refuse to support a company that has that much disregard for customer satisfaction and encourage you to do the same.
