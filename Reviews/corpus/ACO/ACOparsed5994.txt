Good fighting dynamics,fantastic graphics,great gameplay and very interesting timeline,massive map,good characters,tons of content,good main story and I never come acros to a monotonous or repeating side quest yet 24 hrs in and level 21.Just impressive.I just climbed to the top of keops pyramid and it was glorious,just wait there for a day and watch the day become night and raid the thombs of the three pyramids after.Game makes you want to stop following quests and appreciate the scenery and the world all the time .obviously lots of historical research put into this aside software development.I read some reviws criticizing that thats not ac,for me its light years aways from the previous games but haters gonna hate.Also I havent come across a bug yet.If you have a good setupbuy it and interested in history buy it,liked witcher buy it,like assasinscreed buy it.If you are stuck at the idea of ac2 and block anythingelse then dont buy it.I havent played wolfenstein 2 yet but so far far better than any game I played this year.Thanks Ubisoft for not letting my hopes down,what a great comeback.
