Really fun and refreshing Assassins Creed. I have not played AC since Black Flag and boy am I glad I played this one. The new combat style is really fun and makes the game more challenging and exiting that the old buttonsmashing style.The graphics are outstanding and its pretty well optimised if you dont count the 100 CPU  I have i7 7700k in the cities wich in my understanding is because of some wonky antipiracy stuff, I could be wrong. Outside cities FPS staid well beyond 60. 3440x1440, i7 7700k, gtx 1080, highmediumMain missions are nice and epic, and I would  recommend playing them before doing too much of the side missions. I did everything on the map and did basically every side mission before the main ones and it kinda killed the vibe for me.Talking about the the side stuff, there is way too much. I wouldnt complain but every place is the same. Get 13 items, kill captain or save somebody. There were couble good side missions with unique stuff to do and one had really nice cutscene. Ubisoft should really focus on those unique side missions than the absurd quantity of same repetitive stuff on every corner of the map.Overall a solid game that really refreshes the Assassins Creed franchise. 7/10.
