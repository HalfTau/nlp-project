I loved this game. Very very fun to play. When overpowered it is very satisfying to just go on a rampage killing everything with the new fighting system. HOWEVER the mission selection system Similar to skyrim was not great. It may have worked in other games however I felt it took away from the main story some times. Also the fact the main story had 4 sub quest lines, it just become very confusing as to what characters were who and what missions were important or were just plain side quests. I also didnt like having to go find the second or third part of a side quest when I did enjoy that side quest. I rather be able to finish it all not have to hunt for new parts after hours of game play where I forgot the first part of the quest.
