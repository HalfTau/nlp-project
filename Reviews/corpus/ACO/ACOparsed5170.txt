Most people are saying game is tanking due to the DRM making your CPU melt but Im not gonna get salty because of that, in the end this game as a whole is a step in the right direction. Most of the negative reviews here talk about the DRM issue but like me if you can ignore that this is definitly a game worth checking out, by no means is it a bad game nor a great game either, The World is gorgeous to look at, the story is good if youre a fan of the AC storylinenot as awesome as ACBF story arrrr but the conviction of the characters are there, theres a reason for you to fight, combat although many say its bad I personally enjoyed it the weapons feel different and so on. This game is definitly a grinder you cant hope to beat it without doing some boring side quests for some easy XP, but I feel like this is worst part of this game...the fact that you cant take on higher level baddies because almost all the time they combo you to desync, you cant even react and I feel they did this to promote the shop where you can literally buy XP and level up but this can easily be remerdied by third party solutions without spending a dime, but Im still recommending this game even with mirco transactions in this completely singleplayer game because they dont break the game if you dont spend real money and you can earn other stuff like legendary gear from within the game via grinding and I feel the developers didnt want to put microtransactions in the game and it was a more corporate influence not the guys making the game but the guys paying the guys who make the game, the actual developers have put alot of effort into making this game and you can see that when you play this game so thats why I recommend this game.
