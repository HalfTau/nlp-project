After couple of hours of playing this new ubisofts product I have to say that the developers really took AC series to the next level. Well done. Fighting system is very similar to For Honor game and is quite more difficult unlike it was in previous game for instance in AC III or IV where you all you need to do is click mouse button to kill and e to counter and thats it, now its a lot more fun and challenging to play. Gameplay is enterteining, lots of quests, basically this AC transformed to RPG. The only downside of this game is its optimisation like with all Ubisoft games so far...
