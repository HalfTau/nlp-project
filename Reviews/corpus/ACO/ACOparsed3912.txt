I was wary because of the issues people seem to have had with the DRM misbehaving, but I have to say, Im glad I tried. Ive never been a big fan of AC in general because of the wonky scifi angle, though I have to say I loved most of Black Flag. This particular game is badass. There were moments where I wasnt sure if I was playing AC, or Witcher, or Farcry, but in a good way.Highly recommended. I almost always stay over 60fps on my rig at 1080p on Ultra High settings.i7 6700K16GB RAM1070System disk M2 ssd, game install disk sata ssd144hz displayGodspeed, those who suffer performance issues.
