I had to nominated this game for The Even Better Than I Expectedback then when this game announced at E3, i admit i had 0 interest.But what pique my interest? The Guy Director, Ashraf Ismail / Jean Guesdon, both originally worked on AC Black Flag working on this game...for me why not?Guy claimed it has Witchery 3 Feels....... YESAssassins Instagram..... YESMicrotransaction.... YIKESS but you can ignore it 100 as it use for skipping RPG level grindingSimplify Parkour..... YES no more backjumping eject while climbingOptimization..... Erghh UbiKiev Alexandria Micro stutter and demanding PC, GTX1070 and above for YEZZStory.... Still Progressing.... personally greater than both Unity/Syndicate combine for nowGameplay mechanics....
