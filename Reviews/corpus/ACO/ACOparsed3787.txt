Probably my favorite Assassins Creed game so far. The others were pretty good, but this one takes the cake. The story is rich and Ive not even completed it entirely yet. Im level 30 and the enemies are pretty tough evenly throughout all of this. Im very excited for the expansion packs. I had to get the DLC for this one. Im running this game on a GTX 750 on a laptop no less. On High Graphics. I start getting lag spikes after around five to six hours of gameplay and have to reset my game for it to be flawless again. Other than having to reset the game every once and I while, which I think is an issue on my end not the game devs. This game plays amazingly for me. No complaints on how well optimized this is or the story. They did very well on the art design.I have yet to explore all of the map yet. Im still trying to finish everything up in time for the next DLC drop. But hands down, saying this now, 10/10 game. Worth all the money I spent for it.
