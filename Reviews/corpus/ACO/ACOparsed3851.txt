This is a spectacular game. This year there has been an insane amount blow back against major game publishers, while an almost cult like reverence for small independant developers. Its time to move past all that and play Origins. This setting is amazing, the attention to detail, the variety of cultures. I came into the game thinking it would just be about Egypt, but they have managed to expertly depict the Greek and Romans as well and the effect they have on Egypt as a whole. History nerd and I love itAs for the people who are complaining about micro transactions. They give you so much money in this game its insane. You will never be wanting for currency by the end of it. So many weapons and outfits to collect and they are all given as rewards for completing quests.So dont let the endlessly complaining minority of elitist gamers stop you from playing this. Instead buy this awesome game and support the team that crafted this love letter to history addicts everywhere.
