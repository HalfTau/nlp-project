Overal game experience is fantastic, This is a good new begging for the franchise but the looting system sucks and hard to earn money for all the in game needs, other than that so many side quests so much to discover and so manu things to do, i think this time ubisoft think about every onch of the game and put all together flawlessly, clap clap however i like to see less money grabbing on lootings and ofher dlcs in future games.
