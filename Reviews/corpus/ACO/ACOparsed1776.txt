This game Assassins Creed Origins is a beatifully wonderful game, I loved every minute of said game from sitting atop a pyramid staring out at the beautiful designed landscape to slicing and dicing Phylakes. This game has easily become one of my favourite games in recent releases. The story is amazing with interesting characters and well designed quests, Im not usually one for side quests or distractions from the story but I have to admit i couldnt help myself running from side quest to side quest or hunting to attain highest level loot. my only problem with the game is how far apart the recommended levels are for each mission campaign other than that I highly recommend this game to anyone who is new to AC or has lost hope in the series. The last AC game i thoroughly enjoyed this much was Black Flag I know, same creators. 10/10 for me.
