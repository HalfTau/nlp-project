Nice come back. Good additions and changes. Story is short but does its job. Worth if you are an AssCreed fan and have played all in the series. Would wait before buying if youre just curious or play a few games in the series.If youre new, start with other AssCreed games first. I think feeling out the progression helps understand the background story and evolution of gameplay better.
