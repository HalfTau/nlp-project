Many of the negative review I can actually agree with.This game is, in my opinion so far, mechanically, the best entry in the entire AC franchise, but its plagued with audio bugs and troubled with uneven performance.Its a great game with a mediocre port, even though its not even a port, its developed alongside console versions..But in the end I feel like the team behind the game earned my recommendation despite the imperfect job, but know that this review is subject to change if no improvement is seen in the near future,
