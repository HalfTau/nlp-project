The Best AC GameWhen trailer and gameplay videos been released I was dissapointed with black charector and different interface and desert scenes. But I was wrongWhats different in this AC Game?Nothing but they have mixed best things of older AC games in with improvement.Story or Concept?The movie x men apocalypse came late to show us that 1st Mutant was from egypt same way ubisoft released this game to show 1st assassin was bayek and he started a hidden creedCombatThe only missing part is guns because there were no guns that time. But archery and swording is good enough to entertain. The swords and bows have different quality and specifications. The main charector gets stronger based on level and same things apply with enemy and weapons. The Bayek gets 1 ability every level. Here things are more detailed but still easy to understand things.GraphicsThis game has simply the best graphics. Yes even better than w3. The strange thing I found in this game is antialiasing in every game low aa and high aa have lot of performance difference but here aa doesnt eat performance. Even low aa solves almost all edges. But here they have made partical animations aa supported so we have to set high aa to solve blocks of fire, dust and poison animations.
