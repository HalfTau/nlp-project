So many negitive reviews about poor performance.I got a 4770K at 4.5gigs whit a 1080Ti 16gigs of ram.I got the game running in 1440p whit even 120 scaling and eveything on ultra except AA on medium whit mostly 65/75 fps in the open world. Yes the big city i got around 35/45 fps and the game is ramming my cpu hard and is on the limits whit this game.I see people whit better cpus then myn and getpoor performance. What on earth have you running on the background? ?First of all i love the game, I think its one of the best Assassins Creeds. The world looks amazing, so much detail in everything. I love what they did whit the new quest system, because of that you will see alot of the world.The new rpg style feels right, the fighting is getting used to but so much beter then before.The bird that you can use to scan and plan your route is amazing. The funny thing is that the bird is really always whit you, you can see his shadow around you. Its just a little detail but i love it.As a Assassins Creed fan and played every single one of them this is one of my favorite.The game is really well optimized all do people say its not because it ing is. Yes its a heavy game and you need a big rig to run it. I dont have the best cpu and it runs great.Well im done, im not the best reviewer but Ubi needs a little bit of credit because it is a great game.If only SLI would work, that my only complain.Peace out!
