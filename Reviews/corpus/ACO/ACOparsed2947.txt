I would have to say i was so much doubtful to even try assassins creed tor another time. The gameplay gets boring and repetitive over the time. But playing origins is very different, Its like a dream come true. This game feels like a true RPG now. So much things to do and good story direction. Voice acting is best so far. I can see team at U have learnt a lot from games like Witcher and Fallout and Skyrim. Things are so enjoyable in this game. Only thing that worries me is the CPU utilisation the game hits. I have a i7 6700k and it stays 90 percent. Im a bit worried about that. The gameplay is so fun and not easy anymore. There are level based combat mechanics, skills and enemies. The world is so lovely and beautiful to explore. The game is filled with secrets and so much more.
