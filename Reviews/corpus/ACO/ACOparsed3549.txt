I have enjoyed this game for more than 30 hours until I have reached Aya Blade of the Godess. Title crashed when Ive reached the very top where the fire is. A soldier attacked me and then the title crashed. After watching a youtube video this is the place where the save occurs and then the cinematic is played. I have restarted the game and found myself inside the tower but unable to move. No controls were working. I had to AltF4 to adress this. When going back in the game I was placed in a different location outside of the tower at the base of a ramp leading to the tower. All objectives appear to be completed and if I attmpt to climb the tower when I reach the very upper parts, Aya stops responding to controls. Ubisoft Support told me that this is addressed in the next patch. They could not confirm whether my progression will be lost or not. I spent money on this game and now Im stuck...
