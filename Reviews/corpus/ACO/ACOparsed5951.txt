The last AC I truly enjoyed was the second. Once the series became annualized, it never felt the same to me. Ive tried almost every entry since but none have stuck, except for maybe Black Flag, which enthralled me for a short while due to the setting.I cant say Origins is the best game since AC II quite yet, Im still only 8 or so hours in afterall, but no game in the series since has grabbed me as much as this has. Its gorgeous, Im enjoying the more thoughtful quests from both a story and gameplay perspective, the improved combat is very fun play on hard!, and the countless other changes both large and small really make this game feel fresh.So far, so very good.
