For the first 1h this game is visually stunning due to the setting. After 1h1m of playing the story/gameplay/challenges feel so uninspired. Feels like the developers knew what would be interesting to put into the game, but didnt take the time to do anything with it.This is very evident in chariot races. Something that got me excited after being somewhat uninterested in playing for 3 hours. The animations, system, and rewards all are complete letdowns. Save yourself 60 dollars, if you havent played Witcher 3, go do that.
