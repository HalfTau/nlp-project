Had no expectations, wasnt planning on purchasing this game. This game is right there with Black Flag. Easily tied for being the best AC game. The world design is next level awsome. I get caught in moments just staring at the surroundings around me. The new combat isnt a huge improvement but it does change the pace a bit.
