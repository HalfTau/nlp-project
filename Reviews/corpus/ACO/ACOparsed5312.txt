Assassins Creed Origins feels incredible. The new combat system makes it feel like a completely different game and much more involved then simply waiting to press a button and kill over 100 enemies. Also the world must be the biggest world ive ever explored in a game, there are pretty big regions to explore. Also the game looks AMAZING! You may worry about your pc, but its not a big problem. All in all probably the best ac game ever!
