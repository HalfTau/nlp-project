Game itself put simply, if you liked prior ac games youre like this. Its more of what you love in a setting we waited years for and its all done really well. The new leveling system and witcher style exploration on a huge map is yet to get dull. However if i must find a criticism im not really a fan of the dark souls style combat system but that said it is done well. Story and Characters are well written and engaging and i find bayek on par with the likes of Ezio and Edward so far.Playing on a Ryzen 3 1200 overclocked to 3.7 mhz with a GTX 1050 ti so entry level rig. Most of my settings are on very high with few maxed out with average frame rate of 45 at 1080p which isnt too bad for game like this. Put simply coming from xbox one to pc with this being my first AAA pc game Im happy with the settings im using and the frame rate. The processor seems to be the choke point with this so something with a little more power could easily hit 60 at 1080p maybe even 4k. End of the day its still a massive improvement on console versions despite the questionable optimization and antipiracy.
