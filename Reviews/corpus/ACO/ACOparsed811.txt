I dont understand how Ubisoft gets away with testing one set of chip sets. Intel is great however so is AMD. To completely remove and not support a chipset that is still used in the gaming world. Im off ubisoft completely. Steam should pay more care to all there user before selling a product that cant be used by all its players.AMD Phem ii x6 1090TMSI 890GXDDR 3 16 Gigs of RAMAMD Radeon R9 390How is that not able to play this game.
