Beautiful game. I could roam the streets of Florence forever. Climbing Il Duomo and La Campanile for the breathtaking views and figuring out the way up. Collecting pieces of The Truth. Rearranging the map pieces at the Villa. The exhilaration of spotting that elusive feather in broad daylight. And taking the Leap of Faith off the tallest tower one can find.
