I will not be purchasing any more of the Assasins Creed games for the PC.In order to play this, you must run UPLAY another Steam clone, produced by Ubisoft at the same time as Steam. Although I could live with that, whats worse is that the keyboard controls are awkward as hell. Atop that, when I attempted to use my Razer Onza Tournament Edition in order to play comfortably, it mapped the buttons incorrectly, AND didnt recognize either trigger.I emplore you, do not purchase this on PC. Get an XBOX if you really want to play this game that badly, because youll not enjoy it for PC.
