!!!PCVERSION!!!50 bugs the action button is a big problem, climbing an ordeal and fighting does not feel organic, etc, 25 design flaws unclimbable walls you could obviously climb, interface mishap meaning you only get to see those strangely designed buttons and no assigned key which makes interaction complicated, assasinations do not work as they were intended to work most of the time, etc. and 25 it is an okay game which brings my total up to 3/10. I do not understand the hype with that game  maybe the third part will promise improvement cause I got a great deal on a bundle. Well... Ill see!
