One of the greatest games I ever played. Great storyline Ezzio 5, Desmond and stuff was interesting only in the very end, fantastic gameplay yes, Bbatman, you have to learn a thing or 2 from this game, visuals  ok. Youll visit lots of cool places and very extravagant one in the very finale. I strongly recommend you all to play in this marvelous art work! 9.5 / 10!
