is an parkour beatem up adventure game. Escaping from Abstergo Industries and joining a crew of Assassins, Desmond relives the life of another ancestor, Ezio Auditore, an Assassin from Renaissance Italy who sought to avenge his familys murder at the hands of Templars while uncovering a conspiracy of his own. This game builds on what made the firsta success, while introducing a new climbing and combat mechanics. Although less numerous, cities are larger and taller than ever before, gaining access to new areas almost up until the endgame. You have a home base, Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, in which you can invest to get recurring ingame revenue. The story is interesting and intriguing, and missions are less rinse  repeat than the previous game. Although the graphics are some years old, they still hold as ok by todays standards. There is very little development with the overarching plot that made Desmond travel back to Altars and Ezios memories in the first place. If you invest early enough in Villa Auditore, money becomes trivial quickly, making sidequests like races and assassination contracts pointless, and you will make little to no use of the items you get from collecting feathers. Fighting can get somewhat repetitive, and lategame bosses pose no more challenges in a fight than the average guard, albeit taking more strikes to get rid of. There are no random events, so you will pretty much fasttravel all the time as soon as youve been to a region once.   Next on your list!Overall, this game is a good followup to its predecessor, finishing on a cliffhanger much like the first game. It remains nonetheless a satisfying playthrough, and Ill recommend it to anyone who havent already played the sequels.
