You cant escape it. This game will easily suck days of your life away before it becomes boring. However, the only reason it becomes boring is because you feel invincible once you become practiced enough at the motions of fighting, and everyone knows how boring godmode can become before long. Great storyline, acceptable cliffhanger at the end with plenty of closer for one and plenty of opening suspense for another. Simply can not wait for the next.Oh, and you get a renaissance pistol.
