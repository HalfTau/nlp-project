With multiple glitches, odd design choices and poor controls, its a wonder Ubisoft was able to get this off the ground, let alone the plethora of lazy sequels. Having to deal with the headache that is Uplay paled in comparison to this. Rose tinted glasses are a real thing, and I cannot recommend you buy this game.
