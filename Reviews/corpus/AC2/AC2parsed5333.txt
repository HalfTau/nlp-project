The problem with the first Assassin Creed was that it ing sucked huge You did the same three tasks over and over until you wanted to blow your brains out. Then the controls were god awful because your stupidcharacter would jump where the  he felt like was a good spot, which is typically into some area that leads to his death. Anyways, they luckily fixed those problems in this game and actually made a pretty decent game this time. The environments are huge, the missions are much more detailed and varied, and the game is pretty damn fun to kill people. Yeah, and this is a ing Ubisoft game too..
