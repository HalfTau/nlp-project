Didnt play it, couldnt play it. Uplay is terrible. Have to sign up for 2 different accounts just to start the game. Im sure the game is great, AC games get great reviews. But this port, with Uplay and steam is terrible. I wish there was a disclamer in the steam store that said in GIANT letters. Needs some stupid other program to even have a chance of running
