In the AC series I have played AC 1, AC 3, Blackflag, and Syndicate. I picked this up because many loyal fans claim this and brotherhood are the best in the series. In 2015 the game holds up fairly well in my opinion. It controls more like an RPG game than a third person action game. The story is engaging to this point and while many of the crafting and customization options are not there, I am enjoying my time with it. I know the controls are controversial but IMO they hold up fine and if you think of it as RPG controls rather than action game controls I think it helps.
