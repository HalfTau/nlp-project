If you are having problems launching the game make sure that you download the lastest UPLAY from Ubisoft and hopefully it should work, the version of UPLay that comes with the game is defunct. Also I found that the Steam Key didnt copy and paste so I had to type it in.Graphics are pretty good for an old game excluding the cutscenes which are pretty awful. Gameplay is ok but what I dont like is the whole premise of the Knight Templars are evil conspirators trying to take over the world plotline sorry I think it is just really lame.Secondly the game is acted out through genetic memories so I could have forgiven the aforementioned had it been a more coherent plot and story but its just silly and I felt no empathy for the characters especially considering that you are a glorified murderer.
