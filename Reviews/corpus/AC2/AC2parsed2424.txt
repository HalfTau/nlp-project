First of all, you usually get moves explained by symbols foot, left hand, right hand, locked face etc. On a PC this means that at the beginning you will have to switch A LOT to the Key bindings and find out what they mean. BTW. forget to use the mouse in the options menue because this doesnt work at all.....use 2key and 3key. I played it on a Playstation and it was pretty smooth, but on it is a total mess......you just feel that it was not meant to be played on PC and the porting is a disaster.
