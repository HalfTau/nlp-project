The first part of Ezio trilogy which bumps it up quickly. This is the kind of game you are always happy to get back to and which stays in your memories forever. Story, characters, atmosphere, environment.. EVERYTHING is on point and all of it make it so deeply settled inside my heart. Would recommend playing definitely./ PROS the story characters environment architecture, people.. atmosphere music playing, costumes.. improvement from the first AC game the perfect start to the Ezio trilogy/ CONS controlleroriented game GUI is not showing up keyboard keys but controller buttons other than that, none
