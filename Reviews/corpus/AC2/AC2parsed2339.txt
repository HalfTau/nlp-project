Assassins Creed 2!!ProsGameplay is fun and simple more variety of missions, weapons and outfits addedStory is interesting and continues from where number 1 left off.Graphics are pretty decent some of the models faces are a bit poor though.Voice acting is greatConsLike most assassins creed games and like all platformers it does suffer with repetitivenessI felt the ending of the game was poor.Have to sign up to ubisofts crappy clone like version of steam  yay.....Also... it does provide controller support but the buttons are messed up, patches can be found on the forums that will fix this issue.Overall a very good game and major improvements made from the the first in the series7/10
