NOTICE Dont judge me on the hours made on pc. I have possibly 80 on PS3 where i used to play it since the very release. NOTICEAssassins Creed ll, A monster game from 2009, picked the story up where AC1 left it. In comparison with AC1, AC2 made some great changes. AC2 Included a more thrilling storyline and more simplefeatures which AC1 should have had. AC1 was very linear and couldnt take me in to the story really. The gameplay has been improved since there are more things to do, examples Beatup missions, assassination missions etc. In my opinion this will deliver you some more gaming hours, besides freeroaming in the 15th century of Italy you can play the side missions. Two reasons to not rush the game with main missions only.This will take me to the next point, after getting all stuff you actually can get, completed all missions side missions too the game will be boringbased on my experience, of course you can freeroam like I mentioned before but for some reason I dont like it much if I know there is nothing to do after freeroaming gets boring. Replay is able, since I bought it for pc too. kinda crazy but hey!AC2 does not include multiplayer. Maybe a bad point about the game, but I never cared much about the mp of a AC game since I didnt like the PvP setting. Like AC Unity will include I prefer cop mode, to fight with each other against the enemy. Actually ironic that the story gives you the experience to raise a brotherhood and the multiplayer wants you to finish each other off.ConclusionAC2 is a must own, story will keeps you busy for roughly 7 hours, but I advise you guys to explore the world, get the feathers and extra stuff to collect, take the time to enjoy the game which is a rare thing actually isnt common anymore.And for the people who prefer history games... This one even gives you info about buildings, people and other stuff from that period. Take care!
