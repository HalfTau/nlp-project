Really enjoyed this game on 360 all those years ago. Thought I would replay it for nostalgis sake. Now dont get me wrong, the game runs really well and looks pretty good considering its age. But after about 810 hours into the game Uplay rammed its ugly head in and has caused my save games to be lost. Not sure why, but it didme off and for that its getting a negative review.
