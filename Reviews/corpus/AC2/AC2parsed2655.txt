Its a lot better game than AC1, but its still one of the 5 most frustrating games Ive ever played. Ive punched my desk and cursed like a sailor  Ezio tends to make stupid things occasionally, with tragic effect.7/10 for me beautiful cities full of activities plot of the game connected to history shops with armors, weapons and all kinds of stuff medicine to stock autosaves in the middle of the missions better control on protagonist than in AC1  hes not a block of wood now soundtrack in general you can run and kill all those stupid archers Ezio better freerunning than in AC1 but still Ezio sometimes decides to do some idiotic things like jump all the way down when youre in the middle of the platform sequence this one ing song named The Vault  Ive rushed through most of the game, until I had to collect codex pages, then I stopped and decided to make all sidequests, viewpoints etc., my main quest at that moment was collect codex pages and I guess creators of the game connected that one song to this quest and I had to listen to THIS ING SONG for 15 hours, over and over again, with little brakes all Italians speaking English with some Italian words, it seems so false and unnatural that keeps you from feeling like this is more than just a stupid game acctualy it just screams Im just a stupid game all the time, ruins immersion the whole animus idea Desmond no difficulty settings stupid weapon change system in villa I just killed you, lets have a long conversation cant skip cutscenes even when watched 2nd time and even when it comes to Villa cutscenes, like with Da Vinci frustrating fighting system you can win all fights just by pressing X repeatedly you are taught about all these fighting techniques counterattack, dodge, disarm etc. but when it comes to the battle and when 5 people attacks you in the same time, you have no chance of remembering about some stupid disarm interacting with things while chasing people posters of Ezio placed on towers, high buildings  who the hell looks there?! hilarious cutscenes with paralyzed protagonist
