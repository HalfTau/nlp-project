Decently fun game, with a level of polish thats expected of a AAA game. Gets kinda tedious and repetitive around the middle, where the parkour and the collectibles and the similar missions started to wear on me. Still, I would recommend having a taste of at least 1 AC gametheyre all more or less the same anyway, and AC2the fan favourite.
