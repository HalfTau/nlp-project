One of the strongest entries in the series and effectively the first in the series since it started the trend of being more action than stealth oriented that the rest of the series became.  Replayable story with tons of collectables to find and pseudo history that is rooted in real events, events that helped me pass a european history exam in high school btw.  No real reason to not play this game if youre even slightly interested in the action adventure genre this encompasses.
