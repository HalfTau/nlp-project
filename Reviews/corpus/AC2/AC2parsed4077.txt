Going off my knowledge of the other Assassins creed games, I imagine that this game is terrific. Although I will likely never find out, due to this gaes cooperation with the Uplay system, because of this the Uplay launcher crashes everytime the game opens making it impossible to play the game, even though the game needs no use of Uplay whatsoever. unless this problem is fixed preferably with the extinction of Uplay altogether I can not see anyway of being able to play the game at all.Rant complete.
