In my opinion this is the best assassins creed game of them all. The happy feeling you get when you run around in renesance italy, the sad feeling when you see what Ezio has gotten through. This is a game I really recommend good story, side missions, great graphics, italian, and awesome fighting moves XD10/10NooBi Union
