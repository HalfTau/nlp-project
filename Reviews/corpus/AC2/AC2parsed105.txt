Love this game. One of the best in the Assassins Creed series honestly. With good story development and a decent sized open world to go with it. I would pick it up for sure but if you can get the bundle with AC brotherhood and AC Revelations do it because Ezios story is throughout all three games in case you lived under a rock or something.
