To the pointPositive nice story with great historical elements particulary lovely music Italy is looking good, I like the architectural reference to the original buildings great mood very good performance detail is ok, no game crashesNegative controls and manovering is the most illogical Ive ever seen fighting system ditto AI is preposterous uPlay  all the way through is a piece of junk made by incompetent team errors, update  patch problems, issues with account settings bonus Auditore tomb is not worth points whatsoever. Dont.Get.It.Ever. A waste of time and your nerves. camera view is sometimes even more illogical than controls, especially during tomb explorations with timer Faulty tip system  buttons are sometimes wrongly described and/or not mentioned at all. A great deal of controling during fight you must figure out by yourself. horse running looks particulary hilarious Jolly Jumper mode on P ruffian groups to hire are idiots wanted posters... hung on the height of the second or third floor, five metres above the street level... Seriously?
