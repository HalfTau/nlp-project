This is one of my favorite games of all time.  Was able to get it for 5 and was very worth it.  If you are debating on whether to purchase or not, without question you should.  Great story line, fun and exciting missions, and just and overall great experience.One con for me is the camera view changes during some certain areas such as jumping backwards.  For me it took sometime to get used to but nothing that is a deal breaker.Overall 910 for me.  Thanks for reading.
