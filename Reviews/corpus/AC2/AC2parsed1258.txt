For an older game it still lives up to modern games. The story is emotional, you learn a bit of crappy italian. You see history, revenge, death. I played the other AC Assassins Creed games, I finished this game on my Playstation I know, but I joined the PC master race. I still had to get used to the controls I played too much Unity before this.Yet the most important thing of all...Kick people in the 10/10
