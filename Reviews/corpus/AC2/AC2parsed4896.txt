Still the best in the franchize. I can praise Altair and AC3s improved gameplay, Haytham and a terrific story to the end of time, but this  the origin of Ezio  it is the basis, the cornerstone of AC games. Want to try them  this is where you should start.UPD 11/2017. Four new games were released since this review  nope, this one still beats them all.
