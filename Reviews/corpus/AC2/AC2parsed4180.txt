Coming from the excitement of the first Assassins Creed when it launched, this was a huge letdown.The visuals looked less realistic, the story was more boring, the gameplay felt more actiony, less stealthy, more based on capitalism than immersive assassinations. Now I know quite a number of people wouldnt agree with me but I consider them to be more action prone, less the type who immerses himself in the world, the role he is playing as a character and enjoying the build up that leads to an assassination. In the first one you could spend many side missions to learn more about your victim which to me was an amazing and fun mechanic, the more I put into the game, the more I knew about my target and how best to deal with it. It was incredibly satisfying and rewarding when you performed everything flawlessly and ended up with a stealthy assassination, rather than just barging in like a barbarian on crack to hack and slash everyone.If you want action, get this game, if you want to be an assassin get the first one.
