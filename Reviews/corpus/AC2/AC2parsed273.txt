In my humble opinion this is one of the best Assassin creed, if not maybe the best, everything about this game is excellent, excellent story, excellent graphics, excellent puzzles, excellent characters, and the list goes on.You get to play as Ezio Auditore, who was born in the city of Florence in Italy, walk in the footsteps of some of the greatest minds of renaissance Italy, such as Leonardo da vinci, the Medicis family, you get to witness first hand the struggle for power between the pope and the various Italian families that made their fortunes from trading spice and silk with the Ottoman empire and visit all those amazing cities such as Florence and Venise, all renderd with a lot of attention to detail and historical exactitude, truly an Amazing experience.
