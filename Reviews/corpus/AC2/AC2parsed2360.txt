What can I say? I was urged to get this game when it was on sale because it is the best Assassins Creed game yet, and I was not disappointed. This was an awesome game with a great story and impressive graphics for a game made in 2009. I loved walking around and having the option to do what I want, when I want to. The freerunning is awesome and Leonardo da Vinci is more than willing to help you become more and more lethal. I dont like some of the main missions, though, and I thought that some of the objectives were kind of boring at times. Also, the combat was kind of disappointing after a while because it just felt so repetitive. Thats just some constructive critisism, however. I think this game is more than worth the regular price let alone a sale price!
