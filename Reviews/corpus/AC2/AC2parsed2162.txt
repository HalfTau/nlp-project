Now there is nothing new for me to say about this game,all the things that this game has done poorly as well as the ones that it did well have been pointed out on several occasions.So, im just going to tell you my overall opinion It was legen wait for it..... DARYAt some points the game was giving you annoying errands where you were just running back and forth around Italy,and thatme off, so yes the game is repetetive all you are really doing is killing a bunch of people then going to the next city, repeat.Overall its a great game and i think you should buy it.
