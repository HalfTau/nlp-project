One of my alltime favorites. Its open world at its best, a time and place fully realized down to the details a la Red Dead Redemption. What makes this game work so well is that its setting is such a compelling one. Ive played many of the other AC games. None of the other historic settings have worked quite as well as Renaissance Italy does for this game. Its a combination of memorable cities to inhabit like Venice and Florence, colorful characters, and a feeling that this particular time and place is both unique and important. All the famous buildings that you would go to see on an expensive vacation are recreated here fully climbable of course. The music is inspired and really sets the tone for the game.As in any AC game the gameplay is fun if a bit repetitive. To me AC games are setting first, gameplay second. The gameplay is just to give you something to do as you explore the world.Even after five years the game still looks great on a PC with graphics maxed out.
