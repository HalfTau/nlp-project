Assassins Creed II continues the story of Desmond Miles as he now trains to become a modern day Assassin. To do this, he will live the life of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezios story is one filled with loss and revenge as he takes on the Templar Order. This is a direct sequel to the original Assasins Creed and greatly improves on the existing mechanics. Each assassination takes a unique approach as you learn new skills and use more tools. All of these new mechanics are greatly integrated into the overall story as we see Exio grow up and become a Master Assassin. The Deluxe Edition includes two lost sequences that fill in a time gap from the original game, definitely worth playing. Great controls and smooth performance, although the graphics are outdated these days.
