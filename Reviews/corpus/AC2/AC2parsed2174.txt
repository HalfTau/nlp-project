I enjoy this game, but I am not recommending because Ubisoft MAKES you create a uPlay account, or they wont let you play the game. You cannot play without one. This is a new form of extortion that a lot of corporations and institutions are doing these days in order to profit off of making our lives more difficult and complicated, inch by inch.So  you, ubisoft. I dont need to create an account if I have already PAID YOU MONEY. I owe you NOTHING MORE than that money. Now those pigs have my email address.That being said, I did make an account in order to play. Now Ive forgotten my password because I dont give aabout it, and I cant play. So Im pretty annoyed.IT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THAT.Other notes....The story is certainly epicmeaning longbut it isnt very good. Pretty predictable, and filled with simple and obvious characters. The exploration is what I value this game for. Unfortunately, you have to progress in the boringstory in order to unlock new areas of the map. Pretty annoying. But its often beautiful to look at and explore. A good distraction. Sequences and events get repetitive very quickly, but theres a hell of a lot of time to be used in this game.
