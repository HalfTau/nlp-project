Assassins Creed 2 further polishes what Assassins Creed started. Removing the linear preparation and focusing more heavily on story helped meld this series away from a prep, stab, rinse, repeat to a much more enjoyable Im doing this because I have to story. FreeRunning is improved, voice acting is superb, beating out the rigid acting of Altair.It is definitely a worthy successor that while doesnt change the formula up too much, still provides enough new to the table to justify its price and the time commitment.
