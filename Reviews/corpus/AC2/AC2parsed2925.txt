Its still the best Assassins Creed as of the time of writing this reviewBlack Flag comes in close.ProsProduction design feels authentic.An epic story of Ezio the assassin sprawling almost 34 decades.Although it hardly matters now .....but the improvements it brought to the original were ineffable.Pitch perfect pacing of campaign.Mission variety.Plenty of side activities.Each city has its own unique feel.Strong supporting characters.ConsIts animations do feel a little old now.Score9.5/10Must buy and must play!
