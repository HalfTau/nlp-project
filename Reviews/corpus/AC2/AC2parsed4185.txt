Great graphics, especially for its era. Performancewise its excellent too, very well optimised.Varied missions that arent repetitive you never know what youll be doing next and it will always be fun and awesome. You could be soaring across the city with a makeshift hang glider or playing games in Carnivale with a golden mask on.Beautiful locations, such as Venice, Florence and other such italian renaissance places.Stunningly beautiful overall style. The overall style of the game is so good, just look at Ezios robe below. In my opinion thats the best robe in the entire AC series, elegant and majestic as . Not to mention the UI is smooth and simple while the menus are all red and white to match the theme, theyre smooth and well done.By far the best in the series, followed by Black Flag. I enjoyed playing Assassins Creed 2 on a level Ive experienced with very few games and it is a memorable experience that I will never forget. Here are some good pointsEvery character you meet will feel like an entirely different person that youll never forget. Quirky Leonardo and his eagerness towards inventions. The sultry yet toughasnails Caterina Sforza. Bartolomeo and his trusty greatsword Bianca, and of course the cocky yet ever gentlemanly Ezio Auditore himself.If I had to give it any criticism it would be that the button prompts are all symbols instead of letters, so you have to learn what symbol means what key. For example, the red leg button means Shift, the yellow head means E and the blue dagger means the Left Mouse ButtonBut once you get used to that its all good, and other than that I dont really have any other big criticisms. Go play it, its the best in the series by far and its not an experience youll regret. Its fun and the storyline is both encapsulating and intriguing.
