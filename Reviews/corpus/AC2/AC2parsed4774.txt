A massive improvement over the first game, AC2 improves upon the original in every possible way story, gameplay, characters, setting, and more. Renaissance Italy is full of fun and violence, and this game brings you right into the middle of both. The silly future/present day storyline continues, but thankfully it takes a backseat most of the time and lets you stay with Ezio one of my favorite player characters of recent years. Theres a ton of content here, the combat is greatly improved, there is less tedium like the sidemissions in the first game and more murdering to do, and all taking place in some massive and beautiful locations. If I had to say negative stuff and I do, its that the villa management stuff is rather annoying and the platforming dungeons can, at times, be extremely frustrating. This is a gaming experience of high quality.
