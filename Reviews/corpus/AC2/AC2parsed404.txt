Never played any of the AC series before so I went online to check which ones had the best reviews to buy on the sales last week. AC II was the one I started with but the controls seem sooo weird.. They seem like they were made for a console maybe xbox and then transferred really poorly to PC. Ill try to memorise them and play the game cause it seems really promising but it still is frustrating!
