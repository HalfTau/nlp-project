If Tenchu Stealth Assassin and Grand Theft Auto had a baby and bought it a Matrix onsie, this would be the outcome.You need to learn how to become an Assassin and you only have a couple of days to do it! So they load you up into the memories of a 15th century Florentine noble man who you guessed it, learnt to become an Assassin. In a Matrix type state you become Ezio Auditore.Game play is set up in a similar way to how Grand Theft Auto is   you can free travel around beautiful Renaissance Italian cities and in those cities along side the main story are tasks / races / fights etc that you complete when and if you want you just head to the map marker.The graphics still compete with newer games and play is smooth and glitch free. Beautiful backdrops and story rich with a great soundtrack. In short, this game is frickin awesome. Buy this game... Then cancel all your plans and call in sick to work.P.S. If you open the game and your controller isnt registering, all you have to do is download new drivers and copy them into the steam game folder. This link shows you how to do it
