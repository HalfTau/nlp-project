Awesome! Easily tops the original for creating new options for gameplay, modifiable inventory, weapons, and items. Graphics are improved just so noticeably from the original, but dont wear too much on fps which is nice. There are new ways to blend in with crowds and avoid the AI... however, on that note, the AI combat and awareness is only just barely improved from the original Assasins Creed. This game still scores very high in my list of singleplayer games. You can easily spend hours playing in this sequel, thanks to new added modes in the explore style of the game, which differ from the original.
