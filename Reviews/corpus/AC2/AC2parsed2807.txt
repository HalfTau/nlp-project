This game is a pain on Mac. From the default setting of 800x600 that makes launching the first time a headache, it also fails to recognise most keyboards on Yosemite and, Ive heard, many earlier versions of OSX. Marketing this game as playable on Mac is infuriatingly obtuse and quite frankly inaccurate in the extreme. Ill continue searching for a fix for the keyboard issue but as of yet, I havent managed to get past Desmond, we need to go! because I cant move.
