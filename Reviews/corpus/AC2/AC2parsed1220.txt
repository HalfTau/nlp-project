Great story, immersive world and quite impressive graphics  these three make AC2 an awesome game, overall, and I dare to say even the best from the entire AC series. Even though Im not a big fan of Ubisoft and their work, I find this game a special snowflake out there. Being historically inaccurate may be one of the very few cons for the game, but at the same time it can be a pro, a tone of creativity, an interesting way to see history from another perspective, even though its fictional and fanciful, especially in the end of the story. That stuff at the end really made a mess in my brain, but I respect that Ubisoft tries to play with the history and human beliefs in this manner... Afterall, the gameplay matters a lot more, and this makes AC2 a game not just worth playing, but even mandatory for those who consider themselves true gamers.
