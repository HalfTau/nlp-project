 First things first, Ezio is the best Assassin ever Sad but nice story Revenge Perfectly showing the beauty of Bella Italia Firenze, Toskana etc. Smooth Fighting System Currency ingame Buying stuff etc. Not only Swords as Melee Weapons Many ways to eliminate targets Known real life person included ingame D.V Cute girls prost. as allies for distracting enemies Able to learn a little bit italian Game is showing Icons instead the keys to press for the actions. This makes you learn the controls a bit hard. No nudes The second Assassins Creed game improve so much things from the first one. Well made story with awesome characters,beautiful world set in rennaissance Italy in cities like Firenze Florence, Venice and Rome. Advanced fighting mechanics. Awesome atmosphere with the dynamic weather. Information about buildings, historical characters from the game are always shown. Visuals, storyline, characters, sound and music is on point!This game is a masterpiece. I could tell more about this game, but I recommend looking in it by yourselves.
