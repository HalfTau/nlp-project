Great game, exactly like I remember it when I played it on the PS3 but now I can play it with better graphics settings thanks to the PC. Game runs smooth and fluid with no issues. For everybody I was one with uPlay issues, just download uplay off of the uplay website and not through the installer for the game and it should work, at least it did for me. What a piece of art, 10/10
