I have no idea how this is considered The best Assassins Creed game and A Masterpiece While the control scheme and combat are fine, identicle to Assassins creed I, every thing else is really unpleasent. The cities are samey and they twist and turn with no logic. The side missions are useless, Ezio will often get too excited and jump off buildings, grab onto boxes and generally make your life unpleasent. The crowning acheivment of pain is the story. There is no real direction, years pass for no reason, Ezio is likeable enough but most everyone else is just boring. This would be fine if the story ended when it should. There is a point where you have a boss fight and a Wizard of Oz moment and you are here, and YOU are here and you... Then it keeps going. You go save a town that you have not been in at all, as a favor for a person you met once. Then once thats done you go to ANOTHER town and have a whole slew of people to kill. It. Doesnt. End. If the gameplay was good enough and enjoyable the long story would be great, but Assassins Creed I gameplay is only good for about 9 sequences, after that, it loses most of the charm it had. If you like Assassins creed a lot it may be worth getting, but for a new comer, or someone who likes the newer Assassins creed, its not worth it.
