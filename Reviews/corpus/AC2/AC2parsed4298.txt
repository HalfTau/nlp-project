Assassins Creed II is a major and indepth stepup from the first game. The nonsensical hackandslash has given way to a faster, more controllable and ultimately deadlier combat style. The so called stealth missions of AC I where you could kill an entire army in the city square and then stealthily assassinate your target that was covering nearby have given way to a game style where, if you so choose, you can actually play as a stealthy assassin. Guards continue to be impressively stupid and shortsighted but their AI has been increased significantly and they act more reasonably and faster, adding a bit of extra realism. The blending feature, the game economy, the rebuilding of Monteriggioni, the purpose of having something other to do than just kill people all add to the depth of the game.Lastly  I will mention the story. A deep, gripping, emotional story of loss and tragedy, beautifully woven from two brothers contesting in rooftop races to the evolution of a master assassin. You feel like you are fighting for something, that you are connected to the game world and that you want to do anything in your power to keep your family safe and your enemies at bay.Cherries on top  better controls, side missions that are more manageable in size and do not distract from the game and an awesome rendition of major 15th century renaissance Italy cities.
