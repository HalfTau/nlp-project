I had lots and lots of fun playing this game. Its not perfect, but what is?PROS Ezios journey. I cared about what happened, even if the story wasnt such a revelation to me personally. It worked like a charm on Win10 with my controller. No technical problems at all, no Uplay problems either. It has tons of fun stuff to do. Very differentiated quests mostly killing, but fun!. YMMV on this, but its an easy game. I dont like to stress too much over games, and it was ok for me. Collecting things makes sense, they are relevant to the story. Double air assassinations never get old.CONS Towards the end, the story took over and the gameplay was a bit mechanical. Too many timed quests and close shave at that for my taste. If I wanted to constantly worry about the clock ticking, I would be a track athlete. Video audio was not synchronized in many of the cut scenes. Guards can be annoyingly stupid, blind and deaf. Ezio has a ladder fetish. No, really, just walk by them and he gets an urge to climb. Jumps and reaches have game logic. 2 meters away, if the game needs it? No problem. 40 cm if the developers didnt want it that way? Nope.This was my first AC game, and now Im itching to play all of them.P.S. English with an accent character speaks his native language, will never be not hilariously funny to the rest of us.
