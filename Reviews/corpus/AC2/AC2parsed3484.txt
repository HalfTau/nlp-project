Do I recommend the game Yes  on any other platform. Yall, please dont play this stuff on a PC or Mac. So...I love this game and have it on my xbox. So since Im away for college I thought I would just get it on here and have it on my mac instead of taking my xbox with me. HORRIBLE IDEA. It will not launch no matter what.The first times I got it on the mac side of my computer  UPLAY did not like my mac. After DAYS of trying to figure out what was wrong with it, I just decided to succumb to windows and install it on bootcamp  Since my college gives Windows 8.1 Pro to me for free woot woot!!...long story short, I cant play it on bootcamp either.Thank Gwad I got this on sale! I do not see myself buying any other Ubisoft game that FORCES people to install YET ANOTHER software just to launch the damn game  and even after doing all that the game WONT EVEN LAUNCH.STAY AWAY FROM UBISOFT and excuse me while I go get a Valium UDONTPlay is getting on my nerves!BTW The hours I have on records are of me TRYING to figure out what was wrong while the UPlay Launcher was running after Steam triggered it....SO steam wont stop counting time until the process Uplay is terminated  if steam launches it, of course.
