It was the first and last Assassins Creed game that added something new that made it worth to play. Having played the first, third, fourth... and then I dont know how many fing games they made but Black Flag  AC3 as well. Going off track, but for me this game was the first and last Assassins Creed game ever made.If you liked the never Assassins Creed games, good on you, you have sh!t taste in video games.If you have not played any Assassinc Creed games ever, buy this off or on sale I dont really care. It really is worth playing.
