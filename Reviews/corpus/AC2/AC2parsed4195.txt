I couldnt even get this game to work, let alone review the content. After going through the pains of setting up a Uplay account and linking it to the game, having it crash every single time I loaded it, I finally got it to open. It froze, wouldnt recognize my mouse, and made it impossible to select anything from a menu by having the selector constantly move downward. And it still sometimes crashes when I try to open it. I dont know how it works on Windows I am running OS X Mavericks, but I would not recommend this game to any Mac user.
