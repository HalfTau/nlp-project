This game made me play it through 7 times before I got bored...     And thats something!In my opinion the controls have improved from AC 1 a lot.Beautiful landscapes, great story, loads of stuff to do, just great!It has lots of historical characters and eventsOh and Uncle Mario is awesome.Yes, it says my playtime is 1 hour. Now go  yourself, I played it on the xbox long before I discovered steam. Thanks.
