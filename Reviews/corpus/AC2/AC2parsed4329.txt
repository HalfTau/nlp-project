What a fantastic game! This was the first game of the series I have bought or played, and wow I love it. The main storyline is pretty fun, the side missions you can do for extra money are plentiful if somewhat familiar after a while, and Ezio is just a bad a. Great graphics and music, plenty of weapons and upgrades to choose from, and some great free running puzzles. A really fun, immersive game. I have heard this is the best game in the series, and I could see why.Some negatives cant replay main missions, which is sad since they are, in my opinion, the most fun I did not really feel extremely motivated to complete side missions. Money was always plentiful enough to get much of what you wanted, and some side missions where kind of dull. But maybe thats not such a bad thing, since this way you do not have to complete them to grind for money. this game did not make me a bad a in real life. It should have a disclaimer or something. somewhat repetitive and tedious at times. Things can become veeeery familiar.Overall Id give this a 8.5/10. Definitely worth buying and playing at least once, especially since if you wait you can ge it for 5 bucks during steam sales.Note Use a controller. The controls are not entirely PC friendly. Youll get the hang of them eventually, but a controller is much much easier and less frustrating.
