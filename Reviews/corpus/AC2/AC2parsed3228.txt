I told myself i would buy this game. even tho i got rid of it on my 360. i preordred it in 2009 and got the black ezio ediiton. i still have the statue in the box. but not the game. and i saw it on steam and put it on my wishlist. so today was finnaly the day i got around to playing again, after not able to play the game for nearly 3 years, when i first got the game i was into it so so much. i wasted my whole life on it. because of how the game was created how the story was. how everything  was detailed.Free RoamOpen WorldA story of a child who grows up to be an assassinHow it has such amazing character designsThe graphic was good when the game first came out. but now you compare to other creed games, its not that great. but its still an enjoyable game.The game has many weapons and armors to buy.Maybe some parts of the game are repeative, eg looting, same combat, but you learn more combats as you pogress through the story, but its still enjoyable until you finish the game.Its one of the best assassins creed game created, i dont care if you think im wrong or not this is my own review and opinion.The game is set in italy and you get to travel almost the major city of italy.You can pickpocket! !But i know this doesnt says much about the game, its just what iv experienced playing over maybe 1000 hours on the 360, its one of the best assassins creed game! and i recommend it to everyone who loves free roam, open world with amazing set in old days countryside, city and it has such amazing music aswell!
