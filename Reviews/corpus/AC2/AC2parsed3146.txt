AC2 is easily the best Assassins Creed game ever. It has a balanced combat system, beautiful graphics, but more importantly, it has a character you identify with right from the start. It doesnt have a 6 sequence long training, Im looking at you 3. but instead you learn on the job, and you learn it naturally. You can really identify with  Ezio throughout the game you complete missions for reasons other than There is a marker on the minimap.  Granted, there are the side quests, but for the most part the missions contribute to the story.Overall, if you are new to the Assassins Creed franchise, I highly reccommend you start here.If you have played other games in the series, then you should really check this one out.
