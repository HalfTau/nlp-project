An amazing story following Desmond Miles and his ancestor, Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. This game is the second chapter to Desmonds adventure of the hunt for the pieces of eden and the temple. Following to the escape of the Abstergo Industries, Desmond and Lucy manage to escape to a warehouse where the other modern assassins are hanging out. With the new and updated Animus, as Rebecca explains, Animus 2.0, Desmond is set to explore his italian ancestor in the late 1400s to learn from him. In Assassins Creed 2, Ezio, the protagonist, is a charming young man with desire for revenge. After the occurance of his father and two brothers death, Ezio builds a strong hatred towards the ones he thought were friends. With his fathers Assassin robes and a note written to him about the world of Assassins and their goals, Ezio begins  his quest to hunt down every man responsible for the execution of his father. With those responsible dead, Ezio learns more and more of his enemies and the reason behind everything that ever was and ever will be.I suggest playing this game first if you want to play his trilogy, as there are 3 games to Ezios life.
