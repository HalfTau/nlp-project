i expected this game to be fun and exciting and full of action. It ended up full of boring puzzles and very few action task, not to mention sometimes its really frustrated running after people who you dont even bother to and dizzy camera and camera shots. the free run can get sometimes annoying when youre not using game pad. I personally do not use game pad so i use my keyboard instead and its really annoying free run on keyboard. This gives me a headache every time i play and a hot head as well
