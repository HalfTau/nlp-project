So my story with the Assassins Creed franshise is that I have started with Assassins Creed Revelations to Assassins Creed 3 to Assassins Creed Black Flag then Unity and then Assassins Creed II. And Honestly I enjoyed the Ezio Auditore Saga than the other Assassins Creed games. What Assassins Creed II offers is that it is an open world game with around 46 cities to go to in the 15th century Italy. The age of the Renaissance. This game offers one of the greatest cast in an Assassins Creed game waay before Black Flag. You get to meet Leonardo Da Vinci, the Pope and Machiavelli. The details in the cities is so good even though this game was around 79 years ago. It is so impressive to see the landmarks that the cities had to offer. Now the important things that I look for in games is the display, the gameplay and the customization. The graphics are okay for a 2009 game, the colours are vibrant and they look really great. In terms of gameplay it seems it takes more time to defeat and enemy than the current Assassins Creed games from Brotherhood  AC4 even though Assassins Creed Unitys combat is much more complex. But it seems a little more easier still. Customization is a little lacking, but you do get a couple of costumes in the game which is an awesome thing as well. The length of the story is so much longer if you want a story driven game that makes you connect more with Ezio and the other characters as well. Theres not much more to say about this game but I highly reccomend this game as it is one of the best ones in the franchise. This game deserves a 9/10
