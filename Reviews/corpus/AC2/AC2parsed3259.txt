Assassins Creed 2 puts you into the shoes of Ezio Auditore, an ambitious and charismatic character that feels very much alive. The story and flow of the game works perfectly and gets better and better, the beginning being one of my favorite intros in games. Although on the other hand the ending seemed really the story could have ended in so many better ways, yet we are given with a big surprise and the biggest mind in history. Although much respect for the game we are also complimented by beautiful music, that fits carefully with the game. The world is huge and massive and the game takes quite long to finish, around a 20 hour storyline purely main quests. Overall the game starts brilliantly, and progresses on, and ends ily. 9/10
