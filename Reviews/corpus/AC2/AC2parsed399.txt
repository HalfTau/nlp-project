I enjoyed this one a lot.  There was plenty of variety with the missions, locations and puzzles.  The Italian Renaissance setting was awesome, and I thought the voice acting was very well done.  Using real historical characters, cities, architecture and art created a very immersive atmosphere and educated at the same time.  A definite step up from the first one although I dont remember AC1 that well.There are no dialog options, and the only progression elements are better weapons/armor/items and more money, so this is not an RPG.  Its more like a thirdperson action/puzzle game with a good story and a great setting.There were some wtf?/really? moments but overall a great game.  Highly recommended.  9/10
