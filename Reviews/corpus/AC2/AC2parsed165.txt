This is not the first time that Ive played the game but this however is the first time Ive finished it, beginning through end and it is a damn masterpiece. I can see why this game is regarded by most AC fans as the best one in the franchise, personally I havent finished other AC games but from the ones Ive also played this truly is damn impressive. The story is well written, and will grab your attention for sure. My only gripe is the controls, they can sometimes be clunky Im using an xbox 360 controller BTW, nothing is more infuriating than falling out of a building while youre trying to escape guards. The combat system is also pretty good but can be repetitive. One thing to note is that this game was released in 2009, and its graphics may not hold up to most peoples preference and may be a dealbreaker for them. Thats all subjective though.If youre getting this one, buying ACBrotherhood is a must because this one has an open ended ending.Nothing is true, everything is permitted.Requiescat in pace.
