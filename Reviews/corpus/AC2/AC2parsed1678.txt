Ive played all the Assassins Creed up to Unity, and let me just say that this game is very much worth it, Id get it even if it was 50 or more, because thats how much its worth. Assassins Creed II doesnt just give you an amazing impact on both story and gameplay, but it also sharpens your mind. Thats if youre like me and try to become a true Assassin and plan your attacks and improvise to the environment like a true Assassin. I see Assassins Creed as a really violent jigsaw puzzle, the way how you plan to take down your enemy without being seen. Ive been introduced to Assassins Creed in the most uncommon way. I started out on Assassins Creed II Discorvery for the Nintendo DS. After the 2D climbing and assassinations, I merged onto Assassins Creed III, not knowing anything at all. Ill admit I wasnt too good at the game due to me being very young and not caring about anything. But over time I learned to master all the essentials making all my Assassinations and plans much easier, Assassins Creed 1 and 2 REALLY helped with that. I HIGHLY reccommend this game to all who wish to become a true Assassin, and to have a blast of their lives.Final Verdict 8.7/10 Very good game. Worth replaying.
