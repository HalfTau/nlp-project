One of the best ACT games Ive ever played.Actualy, for some reasons I never played AC series before and I bought AC 2 and AC 3 some days ago. Although its a game 3 years ago but its still beyond many many ACT games nowadays. Graphics is good, plot is long enough and attractive, combat process is fun, riddles are not very difficult to solve, and the exlporation process of assassin tombs reminds me of my  happy memory of Tomb Raider series. Besides these, AC 2 provides many side quests for you to complete, and gathering part such as treasure boxes and feather, etc. of the game is much less boring than many games because you can climb or jump beween buildings, which entertains me a lot.Althougn I havent finished this game yet 85 completion, I cant wait to recommend this game for who havent played it, and Im looking forward to playing AC 3 after I finish 100 completion of this game, and if AC 3 can still give me the same or more fun, I wont hesitate to buy AC 4.
