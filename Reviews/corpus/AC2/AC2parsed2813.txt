Reasons for liking the game1. Has amazing graphics.2. Smooth animations3. Great story lineReasons for NOT liking the game1. Doesnt provide a  tutorial for the keybinds  Showing the gamer that he must press an icon which a new gamer doesnt know which key represents this icon makes the game fuzzy and confiousing.2. Doesnt provide any option with different levels of difficulty. Not all gamers have the same abilities.3. If you fail any trial, the scene of taking you back to the beginning with all of this full lightness cyberspace is something that is annoying to the eyes. And I dont see any reason of why you cant skip some trials.4. The gui for the game options while it looks futuristic and modern it is uncomfortable and gives the sense that it takes too much time to complete an action like finding the options to change the keybinds.
