Much better game than the first in the series. Interesting characters, missions. I was motivated to collect eg. all feathers, it was so heartwarming moment when i collected all. Sometimes i was struggling with climbing/parkouring but maybe because i used keyboard, no controller or im just weak at this or Ezio just went crazy idk.I highly recommend this game! Enjoyed every moment of it.
