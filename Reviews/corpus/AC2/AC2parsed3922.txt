I felt kinda meh about the whole thing. Its like... I get it, I can parkour on old buildings. The combat portion of the game is pretty lame in my opinion. Like, all you have to do is counter attack everybody with your hidden blade thing and everybody dies. I wasnt too excited about the story either. Its basically historical fan fiction where the guys OTP is Leonardo Davinci and his OC, but they never get it on because they didnt want to disappoint their senpai, the guy who gives the age rating for games.
