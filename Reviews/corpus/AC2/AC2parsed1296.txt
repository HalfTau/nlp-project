Probably the best part of the whole franchise in the sense that it brought the most meaningful innovations and improvements that the following games did not, except for AC IV which had pretty good ship combat and did the whole pirate theme very well.Otherwise than that it is assassins creed with all its ups and downs, although it is set in the renaissance Italy, which is probaby the best setting so far.Very solid game usually it is cheap when the sales hit so deffinetely worth the money, solid 7,5/10 as of the day of the writting.Written on 28/11/2016
