This program works fine for the first 25, starts to occasionally crash after that and at about the 60 point it crashes and corrupts your game save so you have to start the entire game over again.  I checked online and that is a common problem that no one at Uplay wants to deal with or respond to,   There are many Mac and PC users with the same issue and all with different OS versions.  My computer is top end everything so it is not a hardware issue.  AC 4 and 5 work fine, Tomb Raider also.  Be wary of Creed 2 for the Mac/PC.Game crashes right after the stage coach ride avoiding flaming arrows and killing soldiers in the town you jump off the coach at.  I do a quick hunt for gold around the houses and both times it crashes right there.Played the new versions which made me want to try the older versions.  Big Mistake.
