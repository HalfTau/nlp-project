The story of Ezios life begins here. This game have so epic storyline sequel that i just cant get enough of it. This with Brotherhood and Revelations are best Assassins games so far. You bassically live entire Ezios life from moment when he is born to the moment of his death in Revelations. There is no doubt if you like storyline games especially sequels this is the game you need to get.Assassin Creed games after Revelations are just wrong, from ac1 to revelations is timeline which just continue, the sucky thing in newer AC games is that the Desmond dies imagine that lol and just not worth getting.But let it go, we are talking about AC 2 now, so yes grab it ASAP you wont regret it.
