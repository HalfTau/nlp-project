One of the most graphically impressive lastgen games out there, garbage gameplay. Unintuitive controls, braindead fighting, easy missions leading up to a frustrating 9 missions that can easily be cheesed against the developers intentions, and a decent final level. The plot hinges on alot of unfulfilled promise and little actual substance, and every character is a bland nothing or an eccentric stereotype.Also theres EA origins I guess some people will have a problem with that too
