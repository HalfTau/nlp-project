No crouch/sneak/stealth button?  That alone is a deal breaker for me.  My character automatically enters stealth mode when I enter some bushes but in order to get from one patch of bushes to the next...he stands STRAIGHT UP, walks to the next patch of bushes and then goes back into stealth?!  Just dumb.The fighting mechanics are no good either.  Glad I got this game on super sale.
