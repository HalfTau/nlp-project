The game has similar great setting as the first part, but does much more right. If you like the series you cant miss this games. The gameplay varies much more, the characters are more interesting, and even in 2014 the game looks good. The double drm with steam and uplay is less annoying than expected. Anybody should enjoy this great classic!
