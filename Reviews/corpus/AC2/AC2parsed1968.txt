Assassins Creed II. 8/10What a beauty this game is. How many hours Ive spent exploring the world with my hidden blade and seemingly never ending climbing stamina. The hours spent trying to pick pocket every merchant in town without getting caught. The perfect assassination, stealthy, a quick blade in the crowd, and then disappear before anyone is any wiser.Yes... it is a great game.Yes it is a frustrating game.Because, lets face it. This game was designed for console. Theres no arguing with that. With its stupid rotating camera.Oh Im sorry, did you want to continue jumping straight ahead? Well I rotated the camera, so what was straight ahead is now right and you just jumped off a cliff!Fortunately though these moments are few in the total game experience however they do chip away at the perfect 10 that this game couldve been.The other thing that annoys me is that Im forced to play as the other guy... you know... the guy in the machine... I dont want to play that story line. Im happy playing as Ezio. Im happy in Venice. Please dont force me to play two games in one. And for gods sake... please... please pleasepleasepleasepleasplease make an update for the game so you can skip through the endless droning. Again, great, some people want to play that but those who dont cant even skip through it.So again, that brings the score down from the perfect 10.But its still an 8 for me so yay!
