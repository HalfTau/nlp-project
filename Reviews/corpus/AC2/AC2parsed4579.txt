This game is stuffed to the brim with random pointless things it really wants you to do without giving any reason to ever do it, while the core mechanics are deeply flawed, annoying and just plain unfun. This controls horribly on PC, you might often find yourself getting frustrated with just trying to jump off a railing into a street and run along it, while Ezio will repeatedly jump across to some other perch or try to run up every wall and cling to every little thing when you need to hurry somewhere. You also use the same button to grip stuff and let go, how stupid is that?There dont seem to be any engaging missions in the story, its usually something completely trivial, sometimes forcing you to utilize a mechanic you wouldnt otherwise even remember exists, and usually requiring you to do some navigation over the same old boring identical rooftops or streets. Combat is easily cheesable and tedious either way, stealth is disfunctional, climbing is too clingy and unreliable at the same time.I honestly enjoyed the first one much, much more. I would recommend this one only if you are genuinely a fan of the renaissance Italy setting, which I personally am not. Although if you are interested in the overall story of the series, you might have to play through this one anyways.
