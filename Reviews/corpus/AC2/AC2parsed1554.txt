 Very good, long story Old game but still very much playable today Variety in cities, a lot to explore 72 viewpoints Historical information and accuracy A lot to collect Renovating Monteriggioni is nice, good incentive to get money Graphics are very nice but not stunning Smooth gameplay, sometimes bit awkward No one kill chain combos Only one enemy attacks at a time No difficulty selection No big fights
