Dont bother buying this game, as youll be lucky if youll actually be able to play it. Both Steam customer support and Uplay customer support pass the buck when you explain the game wont start on Windows 7 and Windows 10, an issue that has been documented by a plethora of people in the forums. Unfortunately for me, none of the workarounds actually worked.Youre better off downloading it for free from somewhere else. At least then you might be able to play it.
