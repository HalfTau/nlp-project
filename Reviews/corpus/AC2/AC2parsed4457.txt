Finally got around to playing this in depth after some starting and stopping. I really love the period so getting to roam through Florence and Tuscany during the Renaissance is an incredible experience. The combat is what it is as its largely you waiting for countering opportunities but there are a variety of moves you start and continue to accrue. Graphics can show their age as they werent amazing for the time but its immersive and seemingly historically accurate. The tasks can get a bit repetitive but you can always just delve into the story and lore a bit since theres a ton of history to read about. Definitely recomend if you have played another game in the series or are even looking for a good starting point.
