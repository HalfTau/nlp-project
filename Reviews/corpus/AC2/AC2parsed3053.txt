Assasins creed is a fun game at first. I didnt work up the strength to finish it had me yawning at the end, Manage to get 75 through the game and lost my save with a computer failure. I wonder what I missed. Since this game didnt pull me back to finish it, i guess it was sorta crappy and lonely iin the single player world so lonely. 6/10 I cannot reccomend this unfortuanatley it bores me.
