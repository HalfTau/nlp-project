Although Assassins Creed 2 dates back to 2010 and some people may find the outdated graphics and such offputting, I have to say this game still amazes me today, alongside Skyrim.The storyline and side quests provided substantial game time which I thoroughy enjoyed. Even after completing all of these missions there is still plenty to do for those who want to 100 the game, such as locating treasure, exploring tombs and solving glyph puzzles. As the storyline progresses, so does time which provides availability to new areas and technology, which I found a logical way to unlock better equipment and gear rather than being granted availability from getting good.Although I mostly love the game, there are admittedly negatives that did make the gameplay a little bit unenjoyable at times. The game is played in third person which I dont have a problem with but there are certain points during a parkour sequence where the camera will either look from a really obscure angle so that it made me unsure with which direction I should go to move forward to reach the next point in a sequence, or the camera will suddenly change position and make me suddenly move in the wrong direction. I also found a lot of the time while freerunning I thought, I didnt want to do that. For instance, theres a Borgia messenger Im chasing down on the rooftops and instead of leaping to the next building, I dive into a conveniently placed haystack below. Nice. There is also a very annoying game breaking bug I unforunately stumbled across. Just a little warning DO NOT RETURN THE 100TH FEATHER WHILE WEARING THE ALTAIR OUTFIT GIVEN VIA ONE OF THE UPLAY REWARDS. YOU WILL HAVE TO RESTART THE GAME ALL OVER AGAIN. I found this one out the hard way.Other than this, I didnt encounter many other important problems, and overall for a 2010 game, this is fantastic.And another little note for players, when you arrive in Venice, be ready to give your mate a hug once the tour has concluded
