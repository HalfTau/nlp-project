Just finished it and it was EPIC! The game takes you to renaisance Italy duh, where you go and slaughter templars who conspire against everyone again and kill a part of your family, revenge time. The graphics are great, the scenery is marvelous, you can upgrade your armor and weapons, whitch is nice, and the storyline is worth every euro Ive spend on it. 10/10 would buy and play again. Onward to Brotherhood!
