I spent way too much time getting money in this game. Ended with 400k florins and nothing to buy anymore. Good game, but its the easiest to break the economy in. Dunno if I liked it more than Brotherhood. Lots of stabbing and climbing, like every AC game, but you probably know that already. So, 2 hidden blades outta 2. Or something.
