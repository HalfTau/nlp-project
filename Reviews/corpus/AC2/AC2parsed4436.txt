I would write a review for this game, if only I could play it. I purchased it to play on my mac yeah yeah I know real gamers dont use macs. I downloaded the game, but when I go to play it, the ubisoft launcher does not work, and so it does not launch.I have tried deleting the launcher and redownloading it, but it is impossible to download the launcher onto a mac. After looking thoroughly through different forums, I have come to the conclusion that ubisoft either does not care about any of its consumers, or, at least, that it does not care about mac users. It is completely impossible for me to play this game. I am sure this is a great game, but it is 100 ruined by the fact that ubisoft, and uplay specifically, does not care about their players. If you are planning on playing this game on a mac, DO NOT BUY IT. You will not be able to play this game, and you will have wasted 20 dollars.
