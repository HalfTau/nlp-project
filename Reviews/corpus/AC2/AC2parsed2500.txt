This game is absolutely delicious. Getting my controller to be detected properly and setting up uplay were real pains but its a small price to pay.The freeclimbing parkouris extremely well implemented and youll probably only die twice from Ezio not snapping to the right surface. The amount of stuff to actually do is ridiculous but youll likely have a blast with each of the different activities. Additionally, you get to manage your own villa and upgrade it, which increases the income you receive from it. If the climbing mechanics look good to you, or the history part seems good, Id advise you to get it.Oh yeah, and uplay withholds a small dungeon from you but you can easily look up how to get it.
