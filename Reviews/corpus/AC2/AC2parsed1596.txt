If youre a Mac user I would avoid purchasing this game.When trying to launch the game I got the message Unable to access the Internet. Please verify connection . This was despite having a perfectly healthily connection. I did an online troubleshoot and found this to be a common issue for Steam Mac users but I was unable to find a solid solution.I tried to get a refund from Steam but was sent an  obviously automated response saying I was unable to receive one because my game play exceeded 2 hours.I submitted a new refund request stating that even though my profile displayed 5 hours  game play usage, in actual fact I had never been successful in even launching the game, let alone play it. At this point I tried to compromise with Steam by suggesting that money back into my wallet would be a suffice outcome for me.I received exactly the same automated message from Steam 2 days later stating I was unable to receive a refund because of over usage. At this point I gave up.I have to say I feel pretty cheated and wont be singing Steams praises any time soon.
