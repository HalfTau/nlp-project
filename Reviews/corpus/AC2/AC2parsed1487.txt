Love the game, have played thru it several times now. Enjoy the story, and ubi fixed the repetitiveness that the first one had. While yes you are assassinating people, each one is a different challenge. I know some have had issues with this working on more modern PCs but I have had no issue on my AMD machine running windows 10.
