What can you say? This game was the reason I loved the series so much. I played the whole game through and found all of collectibles. I got it on sale and felt like a kid again playing the series for the first time. There are now some graphical improvement mods floating around that make this game look more current, but it still hasnt aged poorly. 19 is a little steep for a 2010 game, but its an instant buy for me on sale.
