I really recommend playing this if you liked the first one. The story is much better and there are so many things to do. The characters are great, and the citys feel very natural as well. The new notoirety system is cool, and so are the platforming puzzles in the assassin tombs. The game looks amazing and detailed, and everything is made more fluid. The fighting system is waaay better, but keyboard controls REALLY suck, just use your xbox controller though, and everything will be fine. Overall a really good experience and therefore rating 8.5/10.
