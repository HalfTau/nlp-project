Three out of five stars. The mechanics are so pleasing, the soundtack is timeless, the story is usually a delight, and the graphics are oh so lovely. There are a lot of infuriatingly game breaking glitches but theyre usually overshadowed by the games atmosphere and the ease with which you find yourself immersed in it. The only thing as glaring as the gltiches however, is the condescending tone of the game designers. While the first games arrogance came with a cute sense of naivete this title has a tendancy to drag its nose on the ceiling. It brandishes childish psychology as though its making a grand statement and, at times, that really overshadows the very postitive notes being made by both the writing and gameplay. This experience is often a good time but the flaws will leave as big of an impression as most of the games good moments.
