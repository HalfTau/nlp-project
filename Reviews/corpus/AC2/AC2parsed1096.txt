After playing this game to completion for the first time, it became very obvious to me as to why everyone said Ezio was their favorite assassin, because he became my favorite as well. The story in this game kept me enthralled the entire time and the characters made the expirence all the more noteworthy. While the game still suffers from movement mechanic issues that still plague the series to this day, this game is well worth the price.
