This tale of young ezio bring so much memories back when i beat this game on xbox...The music is just grand, gameplay brought the series to a whole new level.Way better than its ancestor Assassins Creed.Controls on PC take a little getting used to, but you can always change your bindings.A part of my heart belongs to this series, and half of that part belongs to Assassins Creed 2...This is a MUST buy.
