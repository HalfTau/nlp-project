Assassins Creed 2 is great game with interesting story. Gamplay is a good improvement over the first Assassins Creed.  With the addition of nonlinear story quests, which was a problem with Assassins Creed prievously. If you like a game where you can staby, staby, killy, killy of everyone I recommend it.9/10
