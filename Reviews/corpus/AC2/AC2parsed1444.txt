I realized way too late that I was playing by addiction and boredom rather than amusement. Repetitive as hell ironic how I dove in directly on the second installment of the series exactly because of the criticism of the repetitive and boredom inducing gameplay mechanics inherent to the first one. Nevertheless, the story was really cool and interesting and kept me going way better than the actual gameplay. One must admit that fighting side by side with Niccol Machiavelli is entertaining by itself, not to mention the beautiful recreation of Renaissance Italy.However.The ending.What a crappy ending.I do not grasped even the slighest curiosity to know how the hell they developed the plot from there, and problably will never care to discover.Oh, I almost forgot Uplay. Yeah.
