For me this was the true start of the Assassins Creed franchise, with the original game being more of a proof of concept. I very much enjoyed the improvements over its predecessor and it set the scene for the next two titles with some pretty strong storytelling. Now that i have mentioned the story let me say that the whole animus/current day storyline does tie the games together with a bit more meaning they were to me at least completely throw away and i believe i would have enjoyed them all the same withouttldr    better than the first, with even better to come7/10  would requiescat in pace again
