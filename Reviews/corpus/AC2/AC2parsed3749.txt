AssassinsCreed 2 is a game full of content being story , side missions , etc but its immense share of design flaws makes it feel inferior to its console counterparts.Dont get me wrong butAC2 on PC graphics wise is through the roof when it comes to its console counterparts.The story is far better than AC3for sure  brotherhood.The beautiful recreations of some of the most beautiful cities in the world and their landmarks make you feel like visiting them in real life.Plenty of sidemissions.Ezio as a character is more relatable then all those silent protagonists that we see in games all around.Each assassination feels fresh and newnot like in AC1 if you know what im saying.You define how your target will die and you can roleplay it and be an assassinin your virtual lifeButlike i said where there a good there a ugly sideSome parkour sections feel like they were designed for joystick instead of Keyboard and mouse.The keys that shows you what actions you do are nothing but cryptic images appearing in your HUD. You hv to go in control section and figure out each one of them.Unlike consoles you cant map your weapons according to your prefference.Either way i give this game a solid A .
