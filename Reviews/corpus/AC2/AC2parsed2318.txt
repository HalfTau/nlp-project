I wanted to play this game for my first time, i was so hyped cuz i started the series of AC and then uplay.... Uplay crashed always at the beginning of the registration/login. It nerves...and its t cuz i wanna play a singleplayer game called Assassins Creed 2 and not when....but when u want to run the app first it shows u Uplay launcher who is always crashing ...Would appreciate when Ubisoft take away this ing Uplay.. thx for readingYours,Martin
