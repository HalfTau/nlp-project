Probably my first and last Assassins Creed game. There isnt much to say about this game. The gameplay is terrible, the story aweful.While the beginning can actually be quite pleasant, the game long overstays its welcome. The last part is a slug full of insipide filler missions and leading to an overwhelmingly disappointing ending.The controller support is shameful. Dont even consider playing the game with anything else than the 360 controller. Any other controller will involve spending an inordinate amount of time fiddling with Steam controller remaping options and yes that includes the xbox one controller.Avoid.
