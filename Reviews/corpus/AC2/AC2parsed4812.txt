When it runs smoothly and doesnt shove story missions in your face its excellent fun. Large numbers of enemies to fight and areas to explore. Engaging and challenging, without drowning you in objectives or equipment as later games in the series do.Clear improvement over the first game, although the new main character takes some getting used to.However, at other times itll demand you complete some boring story mission or worse flying mission, filled with annoying prerequisites and arbitrary stealth sections, which have instafail conditions.Takes a bit of hardware to run smoothly  the freerunning will have you tearing your hair out if it lags.
