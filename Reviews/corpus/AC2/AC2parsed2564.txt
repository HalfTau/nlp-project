It really would be good, except for the fact that it doesnt ing give you a key binding tutorial. It literally says Press Picture of foot to run.Well, I shouldnt have to tab out every five seconds in order to ing see the bindings.Also, This is aport as the buttons are clearly from the xbox. For example, there was this one key that was literally bound to, and I quote, Button 1. ThanksExcept WHAT THE  IS BUTTON 1?Very swift refund. Honestly, if youre going to play it, just get this game on the Xbox or such.
