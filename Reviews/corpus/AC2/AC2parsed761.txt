Something is wrong with this game when it comes to saving.  Ive lost data twice over the weekend.  Uplay or Steam needs a better cloud cause Im able to do it with any other game besides this PoS.  Extremethat I wasted money and time just to play a game from the start everytime I play it. Last time I buy something from steam, cant even trust it to make a local save either.
