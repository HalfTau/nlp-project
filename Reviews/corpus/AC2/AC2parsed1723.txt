This game will keep you busy for hours. Even longer if you go for the feathers and other side quests or just like parkour. If youve ever wanted to throw people off of tall buildings and then watch as people crowd around the body in both amazement and shock, this is your game. If youve never wanted to do any of that, then whats wrong with you? Kidding. Seriously, get this game, you wont regret it.9/10
