Short version AWESOME GAME, HORRIBLE CONTROLS.As I said, GREAT game but the PC port is quite terrible if you ask me. Im new to the Assassins Creed series and when the game began and started to refer to the coloured buttons on the Xbox control I got so confused. Espacially as some are on the mouse and some are on the keyboard. Very confusing to say the least so I eventually bought an Xbox 360 wired gamepad to use which solved that problem.But instead I lost preision which by my experience made Ezio jump all around and never in the direction I intended. Free run made him grab on to anything that he got close to and sometimes his movement froze in battle which made me absolutely loose it P Towards the end of the game I got so furious everytime I began to play that I actually have marks in my desk from the controller P Maybe Im just an horrible AC player but I had some real gameplay issues but I still recommend the game for the awesome story and great characters. A little boring that it didnt take longer to restore the Villa thus making me not haveing to care about money at all. At this point I was not even half way through the game.
