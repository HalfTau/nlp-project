Good game, much improved on the first game. The story is interesting, gameplay is solid, and the sidequests dont feel as repetitive as the first Assassins Creed. The environments are nicer too, with each town having a different flavor. Would definitely recommend.One thing to note though is, if you dont close uPlay after quitting the game, Steam still records the hours as if you are actually in game. Hence why I have 60 hours on record when I actually played about 3540 hours.
