Although still tedious at times, ACII improves many of the areas I had a problem with in ACI. I enjoy the combat more, the cityscapes are more varied and tons more exciting to climb than endless fields of sandstone, and the story is richer and much more immersive.For a brutal FPS player such as myself, the AC franchise all similar stealth games really have posed a hard time with sneaking and hiding instead of just taking a warhammer and banging the bad guys out, but at least in the sequel we have kind of different missions and varied sidemissions to help with the sometimes tedious business.I enjoyed the story more than of its predecessor, but Im still not really a big fan of cutscenes, especially if they are long and unavoidable. Due to having betterdriven goals and a richer exposure to the background of everything happening, they dont bother as much.Generally a recommended gaming experience  there are some good views and the overall production value is good, but it is far below my top10 or even top20 lists.
