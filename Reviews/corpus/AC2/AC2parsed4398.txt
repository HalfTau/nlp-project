Where do I start... where do I.. o I know!This game is amazing!This is the first game that I have played out of the Assassins Creed series.At first it was hard to get into the story , but after 12 hours of playing the game , you get in to the story line.I wont spoil anything , but I will say some things about the story like exposition and background.You are Desmond the real life dude from the last game , and this time you go back to Italy to the 15th century and playing as the person named Ezio who sucked into the assassins world after something wrong happened cause of the templars.In the game there are some characters from the history always better to learn something when you play a video game...One of the only problems in the games is the Dont get detected missions , there are some gamers like me that will hate this missions when you fail 10 times... but it is ok if you are a stealth lover.Score sectionGFX  7/10   The GFX is good for the time the game was released , now it is a bit Old but looking fine.Voices  9/10Gameplay  810Storyline  9/10Score  8.25This is a great game, every one should play at least one game of the Assassins Creed series.
