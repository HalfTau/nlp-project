Loved this game on the Xbox360 and saw it was on sale so snapped it up.After 21 hours, my pc crashed during saving. Now my save game is completely corrupted and the useless UPlay cloud backup did nothing to fix it!!!Probably wont play this again for a while was nearing the end of the game too.Id only recommend this game if you are able to pick it up on sale and if you make sure you disable cloud backups on UPlay as they are redundant.Otherwise stay away for the sake of your sanity.....
