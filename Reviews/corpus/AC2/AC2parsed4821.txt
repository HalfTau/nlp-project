Can still call this the best Assassins Creed game to date. Its the start to one of the best characterdriven franchises ever.But this game in specific  it feels like a fresh start from the original Assassins Creed, in terms of the character.. It retains most of the gameplay elements from the previous game, only outright improved.You start off completely unaware of the Brotherhood, you go along a few nice and simple side missions, to get to know how the game works and handles. And from there on, with a game changing event, you get thrown into this world, one which you were completely unaware of.The gameplay is fun, albeit easy, in the sense that you can overcome most dangers. Missions are fun and creative, and very few of them feel like the same thing. The environment is outstanding and the soundtrack is one of the best. No matter how many Assassins Creed games come up, I recommend you start with this one, if youre new to the franchise..
