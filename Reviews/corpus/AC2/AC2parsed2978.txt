It breaks the redundancy that AC I was noted for. It adds various levels of customization. The maps are impressively large and the level of detail is astonishing. I feel more connected to Ezio Auditore than I ever did with Altair. The other characters make the game help with the whole experience. All in all this is the game in the whole series that will get you hooked on Assassins Creed.
