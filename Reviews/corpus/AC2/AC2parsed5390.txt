If you enjoy stealthy killer games youll love this as you play as a guy who is very boring so he pretends to be his assassin ancestor Ezio Auditore in a virtual reality thingy machine because Ezio is cooler than the bland dude and gets all the ladies.As the boring Desmond guy as Ezio you wander around and climb stuff in various places in Renaissance Italy in broad day light alot of the time even though you are supposed to be assassinating people with stealth. You are also able to blend in with others even though you are the only one wearing a hood and have weapons and armour hanging off you, ooh... and a nice little cape.But putting all its little flaws aside this game is pretty epic. Ezio looks cool though a bit silly in some ways, has cool killer moves and more moves than Altair, can swim unlike Altair and has a bigger variety of weapons than Altair. There is also many side missions and lots of stuff to collect aswell as the main story.
