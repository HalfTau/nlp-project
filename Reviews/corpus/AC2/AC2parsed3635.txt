Another Xbox 360 repurchase.This is still the best Assassins Creed game, particularly because it is the least glitchy and the progression is the most rewarding. Ezio is also still the best written character in the series.I find this runs better than on consoles in general. Apart from one glitch I never encountered before.I like the time period. I like the weapons, the art, the culture, the history.This marked THE high point in everything Ubisoft, in my opinion.
