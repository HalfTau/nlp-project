I bought this game for 8.69 yestarday, now dont get me wrong i dont hate the game, i havent even played it yet. So why the thumbs down? well specifically because of when i installed the game and clicked play it came up with Ubisoft launcher and said that i need a CD key or an Activation Key to access my bought games. The account is linked to my main email and i can access the email account fine. It give me a prompt that my account has been registered in the email letter but no activation or cd code ive looked every where tryed to find out where it might be but its not in my sent emails for my account kinda a shame because i wanted to try out the game and play it.
