A great combination of stealth, action, and openworld gameplay. You take control of Ezio, via the ANIMUS system, in 1470 AD in Florence, Italy, engaged in a millenialong struggle between templars and assassins.The combat works well, and is best when you go for counter kills and disarming opponents. Mercenaries, thieves and s are at your disposal to distract city guards. Much of the game is spent scaling buildings and leaping across rooftops.Learning the controls can take some time, and straight fighting sequences often tied to escort missions can be a chore. However, most missions are rewarding, varied and well designed. There are tons of collectables, upgrades, and places to find. Plus, this deluxe version includes extra DLC released on consoles. With only a few flaws this is one of the highlights of the AC franchise and of openworld games in general.
