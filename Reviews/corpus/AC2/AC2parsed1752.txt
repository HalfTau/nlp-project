Dont you just love it when you play a game for 40 hours, and then when youre about to 100 complete it, a game breaking bug makes your save entirely unplayable? thats what happened to me with this one. still, overall, a positive experience, and a very good game when things work properly. lots of bugs for a game that was released so long ago. youd think they would fix them at some point but i guess not. only a few game breakers though. my reccomendation is not to bother collecting the feathers thats where i found the game breaker mentioned above and watch out for infinite guards.
