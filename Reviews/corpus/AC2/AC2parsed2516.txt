After playing the first game till my fingertips were plain from clicking, there was a relief in playing the secong game in the title.Awesome as it is, there is one major drawback  it is the only game in the series where you can not replay main missions. I would really love to replay some Venice flying or carriage riding along with Leonardo.Comparing to the previous title, the game added a lot of diversityLoved by many, this is the game you should play to experience the story and progress of an Assassin.
