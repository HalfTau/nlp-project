After playing both Assassins Creed III and IV I decided to go back to what is known as the Assassins Creedfranchises best game. I had played a little bit of Assassins Creed II earlier, but I got bored pretty fast because all I wanted to do was to run around killing guards. When I fired the game up again 1 year later, my goal was to finish the game without losing interest. And thanks to Ubisofts amazing story and interesting setting I did just that. When the end credits rolled I had one thought This was a damn good game!You play as Desmon Miles, a bartender who in the first game was kidnapped by Abstergo Industries to explore the life of Altair IbnLaAhad, Desmonds ancestor. In the sequel you have escaped Abstergo and seek to train to become the ultimate Assassin by visiting another ancestor, the Italian Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. Though Desmond you follow Ezio on his quest for revenge upon the ones who betrayed him. You visit four beautiful cities that you can explore as much as you want to, and there are tons of side activities if you somehow get tired of playing the incredible story.For a 2009 game, the visuals are still a joy to look at, especially at the highest settings at 1080p, but the game is nowhere near as beautiful as Crysis 3 or Battlefield 4. The gameplay is also great. Its a bit more challenging that the newer games, but that is not a bad thing. After playing a lot of Assassins Creed III and IV it was refreshing with a more difficult experience.Assassins Creed II is definitely the best game in the franchise. The story is gripping, the protagonist is interesting and the setting is full of good experiences and fun side activities. You absolutely have to pick this game up during the steam sales where the price drops down to 2.50 or your local equivalent, but the game is worth it at full price as well. Highly recommended!
