Assassins Creed 2 is a truly marvelous game that recreates the 15th century Italy down to the finest detail. The world feels alive and immersive and its hard not to completely get sucked into it. Running on the rooftops of Florence and Venice is an unforgettable experience. Sure the controls can be frustrating if you are using MouseKeyboard, but the story and characters are stunning. Graphics are good too... until you get up close! D 09/10
