A very human main character and an exceptionally strong story make ACII quite remarkable. Exploring Florence and Venice is also a great delight and a visual feast. Overall, there is a good 30 hours of topnotch assassinations, intrigue, and exploration. Add in the fun metaplot about mysterious symbols and powers and you have a winning combination.There are two main downsides. First, theres the repetitive nature of the exploring, unlocking viewpoints, and notoriety system. The repetitive nature perhaps indicates the game is a bit too long, with too many similar missions that could have been trimmed to tighten up the flow of the game. Secondly, the combat system is a boring affair, with overly long kill animations and dumb AI that waits its turn to die.Overall, theres a reason why people say ACII is the best of the series. It is a wonderfully realized sequel worthy of praise. Running around rooftops slicing criminals up is always fun, in the game too.
