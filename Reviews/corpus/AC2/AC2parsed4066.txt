Yes! Cant say bigger yes than for AC2. Its a prefect game based mostly on story, but the story is so great and overworked I cant even tell. First time I was like ... Man I dont know... But it was great 26 hour gameplay. I dont regret it and I heartly recomend this Game cause Nothing is real. Everything is permitted. AC2 3
