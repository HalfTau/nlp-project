The game was good, but no longer works for Mac.if you are a mac user, you will be throwing your money away. UBISoft is not responsive to this problem.I do not recommend purchasing this game of you are a Mac user.update I have opened a bug with Ubisoft, and its gone full cycle. They have confirmed that this product does not work, and is not supported on the current Mac OS.Quote from the ticket Because this is an older game and on a MAC the OS must be either 10.5 or 10.6 as it would have difficulties trying to launch on the new OS. I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.
