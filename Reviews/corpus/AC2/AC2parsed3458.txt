Assassins Creed 2 is pretty buono.I cant tell how it stacks up to the first Assassins Creed title Hense I skipped it, even though I wish I didnt But its a very good title on its own. Although, it definitely shows its age for being a 5 year old title.The gameplay is pretty fun, although moving around is sometimes a hastle. Near the middle of the game, the B button is bound to the same button that you also fall with, it takes a while to get used to, but it works after you get the hang of it. The combat is also very tedious.The graphics, well, they are certainly aged. I played the game with SweetFX enabled though, and it looked alot better than being washed out.Story side, ACII is very amusing. I wouldnt say its one of my favorite video game storylines, but its pretty interesting to follow. Sadly its one of those games that manages to confuse you, alot.The only problem I really had was the sluggish pacing. The game starts out well, then just becomes very slow. Sequence 5 onwards, however, are fantastic. But then there is, without spoiling anything, a backtracking segment near the end. Its kind of a poor way to end it, but the outcome is worth every minute.Overall, id give this game a 9/10
