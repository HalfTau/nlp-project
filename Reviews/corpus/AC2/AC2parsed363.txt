Solid entry in AC franchise. Its heavy debated as the best game of the series but if your like me and prefer a game encourages exploration well AC 4 takes that title easily. Never mind that. The game has a solid story, Ezio is defintely the best Assassin compared to the other AC protaganist. Free running is fine but can be frusturating at times compared to newer titles and the graphics, well they didnt age that well, especially that strange brown tinge to everything eww.
