The last good Assasins Creed, if you ask me. Solid storyline, plenty of unlockable opportunities but its not up in your face about it. Gameplay is fun, though occasionally itll get repetitive. The game engine needs some work  I found that every time I died ingame, it was the games fault randomly jumping off walls into canyons, etc.
