Outshines its predecessor in almost every way imaginable, mission structure has been refined to the point where repetativeness from AC1 is a thing of the past. Navigation and free running has become more economical and effecient, and the city has a genuine feel of a bustling society, the lifelike quality is astonishing, that there is always something interesting going on around you... and if youre like me youll walk to your next mission, even if its very far away, just to observe the surroundings...  on the same note, the protagonist is a much more interesting character than AC1. The one thing that really impressed me with this game is how tightly knit the story is, and its a real staple of the series now. I very highly recommend this game, and its successor Brotherhood... but be aware that the series is very much storybased, and youd be doing yourself a tremendous disservice to play the games out of sequence. This series is shaping up to be one of my alltime favorite
