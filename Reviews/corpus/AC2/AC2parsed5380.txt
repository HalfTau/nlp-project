Assassins Creed 2 AC2 is by far one of the best new franchises I have come across in a long time. The gameplay in AC2 is much more refined over AC1 and makes the assassins movements much more fluid, dynamic and overall very capable. Its a powerful feeling to have control over such a versatile character.As with the graphics, the story is fantastic  good script and excellent voice acting carry the narrative and make you feel for the characters.With its various missions, cutscenes and sandbox nature, this is remeniscent of GTA IV for the rennaisance period  and thats not a bad thing by any means. If you enjoy single player games with deep story, believable characters and a variety of tasks, this is one hell of a bargain!My rating 5/5
