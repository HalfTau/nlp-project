Though I enjoyed AC1 I was a little hesitant to buy this game when it first came out. But once I did, I discovered that AC is truly the most amazing video game series Ive ever played. Id say that the most interesting thing about this specific game is the fact that Ezio is the most timeless and compelling characters Ive ever seen.
