This game is a good starting point if you wanted to get introduced to the Assassins Creed series. The story is driven by Ezios journey to finding his identity as an Assassin. The game starts with him wanting answers to his few questions, but as he starts to understand more he is only faced with more questions. He life apparently plays a larger role than he could ever imagine. It gets interesting because you are actually playing out memories of your ancestors in a system called the Animus. The gameplay is excellent and gives the player a sense of freedom. There is a lot to explore and freerunning is actually fluid. There is a great variety of tools that you could use to execute an assassination. The areas are designed so that there was no one correct way to execute a mission.The length of the story was long, but in a good way. The story kept the player entertained throughout and the progression was done right. Upgrades were rewarding and scaled correctly with the story. The replayability was okay because there was not much to do after the story is finished. You could still free roam after the last mission and try to find all of the collectable items. You could also upgrade your villa as you please.A well thought story that keeps the player entertained. This is a great starting place to get introduced to the AC series. Character development was interesting and distinct for each person encountered. There were a variety of different types of mission that reduced repetition. Has an excellent sense of openness in the world.There was not much reaplayability after the story was finished. The combat system was intuitive, but predictable.
