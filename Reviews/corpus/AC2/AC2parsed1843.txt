1. Uplay sucks.2. The keyboard controls are absolutely awful. The icons and popups dont change to match the controls you have set up or to your key bindings so you have to check the menus constantly. On a side note navigating the menus by mouse is also awful.3. Theres no ingame guide or tutorial for learning said crappy controls. Youre dropped into the world and have to figure them out by screwing something up and failing your missions time and time again until you luck out and maybe complete it.4. Sometimes you can use some controls e.g. sprinting and sometimes not. The game doesnt indicate when you can and cant use them.I quit within an hour because the inconsistency in controls was almost rageinducing.
