This games controls are bad. unresponsive, except when its over sensitive, and the camera correction they built is so very unintuitive, confusing, and above all inconsistent its embarrassing.That said, its a wicked awesome kickgame that has lots of content. Is fun, addictive, intriguing, challenging, nerve wracking. Like Thief  Batman rolled into one sausage calzone, eh? It doesnt have the best replay value however.9/10 only because of the ridiculous corrective cameraIve read later versions of this game have the bugs worked out of the controls so maybe try those, but this one is still unbelievably awesome.
