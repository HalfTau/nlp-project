Never played any AC before besides Brotherhood a few years ago on Xbox 360, saw this on sale, picked it up and had so much fun, honestly from beginning to end, I always involved and intrigued and while I did get frustrated at times, once I finally figured out how to solve a riddle or go undetected, it was so much fun, one of the best campaigns Ive ever played and definitly recommend, Ezio is such a fun character to follow. 10/10 Recommend.
