An allaround good fun game, plenty of sidemissions to keep you occupied for hours, an expansive story across 15th century Italy, and characters that you can get involved with emotionally.Definitely a game i would recommend to those who enjoyed playing Prototype, its a massive openworld game with fun parkour/freeroaming and an arsenal of stealthy weapons to keep you happy.There are some minor annoyances, so im going to give it an overall 8/10.
