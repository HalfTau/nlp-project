I realize that Im late to the party. Assassins Creed 2 is an amazing game. You want to be a mideval Batman, this game is the game for you. Im sure youve seen other review praise this game as well, They are all true. I do want to point out a few issues. The controls are screwed up for game pad controllers. There are fixes to remap the buttons but its pretty sad they you have to hunt down a hack to fixed what should be fixed in game. Also during close quaters combat, often you will be fighting the camera as much as the characters. Still, its a must play game.
