Ubisoft got a great idea.Hey lets make a DRM, that crashes every time, is unreliable and pisses off fans of our franchises.GuillemotThats a ing great idea you got there my lads. This way people will get more entertaiment, by uninstalling the drm 5000 times and changing directories over and over again. And the best thing about this new feature is that if you are a steam user, you need to have uplay with it, so the odds for crashing are even higher. Its like poker you know.Please Ubisoft, Please!
