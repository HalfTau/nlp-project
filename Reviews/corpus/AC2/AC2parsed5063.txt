Amazing game. I really love the story and everything. Problems are that the story disconnects slightly with the first game and so do the game mechanics. The puzles also tend to get repetetive. I dont particularly like the combat either. The keyboard layout is not very good either, so not an easy game to play without a controller. overall, id give this game a 80/100.
