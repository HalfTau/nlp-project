The AC series is easily in my favorite series of all time.While they change the controls a bit mostly menu navigation between AC2 and ACBR, its still largely the same game. Youre an Assassin the capital is important!, one of a long line of agents sworn to fight the Templars.Out of the Ezio trilogy, I would place AC2 as my favorite so far. ACB added lifts and more story, which was lovely. ACR so far has added more about Subject 16 and his place in everything, which is fascinating. AC2, though, seems to have a lot more material. The storyline was long, deep, and ended in a way I couldnt have predicted. Upgrading Monteriggoni paid for itself, the bredth of emotion was sustained throughout the game, and the comments in the database kept me laughing.
