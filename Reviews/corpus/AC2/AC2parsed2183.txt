Since i have a 3GB Ram PC im going to have to make this review UNIVERSAL since i played this game on Xbox 360 and PS3Now...I love First Person games. Hell, Half the games i play are first person puzzle games, or go around shoot everything you see games. BUT...i never liked 3rd person till i played this. 3rd person was fun when you can watch DOUBLE HIDDEN BLADES go into a guards face. And the templars are s so its satisfying when you kill them. Even a character that is against you at the beginning you kill later in the game! GG
