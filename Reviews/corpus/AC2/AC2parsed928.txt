Amazing. Its hard to find words that describe how brilliant this game is. I played ACII with little knowledge of the first game, but luckily it was easy to follow and its well crafted. I can see why Ezio is a fan favorite, as his story is intriguing since he was just a troublemaker and womanizer who loves his family, when sudden and unexpected events lead him to becoming the famous assassin he is known to be in the AC universe.ProsAmazing storyBeautiful soundtrackOutstanding graphics and sceneryGood voice actingGreat stealth system blending in with crowds, sitting on a bench to seem normal, hiding in haystacks, etc.The leap of faith is always fun to doHas a lot of content my hours can prove thatEach location is different and fun to explorePeople react to you when you do something that isnt normal such as killing a guard, stealing money, or aggresively shoving an NPC out of the way adding to the realistic enviroment.The guards are smart but not too smart if they see you tearing down a wanted poster,  going into a restricted area,  looting someone, etc, they will be suspicious and might attack.Little, if any, bugs.ConsUbisofts trend of stopping pirating by having the game be permenently online can be a pain, especially if your WiFi tends to go out often.Controls on a keyboard are a bit sloppy and it took a little bit to get used to.QTE during cut scenes can be annoyingThe NPCs that always serenades Ezio are annoying and tend to show up at the worst times.Although I have a lot of games I enjoy and recommend to friends, Assassins Creed 2 has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Its a great, unique story with dynamic characters and fun gameplay and its evident that a lot of time and effort was put into making this game. Its rare to find a game this involving and intriguing that has hours of content and is compatable on both PC and Mac. Definatly a must play for any gamer.
