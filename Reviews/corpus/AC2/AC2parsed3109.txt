The Second game to the Assassins Creed Franchise, and a very well done one as well. With many added features such as rebuilding Monterigionni, even more collectables, extensive collectables and weapons, and many extra side missions, this game packs all the fun of Assassins Creed in both its story mode and many side missions as well. Controlling the character Ezio still took a little getting used to and there were many moments where he would jump off a platform the wrong way and commit suicide, but the mechanics all in all were improved the second time around. Desmonds story line is expanded upon in this game, which can be enjoyable and frustrating at the same time. On a side note, Ezio is a wonderful character and easy to fall in love with because of his charming looks and personality. I give this game a 9.3/10.
