One word YES!This game redefined the definition of actionadventure gaming. Unlike the other games involving Ezio, which only had one city, AC2 has multiple massive cities! After nearly 10 hours of running around Florence and Fiorli, I found I was going to Venice. They just keep throwing new and exciting cities at you. Furthermore, unlike the cities of the future games AC3, or AC4, each city is massive and visually different in many ways.2009 and 2010 was the peak of great games, and AC2 is the peak of the series. If you dont own it, get it.
