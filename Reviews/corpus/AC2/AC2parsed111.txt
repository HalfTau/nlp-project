I loved AC2 on the PS3, and I thought I would pick it up on the PC. While its better than I remember, worth a solid 9/10 1 for poor control and handling, I do NOT recommend getting this mainly because Sequence 12 and 13 are SOOOOO boring and literally add nothing to the main story. Its a HUGE let down,that grinds the story to a halt, and acts as pure filler, adding nothing at all that is fun, new or interesting.I would recommend getting the orinigal AC2 and then adding the DLC you want. That way, when you get bogged by the irrelevant Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities DLCs, you can uninstall/refund it and move on.
