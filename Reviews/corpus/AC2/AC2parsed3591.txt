Assassins Creed is the first game in the series that integrates the elements that made the whole saga so popular. After playing its repetitive and disappointing predecessor, ACII was exactly the kind of experience that I was looking for. ACII involves all the elements of a great game elaborate story, beautiful visual style, exploration, character development, action, fun side missions, rewards and smooth mechanics which were not that smooth actually, but later about that. Deluxe Edition includes all the original DLCs, so therere hours and hours of gameplay. For few euros/bucks on sales or even full price I highly recommend purchasing this game, if you already havent.PROS fascinating story line collectibles, upgrades and secret areas  its all integrated in the story line, which not only makes exploration and side missions meaningful, but also constitutes a sort of economical management microgame, as all your progress in terms of collectibles reflects on the value and features of Monterigioni Villa  Ezios HQ unlike its predecessor ACII actually feels like a stealth game and there are multiple strategies for approaching and assassinating your enemies tons of content opportunity to explore realistic virtual representations of some of the most famous cultural landmarks of Renaissance and to find out about their history epic final battle da Vincis flying machineEssential improvements compared to AC1no annoying beggars and crazy peopleno hordes of citizensfaster and more versatile battlesno repeating patterns in the storyline or sidemissionsmore elaborate surroundingsmore weaponsability to hire factions for your advancetreasure mapsNEUTRAL in the beginning, Ezio always is out of money, because equipment, repairs and collectibles are overpriced, but towards the end youre a millionaire, and after you have purchased everything you could, treasure hunting and villa upgrades become pointless its the same thing in AC3 I mostly used the sword, assassins blades, throwing knifes and smoke bombs throughout the game, also occasionally the pistol but the dagger and poison did not come in handy  fun to try, but other weapons are just more practicalCONS camera rotation  it does not always follow Ezios directions, which is especially problematic in narrow surroundings inside buildings e.g., secret areas to the point that it takes multiple attempts to succesfully perform a back leap Ezio freezes while sitting on corners a problem in chase scenes sometimes the eliminated targets do not disappear from the minimap, which is a bit confusing when you need to find the next one the missions towards the end of main game story were too simplistic and with some notable faults in terms of layout, AIs behaviour and navigation, as if the developers rushed the game to release it on time but luckily that changes after you proceed to the DLC part of the game  the story is fascinating again and even the gameplay itself is much smoother some puzzles do not make sense or the clues are hardly visible its not possible to change Ezios outfit after Altairs costume is acquiredMy overall rating 9/10.
