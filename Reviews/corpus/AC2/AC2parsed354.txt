the game is great ive played it before but never through steam or on pc, this Uplay is complete crap, the google authenticator code i used to first log in said wrong code every time, then it banned me temporarily for too many log in attempts for an hour, so i thought, oh ill just make another uplay account, whatever, banned all 3 accounts i tried to make as soon as i made them, wtf???? i just wanna play the damn game i dont care if im connected online, i dont care about logging into Uplay, this kind of crap makes me wish i just pirated it.
