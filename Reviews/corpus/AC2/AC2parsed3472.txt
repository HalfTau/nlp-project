This is my first Assassins Creed series game.Just take a look at the time I spent playing it,  I would like to recommand it to everyone who has interest in the assassinbased theme game.The brilliant attacking movement and the fantastic assassin art showed by the character you control along with the cohesive plots together make great contribution to its success. Besides this, while you are experencing the famous assassin Ezio auditore s life, you will learn the history of the auditore family and realize everthing in the game  happens for a reason. BTW, the renaissance style architecture and the beautiful countryside views make you feel relaxed between exciting assassinations.You wont regret having it and hope you all have great fun in this game.
