I reccomend this game i really enjoy it. There is one big con though...FKING UPLAY! Everytime i try to play the game Uplay pops up and asks me to sign in. Everytime it says my password is wrong.Everytime i have to change it. And everytime my phone ends up thrown to the other side of the room in frustration. The game is fun but launching it is worse than watching Jupiter Ascending 5 times in a row with your eyes held open.
