Second Assassins creed game Im playing and I loved it. Altair is still my fave thoLets start for once with some flawsTHE ING CONTROLS. Jesus. I played it on PC without any controller and I was about to ragequit more than once just because of this. Its really sad because the game is good but these little things break the fluidity of the game.Also, the speed runs with timers either in missions or looking for Altairs armor could have been so much fun if it wasnt for the contextual camera which also ed me up so many times. And seems like Im not the only one.As for the good points.. Theres many of them Theres a hugeeee difference when it comes to graphics compared with the first game. The storyline is great and will probably still be for the next games with Ezio. If you consider yourself being a completionist and doing all the extra.. the game can be pretty lonnggg. I just played the main story with some extra and its already 35hours of gameplayOverall Great AC I still better dont hit me plz, I know most people enjoyed Ezio by far compared to the other characters!Ill be playing the next AC for sure and hoping for some fixes about the controlsBuy it on sale if you want but its worth its 10 !Id give it an 8/10!
