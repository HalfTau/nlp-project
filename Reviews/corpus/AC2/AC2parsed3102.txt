Disclaimer I didnt finish this game.ProsThe good to this game is basically the story and presentation, its what had kept me playing as long as I did. All the actual gameplay aspects are competent at best, but usually just bland.ConsThe combat is shallow, and brainlessly easy.It uses Uplay which has caused several crashes and lost progress, adding to my lack of inspiration to finish the game.It out stays its welcome. The combat, story and activities are not good enough to warrent it being this long.The parkour system often makes you jump in strange directions, often to your death.There are at least 50 towers to climb, needed to reveal the details of the map. They are all nearly the same, but further on in the game they become more annoying to climb because the set paths become more complex, making an already monotonous task more annoying and monotonous.
