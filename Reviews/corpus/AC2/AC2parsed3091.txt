I really disliked the first Assasins Creed. I found the main character repulsive, and the gameplay too awkward. So I was surprised that I enjoyed the second so much. The plot is much more interesting, and maybe I was more comfortable with the control scheme too. Definitely worth trying, and many people say this was the best of the whole series.
