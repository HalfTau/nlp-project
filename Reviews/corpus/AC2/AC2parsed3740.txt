Once you get over the strange PC control scheme and the first mission which is ridiculously difficult what were they thinking?, its actually a great game! Awesome designs for the surroundings and the main character, and the gameplay has some huge potential. Im glad that I finally got this and resisted the urge to uninstall after the aforementioned blunder.
