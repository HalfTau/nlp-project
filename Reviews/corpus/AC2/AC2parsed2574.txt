Most of the first games grievances carry over to the second one Repetitive side quests, bland protagonist, boring combat, lots of time spent just running or riding around. The most compelling aspect of the game is honestly collecting all the Renaissance art. The story is more fragmented than in the first game, with characters coming and going, though partly that is due to the adherence to historical facts  significant portion of the characters are actual historical figures and again, the largest appeal is exactly how the events of the game tie into actual ones. Still, like with the first game, you should only pick this title up if you want to see the overarching story through from start to finish.
