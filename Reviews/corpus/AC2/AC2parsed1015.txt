I have spent more time than I care to admit playing this game, and I will likely spend more time playing it in the future. I have always loved historical events, and Assassins Creed II is directly up that alley. I consider this game to be wonderfully written, and while it is certainly not perfect, it is one of the better games that I have played, in my opinion.Though one should usually begin at the beginning, I would consider this game a good place to start if youre trying to get into Assassins Creed its what I did, after all.
