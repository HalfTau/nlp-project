Ok, after playing AC Origins and enjoying it so much I decided to go back in time and play AC 2. My perspective is likely different from most who started in order. Personally, I think this game, AC 2 is terrific in terms of story and characters, especially Ezio. I now know why hes such a popular Assassin. For me, this version of the game was also terrific in that it really emphasized the importance of stealth and detection avoidance. To me this is important and one of the only things I dont love as much about the current Origins version in 2017. That said, this feels much more like a good old button masher combat game...a lot. Dont love that as much. Also, I believe some of the quests were incredibly difficult time vampires that, in my opinion, were unnecessary to contribute to the story. Only had a few weird glitchy things happen, things that required me abondoning some completed work which was frustrating, but overall the game was reliable and really entertaining. I certainly learned some good Italian slang along the way too. As always, the graphics and culural aspects were most excellent, intoxicating even. For me though, I still prefer Black Flag and Origins better, but Ezio is now among my alltime greatest RPG gaming characters.
