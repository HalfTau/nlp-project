Not much more to say about Assassins Creed II. It is the best game out of all AC franchise. At the time, it invented so many new features it was probably overwhelming. It took every single good thing from the first one, took it to perfection, and scrapped all the bad stuff. Hell, it probably redefined an entire genre of actionadventure. Charismatic and memorable main protagonist Beautiful graphics that aged pretty damn well in my books Innovative gameplay corpse looting, corpse moving/luring, nonrepetitive missions, double hiddenblade, perfected parries, disarming, outfit customization, rapid wallclimbing? Yeah, all that because of AC II Gripping and wellwritten story about personal vendetta on entire Italian Templar branch Almost psychotic attention to detail, which leads me to.. ...everpresent atmosphere of Renaissance and La Italia Last, but not least ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK from El Maestro Jesper Kyd.. timeless Back when Desmonds story was almost as good as his ancestorsAs you can see, I am positively biased towards this game and I acknowledge it. Im not gonna talk about negatives, as that would be simply redundat and irrelevant at this point, you can read it up in almost every single review here.If you are new to the series and are unsure where to start  this is the right place. Assassins Creed II is the Ubisofts legacy as a game developer, back when they didnt know the meaning of downgrade, and back when it felt good to anticipate new AC title..
