by far my most favorite of the Assassins creed games, it takes place in my favorite period of history, and wilth a similar background as Ezio Auditore, I find it to be one of the best games Ive ever played. The controls are easy once you get them down and the stroyline makes you want to see whats next every time there is a cut off point. By far a 5 star rating from me.
