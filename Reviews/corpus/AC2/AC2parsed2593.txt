Ezio is probably one of my favorite video game characters ever.That being said, the gameplay itself is pretty easy. Perhaps too easy,......which is just the way I like it! I dont like to use my brain and I prefer to stroll through my games without breaking a sweat!You know whats hard? Waking up in the morning to go to work!!
