This game has provided me with endless entertainment! If you like climbing, terrorizing people by being a fool, awesome plotlines and rediculously epic moments then this game is for you. An extremely satisfying stealth game that I would recommend to just about anyone. If the killing isnt your thing, maybe its exploring and finding treasure. Or maybe youd rather collect everything under the sun to improve your hideout? Its aged well, and I still love it.
