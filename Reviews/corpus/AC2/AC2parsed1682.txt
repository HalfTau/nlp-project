I originally illegally downloaded this game and played it, but bought it on steam to support the developers. Ive heard a lot of people say that Assassins Creed II is their favorite, I dont know that this is my favorite, but it is definitely a solid entry into the series. If youre wanting to start playing the Assassins Creed series, I think you should skip the first one its not very good and is very repetitive, and just start with this one.
