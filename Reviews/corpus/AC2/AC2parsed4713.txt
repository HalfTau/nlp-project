Many people think that ACBH is the best game of AC series, but the best is ACII in my humble opinion. The game time is about much longer than in ACBH, you can visit more areas there is Rome only in ACBH. The game is more difficult also, it is not a movie like the later parts and the story is very interesting. There are not unnecessary things from ACBH like the recruting of new assassins, what make game easier only. Because the true assassin fights alone. If you are a newbie to AC series, this is ideal game for the start with this great series.
