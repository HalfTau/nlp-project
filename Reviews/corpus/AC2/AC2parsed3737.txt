Some games age well, remaining entertaining and challenging long after release. ACII does not appear to be one of those games. The greatest challenges youll face are not enemies or puzzles. No, the combat is laughably simple and the platform puzzles straightforward. Instead, the challenge will lie in the poor camera and loose controls. You will never die in combat, but you will die to jumping in a random direction many times.As for the story, it starts strong with good human interest and character growth, but quickly runs down the rabbit hole of JJ Abrams style mystery and conspiracy with no satisfying conclusion.The last 6 hours of gameplay I was gritting my teeth, forcing myself to finish this bloody game once and for all. It was not fun. It was repetitive and simple and frustrating. If youre debating whether to get back into the AC series after years away, I would strongly recommend against it. Read the wiki to catch up on the story and buy the latest sequel, if you absolutely must.
