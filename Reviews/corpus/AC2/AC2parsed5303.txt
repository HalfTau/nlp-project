A good, sound follow up to A/C 1, you will now play as Ezio Desmonds Renaissanceera Italian ancestor. Building off the combat system from A/C 1, the finishers are just as satisfying, with some new weapons added for a bit of diversity and an option other than throwing knives for ranged. If youre in to upgrading property and collecting items, you can spend a long while following side quests and receiving different rewards. The Armour of Altair is well worth getting because its the only armour set in the game that doesnt require repairing after combat. The story itself is quite entertaining and  the ending is pretty weird. Good fun!
