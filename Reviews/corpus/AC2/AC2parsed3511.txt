ProsDoes not get boring can play for six hours straight!Good StorySmooth ParkourNo Bugs Or GlitchesGood Graphics even to 2014 standardsGood StoryGood Combat System i got it for 7 on sale but even at 11 it is VERY WELL PRICEDCons Instead of saying Press Q The game will say Press  Which means you have to dig through 4 menus and look at the controls to see what button  actually means but after 13 hours you get used to thisafter a while you cant even take one step out side before being spotted by a billion guardsbeggers Controls take a long time to get used to  UP TO 13 HOURS! uses UPlay and i had to reinstall UPlay TWICE for the game to workMost of the faults/cons are minor so i give this game a9.5/10
