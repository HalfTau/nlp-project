Impressive game!!!Even though the game isnt really perfect I mean sometimes you may meet some problems like feeling not good when you were operating the character, being annoyed by some mysterious BUG, or something you unexpect to see when you were enjoying your game, you can still be attracted by its story, the legendary of EZIO, and the pieces of EDEN. Ive never been to Italy before, but the game gives me a brief concept of the country with long history. Dont miss this game, its worthy for you to take a look!!!
