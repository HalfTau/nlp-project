BEST ASSASSINS CREED GAME EVER!Ive played from Assassins Creed I to Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and this one is still my favorite, Not only the story is long enough and very interesting, but the gameplay is different and fun, and my dear Ezio Auditore da Firenze I also consider him the best assassin ever is a very charismatic person, hes funny, hes good with the ladies, and of course, hes handsome as hell, if you ever doubt if you should buy this game or not, dont doubt it, BUY IT NOW! Its worth every cent c
