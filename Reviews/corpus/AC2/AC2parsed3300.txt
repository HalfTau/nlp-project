Very fun game with lots to do and an amazing story. One of the best, if not THE best Assassins Creed game. I recommend this to anyone looking for an openworld action game.Though I will say the mouse movement is abysmal, you pretty much have no other choice but to play with a controller. Also it crashes a lot and quite randomly.
