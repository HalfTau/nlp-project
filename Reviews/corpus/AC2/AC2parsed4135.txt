I got my hands on this game a couple of years after I played the first Assassins Creed game and ended up with mixed feelings about the second. Now that doesnt mean that AC2 is worse, it has pretty much everything I loved in the first AC. Then AC2 adds several gameplay features that make the game better. Then there are superb soundtracks, especially in Venice.But there were things I expected to see in the second installation. First of all is difficulty. The game wasnt challenging and occassions when you had to play as an actual stealthy and silent assassin were extremely rare. Most of the time you could use brute force and the only punishment for that was slowed down travelling from A to B. At least within the main plot missions. Second is the plot, which was rather alright, than good.The conclusion if you liked the first AC game, youll like this one, but probably will end up a little bit disappointed.
