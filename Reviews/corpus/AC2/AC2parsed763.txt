I know the plot and gameplay are good because I have this game on Xbox. If you want to actually play the freaking game, get it for a console. Turns out Im not the only reviewer to buy this game only to be LOCKED OUT because the Uplay servers DONT WORK!! !I loved the game on the console, wanted to be able to play it in coffee shops, was grossly disappointed that I wasted the harddisk space on a game that REFUSES TO RUN! And its entirely the fault of the same company that starved and murdered Uru Live.
