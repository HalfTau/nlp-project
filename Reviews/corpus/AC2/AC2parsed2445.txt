As 1st Assasins Creed game was pretty repetitive AC 2 is a new quality. Its couple years after the release this game just connected itself to me and i just cant let it go. Really after downloading i spent 20 hours from the go. I aced the game to 100. And to be honest Single Player Games must be really amazing to do this and AC 2 did just that. Buy this game since all you will lose is your friends but you will keep your virginity. 10/10 Now i gotta go play some AC Brotherhood.
