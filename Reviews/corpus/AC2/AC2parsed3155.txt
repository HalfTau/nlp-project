What a great game this was. I recommend AC2 to any gamer who enjoys a good story with a beautiful world to explore and stuff to collect.There is a lot of info about the locations in the game, and those locations are really accurately designed and that only adds to an already strong and original story. My friends told me this was the best AC game of the series so far and now i believe them.Plus, you can murder a  of people and get away with it ThugLife9/10.
