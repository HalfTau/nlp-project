The added localization is my main reason of purchasing, much appreciated. General thumbdown for uplay, DRM, monitoring terms in the EULA well, its a controversial method even in online games for the sole purpose of detecting cheating, Ubisoft added it into a standalone game, etc. I guess my comment cant really do anything meaningful here, but I am still going to express these concerns just to prove that there are people who care about this.
