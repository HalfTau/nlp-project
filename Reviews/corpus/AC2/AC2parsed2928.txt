this is one of my all time favorite game, i played it so much when it first came out on my xbox. now that ive got a pc i thought id try it out, but bloody uplay always drops the signal before i can even get the game loaded! DRM is never a good idea and why they thought they had to have it in this game is beyond me. as far as im comcerned ubisoft can go eat a bag of ds! dont wasteyour money
