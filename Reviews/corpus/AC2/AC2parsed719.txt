The game plot is meh honestly  just vengence, kill everyone.The main missions are all go point AB, talk to a guy, BC, kill another guy, CA return to turn in the quest.As if that is not repetitive enough, suddenly you got pulled out of the game world back to the modern real world for some mediocre cliche talking cutscene...where is the immersion?! Its not like there is another interesting to do in the modern real world, but you get force pulled out anyway and watch all that talking that you can NOT skip.then you only have 4 buttons for 10 actions/manuvers/attacks/dodges.Oh of course!, its a goddamn port! !Even running is a pain, you need to hold down RMSSpace AT THE SAME TIME.there is no jump button, you still run as above, and slam yourself into a wall, then he will magically start climbing.if the above happens and you try to fix the direction by turning? GG your character just did a 180 midair turn jump into the abyss ie alley AND DIE.I can pretty much say the same for moving when youre hanging on a ledge, you ALSO press the SAME buttons to move across a disconnected ledge, and....you get the idea.Bonus point, tutorials? hints? it tells you to push a button/combo and shows a XBox button picture. You have to blindly find your controls or keep going back into the options to look at it.Why not just show the ing key I mapped?These ing stupid console controls Up down left right make a game that requires so much precision on climbing and manuvering simply UNPLAYABLE.
