A wonderful marvellous game, i have a lot more hours on ps3. This is one of the best assassins creed games to date, and will remind you of a better ubisoft. Even if you dont like ubisoft, this game is worth every effort. Excellent narrative and story, fun parkour, brilliant combat and all around fun gameplay make this game a masterpiece. this game has a lot of fun side activities too and is often rewarding with them, which really motivates you to collect every piece of every set of armour and raid all the assassin tombs. But, when encountering glitches, or lag, remember this is a 2010 game, and the game checkpoints and saves often enough for it not to be a big deal. all that said10/10 would tutorial sex again.
