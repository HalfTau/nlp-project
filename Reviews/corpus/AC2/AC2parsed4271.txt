This is easily one of the best, if not THE best Assassins Creed game in the series. The open world exploration is great as well as the games story. There are just so many extra things you can do aside from the main story line missions. I think people have mentioned this before about how this game runs pretty poorly on PC even when having a good graphics card. I had a decent graphics card on my laptop and I was getting under 30 fps in most areas of the game on lowest settings. I somehow get the feeling that this game wasnt ported to the PC very well, but I was still able to beat the game and had a lot of fun. The world of AC2 is vast and beautiful, not the mention the soundtrack for the game is pretty good as well. Combat is fun, and for anyone who has played Assassins Creed 1, the combat is much improved and varied because of all the different skills and weapons you have.If you have a very good graphics card, then the PC version is great. Otherwise, I would stick with the console version for a more enjoyable experience. I am going to give this game a 9/10 because it was fun even though I wasnt able to run the game very well.
