Cant run the game installed by Steam. Every time I start the game, it always popup saying A Ubisoft service is unavailable. Dont know whether it is the problem of Steam or Ubisoft server?And the version I bought is deluxe edition.So disappointed.The game should not be on sale if Ubisoft has shutted down the server of this game.The Ubisoft has responsibility to maintain the server if they still make money from selling it.I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
