Assassins Creed II takes everything that was good about the first installment and improves it. It also takes all the complaints in the first one and does away with them entirely.The story is engrossing and captivating. You wanted to keep playing, even after fatigue had set in, to continue the story and see what happens next. The characters are lively and entertaining while adding to the overall story of the game.While I am a fan of adding and improving the variety of your arsenal, you will find yourself sticking to your hidden blade most of the time. Not that this is neccesarily a bad thing it just happened to be how I played it.The only thing one needs to know of this game is it is a must have, especially if the first one was able to suck you in.
