There are three games I will certainly remember for the rest of my life because of their breathtaking graphics, deep and intriguing plots, and fresh and exciting gameplay. Two of these are Bioshock and Mass Effect 2 the latter of which I cannot review because I dont own it on Steam. The third is Assassins Creed II. Im personally conflicted on whether or not to recommend the first one. The original Assassins Creed had some of the most bland  and repetitive gameplay Ive ever witnessed. The sequel improves on EVERYTHING and tacks on tons of new feature. The only reason Id have to pick up the first game is for the story. Whether youre a fan of action, puzzle, or story, this game has it all.Grade A
