I played this game on Xbox several years ago, and absolutely loved it. I picked it up on Steam for a replay when it was on sale, but it uses Ubisofts Uplay software, which was not available when I loaded up the game to play. Several users have had problems with Uplay, and it seems silly to me that running an entirely singleplayer game should depend on the availability of Ubisofts DRM services.Thus, I would recommend against buying this game on Steam. If you have a console, though, or are willing to put up with Uplay, its a great game.Edit 11116Apparently, many folks have found a way to make the Uplay part work see the comments on this review basically you need to download the Uplay launcher from Ubisofts website separately. Although I havent tried it myself, this would probably take Uplay from a dealbreaker to a mere annoyance in my opinion. As I said above, the game is spectacularly fun, so it might be worth a shot at making the Uplay work to play it. You can always request a refund if you have problems.Given the new information, Ive changed my review to a positive recommendation. If youve never played it before, I think itd be worth a try, even considering Uplay.
