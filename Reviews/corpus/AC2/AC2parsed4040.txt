I love this game so much!! !Another successful game from Ubisoft that showed the sequel of the original and genius story in a fictionalhistorical setting of renaissance Italy with all the other new features since the first Assassins Creed, for example the ability to buy weapons and armor instead of earning it through gameplay.i dont think or seen any cons on this game cause its awesome.
