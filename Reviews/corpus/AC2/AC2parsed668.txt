So I bought this via Summer Sale because you know what...I had such fond memories of this game and I just really wanted to play it again and for 10...cant be too bad right??!So I played it throughout the weekend and the very first day I played it, super buggy. It keeps making my monitor go nuts to where I cant even play it. No other game I have does that and this is soooo disappointing
