If you liked the first one, you will like this. If you didnt like the first one, you might like this too! It is monumentally imrpoved over AC1, with a much more engaging plot and many more varied sidemissions. The AC2 world is gorgeous, and one of the most beautifully designed worlds Ive seen in a video game although the engine seems to enjoy rendering things as you walk past them   . Ive also had zero trouble with the Ubisoft DRM stuff, so dont let that scare you away!
