While I only recommend the first Assassins Creed if you plan on playing the entire series, Assassins Creed II is one I can recommend even if you plan on skipping the crappy ones and just playing the good ones. The graphics are great although the cutscenes are obviously a little dated, and the controls still love to fight with you with Ezio jumping off buildings and climbing up ladders when you didnt want him to do that at all, but by the end you get used to it. Theres so many missions to complete and getting 100 is more of a time investment than an annoyance, which is good for people who like to fully complete games but you wont be missing out on a lot if you decide to just finish the story.For the story, I can only ask what kind of drugs the writers were on.But I still had a lot of fun with Assassins Creed II. My only complaint is that I wish it was a little harder since I never died once in any combat or mission, unless I fell off a gigantic building because Ezio is sometimes an idiot. Other than that the challenge is keeping track of who all the Italiano Pepperonis are and knowing why youre supposed to hate the people youre killing
