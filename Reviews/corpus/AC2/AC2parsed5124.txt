Its fun, and all the stabbystabby you could ask for. The story even gets pretty interesting, if you can let your brain get past how ridiculous it all is.You should probably play Assassins Creed 1 first, you should definitely play Brotherhood next, and you should most certainly SKIP the hell over Revelations.Even if you find yourself growing invested in the story, seriously jus skip Revelations. Believe me when I say nothing important actually happens in that game.
