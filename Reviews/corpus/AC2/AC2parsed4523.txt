YES! Craploads to do! Rennaisance Italy! Leonardo da Vinci! Machiavelli! UR AN ASSASSIN HURFDURF BONER ENGAGED MOVE LIKE A NINJA AND ALL THAT HURR Great voice acting Really engaging story Great combat mechanicsNO?! The original Assassins Creed still has more fluid animation  why is that? Not hardwarefriendly on lowerspec systems Missions are kind of linear, but entertaining otherwise Itsame, Mario!Assassins Creed 2 may be your breadandbutter thirdperson actionadventure game during its release. A great mix of social stealth, great swordplay and gratuitous conspiracy theories bind this awesome title together.Need I say more? Go get it, you wont regret every second youve played.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
