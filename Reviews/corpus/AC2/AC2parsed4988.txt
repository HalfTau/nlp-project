A lot better than the first Assassins Creed by far... Im not sure how they did it but the makers managed to wrap religion, science, past, present, and future plus a whole lot more into the storyline of this game. Combat is great and there is a fair amount of upgrades and other items to purchase. The only downside is all of the running around gets to be annoying.
