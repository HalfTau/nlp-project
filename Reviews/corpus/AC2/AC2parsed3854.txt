Assassins creed is one of the best game serieses i have ever playedWith AC1 not being as good as it could have been, AC2 was a HUUUUUGE set upIts not repetitive like AC1 and follows a main storyline. There is sooooo much to do when the game is completed. Guards are more aware of your actions with the noterioty meter where as in AC1 you would run past a guard after killing another guard and they would do f all. The final thing is the amount of side missions that this game has to offer. Races/Mail/Beatup events are amazing and give you a little break from the normal story line.Ezio is a legend and is so much better then Altair. But it is not the best in the Series. Black Flag holds that honour
