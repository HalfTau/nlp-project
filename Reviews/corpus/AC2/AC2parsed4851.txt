Assassins Creed 2 is one of the best games Ive ever played and definitely the best part of the series. Its more varied than the first part and the characters are simply awesome. The game has brought a lot of innovations into the series, such as a new main character, a lot of novel weapons and armors and the ability to swim. There is a giant new world to explore and the story is thrilling till the end. Finally, I cant tell you anything bad about the game, I mean even the soundtrack is great. So if you like ActionAdventures like this, buy the game, its still worth the money.
