Assassins Creed II is so different from AC that you could easily say that the current franchise began with this second game. Ezio is your typical charismatic badboy, and playing as him throughout his great character arc is very satisfying. The combat, while not as ridiculously easy as it is in later titles, is very different than it was in AC, and the varying styles of the missions keep the game interesting for more casual players. The story is interesting, but much less profound and contemplative than ACs, but the games many other qualities especially the visuals more than make up for it.
