In general, I advise never buying an Ubisoft game. They use an intrusive, practically malware application called Uplay. It will force you to set up an account, it will want to run on your computer all the time, and the worst part, it is natively broken, so you will have to spend about an hour reading forums and editing file properties to get Uplay to work. Then, maybe get into the game. I will never buy another Ubisoft product, ever.I may come back later with some comments on gameplay, if I can play it.
