Assassins Creed 2 is the best game of the series. The environment is the best, the gameplay is fun, and the character Ezio is so adored his story got expanded two more games.If youre looking for a way in to the series, this is the game.I do want to point out two big things the investment feels rather tangential, but has to be done to get better armor and weapons. Eventually you will have too much money and not enough useful things to spend it on.I dislike having to also open up Ubisofts gaming client. Thats a rather nitpicky issue, but it means if I want to play this game offline, I better have opened up Ubisofts gaming client beforehand.
