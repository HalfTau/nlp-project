I bought this to play on an early 2015 Macbook Pro Retina running MacOS Sierra, and had some pretty big problems right out the box.Ubisoft requires you to play this game through their UPlay launcher. This launcher shows nothing but a white box to me. It is still possible to log in but you have to move your cursor around until you find a text input field, hope its the username field, enter your username, then hit TAB to enter your password. If this works, the launcher will bring up another white box and you have to blindly click around until you hopefully hit play in the bottom right corner.Once the game starts, you may only be able to see half the screen, as it will be shifted halfway up your monitor. If you get the correct half of the screen, or if you know which keyboard keys to press, you may be able to get into graphics options and change the resolution. This sometimes fixes your problem, but at this point I figured it would be better to quit and get a refund from Steam, so I dont have any info on the gameplay.Ubisoft has seriously pooped the bed on this one. If you have a Mac and youre thinking of testing your luck, just remember that you can request a refund from Steam within two weeks of purchase as long as you have fewer than 2 hours of playtime.
