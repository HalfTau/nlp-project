PROSthe combat is fun but not too easystory is way better then the first oneit has your stats like enemies killed and money well i thought it was pretty cool it had thatCONSsometimes when jumping from building to building there can be a path clear as day and ezios dumbass decides to jump off the ing building so parkour is wankytheres no set controller settingsand thats really it those were really the only two things that stood out to me everything else was really fun about the game there were no missions that i felt were absolutely pointless so this is an overall good game
