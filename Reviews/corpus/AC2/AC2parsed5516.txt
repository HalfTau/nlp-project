Much better than the first, with more variety in everything. If youre the items junkie type, youll get plenty. The story is interesting but I didnt like the ending much. The gameplay however is improved and the combat mechanics are one of the most fun aspects of the game and one of the best ive seen.Id recommend it but for those with internet D/C issues stay away from it as the game will not continue without an active internet connection at all times.
