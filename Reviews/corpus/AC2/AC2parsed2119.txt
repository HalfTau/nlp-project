Words cant express how frustrating this game is on here. Thats why Im gonna have to write even more words. Ubisoft has given the assassins creed games on steam a death sentence due to one huge problem Uplay. Its a shame that the AC game I consider to be the best entry in the series be brought down to the ground with numerous disconnects from its service, basically making the game go fullstop. Many, many times have I had to deal with a bunch of outages that prevents me from progressing. Basically, dont buy it.
