Having played the more recent games, I will say that the free running in this is not nearly as good after about the 12th time you get desynced trying to do a leap of faith youll understand, however it works well enough that the game is still enjoyable. The story is pretty amazing, if the fights a bit tiring and countering both too powerful and weak at the same time.
