i would say it would be great if it actually worked, but worked is more a matter of opinion at this point. it used to function, but something happened somewhere along the line, and i kept getting a cannot connect to servers error from the ubisoft game launcher. i figured maybe the servers were down for maintenance or something, so i tried again today. its wonderful sitting and watching the simple loading wheel spin endlessly for no apparent reason while the game launcher attempts to check for updates that dont actually exist. every attempt to reinstall the game has failed and left me back at the infinite checking for updates mini screen.prior to this, the controls of the game were... lacking. it should make sense that pressing a directional key towards the ladder i am attempting to climb would make ezio turn towards that ladder and climb it, but he seems to have an inexplicable fascination with doing a stupid, babylevel parkour jump exactly one foot off the ground on the walls next to ladders. hes also probably in serious need of therapy, since it appears he tends to fall into sudden bouts of chronic melodrama and throw himself from rooftops to his death. you would think that a year would be enough time to recover from the loss of family, but then he also dedicated his life to revenge and murder, so perhaps he had some sort of predisposition to poor mental health.
