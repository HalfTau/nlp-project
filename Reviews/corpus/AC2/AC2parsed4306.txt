Everyone who said this one was better than the first was correct. However, it still had a couple fairly major issues. Because of the pseudoplatforming, there were times when Ezio would get somewhat out of control. I get that it was supposed to be to make the game playable while very cinematic, but too often it had the opposite effect. He would miss a jump that would have been very easy with manual control. The other issue is the game just wore out its welcome. I found the story quite compelling, but it didnt need to last 24 hours without even collecting the feathers. A game half as long would have had a larger impact with less filler to dilute it. Now I need to decide whether to fight the temptation of jumping to III and skipping Revelations and Brotherhood.
