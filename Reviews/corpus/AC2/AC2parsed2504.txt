Very hard game. Specially opening the game. Im not talking about the first moments of game. Just opening it is hard. You need download the game. then delete some files. Then download the new versions on the Ubisofts website. Than get the cd key. Active the game on UPlay. Then maybe you can play it. If you have a controller. If you dont it is almost impossible to play this game with keyboard and mouse. I just bought a Xbox Controller just for this game. I hope it is worth it.
