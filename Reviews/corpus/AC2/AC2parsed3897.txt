Assassins Creed II is the BEST AC game I have every played, the story for this game is fantastic and with the DLC that adds both Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities you will get an expanded storyline that is missing in the game if you do not have the ACII Deluxe Edition. The game is set in the 21st century and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze.The story takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy during the 15th and early 16th century. In ACII there is a lot of new abilities that the player has access to that were not available in the first AC. Now you can now use Eagle Vision in thirdperson view and while moving and you also now have the ability to swim. Now you can hire different groups of NPCs, such as mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves to help you fight, distract, or lure guards some thing that the first AC game never had. A day and night cycle has also been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time.The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenthcentury Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forl, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. ACII has added a lot of new sidemissions that you can access any time throughout the game like now they have added Assassin Tombs which is an optional sidemission to find all of the Assassin Seals to unlock the legendary Armor of Altar.Overall I give this game a 10/10 it is a huge improvement over the first AC game and I reckon it is probably the best AC game out there. I really cannot recommend this game to you enough it is just fantastic I am absolutely 100 sure that this game will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.
