Assassins Creed 2 is one of the few true masterpieces of the video game medium.Can you feel it? The hairs raising on the back of your neck? When was the last time a video game did that to you? Whether youre running over rooftops or solving mysterious puzzles, Assassins Creed 2 never ceases to be interesting and fun. The conspiracy theory at the core of the plot is both fascinating and terrifying at the same time and serves to completely engross you in the games story, characters and setting with a fantastic sense of wonderment and curiosity unlike any videogame youve ever played before.A conspiracy theory involving the creation of man, his purpose, his nature and most importantly, his rulers. The game talks about the origin and evolution of religion, objective truth and how history can be shaped and molded into creating truths that better suit humanitys rulers. Important philosophical questions are raised and never truly answered because maybe theyre not meant to and youre supposed to find your own meaning and purpose in the world. The game was designed to make you think and reflect on these things by yourself and I believe that makes Assassins Creed 2 one of the best and most important games of our generation.
