The combat is fairly easy walk behind a guy and instantly kill him with your sword.The Hidden blades attack way too fast enough for the opponent to stand a chance.Yet i think it is quite badass you can take on 10 people with just your fists.I highly reccomend playing the first assassins creed before this.completed the gamedoing just the story but i feel compelled to start this game again to do all of the little missions and 100 this game.i would reccomend this to 13 ages or 10 ad mature as there is alot of killingif you didnt know that already. This game is kind of worth the 10 but i believe it should be around 56
