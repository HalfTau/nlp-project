AC2 steam linked with uplaythumb up for you guys  ubisoft  next time please make more interesting games like this , but my rates for this game   9/10 graphics , gameplay 8/10 , dialogs  6/10  coz eng mix with italian languages  .i thought ubisoft could create more assassins creed games in the future with more storyline and characters , but for me graphics are nothing  and gameplay is more important .next time i would buy ubisoft games  while i am upgrading my PC hehe.
