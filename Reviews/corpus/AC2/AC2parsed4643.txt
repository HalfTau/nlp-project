I wasnt expecting much when I picked this up in late 2013. Still I really loved the italian setting and the depictions of these places were more accurate than I had expected. The freerunning parkouresque way of navigating around the world was a nice change even though it takes a while to cover greater distances. And the jumping puzzles are a lot of fun too.The story was allright though I feel like it probably leaves a few too many open questions and uncertainties Seems like brotherhood ties a lot of these up however. The only other thing I can complain about are the silly default controller keybinds. Check the community hub for a fix. But even with said fix its still pretty awkward when buttons likeRT are visualized as random icons during tutorials and crucial moments.But overall a good bang for your buck!
