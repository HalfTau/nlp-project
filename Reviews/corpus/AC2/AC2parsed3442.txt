Whilst I reccomend this game there is a few things that are horrible about it.1. Controller support. I had to download some fix so I could use the LT and RT buttons on my 360 controller. Controller mapping useless without this fix.2. Uplay, Origins  cousin. Crashes all the time. Took me 20 minutes to register the game.
