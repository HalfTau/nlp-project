Less repetitive than the first game, lots of content, a good story and nicely routed in history. There are now some nice pure puzzle platformer parts that bring tomb raider gameplay to mind. Sadly the horrible interface prevents this game from being great. This is a badly done port with severe consolitis  interface not optimised for mousekeyboard, severe mouse acceleration, generally too arcade, low detail graphics due to xbox RAM limits etc.
