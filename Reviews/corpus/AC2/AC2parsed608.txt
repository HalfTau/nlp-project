The number of mechanics this game improves upon is vast compared to the original. There is a vast amount of weapons to experience, and play with. The main charater is memoriable, the side characters are enjoyable to listen to, and the game captures the beauty of Italy very well. The music is solid, but not memoriable. This iteration of AC adds a lot of little things that AC1 was missing to keep the side quest from getting too boring. However, the game screams that it was meant for a controller.
