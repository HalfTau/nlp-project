The best AC game made, even now, all these years later. Ezio is simply the best character Ubisoft has ever made. The environment is incredible, Florence, Venice, and the other towns are breathtaking.The graphics have aged wonderfully, better than almost any other games from 2008.The gameplay was at its best, not too many gadgets and weapons, but not too streamlined either.10/10, Ive bought this game 3 times and will continue to play it again.
