As I was finally able to play this game on a decent computer, I began to play it soonest possible. The story really succeeded to catch from the very beginning starting out as a somehow normal guy with no weapons and later on obtaining more weapons as you play and collect Codex pages, with which you fight your way through several great cities, to finally defeat the Pope of Roma and thereby avenge the murder of your family.This game really has amused me with both graphics, voice acting accents!, the beautiful areas, the atmosphere, and the gameplay  sure some missions were almost identical, but you also get to do a huge variety of different tasks such as attending a carnival.Almost nothing for me to put a finger on except a few rarely occouring glitches. The end is also amazing and full of beams and effects.To be honest Id call this game truly epic.
