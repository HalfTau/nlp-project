Though the original console version of AC II is a fantastic game, this is practically unplayable on PC.Ive found it virtually impossible to get past a really early point training with your uncle due to controls not doing what they should cant lock onto an enemy. Ive tried various different controllers including steam controller as well as mouse  keyboard and no single configuration has let me lock onto targets thus, Im unable to progress in the storyline. It seems to be a common issue as Ive found a lot of similar complaints when trying to find a fix, but no helpful solution yet.TLDR Dont buy on PC, get it on console.
