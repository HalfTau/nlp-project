IMO is the best of the games in this series really, this is the one that should be played.  the story is gripping, passionate, and will pull you in regardless of any skepticism... some flawed gameplay mechanics as in need additional tweaks, but nothing that breaks the game itself.  Beautifully done, a much better game than its predecessor
