This is the beginning of where Assassins Creed really comes into its own. Defintely worth playing.First of all, they began by adding the essential stealth kill mechanics, such as haystack kills, ledge kills, and drop kills, and then expect you to use them to kill without being seen.Second, unlike the first game, a crowd of guards can be a real pain, especially once they start mixing in brutes.Lastly, the controls feel a lot better, though you wont be able to escape jumping off into space now and then. Still an improvement over the first game. And to top it off, water no longer is an instant death for you though it still kills your enemies, so thumbs up to that.Graphics are what youd expect from a game of that age, but they didnt kill the mood for me. Sound quality wasnt anything I noticed as either good or bad.All in all, a good game worth playing.
