The best AC ever, a must buy.Travel Reinassance Italy, recreated almost perfectly Im Italian myself and Ive visited all the cities depicted and I can say that the level of details is incredible.The story is also great, you follow Ezio on his path of vengeance, from his very first day until a great twist that is followed up in the sequel.If you like AC, Reinassance, beautiful soundtrack and a great immersion overall, AC 2 is the game for you
