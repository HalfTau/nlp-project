This game is awesome! 2 years ago, my wife and I went and spent 2 weeks in Tuscany. And by chance we visited and stayed in most of the locations that the game takes place in. Its like a second vacation. I cannot believe how exact the cities are replicated. I constantly pull out our pictures and have my wife come look at the game holy cow, its exact, look we were standing right there!At first I didnt like the lack of normal customization that I am used to in a RPG and I dont do many consule like games, but this one was the exception. I am a history buff and the content of this game, how it tells you exactly who was who and where was where in actually history is just amazing.The actually game play is addicting. The quests and the achievement like system gets you so distracted that time flies and its hard to stop playing.This is my first Assassin Creed game and I am crossing my fingers that the other ones are this good.
