I understand why many people say this was the best Assassins Creed...For me, i also think the same Best Asssassins Creed but thats it, it does not mean if was the best game, it was yes, the best Asssassins CreedIn terms of soundtrack, characters, story, definetly it was the best of the best, characters nobody will forget, cities nobody will forget, a story full of emotions, vengeance, etc.I loved the Assassin Tombs, templar lairs, the soundtrack, the story, but in terms of game itself, it lacks a lot, every side activity is repetitive and looks the same, tons and tons of view points that are not necessary,thats why i felt Unity, Black Flag, and Origins, the complete games, were not the best in terms of story, but they had hours of gameplay, so yes, i recommend asc II even if you have not played other games of the franchise, it is a great place to start.I dont feel the graphics that old to be honest, the gameplay is responsive, and i love the parkour in this game more than most present Assassin Creed games, could play all day long this game and not feeling tired, feels always good to come back and restart again the whole 3 games of Ezio.
