I first played AC4, then AC3 and now Im on AC2. I just finished the main story after 37 hours of gameplay. I think AC3 and AC4 are better than AC2 but theyre all good in my opinion and worth your time. The fact that I played the series backward made it so I played the best through the worst.Overall this is a great game. Good graphics, good music and sounds, good storyline.My only major problem are the controls. Horrible controls! I think I lost more energy by falling from high places than getting hit by enemies because I didnt climb or jump where I wanted. Be prepared to redo 10 times every missions than demand speed and accuracy. They improved them in the next games so they got it better in the end. The fighting system is not very good either.7/10
