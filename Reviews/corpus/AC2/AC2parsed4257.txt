Definitely a fun game, unfortunately though through this series of Ezios life, we never learn much about the Assassins Creed or their order, besides a 15 minute shocking ending in assassins creed revelations. All in all though AC2 was a wonderful, tacticful, intriguing, and surprisingly frustrating game. I would pay like 50 to play this series.
