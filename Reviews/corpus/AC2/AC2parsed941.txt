I very rarely write reviews on games, but this one was a special exception. Of the 45 minutes I spent playing this game, more than half were spent trying to figure out the controls. They are by far the worst, most unintuitive controls Ive ever seen in an action game. I am supremely disappointed, as I was really looking forward to playing one of the most hyped up games.
