Its my honest opinion the Original Assassins creed games are the backbone of what stealth games are today. The franchise as a whole but mainly the earlier titles, laid the foundation for such a large and widely growing fanbase for the stealth genre we have today. Assassins creed is a must play game for any stealth fanatics showing off massive upgrades to its father title named Assassins Creed. Assassins Creed 2 promotes richer storyline with an immersive gameplay if youre in the right mindset.  Honestly my favourite franchise of games ever created , moulding my taste of games and what I now like today 10/10
