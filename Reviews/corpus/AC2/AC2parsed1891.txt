First things first AC2 is good. It has its flaws, obviosly, but in the end its a nice experience. At the end of the game, or even half its duration, it may get annoyingly repetitive, and frankly, very easy, but overall its a good game.BUTIn order to play the game you have to install UPlay, which I completely disagree with. Keep this in mind.
