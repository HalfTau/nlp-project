This game may be nearly a decade old, but its still the best Assassins creed game in the series. Check the internet if you dont believe me. Assassins creed Origins may beat it now, but it was the reigning champ for nearly a decade. That says a lot. I feel that the series has been relatively same after this game. A few improvements here and there but nothing revolutionary. I played the original Assassins creed and the difference between that and this is like night and day. I hope that the series proves its worth with Origins. Thanks for reading this! !
