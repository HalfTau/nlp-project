I havent played this game on PC yet, but I beat it for xbox not too long ago, and I would say its excellent. It has a great story, fun combat, and plenty of content. So far, Ive been dissapointed in the Steam release due to poor optimization, but that doesnt change how well this game holds up, even 7 years later. 9/10EDIT Though I still love this game and would reccomend it, I must say that the PC port sucks. Like a lot. The keyboard and mouse controls are abysmal and they make it extremely difficult to set it up with a gamepad, especially on a mac. Great game. Lazy port. Steam version 1/10
