Nothing is true, Everything is permitted.Assassins creed II is one of my most favorite games from this series and surely Ezio is one of best protagonists from entire gaming world.Assassins Creed II is almost the opposite experience of Assassins Creed. It starts off looking and feeling like more of the same. This game is an improvement in every way over Assassins Creed. The main improvement is it is not repetitive, There are many more mission types. The story of this game is strongest point here, and the protagonist, Ezio Auditorie, is definitely the best in the entire series.The cities of Italy are so much bigger in this game.This game is a true masterpiece and  must buy for AC lover
