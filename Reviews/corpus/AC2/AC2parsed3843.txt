This game is possibly the best Assassins Creed game that has been made. That means better than Black FlagI say this because the story of how Ezio became an Assasin and his journey for revenge is, one, truly amazing, and historically semiacurrate.My biggest problem however is the fact that the objective is sometimes unclear.That being said, I still encourage everyone to buy this game!I have beaten it 3x on my Xbox 360
