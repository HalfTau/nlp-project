Lets be honest  This is an incredible game. Fun, engaging, immersive.Theres only one thing i can say to games in generalPLEASE dont take 67 hours to complete!! By the 50th hour of play time i was practically begging for the game to get over.Ill reiterate, i loved everything about this game, but it went on for so so long that i had to take a two month break and come back to finish it, just so it would feel like a game again and not arduous work to complete.That being said, Onto Brotherhood! !
