Amazing game! Worth buying. I have not played the story to the end yet, but it seems fantastic. The icons of the controls were confusing at the start, but now theyre clear to me. I am playing with HP laptop with Windows 8. The FPS is a little lagging, but otherwise, I have no problems with the game. Absolutely worth 10!
