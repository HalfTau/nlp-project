This game is my childhood. The best one in the whole Franchise. Shame Ezio had to stop, because noone wanted him to go. Probably one of the best OpenWorld games ever created, and Im sure its going to godown in history as that. All those people having problems with UPlay are just not good enough to play this masterpiece. I went throuh the registration and everything else  easy to login/register and access the game from UPlay.
