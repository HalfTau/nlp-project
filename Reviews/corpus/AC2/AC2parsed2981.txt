This was my first official rated M game I bought, as well as one of the fewest games I bought when I first came to Steam. From a guy who was raised on Mario games and various Wii games, I didnt have the luxury to play these kinds of games. I was 17 when I bought this game.Sevenfreakingteen. My first rated M game. At 17. Yes, you could very well say I was sheltered. And rightfully so.When I was at the checkout to buy this game, I was sweating. Sad, but true. Thoughts raced through my head Will I get in trouble? Would I really get away with this? After all, a rated M game in my family was strictly taboo. I swallowed my cowardly fear and purchased the game.About an hour or so later, the download was finished. I was so close to playing this game. Will it be any good? Will it be worth it?About an hour in the game, all fears washed away. I was in love. This was the game that started my obsession with the franchise. This is the game that truly started my love for thirdperson stealthaction games. It showed me that video games can tell great stories, share loved memories, and can take my breath away. It showed me that even video games can have a beautiful soundtrack, just like the movies. I still listen to it whenever I am studying and trying to relax. Heck, I even gained an intrest in speaking Italian. Sure, the port isnt the best thing out there, the combat can be frustrating at some points, and the goddamn feathers, but it still left an impact on my mind.A couple days later, my mom found out and was very disappointed. But it didnt matter. I played a game that changed the way I looked at video games.Nothing is true, everything is permitted.8.9/10 would relive those memories again.
