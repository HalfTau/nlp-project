I thought it was cute how people were to describe a selling point for Assassins Creed II in ten words or less, my favorite being You get in a slap fight with the pope.Assassins Creed II is probably my first and hopefully not my last, though judging by brotherhood and the little I played of III, Im guessing this was my last. This installment in the assassins creed series is the first of what is now known as the Ezio Trilogy, to which there are three games you follow in the footsteps of Ezio Auditore. The game enviorment breaks from the bleak and extremely uncolored backgrounds, giving people in and out of the animus character and depth. This allows for great dialog with people who actually seem human and not clone back water breed people seeking power.The game starts off as you with a sort of rebellious italian spitfire where you witness your families death, save your mother and sister. While on the path to revenge, you meet your uncle mario and he reveals that your father was more then a banker, he was an assassin. Uncle Mario guides and trains you and you in turn decide to take up your fathers work and finish what he started To stop the templars and protect the Apple of Eden.The game, for my taste, is just the right length and unlike the first Assassin, Ezio is not water solvent and does not navigate like a land yacht. The PC version of the game is complete, but the console versions are not. They added two DLCs which are Sequence 12 and Sequence 13. So if you should feel that the story has taken a sharp left turn around that part of the game, youre not alone.Overall, Id recommend this game
