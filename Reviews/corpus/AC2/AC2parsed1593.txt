Assassins Creed 2 is the second game of the Assassins Creed franchise , and , said by many, the best one yet.The scenario is redistribuited throughout various citys like Florenze, Venezia , Romagnia and temporarily the game is located in the XV century more precisely throughout 22 years of the life of Ezio Auditore de Firenze.Lets evaluate it!Graphics  75/100  The graphics on Assassins Creed 2 are  by the time of this review  already outdated. While it is very chompy for us already,back in 2009 I believe they were astonishing.                                                                                                  I think, nonetheless, that the models of the faces of some characters  especially the less relevant ones  could be more detailed despite the age of the game.Sounds  75/100  The soundtrack in this games offers plenty of pleasure moments especially when the city guards are pursuing you while you parkour in the XV century Florence rooftops. That angelic specific music suits wonderfuly in the parkour moments and I absolutely loved it.Despite the good soundtrack, some dialogs of the civilians were extremely repetitive and a reason to mock.Story  90/100  Great Story! You are Desmond Miles, a normal person whose ancients were several generations of Assassins. You are caught in a war between Templars  the bad guys and Assassins  The good guys. In the first title you are kidnapped by the templars while in this title you are caught by the Assassins. Due to the low resources of the Assassins  that have to face a source of infinite resources that feeds the Templars you incarnate as Ezio Auditore de Firenze as a way of seeking more information about the Pieces of Eden , and the  main goal , to train you.Ezio Auditore de Firenze is motivated by revenging the ones that killed his family and throughout the course continues the work of his father about ancient artifacts called The Pieces of Eden.Gameplay  85/ 100  Nothing really new here. Fantastic combat system that , in my mere opinion , could be more punishing.The game feels ,after some hours, repetitive due to a decent length in the story time. The social features of the game are well achieved although they could make it a little bit more imersive.In the end , the game deserves    81 / 100
