Assassins Creed II improves on its predecessor in every conceivable way. The characters and environment are engaging. The story is enthralling and its a heck of a lot of fun. If you found AC1 a bit tedious but enjoyed the core mechanics, you will definitely love AC2.It is possibly the best entry in the series. Definitely the best until AC4 Black Flag. Definitely worth 10 bucks or less.
