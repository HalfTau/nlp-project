Im not a console person and due to needing a mac for my major, I was excited to see at least one of these games for mac. It booted up perfectly the first two times times I logged into it and then it went downhill from there. At lest one hour of my gameplay time was trying to get it to work. Its great when it works, so for that Ill give it a thumbs up.Screw uplay.
