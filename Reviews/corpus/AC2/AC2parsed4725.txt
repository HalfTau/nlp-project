This game is 4 years old so what could I possibly say about it that has not already been said.  I loved the first installment, despite the repetitive nature of the missons.  It took me quite awhile to play the first one since my computer would not run it.  ACII is the second AC that I have finnished this year and it is a marked improvement over the first, and really makes the grind of the repetitive missions of the first game stand out that much more as an eyesore.  You really should play the first one to fully appriciate how much better this one is.
