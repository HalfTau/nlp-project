Havent played this since August 2015, but i still feel compelled to give this a review. Assassins Creed 2 is probably my personal favourite of the AC series with Black Flag following in Second. Everything about this game was done very well, the storyline, the gameplay, the exploration, the different cities, the soundtrack and of course the main characator himself Ezio. The graphics although not superb still hold up to todays standards. Assassins creed are known for long drawn out sidemissions and repeditive gameplay but something about this installment kept it all very fresh and interesting. The whole thing felt like a total adventure and i loved every minute of it, and my hours played prove this. i have most of the other installents on my uplay account so unfortunatley i cant review them on steam but they still are not as enjoyable as this this installment. The only problem i kind of had was the controls which took a while to get used to but as regards problems or complaints thats it. Anyone who has not this game in the series should definitley try it. it will get a second playthrough from me in the future.
