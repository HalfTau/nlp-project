Commonly perceived as the best assassins creed created, it is hard to disagree with everyone. Stunning views of Firenze and Venice with accurate depictions of events at the time. UBISOFT have done an outstanding job with this game. From the free Climbing that we loved from the first game to the carnival scenes and missions. This is a must play and I would highly recommend playing this absolutely amazing game.10/10
