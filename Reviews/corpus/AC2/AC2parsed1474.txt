By far one of my favorites games. I grew up in Italy so seeing all the Italian scenery gave me a sense of nostalgia I enjoyed throughout the gameplay.The soundtrack is brilliant the graphics amazing, all things considered and although not extremely challenging, the battles are enjoyable. The plot is very interesting and the characters encountered even more so I freaking ADORE Leonardo.Side effects of playing this for too long Makes you wanna learn parkour.
