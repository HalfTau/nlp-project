First, DO NOT listen to the negative reviews for UPlay servers being down. There are many threads explaining how to uninstall the UPlay launcher and then reinstalling a newer version. Very easy to do. Once you get to playing, you are pulled into a fantastic open world. Almost everything in the game is extremely gratifying, and if you have not picked up this game, do it. One other piece of advice is to use a controller while playing this game. I am about a quarter of the way through the game, and Ive been playing with a keyboard, but its given me some trouble. Other than that, do not hesitate to buy this game and enjoy!
