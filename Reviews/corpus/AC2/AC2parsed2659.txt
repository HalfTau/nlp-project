Obvious negative Uplay. However, you can disable Uplays ingame interface, so its not too intrustive.After coming off of Assassins Creed 1 and having to actually FORCE myself through it, I kept hearing Assassins Creed 2 is leaps and bounds better! And, lo and behold, it was! I really did enjoy my time in Italy. Its beautiful, the story is fun, and the gameplay is great. One thing to note for controller players, though, it does not have FULL controller support. Youll have to have memorized what buttons do what and when because all they give you is symbols to work with.Assassins Creed 2 was a huge leap forward for the series, and I highly recommend that you give it a try.
