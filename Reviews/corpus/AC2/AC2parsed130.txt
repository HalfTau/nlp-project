Well, this is not a very good game for me. Almost boring, the story just so goddamn short, even I can complete 3 sequence in 1 hour. And the most disturbing of all of this is, well, Auditore Cape bug. Im stuck at the cinematic scene, and I cant go anywhere. And you know what? They Ubisoft tells me to just restart the goddamn savefile! They have no idea to fix this bug lolVery boring, short, and buggy. 10/10 would never play this game again.
