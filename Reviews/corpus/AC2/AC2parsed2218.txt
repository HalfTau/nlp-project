This is an amazing game. In many aspects it is better then the first Assassins Creed.Pros Captivating story. Although you can sense a little bit of what might be coming, I was still amazed that they went full blast on that concept. Not as repetitive as AC 1. Great graphics, and environment in general. History lives and breaths in this game. From music, through architecture, details and famous and fabulous painting. Even weaponry of the era. Eagle vision is useful! Interesting characters. Decent length of game play.Cons not many Combat is very similar to one from the original game. Can feel clumsy a bit sometimes. Although you have a wide variety of weapons to chose from, I hardly ever used throwing knives unlike AC 1 or felt necessity to use short blade unlike AC 1 again. From time to time you might get irritated when cameras twists and turns mess up your jumping or other acrobatics. Although far less bugs happened, Ive captivated pretty hilarious one. In Venice you may encounter legions of guards on one tiny bit of rooftop. Out of the sudden. They just HAPPENED there. The more you killed trying to clear out the area, the more would pop up in their sted. Creepy.Apart from that, the game is one of the rarer kinds when you have a blast playing and can learn some history. This is of great value as well, and AC series so far has been also educative. I know Ill be fishing for other titles of AC now. Yeah, Ive heard the rumours about meh protagonist in AC III but... I must yet get disappointed by any game of the series. So far so good.Recommended!
