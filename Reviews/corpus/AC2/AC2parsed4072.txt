For a game that came out in 2009 released on PC in 2010 playing this in 1440p on max settings makes it look better than a lot of games that come out these days.If you are like me and only played 3 and 4 before this you are missing out. This quite possibly could be the best game in the series, unlike the new ones there is no repetitive missions, the story is meaningful and it makes you want to come back for more.A few things that are a bit annoying is that the controls are very bad if you are using a keyboard, it does not tell you which keys to press but rather icons, this can be a tedious task flipping back and forth to the controls menu and the game but once you get used to it it is pretty good.Guards are very hard to kill in this game, I cannot stress that enough. The guards come in different sizes and it is sometimes very annoying and boring constantly spamming the hit button. But perhaps thats because Im not as skilledOverall, a very good game. I am looking forward to the next segment of the Ezio trilogy.9/10
