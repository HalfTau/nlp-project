It is a super fun game in the mid 6 hours of playing this game I had a lot of fun jumping around but there are...issues first one is the controls for pc they are very confusing meaning you cant just jump in you have to go to the controls menu and learn the controls which is very frustratingbut fun once you got them down. My second is the launcher it was made in swedeen and dosnt really work that well because uplay can...break it become frustrating losing the game but people will help out on the forms but it still shouldent happend at all.it stopped my gameplay and the signs of this about to go dead is when it starts failing to do parkour because spoiler aleat!when I got out of the animus and into the dram stage I couldent climb a serten part of the tower. I wondered why and tried resteting the game but then uplay crashed then i thourght to reset the game but uplay was still broken and I thought i wasted my money and i was on fire I hated that fact. When you want to play a game you just want to have fun so yeah I did but I wont pick it up for awhile 7/10
