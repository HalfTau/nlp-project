Well this game is probably the best game in the AC series personally though I prefer syndicate. It had a compelling backstory for our protagonist No spoilers!. It featured many historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Niccol Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza etc. The parkour is the best its even been. The melee combat is a bit just like mashing 2 toys together sometimes for my liking. Overall the best AC game!Tl DRProsGreat parkourGood storyFeatures famous people and their historyA really cool tomb system basically like the new tomb raider gamesConsOccasional bugs in combatMade by Ubisoft Im hoping Watch Dogs 2 When I get it will redeem Ubisoft in my eyesIm giving it a.8.75/10P.S If you are planning to start playing some of the AC series, start with AC2.
