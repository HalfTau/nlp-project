Because of this game i fell in love with ac. I hadnt even played ac 1 before this. Im a huge fan f the series and this game will always be my favorite game ever. I played it a long time ago. Not on this account. So just ignore the fact that i havent played this game on this account yet xD. Im a huge fanboy of the series so i might not be completly objective. This is all my opinion!Story We follow EZIO AUDITORE DA FIRENZE!!!!!!!!!!! He is an amaizng character! Just play the story! I love it. Thats all im gonna say about Ezios story. Desmonds story got big in this game. spoilers warning so if you care about the modern day dont read further, just continue at gameplay You have to escape Abstergo! Wich is so cool.Gameplay The game is very old. About 7/8 years i think. And i still enjoy the gameplay a lot. The free running system is very good. Fighting is easy to learn and pretty easy to master.graphics Its a very old game so its not really good.verdict Ac 2 is the best ac imoI would highly recommend this to everyone.
