AC2 is almost perfection in my book. While it seems a little bit easier in combat than the first game, the story, the side quests, the customization, the dialogue, the scinarios, the controls  everything is much improved from the first game. While at first I wasnt too big on the Italian setting, it grows on you. It brings quite a bit more variety than the first game. Also the side quests are quite interesting as opposed to the first game  the game directly rewards you for doing sidequests, instead of some silly gimmick. Altiars/Brutus armor come to my mind. The addition of an Inventory and currency is very welcome as well... Cant wait to finish it and move on to Brotherhood.
