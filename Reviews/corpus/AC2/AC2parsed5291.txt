Assassins Creed II is such an improvement over the original game which, while fun to explore and leap around, had not much to actually do except the core assassinations.This adds apart from new weapons and an obvious new era to go around in, a good set of side missions and extra things to do. I explored everything and it was amazing fun for moderate periods of time. You can make things more difficult with selfimposed ways of doing the missions too. There are also additional tombs you need to complete which usually are much more about jumping then combat or stealth.The fighting is pretty reasonable timed counter moves, varieties of weapons. Still pretty easy and no difficulty select anywhere to be found.The improvements to the writing are also welcomed since there are a ton of cutscenes. Bad guys are villianous and evil! Good guys are nice and humorous! You can ignore it being a recreation of the past via. DNA if you so wish. Seeing historical figures talk is great fun!
