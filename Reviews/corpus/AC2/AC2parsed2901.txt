The Altar is dead, long live the Ezio.The game is basically the same as the first, but this time... it is personal! Dumn Dumn Duuummmmmnnn! Camera fates  scene twists to closeup over the shoulder of an young man in the middle of ancient FlorenceBesides main character Raymond forgot about him? you are playing as Ezio Auditore de Iforgot and he is as cool and manly as his name is. Singlehanded trying to take revenge on the death of his father and brother he might as well suffer through it and commit suicide after the first 12 minutes ingame, but not him! He has so many girls to hit on  and he needs to rescue his mother and sister for an less important reason to stay alive. Anyway  Fighting his way out of the town, learning about the Assassins, he becomes cooler than Altar ever was and you start to learn so many things that are really important for the super cool character that you havent had forgotten now?! Raymond Miles, the boy in the Anuminus... Aluminus... in the thing with the memory ...memorything.10/10 way better ways of death from above than in the first game, plus Character with charism
