Just bough it on sale first timer on Assassins Creed and even before getting to the game, I have to register with some stupid UPLAY. WTH? I bought on Steam, I dont need another  program love Steam though to be able to play the game I just payed for.Its like the dumb Windows Games thing. Why are these things on Steam?? Why doesnt Steam warn people before they buy the game...Seriously GFY Ubisoft!Want my  back.EDIT after 1hr of play The gameplay and controls are very bad. No proper tutorial, controls guide with a head,foot,hand and other symbols  really? Cant you just say shift, space etc.??No more Ubisoft for me
