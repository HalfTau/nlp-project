At first I didnt pay much mind to Assassins Creed. Big mistake. When I was gifted this game I felt like it would probably not be the best game. I was wrong on the highest level possible. If youre not playing Assassins Creed, youre missing out. The fighting is more than just beatemup style. You can counter attacks and instantly kill enemies. You assassinate highup people responsible for a conspiracy behind the death of your father, and brothers. You even have a pistol later on in the game! Plus, you get to kill a corrupt politician with the title of doge. Thats another bonus to people tired of that twelvie may may.
