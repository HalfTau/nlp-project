Great game, good graphics, good gameplay. Only problem is that once youve completed the story, the only thing left to do is be a completionist and get the game to 100.  After that you have 3 options. 1  Restart. 2  Walk around ad enjoy murdering people at the end game. or 3  GET THE NEXT GAME. After completing all 3 of these options, I have concluded that option 3 worked the best for me. Overall great game, good story, but after the story theres really only 1 option.
