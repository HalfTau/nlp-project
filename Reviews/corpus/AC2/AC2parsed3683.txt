Keep in mind that the game itself is good but Uplay is annoying AF.I highly recommend this game, I was new to the Assassins Creed franchise and chose this one to be the first of their games that I play, and let me tell you its great, if you love open world enviroments for you to explore this is just perfect.You can run and jump around like a madman and explore everything, the world feels emmersive and I rarely get pulled out, also when it comes to the fighting its more about stealth than beating up everything in sight, which I love. The story is pretty good, I got into it pretty easily.All I can say past that is buy it, if you want you could try and wait around for a sale but personally its worth the full price.
