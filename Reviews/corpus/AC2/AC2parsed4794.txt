The second game in the series previous game Assassins Creed, next game Assassins Creed Brotherhood, this has several graphical and control style updates over the previous game.  In addition, currency and purchases for upgrades are added, and you have a villa to renovate as well.  All in all a solid game in a solid series.  Strongly recommended to play with a controller but easily playable with keyboard and mouse as well.
