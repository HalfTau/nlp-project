Great Game but...The game itself is great. Gameplay is fun and the storyline is pretty good too. Graphics are decent but..The game randomly lags. I have a decent laptop 3Ghz 8GB, with built in graphics at 1GB and the thing still lags. After awhile I figued out the only way to fix this is either restart your computer or give it a few hours before starting again. This is really annoying but besides this it is an awesome game.As a side note Ubisoft have never been well know for their amazing console ports. I had problems with Far Cry 3 for awhile but it was later fixed
