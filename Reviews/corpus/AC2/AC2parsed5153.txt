My praises toward the Assassins Creed series may be starting to sound a bit fanboyish, but what can I say?I reviewed Assassins Creed a while back and there wasnt much I didnt enjoy about the game. Given it felt repetitive at times and the controls werent best suited for pc.Assassins Creed II looks and feels a lot like its predecessor the game mechanics are pretty much the same. There are a few new attacks and movement altogether feels slightly improved. It might be just me though.Ubisoft has done a great job improving both gameplay and the atmosphere.The plot is now more compelling and even the cutscenes are fun to watch.Theyve even managed to keep the amount of collectibles reasonable this time.As for criticism the game kind of feels like a facelift. The environment, mechanics and objectives are so similar to Assassins Creed that even though the story is interesting and different, it feels like there couldve been more to it.
