I never was a huge fan of the whole openworld GTA thing. After playing this, I found it to provide much fun, although its a little overrated. The characters and story are interesting at least, bravely taking place over the course of several years. However, the whole revenge aspect grows a bit redundant over time and youll find yourself doing the same tasks over and over. But give it a try, its still worth the money!
