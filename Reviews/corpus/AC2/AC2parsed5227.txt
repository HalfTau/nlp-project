Played em all, and I think this is still the best AC game. Compelling story takes you throughout Ezios life, rewards throughout the game shake things up a bit, and the varied and beautiful settings put its predecessor and even its successors in some ways to shame. Dont play this first, of course ... but be sure to play it.
