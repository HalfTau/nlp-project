I dont care how good the game is for me, it is the same as AC1, but it has UPlay. It wont let you play without it. And who wants to install UPlay? So this made me crack a game that I legally bought. A lotta pointless work, since I spent more time finding cracked exes in order to make it run than I spent actually playing. And since altogether I put in more than 5 hours, 3 of which was making it UPlayfree.  that. Go play anything outside of UPlay.Never go full UPlay. Never.
