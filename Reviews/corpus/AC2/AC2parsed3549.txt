This game is the best no doubt, of the Assassins Creed Franchise.The combat is fastpaced, and free running is fun. The only quirk is sometimes you will jump backwards from where you really want to climb. The game is simple, it is easy, but can be challenging and frustrating at times, like with those annoying tailing missions. The story is excellent but for the first installment of the Ezio franchise it can get a bit dull. Like with the part where you help that group of bandits fight the guards, it just seemed like the same mission over and over again.Story Excellent but can be rather dull. 8/10Combat Not very smooth, its better in Assassins Creed 3 and above that. 7.5/10Controls Playing this on a PC, the controls take getting used to and might seem weird at first but once you get used to them they are great. They are customisable also. 10/10Charecters A lot of charecter development and you can feel the sadness of Ezio when his family was hung. 9.5/10Overall This game is amazing and is definitely worth it for 20 dollars.
