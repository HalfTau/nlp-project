In my oppinion, the last proper game Ubisoft made. Love this game, its basically a straight upgrade from the first one, It leaves out the whole investigation system from the first game which I really liked but I can live without and added a metric ton of content and new mechanics. The characters are memorable and you really feel like the world around you is alive. Unlike Assassins Creed 3 In my oppinion atleast.Also I swear Uplay is absolute It went through like 10 updates, as if it was installing the first uplay browser all the way to the la one. And on top of all that you NEED to make a special Uplay account, EVEN THOUGH you are already signed in to steam.But yes if you can get passed the whole Uplay BS you can enjoy a great game. Get the game if you liked the first one, this one takes those concepts and enhances them tenfold.
