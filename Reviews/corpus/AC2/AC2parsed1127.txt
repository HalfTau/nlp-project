It may not have modern graphics.The animations may look a little bit off.Ezios hands sometimes go through objects instead of touching them.It may not have multiplayer.It may not have the biggest map.But by God, its a ing brilliant game with a stunning soundtrack, and the best Assassins Creed ever made. I do not think that Ubisoft will ever top this game. Everything about it is simply superb.
