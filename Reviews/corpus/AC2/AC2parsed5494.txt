Very fun game!The controls can be a bit hard to get used to at first if you havent played much of AC1. For the most part, the movement is fluid, but a few times Ezio got stuck or made a weird decision to leap off the side of a building for no reason...Much better than what I glimpse from the 1 hour or so Ive played of AC1, though the combat is still quite slow and focuses on counterattacks.Campaign does look to be about 20 hours long, though if you do all the side missions and object hunts, it might push 35 hours. However, dont make my mistake and try looking for all the treasures BEFORE finishing the campaign, because that really make you tired PBiggest complaint I have is that, for an assassin, Ezio is too strong in normal combat. Sure, he should be good, but there really is no incentive for staying in cover, except that it doesnt waste your time. Id like to see battles that I know I will lose if I fight, but right now a 1v8 fight is actually a 1v1 fight 8 times.
