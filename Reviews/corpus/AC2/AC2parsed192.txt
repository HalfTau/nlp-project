Definitely an improvement to the first game, I fully enjoyed this one. Took just a touch over 24 hours to beat, with doing some side stuff, but not all.The only issue that lingered from the first game is the issue I had with physics, but in some cases it was worse in this one. If you kill a guy near a drop off, you will more  than likely fall. After the body hits the ground, it likes to flop, sometimes kicking you off the edge with it. It got annoying, but it was in no way game breaking although it did kill me a couple times.I loved the feature with rebuilding Villa Auditore. It never got old, and I collected every armor and weapon because of it. Same with purchasing every painting. It was enjoyable.The Parkour was a big improvement over the first one as well, but the camera was not always on your side. Especially during the Assassins Tomb segments. You might be rushing up an area, then out of no where the camera does a turn, and you miss the jump. It didnt happen all to often, I did end up getting used to it, and taking my time helped.All in all, this was a much better experience from the first game. I highly recommend it.
