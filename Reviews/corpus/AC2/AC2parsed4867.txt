The saga continues after Desmond is freed by Lucy from Abstergo. By using an improved version of the Animus Desmond this relives the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th Century in Florence. Slight improvements to the gameplay and still that familiar feeling game play of moving your character, Ezio, stealthily through a crowd, make stealth kills, climb, run over roofs, and admire vistas of the cities Venice, Florence, Forl, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside in an unbelievable way.Highly recommended, rated 10 out of 10.
