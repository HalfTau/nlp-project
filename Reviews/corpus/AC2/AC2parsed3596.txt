Assassins Creed II is the second part of an ever growing action adventure franchise, perhaps one of the better ones in its series.GoodGood story with plenty of emotions. Some memorable moments in fights. Thrilling assassin missions. Parkour is fun when working properly. Lots of mysteries and collectibles. Well designed cities and tombs. Micromanagement options.BadBroken, stuttering, accelerated mouse camera controls. Using a controller is painful. The automatic camera movement is useless. Tombs are frustrating to complete, because every third jump is missed due to the terrible camera angles. Combat and freerunning sometimes not work as intended making harder to finish difficult sections. Uplay just ed up hours of my progress with a save sync!Overall, the game should be one of the brightest spots of the series, but it has serious issues. Both fighting and freerunning/parkour can be so glitchy at times that they mostly spoil the fun. Also, as long as Uplay is in the picture, I would not recommend this game even for free.Graphics 8/10World Design 8/10Gameplay 7/10Sound 9/10Replay Value 8/10Uplay 5/10
