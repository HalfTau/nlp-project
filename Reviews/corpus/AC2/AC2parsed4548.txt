So far my review is a first impression for my first two hours of gameplay. THe story so far seems alittle linear but with a pontentiality of branching off. The environment even for todays time is still beautifull for thosse who know graphics dont make up for anything. My biggest problem for the game wasfiguring out the controls at first. Having colored icons for pc controls absolutely did no elp but once you mentally map the controls it goes pretty flawless. THis is my first Assasins Creed and starting with the second one doesnt leave you too much out of the plot. The combat can be alittle strange somewhat similar to Batman Arkum Asylum. It is just a matter of getting down the timming and process of getting the most efficient kill. SO far te game is very good and has a potential to either crash in flames or do good.
