The incredible amount of improvements made over the first AC game are so extensive it is not even funny. Parkour is still a bit buggy but drastically improved.The major negatives are an annoying heavy blur/gloom filter on everything, espically distant objects. Also sword sound effects have a permanent wet sounding echo to them, that yes, should exist in certain situations, but is way overdone in this game. Sword fighting outdoors does not cause such a deep reverb eco.Overall tho a decent game compared to the original. This game is weaker when held up against newer AC games.
