Assassins Creed II is an awesome game. However, for someone with a older mac book pro, the game is probably the laggiest game I have ever played. The story and gameplay is great, but the cutscenes lag so much it is very painful to watch. Even the game itself lags so combat is difficult. Overall, this is a fun game but if you have an old mac, I would mabye think twice.
