Im not intending to make a long review because there is not very much to say except for the fact that yes, the game is GOOD and deserves to be played its not only the most acclaimed AC of all time for nothing. Sadly, the mechanics werent the most awesome at that time but the rest is quite good, with the STORY making up for the negatives. I also enjoyed the setup  15th century Italy was a charm, and another thing that I remarked to be extraordinary  the MUSIC, and finally the characters personality, EZIO seems indeed the greatest Assassin of the series. Btw, had only 3 crashes in 50hrs  100 full synch. Anyway, thats it, have fun!
