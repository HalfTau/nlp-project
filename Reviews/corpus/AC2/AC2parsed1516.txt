Recommended. Abssolutely fantastic game. Major upgrade in story and execution after kinda repetive missions of Assassins Creed. Some controls on PC are awkward but thats minor issue mostly in tombs with time runs. The story is fine and i hope it will progress nicely in AC brotherhood im doing AC marathon.
