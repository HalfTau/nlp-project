Assassins Creed 2 was universally regarded as an improvement over the first game and I am of the same opinion. Gone are the same repetitive side quests at every turn. Instead we get a game more expansive and with more depth than its predecessor and a beautifully crafted medieval Italy to explore and experience. The protagonist, Ezio, is also an improvement over Altair feeling more like a protagonist rather than a puppet that the player guides through the game world. Assassins Creed 2 is definitely one of the best titles in the series.
