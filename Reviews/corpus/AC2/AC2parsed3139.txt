The best Assassins Creed game, and one of the greatest games of last gen. Expands and improves upon virtually every aspect of the first game. In many ways, after playing 2, its easy to see 1 as a tech demo for 2. Everything about Assassins Creed 2 comes together almost perfectly. The setting, Ezio, the story, the themes, the improved gameplay, the amazing music by the equally amazing Jesper Kyd. Everything about the game ties together almost perfectly. One of the greatest gaming experiences Ive had the pleasure of having. Get it. Almost everything is great about it, and then play Brotherhood.
