This game is better than the original Assassins Creed in every way. Where the original felt repetitive and the environments all felt similar, Assassins Creed 2s Italy is beautiful, although now a bit dated. The armor and clothing is vibrant and well crafted, and the combat, exploration, side missions and story are miles ahead of the original. The protagonist, Ezio, is likeable and entertaining. I would highly recommend giving this game a chance, even if youve disliked or havent played AC1.Assassins Creed 2 is tied with AC4 Black Flag for my favorite game in the series. With that said, I would also recommend playing AC Brotherhood and AC Revelations if you enjoy this game. They continue and complate Ezios story.
