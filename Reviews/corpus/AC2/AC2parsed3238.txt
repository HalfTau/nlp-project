Really? People complaining about UPlay? Disregard them. UPlay is not a big deal in this game. It even unlocks more content! When you play this game for the first time, UPlay will crash and no AC2. Theres an easy way to work around this.  Uninstall UPlay, go to UbiSofts website and install the UPlay client off their website, run it once, and then youre golden. You may need to restart your computer after reinstalling UPlay So, with that out of the way, the game part of the review.Its a solid game! Gameplay is a huge improvement from the first, the parkour and freerunning is easy to use better than AC Unity, and the grahpics are amazing! Controls are good I used KB/M, not controller and there isnt a ton of GUI in your face cough Unity COUGH.So, spend 20 dollars for about 30 hours of game? I would. Heck, when its on sale, dont forget to buy your ol friend AC2!TLDRIf you let the people crying about UPlay get to you, youll be missing out.
