Still the best Assassins Creed, and Ive played most of them. When I think about what made this game so special, I think about these five reasons1. Ezio  story. Ezio is by far the strongest lead character the series has ever had, and the story is engaging right from the start all the way until the mindblowing ending. Other characters are great as well.2. Glyphs. These cryptic puzzles are scattered all around the cities, hidden from plain sight but revealed using your special vision. Theyre fascinating, creepy as hell, and addictive. And each one you find contributes towards an important piece of information in the story. Its glaring that they scrapped these in later AC installments.3. Music. Jesper Kyd created the soundtrack and its nothing short of stellar. YouTube it if you dont believe me.4. Challenge and pacing. Progression and difficulty feel just right.5. You get to.This isnt just the best Assassins Creed, its a fantastic and memorable game on its own right so enjoyable that it made AC1 feel like a tech demo in comparison. If you could only play one Assassins Creed, play this one.
