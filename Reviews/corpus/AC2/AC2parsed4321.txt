Assassins Creed 2 is probably one of the best games to ever be created.If you like exploring tombs, killing guards, an amazing storyline, and speaking to Leonardo D Vinci while he upgrades and makes you weapons then please get this game.I could go on and on about how good this game is but I will be here for ever, only thing is, that Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is probably just about beating Assassins Creed 2 as in its graphics and storyline. Get this game first before you buy Assassins Creed Brotherhood, otherwise the story will not make much sense.Get Assassins Creed 2.
