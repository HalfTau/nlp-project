I love sandbox games and this ones a good one. I recommend it for people who enjoy completionism and sneak games. I give it an 8/10, for the following reasonsProsMultiple ways to complete objectivesSide quests and collections have a reason/rewardDecent play timeHistorical figures in a fictional settingConsFive forced fightsDesmond stuffCant add to quick menuHints come with button colors and picturesNo firm endingI play on PC using keyboard/mouse, and the controls can be set up for shiftsprint like normal, so the port wasnt an issue. The hints were overcome once you have the pictures memorized, and turning off the HUD removed the controller aspect.The game leads to the sequel and thus feels a bit incomplete main storywise the Desmond stuff, but the parts that take place in the past are fulfilled.Overall, I would recommend this game.
