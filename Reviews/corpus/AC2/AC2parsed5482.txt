The first Assassins Creed was a minor groundbreaker, heralding the return of the stealth genre and telling a multilayered story within a wonderfullyrealized world. Ultimately, however, the bland main character, sheer repetitiveness of the mission design, and abrupt ending kept a good game from achieving greatness. Fast forward two years, however, and Ubisoft Montreal had crafted Assassins Creed II, a sequel that was superior to the original in every conceivable way. Moving from the middle east to Europe got rid of the monochromatic desert locales, giving way to vibrant cityscapes bustling with color, denizens, and side missions. That latter detail, along with the streamlined story structure, effectively eliminated the first games biggest flaw. The main story path no longer consisted of having to perform the same mundane tasks over and over again to clear a path to the target. Each memory was now its own, selfcontained concoction of writing, combat, and sneaking that added tangible weight to the players actions. II also served to introduce the gaming world to Ezio Auditore, to this day the series most beloved protagonist, as well as to famous faces from history that would become a series staple. Machiavelli, Pope Alexander the Sixth, and Leonardo Da Vinci each left impressions that characters from the first could only dream of. Even the presentday storyline got a face lift, fleshing out the characters to the point of acceptance by the majority of the players, as well as ending on a nailbiting cliffhanger that neatly paved the way for future installments. There may have been more bodies in the streets, but to this day, Assassins Creed has never felt so alive.SCORE 10/10
