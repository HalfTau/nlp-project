First off this port is bad, I know that isnt a fault on the game itself but it is good to know.Overall the gameplay is a lot less stealthy/cool than it pretends to be, leading to most kills just involving walking up and stabbing people rather than the exciting roof jumps that the trailers bill and like many ubisoft games the large map of repetative mission types gets old fast.
