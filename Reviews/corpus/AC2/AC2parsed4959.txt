The second installment of the most awesome franchise ever.The new ancestor of Desmond Miles is Ezio Auditore,which would easily be my favourite Assassin 3This game is definitely recommended,it has stronger emphasis on openworld exploration and interaction, nonlinear gameplay and greater mission variety compared to the first Assassins Creed. The game was also credited with improved nonplayer character AI and combat mechanics, and its new economic system allowing players to purchase accessories, armor, and improved weapons through the course of the game.
