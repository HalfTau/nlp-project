If you still have not bought this game then I ask you WHY? This game takes the excellent ideas in the first one and makes them fun!!! Yea, what weve been waiting for.This is most peoples favorite of the Assassins Creed games. It introduced Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the by far most likeable protagonist perhaps because he has a personality! This was also the FIRST game with Ezio so he wasnt old hat yet.The new setting of renaissance Italy is great. The cities, like in the first game feel different Florence is huge with large cathedrals and town squares and Venice is more cramped with canals, but unlike the first game the cities seem varied. One block in Florence looks different from another block in Florence.One of the bigger additions to the game was money a staple in the series now. Money is fcking useless! I breezed through the whole game and bought nothing. Literally NOTHING. You can also use money to renovate your villa to gain more money, but this is boring as fck!Even though that shts dumb, most of the new features are interesting. There are loads of new murdering gadgets and more missions than before. It has gone from 10 hours of tedium and some fun to like 30 hours of fun.SPOILERSAlso, the final boss is the pope, so thats a plus if youre into channeling your papal anger.
