After a few years from the first game, I came back to play through the second part of the series and was not disappointed. At first I was a little lost from the different playstyles I spent a while trying to figure out what button it was to blend in with crowds, until I was eventually shown through the story how to be a noob 101, here. Im a huge fan of the story, and I have to say, the ending got me. Definitely worth it, after the initial struggles.Initially, getting the game to actually run was a problem. Steam didnt actually give me the Uplay launcher, per se, and because I did not know that I needed it, I was getting frustrated that I couldnt actually play the game that I had just bought. Looking through for answers, I was a bit annoyed that I had to go download a whole new launcher just to get the game to run, but I sucked it up and dealt with it, as Im sure a number of other players have already done, and will continue to do. Aside from that initial issue, I didnt have a single problem with functionality or anything of the sort, so thats a plus.Ive now set my scopes on part III, because I want to know how Desmonds story really ends and dont want to do it the cheap way and search it on the internetwheres the fun in that?.
