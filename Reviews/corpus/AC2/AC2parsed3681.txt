Just as AC1 most should know this game by now and to a lot of them this had one of the best storys in the seriesthey added a lot in this one comparied to the first and changed a lot fo the machanics which was nice i wont say so no spoilers for any who havnt played but if you played the first you will see the changesOver all its a great game and fun to play even the story is pretty niceOff the game a bit onto RequirmentsUnlike the first this one does require Uplay and a active Uplay account some claim its couse of that the game doesnt work right and such that is falseThe game will lag at time and does run hard on the pcs but its not Uplay its there codding in the game itself longs you have ana ctual gammking pc that sint from 10 years ago you should be fine and should run smooth. this is one of those games you really need the recamendded system stats not the lower end ones
