Probably the best Assassins Creed game ever created. The world is so amazingly well put together and the graphics are very nice. However i hate the storyline of the entire Assassins Creed series. The present part of this game is so dull. If only this entire part were to be kept out of the game it would be a pleasure to many Assassins Creed players. The time spending as Ezio however is amazing. Ezio is and will stay the best Assassins Creed main protagonist.I hope you will enjoy this game as much as i have enjoyed it.
