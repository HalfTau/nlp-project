first off, i would love to review this game because Assassins creed 2 is one of my absolute favorite of the series, which i have spent many hours playing on the PS3. UNFORTUNATELLY Uplay crashes every single time i load this game up, ive had it for several months, and still have not actually played it yet.would i reccommend this game for PS3/360?  absolutely. Steam?  Not from what i have experianced. i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and Uplay always crashes each time.
