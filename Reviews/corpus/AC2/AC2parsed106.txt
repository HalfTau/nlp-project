AC2 Deluxe Edition is my first AC game in my life, even if this game look like so old since 2010, however, to me the graphic is still so nice . Yeah I like that.Graphic I give 10/10, graphic setting and resolution is attractive and so beautiful.Gameplay I give 9.5/10, I love to climb the wall of building, jump across the building, look the beautiful scenario on the top of building and punch the people.Story I give 9/10, good storyline.Soundtrack I give 10/10, Best soundtrack ever !!!Overall 9.6/10.Of course, this is my personal opinion to recommend  every people to play it. But the only one thing I want to say is Ubisoft is definitely a money hungry, every uplay games need cost the money LOL!!! Shut up and just take my money, Ub1tchsoft!!!
