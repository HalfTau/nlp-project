Amazing game. Amazing history.... Buuuuuuuut the controlls are a huge nightmare and the Contextual Camera only comes in the worst moments of parkour to screw you up. Controlls and Camera are enough to make your gametime a waste, boring and anoyin over thousand. I rather spend my time playing other.P.s. and yes, Uplay increase the problem at 1000.
