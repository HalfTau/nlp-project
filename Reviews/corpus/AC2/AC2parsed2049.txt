Just purchased this game today, though I have owned it for X360, as well as PS3 in the Ezio Trilogy. However since I no longer own any consoles, Im in the process of obtaining all the games again. I was uncertain about this, as Ive heard many horror stories of problems ranging from technical issues to just downright not even being able to play the game due to Uplay. That being said, here was my experience with the game.Upon initial startup, it would not load with an error stating that the Uplay service was unavailable. This was easily fixed by downloading the current Uplay client from the website. Once I did that and installed, I restarted the game. Uplay loaded fine, linked accounts perfectly and the game started right up. I was very happy with this as this was one of the main reasons I had held off on the PC versions of this series.I then ran into controller issues. I have an Xbox One controller and it did not want to work, whatsoever. There is, however, a fix located in the forums that solved this issue, with some minor tweaking to get the triggers to work. After this, the game plays just like its console counterpart.Other than that, Ive had one hard crash upon exiting to Windows, though this was more of a hang than a crash. I had to log out of my Windows profile and back in to kill the game. This caused it not to sync with my cloud, but it still saved my game to my HDD, and I was able to sync upon my next play session.So, all in all, while it may not be as plug n play as its console brethren, I still reccomend this game to anyone who loved AC, as this, along with Brotherhood was its pinnacle. The graphics are great for their time, gameplay is smooth so far, though I havent obviously played long enough to comment on any glitches or bugs. But so far, smooth 60fps. So happy to have this game again, its one of my all time favorites.
