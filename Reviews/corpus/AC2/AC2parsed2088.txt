The story is something good and as Ezio, you troll around in Italy and assassinate guards and evil leaders. But the BIG negative about this, is that the buttons you need to have control over isnt funny at all. This game is created for xbox and got like the stylish X,Y,B,A buttons in the top left corner.... ANNOYING, but still one of the best games in Assassins Creed Franchise. 6/10
