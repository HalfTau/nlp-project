Please dont buy this game.I mean its ok I guess, but the graphics are outdated. Im sure they looked cool and realistic at the time, but now theyre just creepy. The controls arent clear for people playing without a plug in controller. The worst thing though is stupid Uplay, which is ubisofts way of forcing you to make an account on a website which wouldve looked bad in 1990.Its a good enough game, the storys ok or whatever, but its outdated, and youd be better just buying a newer assassins creed.
