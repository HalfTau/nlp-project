Despite the fact that the controls are terrible in this game, I really enjoyed playing this game. The problem with the controls is that they never mention the key you need to press for a certain action. For example, theyll show a hand icon to steal money, and not the actual keyboard key to use for the action. So you have to go into the menu, to learn which key is bound to that icon. Its really annoying and had me waste a lot of time, trying to memorize all the keys.Overall the game is amazing. I really like the gameplay. This was the first AC game I played and it got me hooked to the franchise.7/10 For bad controls. Although I think a controller would work perfectly for this game.
