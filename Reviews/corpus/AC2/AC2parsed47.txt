Assassins Creed II is a particularly interesting game that highlights the coming of age for the main character, Ezio. The PC controls take time to get used too, but you will adapt. The missions are decent, sometimes repetitive. As for the graphics, this game hasnt exactly aged well. That being said, youre going to want to play this game for the story and the main character as its quite good. Cant wait to see where Brotherhood and Revelations lead me.
