One of the best assassins creed In the series but the controls are a little different from the assassins creed now since they have easier controls and better graphics so if you like story based assassins creed i would get it but if your more just kill everything then i wouldnt and dont let the uplay reviews get to you i havent had a single problem with uplay.
