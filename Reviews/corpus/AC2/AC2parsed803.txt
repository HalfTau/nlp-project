The GOAT Assassins Creed game by a long stretch plus you dont have to play the first one because everything that happened in the first game gets explained at the very beginning of the second.Ezio is by far the best Protagonist Assassins Creed ever produced, strong, charismatic, charming, a ladies man but loyal. I wont spoil what happens but it is a very very good game and still a very good looking game even after all of these years.
