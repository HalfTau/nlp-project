Im glad I gave the AC series a chance, I wasnt really into AC1 since it felt very repetitive although I did like the story itself but AC2 basically gets rid of the repetitiveness and its pretty much more enjoyable. Every ascpect of the game is definitely much better than AC1. Storywise its pretty intense, awesome story with an insane ending, I was like WTF?!?!. Great game, for the 5 bucks it usually is its awesome to go through.
