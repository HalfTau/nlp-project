Ezio is one of the best written characters in gaming. I love every god damn moment with that  charismatic son of a . The entire game is worth going through to see his story unfold, and his character grow. Its a damn shame nothing happened with him in Brotherhood, and we saw the end of his story in Relevations. Ill take this dapper Italian over some halfbreed native american any day.
