I started playing the Assassins Creed games with this one. I saw many people talking really good about it and I was a little curious about the gameplay and the story.I never regret buying it!The game has good graphics and a good gameplay when you start, you can feel a little confused with all the commands, but you will get used to it.The story itself values the money you spend in this game, in the end, I was like wow, that was astonishing.I recommend it for everybody looking for a surprising and wonderful game to spend you free time hours.
