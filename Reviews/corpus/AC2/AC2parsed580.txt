Ezio Auditore da Firenze hope I spelt that right what a great character. Many cities to explore. Classic Ubisoft tower climbing and radar vision eagle vision. Controlls on PC great still recommend using controller.Combat can be a bit weird at times and the parkour isnt as good as it used to be compared to newer assassins creed games.
