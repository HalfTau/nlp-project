All in all, a pretty good game. The story can be pretty disjointed and missions are somewhat lackluster, especially near the end of the game, but the overall experience is enjoyable. The graphics hold up even this many years afterwards, and the parkour gameplay is still wonderful. Not a great stealth game either, but fun nevertheless.
