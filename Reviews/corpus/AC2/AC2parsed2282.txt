At least when I played it in 2009, I thought it was the best story driven game Ive ever played. And it still holds up 2015. Ive played this game about 10 times 150 hours with achievements etc., I think that speaks for itself.With the free mod/plugin/program SoftTH, i could play with a resolution of 5280x1080 on my 3 monitors PCMasterRace. UPlay isnt as bad as everyone says it is. No problems yet.This is probably the best in the series so far havent played Syndicate or Origins yet though.My list of the AC games II IV Black Flag Rogue Brotherhood The Original Unity III Revelations
