The first impression was a near catastrophe After downloading AC2 uPlay wants to update Then uPlay it always crashes, see fix for uPlay with permissiosn Requires an additional uPlay account wait, what about integration with Steam Then in the Tutorial you get a press Symbol but not current or default key bindingrequires to open up the options and look things up, this was definitely better in AC1Hoping the content is going to be better, but Ubisoft is here to blame for the mess with uPlay, sorry, not really a Valve issue I guess.To fix uPlay go to the folder where uPlay got installed default seems to be CProgram Files x86UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher edit the security permissions and giving full permission to the users group should suffice.
