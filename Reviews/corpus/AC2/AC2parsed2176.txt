This is a prime example of what a sequel should be.AC2 took what AC1 tried out and refined it, added to it, and generally just made playing the game that much more awesome.Storywise this one also feels like more is at stake. Opposed to being a master that loses his gear and somehow skills?, you are a true novice, never having touched the life or training of an assassin. This world is then entered in a manner that has you truly invested alojngside the character and their plight.The graphics, are once again, eyecandy, especially if you enjoy the RenneisanceItaly setting and the gameplay is streamlined in a manner that makes AC2 a joy to play, when held up to its prequel. It fixed what was wrong, and made better what was good.Word of waring, you could have gotten away without a controller playing AC1, but for some reason AC2s camera is fracked if you dont use one.
