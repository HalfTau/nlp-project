It continuously refused to load, even though my computer well outsed the standards for this game, and I have not been able to enjoy play of this game since I purchased it. U Play refuses to load aswell. Not to mention the unnessesary code you need to copy and type in when the game loads.I doubt Im doing anything wrong... Its just not up to the task, sorry Assassins Creed.
