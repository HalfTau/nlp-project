I have a computer that goes way above and beyond the system requirements for this game.  At first everything was just fine, then suddenly the frame rate drops to below 30 for absolutely no reason.  I have seen the frame rate on my high end system drop to 1, FREAKING 1 FPS.  I tried dropping the graphics to their lowest setting with no luck.  My search online has yeilded no answers.  Contacting Ubisoft will give you the usual headache of Try and update your drivers and the other cookie cutter responses.If you want to throw away 20, this is the place to do it.  Of course you could use that 20 to buy a hammer and hit yourself in the head until the demons leave.  You decide, both are equally good investments.
