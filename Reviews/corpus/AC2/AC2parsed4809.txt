Truly the best Assassins Creed experience. This game was a mindshock for me back when it came out, and no other AC can even compare to it. The story, the characters, the feeling of living and breathing in Florence and Venice is just...unique. I recommend you all to put 20 hours of your life into this unforgettable experience which will surely stick with me for decades.
