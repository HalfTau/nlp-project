A really good story with cool timeline, and long. The ending to the story is such a cliff hanger and cant wait to play the next one. Has a decent open world size for the age of the game. Its intresting to run around and climb buildings for those who are into it, not to many side quests but theres enough. Works great and didnt run into any issues with the game.
