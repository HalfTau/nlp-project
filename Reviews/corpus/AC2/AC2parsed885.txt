I think this is my favourite game ever. So much story, features, improvement on the last,But one word. It will be the most common word in the negative reviews section. And its that t  that comes with every Assassins creed game. It is resovled when pirating the game but its main aim to stop pirating.Also it took me like half an hour to start this thing with first time setup, load in UdontPLAY, even worse if its not installed yet, 2 different permission accepts and a password enter, and then finding my UdontPLAY password/account.ALSO YOU CANT REPLAY MEMORIES!! !
