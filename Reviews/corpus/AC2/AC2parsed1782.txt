Assassins Creed 2 still holds out as a personal favourite game.The story is rather captivating and the gameplay is fairly smooth and very enjoyable.Unlike newer Assasins Creed games this one does not suffer from a lot of the glitches, bugs, and major repetitve nature of many modern games.The game does not have a massive replay factor as it is a linear game however I would recommend that the game is worth playing through at least once, and that it is worth buying for at least a single playthrough.
