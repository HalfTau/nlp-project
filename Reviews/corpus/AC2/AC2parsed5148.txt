When you find yourself still awake playing this game at 6 in the morning you realize that the game you are playing is addicting.  With almost 17 hours of gameplay right now and not even halfway through the game I would recommend this game. However it is kinda frustrating trying to kill a gaurd and a musician comes right in front of your face and instead of kill a gaurd you kill the musician.  However that is just a small complaint, 9.5/10
