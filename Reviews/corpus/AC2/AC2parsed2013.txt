Assassins Creed 2 actually changes quite alot from its predecessor. Instead of collecting information on your target because of the story, you assassinate your target as it is part of the story. And like last time, there is an amazing feeling about running away and hiding from countless gaurds on your tail right after a majestic assassination. Parkour in this is similar to the last with sweet Architecture to climb and run across, giving off a completely different vibe than the original. Whats the best indicator that something is a sequel? Well the number 2 of course! Which is why you now have 2 hidden blades! Some combat animations are quite satisfying although i think its become quite easy and i still enjoy the slower paced clashes of the original with close ups of bringing down your enemies. Music has also seemed to be toned up this time around, and the mood just always feels right and nostalgic. Ezio isnt perfect, and that adds to the story, and Ill always enjoy Altair and the ancient middle eastern setting, But AC2 Is a blast with a ton of fantastic improvements and additions.
