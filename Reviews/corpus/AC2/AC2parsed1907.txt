So i bought this game cause it was on sale. When i installed the game it did a little shaking but it went away after the cutsence, i took one step in the game and the camera shakes nonstop, this is total bullshit. I demand a fix for this problem or ubisoft can give me a full refund for a game i cannot even play. I also bought Assassins Creed Rogue and they was aterrible mistake because the game wont even open. it just saying running for a second then nothing pops up, no game menu, no uplay menu. Nothing. I demand a refund for these broken games that i bought.
