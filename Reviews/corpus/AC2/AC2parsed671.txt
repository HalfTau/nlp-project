IntroductionAssassins Creed II, takes place during the height of the Renaissance in Italy.You play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the Assassin on a quest for vengeance against those responsible for betraying his family.The second title in the franchise, adds many features to the game. This includes the Hidden Gun, the ability to swim, a graphics overhaul, some flying mechanics and many refines to combat.GameplayAssassins Creed II favors stealth over fullon combat.You can run, ride horses, swim, or use paddle boats to get to your destination.Parkour has been improved from the first game, which allows for smoother and faster movement and many different animations have been added from the first.CombatThe combat in this edition of Assassins Creed, has been improved from its predecessor, becoming more fluent with appreciated changes, however there is still a sense of button mashing in there and does not require skill which i prefer.Being able to use the Hidden Gun, will bring a whole new advancement to the games combat.You can now purchase armor and weapons, which will increase health and change Ezios appearance.StoryAs stated above, you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze.He starts off the game young and reckless, until his family is hung because of templars wanting to take control. Before his father dies, he learns that his father was an Assassin. Ezio goes to collect his fathers gear and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Marios villa in the countryside. As he assassinates his targets, he identifies the mastermind of the plot the Spaniard Rodrigo Borgia. In modern day you play as Desmond Miles ,who is the ancester of Ezio Auditore, and you are on the run from the modern day templars. Unlike the first game there are more things to do in modern day suc as some missions and a little free roam.GraphicsConsidering the game was released in 2009, it doesnt have the best graphics.Colors are quite bland, shadows are horrible, and render distance is short.With a SweetFX patch, and with 4k DSR 60fps, the game doesnt look that bad.OptimizationOptimization is quite poor in this game.Frame rate will jump around a lot, no matter the settings you use.BugsEnemies will attack you even when you block them.Bad performance.Personal ExperienceBeginning of the game is rather boring, and didnt interest me all that much.Once I got to the middle of the game, I really liked it and was really interested.Performance wise, I was playing on a RX 480 with everything maxed out at 2560x1080p. I could easily manage 60fps.The game was a great improvement from the first game.ProsInteresting story.Loveable main character.Great landmarks.ConsPoor performance.Microstutters.Bland coloring.ConclusionGreat improvement over the first game, and gets interesting once youre through half of the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the Assassins Creed franchise. However if you own a xbox one or ps4 i would reccomend buying the ezio collection as there is improved graphics and it also comes with the direct sequels of ezios life. And i restarted the game on xbox so i only got 13 hours on steam then switched to xbox.
