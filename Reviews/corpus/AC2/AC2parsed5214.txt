One of my favorites in the series. I have to admit Ive become attached to the character Ezio which has made me uneasy to play Revelations knowing its the last hell be in. All in all I feel that the story of his life has been well done and drags you into it, you meet Ezio from birth and go on to see his life unfold with a wonderful expansive environment to explore and great characters to get involved with.
