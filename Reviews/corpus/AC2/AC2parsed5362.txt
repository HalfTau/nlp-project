Assassins Creed 2 is the sequel of Assassins Creed.After the few years that passed, the developers created a game far more awesome and interesting than the first one.The game is put on the 15th century, and the developers once again made brilliant exact copies of how the world was back then.Venice, Romagna, Florence are just a few of the locations implemented.Better fighting system, more RPG elements, lots of side quests, awesome graphics, unique music, better climbing features and additional sweeming abilities and free running locations.And the storyline... oh the storyline is the perfection of the game. More interesting than ever.Up to every detail the game is awesome.Recommended for sure!
