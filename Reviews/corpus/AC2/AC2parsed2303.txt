I currently havent played the PC version of the game but I am trying my best to play it now. The only problems are that it takes forever to install but yet again that goes for ALL big games, so I guess you shouldnt take that to heart, and after that I put my earphones in and thought Hey I can play this game finally! only to have that lovely prospect put under my nose before being thrown to David Camerons prize piggy, Skyrim was a large game but it didnt require all the different installs and patches this thing needed. If youve finished the first installation be aware you have another hour left. If you were prepared for this it wouldnt be that much of a biggy but I was given no prior warning to this and so its like going into a cinema and having the opening for the movie played every now and then but then it cuts to a massive string of adverts.When I finally got to the Uplay section and made an account I thought I got to play. Not very likely! The game simply froze and told me it had stopped working. I then tried to start the game up again but the same thing happened. And again. This process happened numerous times.Now I have yet to actually play the game, but while playing it on PS3 I would say it is a very good game, lots of funny stuff in it and its all very nice when you get to stab someone. But be aware getting INTO the game may take a longer time than it would take to actually get through the whole thing.I would give this game a thumbs up for the content but to be fair Id actually like to play the damn thing.
