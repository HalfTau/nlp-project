Just finally finished this after having it sit in my Steam library for too long and I have to say I understand why the Assassins Creed franchise is so popular. I enjoyed the first game, but AC2 really polishes the story up.Graphics are decent, but the combat and freerunning are what really make this game enjoyable. Very fluid and tight.There are lots of collectibles in this game and I could pretty easily find most of them barring the feathers and treasure chests. Theres just too many to be worth spending my time on.My only complaint was how lackluster the final boss fight was. I SMACKED that fatty around without even trying  mean come on isnt that supposed to be the epic boss fight? He seemed like a sissy at the hands of humble Ezio.Anyways, great fun game. Recommended. Ill probably end up purchasing the others in the franchise because of this one.
