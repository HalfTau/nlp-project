Bought this game on the autum sale and thank god I did because if I paid full price this review would be worse. I cant tell you the countless times ive had to uninstall than reinstall the game, update the uplay game files just to get the game working. Just got halfway through the game and now it wont even load. Oh well if any of you guys buy this game I hope you have a better experience than I did.
