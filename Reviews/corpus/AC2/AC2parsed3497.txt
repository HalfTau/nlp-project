The seamlessness of the parkour and, to a lesser extent, combat flow both from the first game is revolutionary in its own way. The animation is plenty enough to get excited about, and parkour chase/escape scenes work especially well, letting you focus on where you want to go and the method of your escape, whilst the execution of jumps, turns and climbs is mostly automated.Turn off the minimap. Instead, bring up the full map when you get a new objective, then follow the streets, landmarks, and your sense of direction, to find the target, and your camera to search for guards. Make yourself be drawn into the beautiful recreations of beautiful cities, the colours, the changing atmospheres, the rich environmental soundscape enhancing with understated music, and you might just fall in love with this game.
