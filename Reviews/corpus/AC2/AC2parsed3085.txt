Great game! Would have been awesome if no internet connection was required. The game was great, the story was fun, side quests were also fun, great character and assassin robe. Only negative thing to this game for me is the internet connection. I run on slow internet and it was constantly losing connection during the middle of missions forcing me to wait until my internet started working again. This caused me to get through the story quickly because it was really annoying. Looking at this game would have been amazing if my internet was good.
