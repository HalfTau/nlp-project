I can find very few faults with the Assasssins Creed series. All the games so far have been very well put together, on all fronts. The storyline is engaging, the gameplay is dynamic, and the atmosphere is beautiful.That said, AC 2 and Brotherhood suffer from the heavy hand of Ubisoft antipiracy tactics, especially on PC. They do, however, offer some incentives through the Uplay service in the form of ingame content unlockable through points gained from playing.It really comes down to your opinion on DRM with these games. They are worthwhile investments, but if youve lost your internet connection, theyre completely unplayable on PC. I can say though, owning Brotherhood on the PS3, that the console version is excellent as well, and the DRM not as draconic.Your choice.
