So after a long install process, I expected to open the game and get playing almost immediately.Instead, I was greeted with the Ubisoft launcher and its inability to connect to the internet, effectively shutting me out of the game.I spent hours searching for fixes online, but nothing I could find helped me to play the game I purchased and should be able to play.Luckily, I only wasted five dollars on this broken pieceaDo not purchase this unless you want to take a chance with the various 3rd party patches, because clearly Ubisoft isnt gonna release one themselves.
