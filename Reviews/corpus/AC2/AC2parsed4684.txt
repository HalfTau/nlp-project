A great followup to Assassins Creed. Much to my personal joy and displeasure, this game is far less about stealth, and more about getting the job done. The wotry continues to captivate, as you watch Ezio Auditore, go from being a troubled making teenager, to an Adult looking to finish what his family had started.Combat is much smother, and social interaction is the key, from making allies to blending in with crowds, and avoiding the gain of noteriety. The DLC ads even more to the story, filling in what I felt like were plot gaps, that make the Templar seem like slackers, making the Delux edition well worth the extra cost.
