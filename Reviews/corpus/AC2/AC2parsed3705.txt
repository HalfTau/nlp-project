If you loved Assassins Creed 1, then I highly recommend this game. Ubisoft took everything about the first Assassins Creed and  improved it. Better combat, more mobility, fancier assassinations, more weapon options, your own city to manage, and more. Play it.This is a good port and the only issues I had were with lag spikes very rare and a specific cutscene that would freeze the game the cutscene where Ezio first receives his hidden blade. The cutscene bug can be fixed simply by pressing the key 2.
