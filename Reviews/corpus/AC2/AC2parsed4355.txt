Spent an hour trying to get this to work on w7 64bit. After uplay launches the game briefly pops up and crashes back to uplay. Many of the fixes seem outdated and failed to work.An hour is as much time im willing to spend trying to get a game to work.I obtained another version for pc and it works beautifully. But i cant recommend the steam uplay version.As for the game itself It is a landmark in the AC series. Brimming with content and lots to do with lesser repetition than AC1.
