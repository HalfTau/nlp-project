I played this on xbox, and decided to try out the PC version.For one, the controls are somewhat funky. I suppose its because Im not accustomed to this version. Honestly from the get go I realized the PC version was alright at best.But game wise, it has a fantastic story line and is definitely worth the play, PC or otherwise.
