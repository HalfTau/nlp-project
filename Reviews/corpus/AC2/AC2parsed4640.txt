Sinking tons of time into this game. Absolutely amazing. Incredibly fun.EDIT I would like to come back to this review and give an honest opinion on what I think about the game. I originally made the review above when I had only a few hours of game time.Im going to say it right now, this is probably my favorite game in the series, or at least top two, as of August 9th, 2014.To start off, the story of Assassins Creed 2 is above and beyond what I would have expected after playing the first game. Its not just a linear go kill this person and come back type of story this time around. There are genuine reasons for killing the people you kill, the cutscenes have many, many times more emotion than in the first game, and the voice acting is superb. In the first game, Altairs voice is monotone the whole way through. You could chalk this up to his serious personality, but if you have ever played games showcasing Altair later, such as in Revelations, youll know this is not the case. It shows that Ubisoft really put many more hours of effort into making the story in Assassins Creed II the best it could possibly be.Now, as far as content goes, the overall content in Assassins Creed I can be smushed into 15 hours at max, and 89 hours if you just play the story. However, as you can see, I have 50 hours in Assassins Creed II as of the time this review is being written. I have replayed the game once now, but many hours were spent dicking around in the unique environment that is Renaissance Italy. There are endless possibilities for things to do in Assassins Creed II, even after finishing the story. The best part is though, that even after finishing the game, I can start a new game and not be bored. Thats the beauty of this game to me, and all of the Assassins Creed games really.Overall, this game is worth the money twice over, and if youre thinking about buying it, you really should. I can honestly say that youll have a hard time regretting it if you give it a chance.
