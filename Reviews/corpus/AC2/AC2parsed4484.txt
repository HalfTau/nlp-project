Why I wouldnt recommend Assassins Creed to even my worst enemies Hmmm, there are 4 places to jump, one of which is right in front of me. What to do? Oh, I know, suicide! Even if you ignore the fact that the Assassin Creed series is hopelessly repeatative to the extent of being downright boring, it is impossible to ignore that for an open world game that bases its gameplay on freerunning, Ezio has a nasty tendency to always choose the wrong path, because hey, lets put intelligent targeting into this The result of which is that he ends up either running into things, fall off things or just simply derp around like a headless chicken. If you want assassins, play Dishonored, if you want running play Mirrors Edge, if you want open world fun play Batman. Just stay away from this hunk of junk. Unless you like spending hours swearing at the screen. And no, the story is not genius, sorry, but if you really want an overthetop conspiracy story, play Metal Gear Solid.
