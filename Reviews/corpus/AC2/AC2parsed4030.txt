AC II is an amazing game, one to be played for hours and hours. Its got at least 24 hours of story gameplay and masses on top of that with various collectibles and side quests. I loved this game and bought it based on a 5 minute trial I had on it at a friends house. At the same time I bought the 3 sequels Brotherhood, Revelations and AC III.What Ill remember most about this game is the free running ability and massive roaming pleasure jumping from ledge to ledge. You can choose your own play style too. Sneak up the streets darting from crowd to crowd, leap from the rooftops knife first onto your target, walk straight up to them and shoot them in the face in front of everybody, or charge them with your sword and make chase.The story is good too, but what stands out is the action gameplay in this game. Various kill sequences can be used which look amazing.A game I will love playing for many more hours to come, and have done for many hours passed.
