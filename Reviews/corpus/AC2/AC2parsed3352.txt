One of the best games in the Assassins Creed Series. Graphics, while not the most beautiful anymore still hold up and looking over renaissance Itally is still a beautiful experience. Story is fun, if still suffering a bit from the first games repetitiveness. Overall a great buy and a personall 8/10 game for me.
