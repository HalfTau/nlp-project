Having played through the first game via steam, my initial reaction is that the first one is a lot less buggy. There are new mechanics such as picking things up, mission logs/sequencing, and looting, which are glitchy  there is certainly a delayed action feel in general to movement. There seems to be issues with the dubbing as well being massively out of time with the actions of characters, which can lead to amusing/tedious mime shows during set pieces. I suspect as a result of all the new added features the interface between map and other tools is a little unwieldly. But whilst some of these can be frustrating, there arnt enough to seriously dampen an interesting and enjoyable game.UPDATEHaving now completed the game, I would say the lack of a difficulty curve is balanced by the at times flailing control system. There were several points which felt like a natural end point, but which were then padded out to add a bit of time. Overall, I still have a positive opinion, and I like a lot of the new additions a lot thanks gods for the fast travel system  but I think I had more fun with the first game in the series.
