8/10Everyones heard of Ubisofts flagship franchise, and knows whether they like it. If you like Assassins Creed, youll love this, and if you dont, I urge you to try this game. Its by far the best in franchise, and is overall a great game. The Renaissance setting is fun, and it pairs well with the mechanics. Not to mention one of my favorite soundtracks from last generation its no Bastion, but its good. It is buggy, however, and the Uplay DRM is maddeningly intrusive to your game. Sometimes the game feels bloated, especially with the poorly written outside the Animus story, but most of the extra fluff is relatively optional. Overall, its a well made game thats worth your time and money, but not much more.
