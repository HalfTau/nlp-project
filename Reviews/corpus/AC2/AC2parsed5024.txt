Assassins Creed 2 has brought me nothing but thrills. The combat is exciting, the graphics are solid, and the story is so good. Even though the newer AC games have more features, I still see my self coming back to this one. If you played the first one and liked it, I dont know why you wouldnt have this one. If you played the first one and liked the gameplay but wasnt fond of the story, dont worry it gets so much better in this one. Buy it.
