Okay lets get this over with.First of, good things.1. Its gotta be one of the funnest games I have ever played.2. Free roaming is not a achivment or unlockable thing.3. The characthers are fun and enjoyable.Bad things.1. This U Play thing... is stupid, I hate it when games make you sign up for stupid things they dont want. Its like Batman Arkham City, or YouTube. I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE DAMN GAME!!!!!2. The default controls are wonky. It takes some time to get used to them, and there really random. Now that doesnt make the game bad, it makes it annoying when I have to stop in the middle of a cut scene to see which button controls the head.Speaking of which... 3. THE QUICK TIME EVENTS IN CUTSCENES....WHY!THERE ANNOYING.STUPID..THEY DONT EVEN MAKE A DIFFERNECE!WHY ARE THEY THERE. I want to enjoy the sorroundings and the people, not surive a book!4. The Italin thing. Okay, I hade a fun time with this europe thing since Ive been there 6 times. But most of the time the characthers just randomly start talking in another launguge. Why?!I mean thats so annoying, having to understand what there saying.5.The voice actors, could be better. I mean there decent yes, but since I fell like there second launguge is Italin, I fell like there not used to English, either that or the accents are getting in the way of there talking.So yea thats it, alot of those bad things dont really hurt the story or the gameplay. Except 1 and 3.Its a great game, get it now.My gaming score 9 neck stabs/10
