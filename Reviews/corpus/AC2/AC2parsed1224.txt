I played and finished this game 4 times 3 times on Xbox 360 and the fourth time on PC.Do i reccomend this game? Absolutely,YES.Im an Assassins Creed fan,i played all the chapters and trust me,this is the best in the series.Italy is great,a beautiful place,the Story is compelling,sometimes funny,and mostly,exciting.Ezio too is the best protagonist in the series,charismatic,fair and combative.The game is dubbed in many languages,like English,italian,French,Spanish,Japenese and others,but the best is the italian one.I would not recommend the others,cause the characters speak a half Italian and a half the other,so they sound so bad. im italian.One of the best games ever made.VOTE 9.5/10Buy it
