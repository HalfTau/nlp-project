This game gave me nightmares. They really did not give aabout the story one bit did they? So awful.The gameplay on the other hand is okay... but the camera is ultra frustrating and makes some platforming elements ridiculously 1997era. I would not recommend this game. I rarely say this as I like my games long, but this thing just drags on and on.
