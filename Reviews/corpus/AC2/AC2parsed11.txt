One of the Good Assassins Creed games. Although it doesnt have multiplayer, it runs really well and the combat engine is great. The cities are really well detailed and accurate, and there are lots of things to do, even when the story is complete. Although getting Altars armour wasnt that challenging, it was still entertaining and kept me going between missions. On the whole, a very good game.
