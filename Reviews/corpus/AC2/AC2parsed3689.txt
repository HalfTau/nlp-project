Story 5/5 Gameplay 4/5 Artwork 5/5 Soundtrack 5/5 Verdict 4.8 Superb game. Conclusion A worthy sequel to the first game. Ubisoft improved so much about the games formula and the beautifully designed cities of Italy are just there to suck you in. I would recommend the game to anybody who played any of the Assassins Creed games, and fans of historical games as well.
