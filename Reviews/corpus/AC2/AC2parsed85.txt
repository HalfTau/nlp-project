Horrible And Overly Complicated Controls For Keyboards Users, But As Long As You Have A Controller Like Logitech Or Xbox, Especially Xbox 360 It Is A Great Game And Fun To Play.The Storys Not Just Good But Its GREAT. Ubisoft Use A Simple Matter And Make It Into A Great Story About Family, Revenge, And Vengeance.Overall, It Is A Great Game With Controller, But Not With Keyboard.Id say...... BUY IT!!!One Of The Cheapest, Yet The Best Game In The Series. Yes, I DO MEAN IT.One More Thing. Before You Play This Game. Just Create An Uplay Account Cause If You Dont Activate The Game Code For Uplay, YOU CANT PLAY THE GAME.ITSAME MARIO!!
