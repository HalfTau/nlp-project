A great followup to AC 1, the city design again impresses, though not as much as the first.I like how characters were a bit better developed and the villa upgrade system works. There are also a few good WTF moments that are comical.Like in AC1, I didnt care for actual missions especially the slow walk follow people missions.I played this game in 2011 and completed the main storyline.
