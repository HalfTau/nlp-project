This game is absolutely amazing.  It does have its flaws though, such as mking you jump one way while you wanted to go about 45 degrees left or right.  But still its an amazing game.  I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to commit complete and utter badassery.  Also, by the way, right click to start sprinting. P.S. If you like this game, get Brotherhood  and Revelations as well.
