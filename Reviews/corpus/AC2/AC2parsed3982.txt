played it for a while, still not much improvement on the 1st one. Then upon returning to the game some months later the totally f ucked up uplay refused to run it, now i find uplay will not run any games. After much searching and wasting my time for solutions i have decided to delete uplay and all its associated games for good, i will never buy any product related to this c rap again and advise everyone else to do the same.  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE ...Not one to give up so easily i spent much time and effort getting uplay back up to finish. Oh God i wish i hadnt. The game sucks, it sucks so bad that i could write a book on just how bad it sucks. The more i played the more it got worse. I cannot think of a worse game, why the hell do people buy this s hit for s hit is what it is. Glad it only cost me a couple of quid for i feel truly sorry for those that paid any more. This game is so bad that i just cant think of one positive thing to say about it....
