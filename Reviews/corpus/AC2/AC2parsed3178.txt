Takes the good from the first game and makes them better while adding a few new concepts. the story isnt as interesting but the main characters are well developed and its great to play a teen being exposed to this world of death and learning to live with it. the world itself isnt as interesting and the villens are completely forgettable but still a great improvement on the first game.
