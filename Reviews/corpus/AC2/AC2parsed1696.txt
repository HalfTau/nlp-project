Assassins Creed 2, does everything a sequel needs to do. it added to the gameplay, expanded the story in multiple directions and created a highly memorable character in the form of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.It also lead to such apparent popularity that Ubisoft decided to flog the series into oblivion thereafter with yearly sequels including 2 spinoffs to Ezios particular story which where still decent if formulaic.The inclusion of multiplayer as well as an onthego manual and historical checkbook, and puzzle minigames made the game enjoyable not only by increasing the rich wealth of historical lore but adding much needed breaks from running over rooftops, causing tiles to crash to the streets below...This and Brotherhood its first sequel and second part of Ezios trilogy are the best of the Assassins Creed series, partly because the game was still fresh and partly because the setting of Renaissance Italy was one of the most fascinating areas of history to explore.Highly recommend  will likely become a Classic.
