This is a great game unfortunately the Mac port is quite bad.  There are persistent issues with using an external keyboard I have a Bluetooth connected one such that half the time the game opens it does not detec the keyboard. The only solution appears to be quitting and relaunching the game. This is an issue that many onilne are facing as welland.
