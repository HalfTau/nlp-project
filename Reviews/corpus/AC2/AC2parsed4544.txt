This is one hell of a sequel i tell you that. The story and gameplay are magnificent aswell as the voice acting. Though the sound and the gameplay itself has some bugs. There has been a huge change since AC1 and its not a bad thing you are more free. The mission are not as challenging as the first game but it makes you more certain that you are going to complete the game, its not like some other games where you get stuck on multiple missions and never get through dark souls. Anyway this game i worth buying if you are a assassins creed fan or if you just want a game with a great story.
