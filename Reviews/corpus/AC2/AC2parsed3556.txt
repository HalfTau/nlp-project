game is great, but u play is super annoying. had to delete uplay, download from website instead of steam, run as admin, and download xbox wireless fix to get it running. And then, something went wrong because uplay thinks i dont have the deluxe version which i did purchase. so, i cant load my old saves because they have been created using the deluxe version... very unsatisfying
