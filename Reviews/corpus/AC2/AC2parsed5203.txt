Inspite of Ubisofts sketchy and poor DRM. This game is just brilliant with an epic long story filled with action.In the first 3 sequences, I found myself a little bit bored untill it started getting more exciting.I liked the fun free running and the smooth gameplay in this game. However, the camera angle goes wrong sometimes, but its still amazing.Highly enjoyable and recommended to play.9/10
