Such as gaining a second hidden blade to allow for 2 kills at once, the ability to posion one blade to made enimies infected go berserk and eventually die. later in the game you will also unlock a pistol upgrade.This game also came with a optional puzzle elements that you can do that builds on the lore of assassins creed. As well as side objectives such as rebuilding a town that has been left in a state of disrepair. Buying paintings from art merchants to add to the villa of the town you are helping to rebuild which will also add a steady income for you to collect which will allow you to buy newer armour and equipment throughout the game.Finally the story builds on what happens with desmond in the modern era and the continued struggle with Assassins and Templers in the past. The story  is about desmond using the assassins animus 2.0 to relive the life of Ezio Auditore a 15th century noble who is on a quest of revenge agaisnt the ones that killed 3 member of his family.
