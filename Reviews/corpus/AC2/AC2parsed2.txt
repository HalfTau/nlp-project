Recently decided to go back and play all the Assassins Creed games. I had only ever played the first one when it was released and greatly enjoyed it. Finally got around to finishing this first sequel. The ending left a little to be desired but knowing that the Ezio timeline is a triolgy means Im a little less annoyed by the WTF ending. Solid gameplay even if it was more of the same. Combat is simple and polished and I loved fighting unarmed and using the enemies own weapons to finish them off. Few minor hiccups with climbing and getting Ezio to leap in the proper direction but I would say a lot less frustration when compared with the original. Looking forward to continuing the series.
