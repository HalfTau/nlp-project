Assassins Creed II is a great game !In fact, its one of my favorites. The overall storyline is very touching, especially in the beginning. As you follow Ezio along his journey you will meet many people who can help you achieve your goals and all have a specific role in the storyline.The main reason why I love this game is the story, that doesnt stop at the end of this game, but spans throughout the followup games Assassins Creed  Brotherhood  Assassins Creed  Revelations. Seeing Ezio grow up and advance his skills more and more is really realistic and gives a good bonding with the character.If you like adventure games dated in ancient times, and youre a fan of pretty storylines, I recommend this game to you !
