Its as rich, interesting, and cool as AC1 and includes one of Jesper Kyds best soundtracks to date. My only real gripe with the AC series would be the occasional quirky movement controls which can either make or break a mission sometimes. Also, it helps to play the previous game in the series to get the full story.
