Having played most of the AC games, I can hand on heart say that AC2 is still the best of them all. Sure, later games added a little more in the way of actions, abilities and gadgets, bigger worlds to explore and even seas to sail, but it was AC2 that truly defined the series. This is the one AC game where, far and above all the others, everything just comes together perfectly  story, setting, characters, gadgets, actions, mechanics, graphics...And the music? A sheer delight to listen to. AC2 is a masterpiece so beautifully captivating from is humble beginning to its awesome conclusion, youd swear the hand of Da Vinci himself had been involved in its creation.
