This is still the best AC game ever. Now if you are having trouble with uplay crashing,you need to uninstall uplay and download it directly from its website. This is because downloading uplay with AC 2 makes uplay crash for a reason. Anyways this game has an epic storyline. The first few missions may be boring but right when you are about to quit the game makes you suddenly interested in the story. This games storyline is over 15 hours! Thats almost GTA V. Anyways this game is a solid 10/10.
