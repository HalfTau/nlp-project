After what i played these are things i like and i dont.I give this game 4/5 for the following reasons.ProsGood storyPretty nice graphics for this old gameSomewhat difficult, not just visual novelsidequests are short enough, assassin tombs or codex page fetching, only that getting those feathers is boring. zzOne of the best SoundtracksConsMeanwhile the combat is nice, its somewhat unresponsiveThe camera is sometimes weird, especially in ALL Assassin tomb raids, the camera makes you fall most of the time.Has some Fps issues, running this on gtx 1060 and it sometimes drops to 30 fps. Regardless its fine on most cases, just to mention that its the game not your gpu.So i recommend this game for all of you, but notice that there are some quick time events, DONT MISS THE HUG WITH LEONARDO, i feel so bad for missing it, and then he got sad.
