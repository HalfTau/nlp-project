Slight improvement over the first one.Enjoyable game Too much repetition. Boring towers are boring... Irritating and stupid combat system, no improvement here and it still is not much fun. Being an assassin is still awesome and the assassination missions are fun. Intriguing story, but the final boss fight was just plain stupid. Good gfx and audio, great improvement here, very nice setting.
