Easily the best game in the series.Whereas the first game felt dull and repetative, Assasins Creed picks up the pace with everything. The music, the atmosphere, the characters and especially Ezio are magnificient.If you are thinking about buying an Assassins Creed game, this is the one you want. If you are a completist like me, youll get a bit more out of the games in sense of story and background, however that is not necessary at all.
