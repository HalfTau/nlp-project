Really enjoyed the game until I got to the point where my saves kept failing meaning hours of repeated gameplay.  I have searched Steam forums and on various online sources for a fix but to no avail.  It seems like Ubisoft has known of the problem for a few years now but it still remains unpatched.  Very poor support for a tittle from one of their most popular franchises.  I had originally started to feel like I had missed a classic series somehow, needless to say I wont be buying anymore of the series now!
