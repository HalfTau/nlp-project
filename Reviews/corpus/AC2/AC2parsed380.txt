My first Assassins Creed game, really great, didnt 100 it but I synchronized all the viewpoints and finished the story. Definitely recommend it if you are a fan of story driven games or if you want to play around in historical locations. If you are looking for deep combat or stealth mechanics, this is not the right entry for you.
