I want to like this game. Yes, yes I know, its not one of the newer ones and the gameplay on it isnt as shiny and smooth as on the newer ones. Its actually my first Assassins Creed game so Im not comparing it firsthand to the others. But this game got such good reviews and many people think this is the best one of the series. I was expecting the game to be at least entertaining. I am so bored with it. There is nothing fun about this game that keeps me coming back. The parkour system works most of the time but the voice acting, graphics even on MAXIMUM setting across the board, combat system, and overall experience is just boring and gets old. The side quests and missions are all the same! No enemy variety either! I really dont see the appeal. It is so slow paced that I dread continuing, hoping itll get better. I may give it another go in the future but man, this was a letdown.
