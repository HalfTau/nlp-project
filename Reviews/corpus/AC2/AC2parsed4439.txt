Go away Uplay, nobody likes you. Really. Uplay has ruined this game. Really, ive owned this game for a while but ive yet to actually play it. You see, when i launched the game, it booted up all of that Uplay crap and  made me make an acount, only for my password not to work and yes, i had the right password. so i attempted to get a new password. after doing their stupid im not a robot test, which was a pain, i finally DIDNT get an email to reset my password. in fact, no matter how many times i do it, I never get an email and yes, i have the right email. So thank you Uplay for taking my money.Ps. nobody loves you either, Uplay.
