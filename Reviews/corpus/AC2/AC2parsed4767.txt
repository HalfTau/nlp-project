Assassins Creed 2 is one of the best of the Ezio trilogy still doesnt beat AC Brotherhood in my opinion, enhancing the experience and errors the original had. The game has a much more charming and likeable protagonist named Ezio Auditore, and the mechanics have been greatly improved as well as having a way bigger world to play in.Problem is, the game does have some very tedious collecting, and some things still need improvement, but overall, this is a fantastic game, and shows potential that Assassins Creed can do better.I give it 9 out of 10.Besides the two errors I mentioned, this is a fantastic game, and should not be missed.
