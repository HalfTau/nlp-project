Edit I finally got the game to work. After uninstalling the game and Uplay from my computer, I decided months later to reinstall and give it another try. It works now with no explanation as to why, but thankfully the game saves my progress. I am still going to leave this review with a not reccomended due to Uplay, but if you are willing to risk it and invest lots of unneccesary time/effort into making this game work, then it is definitely worth it.This game is amazing. The graphic are great for its time, the gameplay is fun and it is probably one of the better assassins creed games. So why dont I reccomend it? A broken, unfixable, glitchy uplay. Why should I have to run something on a program as good as Steam and then download another piece of crap program like uplay to run it? I shouldnt have to. For starters, when I bought the game, uplay didnt work. After hours of expierimenting and looking stuff up on YouTube, it was fixed. Then I got a good portion of the game finished before it stopped saving my game. No matter how many checkpoints i reach or how many times is claims to save my game, it wont. Even after I die, i spawn at checkpoints, but i lose hours of gameplay when I exit the game. And I cant find any help for it online. So my reccomendation If you are like me and only play on pc, you are screwed. But if you are lucky enough to own a console, buy it there. Im pretty sure uplay doesnt exist there. If im right about that then buy it for consoles, not on pc.
