My first Assassins Creed was Brotherhood, then I played Revelations, 3, 4, Rogue and now 2. I really like the traditional Assassins Creed games, especially the ones about Ezio. Now, let me just talk about Assassins Creed 2. When I started playing it, I could hardly believe it was a game established in 2009. I mean, except for its outofdate graphics, this game really surprised me a lot. Its map designs, puzzle designs, stories, atmosphere, and of course the music are extremely impressive. Although its fighting style kind of sucks, and the guards and civilians behaves abnormally because of bugs, I really enjoy this game. Compared to some other Assassins Creed games, it is more like a piece of art than a product. Ive heard Ubisoft planning to make an Assassins Creed movie, Oh, nononononono, youve already had Assassins Creed 2! Why making a movie?I strongly recommend this game to you guys. By the way, watch out for bugs, they are more dangerous than any kind of enemies in this game.
