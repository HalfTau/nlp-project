Ezio was not really sympathetic to me in his early age, but his character was developed and shown troughout years. 20 years later he was totally different man.In terms of gameplay everything that I didnt like in previous game was fixed or improved. You have more options how to hide in crowd and draw guards away. Improved battle techniques, my favorite so far is disarming enemy and killing him with his own weapon.Edit I almost forgot the! yeah! No more dying from water... not mentioning how cool it looks when you jump from high altitude.And if you want to stay in this world a little longer, they added aexcept the main story! You can raid tombs for, collect feathers all over the map for a, or find strange glyphs and solve their puzzles to!There is now also money aspect, you make money by completing memories, you upgradeto make even more money and then you can buy upgrades, better weapons, refill knives, ...Only ONE thing that really bothered at the beginning the controls are marked by some stupid icons that say nothing at all... everytime I had to look at settings what icon is what key until i got used to the controls...Totally recommending this game... and dont forget to play first AC as well to have the story complete.
