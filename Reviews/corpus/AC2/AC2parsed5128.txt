Playing the Assassins Creedseries in a totally nonchronological way AC, AC Brotherhood and now AC 2, I easily find myself comparing Assassins Creed 2 to the followup, Brotherhood. And yes, in many ways, they are totally identical graphics, controls and gameplay, but shockingly, I still find AC II to be slightly more fun than Brotherhood. Yes, I loved Rome I have history with that city and the whole assassin training deal, but AC II, with its straight revenge and rebuild story just feels more personal to me. And the fact that you move from Firenze through Monteriggioni your own hometown to Forli and Venice a city I now totally love and a huge reason why I started playing AC 2 gives the game a bit more variety. And with the historically accurate political intrigue of Reneissance Italy, whats not to love?
