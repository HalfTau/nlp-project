This game is alot of fun. It captures the feel of 16th and 17th century italy in a very immersive way. The stealth and combat are solidly designed but a little oo easy if anything. ezio is a charismatic and entertaining character. this is one of my favourite games and by far the best assassins creed game. It does however suffer from poor instructions on the controls and is a little too easy but these are minor subtractions 8.8/10
