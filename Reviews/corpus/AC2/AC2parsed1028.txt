For me, Assassins Creed II stands as the peak of the entire series.It is a quantum leap from the clunky previous game, bringing all the immersive environments and great story telling, and combining it with a slick and fluid combat system.The plot is excellent, although it does lose pace somewhat in the later stages of the game as there are large time jumps, but the DLC goes go some way to remedy this.The freerunning mechanics are simple and easy to use, and make you feel like an absolute master of the art within minutes. If I had one small complaint  less timed free running puzzles please?If you only ever play one game in the AC collection  make it this one.
