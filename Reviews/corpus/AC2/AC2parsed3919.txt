I love the beautiful graphics and dynamic story of this game. Everything is very smooth and lifelike, and the quality is constant throughout the game interactive and video. I think its great theres is an option to turn off the blood splatters, which even carries over to the story video sequences, and there is minimal some, though infrequent foul language. As an open world, you can explore all you want and get back to the story major or minor when you feel like it. Ive been looking for a game with this much quality effort put into it for a long time, and am quite satisfied so far. Its no wonder this series is such a success! This is the first Assassins Creed game I have played, and I am very happy with my choice. Five stars!
