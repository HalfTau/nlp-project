This is the game that really introduced me to the world of action. I mean, Ive played some action games before, but none of them could impress me. Im more comfortable with RPGs, adventures and strategies.But what AC2 managed to do is made me spend more than 50 hours in the skin of both Desmond Miles and Ezio Auditore trying to get every single achievement.First of all, the strongest point of this game is its story of an eternal war between the Assassins and the Templars, in which you participate actively, while visiting some jewels of Renaissance Italy, such as Florence and Venice, and meeting some famous historical characters, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Lorenzo di Medici and Nicolo Machiavelli.Unlike its predecessor, AC2 offers more than just killing, collecting feathers and saving citizens. You now have a city to rebuild, codex pages to collect, ancient treasures to discover, puzzles to solve. There is a good chance youll never get bored on your journey.I really like how the developers made all the important characters seem real... managed to breathe life into them. I mustnt also forget to mention the impressive voiceover work of the actors.All in all, Assassins Creed 2 is a real treasure to unearth, so, if you have any doubt, whether to play it or not, have none. Its guaranteed you will spend many hours entranced in the story.
