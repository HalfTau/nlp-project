I absolutely love the Assassins Creed franchise, and normally I would recommend this game, but the saves are absolutely broken. I dont know whether its just an old bug that never got patched or whether its some problem with Uplay, but every time I load up the game I get set back and lose hours of progress. Ubisoft has long since moved on to their newest games, and this problem will likely never get fixed. DO NOT purchase this game on PC/Mac.
