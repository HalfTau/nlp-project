Having improved vastly over the first entry, AC2 can last anywhere from 12 to 18 hours depending on skill and completion status.  This game rarely seems to drag on and when its in full swing, you wont notice just how long youve been playing.  Everything in this game is better than AC1 from the climbing mechanics, to the scenery, story, and gameplay overall.  Anyone who ever tried Assassins Creed and liked it even the smallest bit would enjoy this game and the story is clear enough for newcomers to jump right in.
