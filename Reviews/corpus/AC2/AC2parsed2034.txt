This is the best Assassins Creed game. No doubt about it. I have only played the first two games and the sequel to this the one set in Rome. But I have also closely followed the franchise, sadly limited by my mediocre PC. AC1 was clearly revolutionary but like any revolutionary step in gaming there are uncertainties and places where mistakes were made. The wise developers realized their mistakes and fixed them in this!This time you play as arguably the most loved asssassin, Ezio, who runs around a beautifully aesthetic rennaissance Italy, interacting with fictionalized people of that time Leonardo da Vinci for one. The plot revolves around the revenge Ezio seeks against the Borgia/Templar group.The gameplay is sleak, seamless and natural, the visuals are beautiful and interesting, the soundtrack is worth downloading and listening to by itself, the game is dotted with amazing levels of detail and actual historical places and people with a good lot of information for the historians who also game.I said its the best game. After this game the level of innovation never really justified Ubisoft spamming the world with more and more. In some cases more of the same is fitting and appreciated. But somehow it doesnt work for me.If you want to start with any of the games choose this.
