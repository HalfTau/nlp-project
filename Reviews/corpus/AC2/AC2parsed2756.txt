I get to run around shouting things in italian, beating the crap out of people and looting their bodies and finding treasure chests ala legend of zelda style. I freaking love this game.Old Grumpy Review belowWOW Where to begin with this game? This is a pregame review as I havent really played too much of this port to really comment on the actual gameplay. But lets get some stuff out of the way that they may not tell you.This is a PC port that requires use of UPlay. If you do not have Uplay, you will need to register for it. Otherwise, you cannot play it.Framerate has a hard cap of 62 FPS. From what I understand the oh so lovely Anvil Engine the game runs on is to blame. Ive heard of stories of some people force unlocking their framerates on custom resolutions but I cant be bothered to look into that. They allow you to select 120hz and even 144hz refresh rates though, so more power to the game for that at least.The games age really shows though, It was meant to run on Xbox 360 Hardware after all. Textures and shadows pop in and out a predefined field around the character, and running it on 1080p and above monitors, it looks absolutely disgusting. This wouldnt be so bad if it werent for the fact that everything looks terrible and shtty unless your character is pressing RIGHT UP AGAINST whatever it is youre looking at. Even when the textures are fully loaded in, they still look likeOverall, from a buyers standpoint, if you had to choose between playing this game on Steam or a console, its probably better to pick up the console version for maybe 5 bucks or less than to pay 20 for basically the same thing but on PC. If its on sale maybe for 5 on steam, then yes, its justified.
