Uplay works fine for me, launchs easily and without hassle, but when I first launch the Story Mode and begin to actually play the game, the world starts having a seizure and its unplayable. Everything is shaking giving you an instant  headache. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled the game THREE TIMES, each time having the same outcome. Of course, this doesnt happen for everyone so if anyone can help me feel free to do so. This is one of my favourite later childhood games and I really want to play it so please help.
