I absolutely love this game! Although I was sceptic at first. Because I hate climbing, jumping etc. Im NOT good at it. My combat skills are terrible so this game was pain in the  for me at first. But I fell in love with the story and characters. Its true, the controls are a little buggy, you get used to it. Some people may say that the controls are broken. Nah, not broken just buggy at times. If I can do it, trust me, you can do it In my opinon, THE best AC game ever.
