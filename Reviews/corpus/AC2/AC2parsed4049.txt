Im not usually one to complain about DRM or write reviews, but avoid paying for this game  no, all ubisoft games  because of the particular DRM system they use for activation.I changed my email address for the uplay service which is a nightmare in itself, need to request via support and wait a few weeks for them to pull the thumb out and after that the cd key will no longer activate when reinstalling the game as it claims to be registered to another email address. Im pretty annoyed at their support who have not even contacted me back after several days waiting.Game itself is fine, get a torrent version instead of buying though and save yourself the headache of dealing with this kind of gamebreaking DRM. Its one of those situations where the paying customer gets the worst available version of the product.Edit Several YEARS later and still no response from ubisoft support. Worse still steam refuse to remove this game from my library  so even if I wanted to take it up theand pay for it a second time this isnt possible without creating a new steam account. What a joke, except I dont find it very funny since its at my expense.
