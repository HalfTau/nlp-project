I havent written a negative review for a game yet, but this deserves it. The game itself may be good no doubt, but thats only if you can get to it. Ive run into many problems with this game and received no help. It will not launch on any computer I have. It comes up, the screen flips resolution, then it crashes.I started a ticket with tech support on 01/02/17 and it didnt close until 02/16/17 as they usually took five or six days to reply and asked for the same thing over and over. Their go to line was You dont meet requirements even though I have 16GBs of RAM, an Intel i7, a nice Nvidia card, and everything. This obiviously doesnt make the game work but they were repeatedly trying to tell me my computer was under specs when I proved over and over it was. At the end they told me they couldnt fix the problem and to not contact them about this game again.They proved no help at all and seemed annoyed I wanted any help. I cant reccomend a game that doesnt launch. / Thanks Ubisoft for letting me down.Pros Nice logoCons Crashes Doesnt launch Tech support  JokeTL DR Game wont launch, tech support doesnt care, Ubisoft lives up to their bad reputation /
