uplay sucks.at first launch, uplay crashed at login process, continously.so I googled it.I reinstalled uplay client that downloaded from uplay official homepage, after uninstall uplay client.I could play it first time.few days laterI launched this game at steam, and nothing happens.I just saw a cdkey window. I clicked play button and nothing happens.so I launched uplay client and clicked play button in there.then uplay launcher says loading steam client and gave me steam cdkey window..no response at all. even a error massage.I googled it, again. at this time, I cant find any evidence about this symptom.but I uninstalled and reinstalled uplay.and it worked.what the hack is this?should I uninstall and reinstall uplay client, each time when I want to play this game?this is ridiculous.I hate uplay.
