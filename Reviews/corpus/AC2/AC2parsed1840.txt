Assassins Creed 2 was my favorite of the series. It introduced a dynamic, exciting new assassin in Ezio, the gameplay from the first game was much improved and the story was less repetitive. The game introduced a lot of new mechanics, such as money, building up your own Assassin base, bombs, hidden firearms, double blades, all kinds of things! It was a fresh new experience from the rinse and repeat gameplay of AC1.AC2s biggest flaw was its ending, which ended up being really dragged out and repetitive. AC2 also still suffered from the control issues from the first game with Ezio randomly jumping off of or getting stuck on various things while climbing or doing parkour. While these created some frustration they didnt take away from the overall game.If you are new to the AC franchise, I would recommend starting with AC2. Altair wasnt that great of a character and the gameplay of the first game was repetitive and boring. AC really begins to be its own unique game in AC2 and you start with a long, expansive story with Ezio spanning 3 games. This game provides hours of entertainment and lets you experience Renaissance Italy in a unique way.
