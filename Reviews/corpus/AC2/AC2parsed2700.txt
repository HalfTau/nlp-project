I fell in love with this.But... Problems with Uplay installation and crashing... Come on, seriously? Guys, the way company delivers the game is one the best ways to leave a good or bad impression. You leave bad one. But thanks to Steam users and guides I got through that. And, actually, i work in IT so im kinda used to when things that have to work brilliantly dont work at all, and there always are people who already know what to do.If you want to try, get ready to fix some troubles with Uplay. Guides will help.Now ok, let us return to the game.Epic plot.Smart developed.Beautiful designed interfaces even if there are some unnecessary confirmations if i want to heal now, that means I want to heal now, there is no need to ask me if Im sure or not.New breath to classical vengeance stories.Definentely yes.
