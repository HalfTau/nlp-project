Setting.Renaissance Italy is much more beautiful and interesting than medieval Middle East.Florence,Venice,Toscana.Soundtrack.Jesper Kyd done a good job.Ezios Family still one of the best tracks in whole series.Improved fight system.More weapons to use,more moves to do.Economy system.Rebuilding Monteriggioni and buying stuff was fun.Improved parkour.Much better than AC1 but still not so good as Brotherhood.Collectibles.Founding seales,feathers,statuettes and glyphs was more interesting than collecting flags in AC1.Cause there is reward for this.Characters.There was few remarkable characters in AC1.But in AC2 there is dozens of them.Dialogues with templars.When you killed templar in AC1 it was really interesting to hear dialogue between Altair and his prey.You started to think what you dont want to kill this man,what maybe templars are good guys.There is no such thing in AC2.Parkour sometimes goes crazy.I want jump straight.Ezio jumps left.Frustrating sometimes.Obvious war of two secret organizations.You know,Assassins and Templars are two secret brotherhoods fighting with each other.But AC2 made it looks like open war,like there is no conspiration.Everyone knows about assassins and templars.Everyone is assassins or templar.This is just stupid.Ezios outfit.Altair outfit perfectly fited the setting.Cause it was really noteless.But in AC2 setting this looks like a joke.Assassins outfit looks too noticeable.
