An easy 9/10.So much more content, back story, character development and customization than the first game. One might fall in love with the persona of Ezio and how he matures to become an Assassin and parallely, whatever Desmond learns in the process. This game has taken the story forward marvellously amidst elements of unforgettable history.Set during the renaissance, Ezio has allies like Leonardo da Vinci and Niccholo Machiavelli, to name but a few. And his story is interspersed so finely with actual history that one might actually believe those events took place exactly like in the game. The connection with the first game, with Altair as well as Desmond, was made flawlessly.For the gameplay, the dynamics are much the same as in the first game, with some added moves, making combat slightly more realistic and more dynamic. The graphics look amazing. Florence, Venice and Forli look like their real counterparts.Its a really long to finish and I definitely dont have the patience to complete every mission from the subplot, particularly the one involving Subject 16. Its very tedious and the reason for the 9, instead of the 10. But Im sure patience would be rewarded because of the video waiting at the end of it.All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!
