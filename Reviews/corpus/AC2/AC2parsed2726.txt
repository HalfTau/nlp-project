Good sequel to the first, despite it being Ubisoft. Well, for the most part. Their alteration of the mouse control was absolutely unwarrented, and luckily I was able to mangle my mouse settings enough to get it to be playable. However in doing so, it has completely ruined my ability to aim well in other games... so some relearning will be needed.I enjoyed the end. Will have to play AC3 now to continue the story. Interesting.
