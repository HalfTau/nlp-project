If you were ever interested in the rogue character class in RPGs, or ever interested in the Thief games, or dirty fighting, or anything that has to do with ninjas or hitmen or assassins, youll probably like this game. Ezio, the player character, unravels a plot by a seemingly unstoppable nemesis. With revenge in mind and a supportive uncle, he sets out to bring his enemies down once and for all. What the game lacks in serious stealth abilities, it makes up for with special combat moves and special techniques like distraction, as well as wardrobe customization and plenty of parkour. Solid improvement on its predecessor.
