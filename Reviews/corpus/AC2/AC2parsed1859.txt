As usual, this will be a short one. AC2 is definately the best in the series. If you have played and enjoyed any of the other ones, youll probably love the second of the series. The game is pretty, has a pretty solid story, really excellent mechanics, and just improves on everything in the first one. Basically, this game is all that a sequal should be it took the first game, kept the same concept, then improved everything. Really fun, and just really well executed.
