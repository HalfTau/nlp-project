I bought this game a couple years ago, having not really payed much attention to the series before. After playing it for a couple hours, I bought the previous game, and the next two as well. Needless to say, I was impressed. Ive never played any other game like Assassins Creed before, and its really a unique franchise, even if theres little variety between each instalment.Gameplay wise, this game has very few flaws. Theres almost no glitches, and the combat, while not as easy/smooth as later games, has no problems.The story is one of the best of the series, though I havent played most of the new instalments to fully compare.I recommend this game to anyone curious about the series. While the first game is alright, I think that this game gives a better introduction into the gameplay/style of this series.
