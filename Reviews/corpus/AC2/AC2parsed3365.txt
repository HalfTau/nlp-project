Broken gameAfter completing most of the game, the game froze when loading a new city forcing me to restart my computer. Upon starting it up again, all my data was completely lost forcing me to start from the beginning. This is a major game breaking glitch that ruins an otherwise alright game.From what Ive heard, this problem exists in many Ubisoft games including the other Assassins Creed games. I would not recomment a game from the series given these issues.
