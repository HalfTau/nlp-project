UPlay deleted my save   There is a website assassinscreedsavesdotcom that I recommend anyone who has this problem to go to, theres a save for every chapter, but your unlocks will differ drastically and for this reason Im just going to watch the last two sequences on YouTube, Im just far too annoyed to continue on playing.
