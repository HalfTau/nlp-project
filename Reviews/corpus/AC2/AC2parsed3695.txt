From AS1 to AS2 the story seems interesting. The end however was a big disappointment.  Lots of ways to make money in the game. I would strongly suggest investing right away into the villa his uncle has, its return makes it a better investment then running around collecting feathers or chests or boats with money.  The feathers and the races are the worst, at first the races were a tad fun, but later on they just get annoying.  Maybe it was the fact i was playing with the keyboad but the races got annoying and i never finished them.  Also i thought the flags in AS1 were hard to find, the feathers are evern HARDER to find.  They dont stand out much.  The game is fun, and the stealthly missions really made it more interesting then just going for the kill, having to use tactics that are there but needed for stealth kills.  All in all a fun game, and look forward to playing the next installment today or tomorrow just to see where this series leads in the story itself although the ending was crap. On the  side at least you can go into water unlike AS1 haha.
