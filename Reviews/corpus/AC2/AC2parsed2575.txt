I know Steam says that I only have 2.3 hours but I actually have over 24 hours in the game I had no internet for a weekend so I played the whole story and most of the sidequests within a weekendThe story is great, The missions are challenging without being annoying and the characters are relatable and funny Mario I would recommend this game to all my friends.I was thinking about getting this game for a while because I wanted to play an Assassins creed game and everybody said that this one was the best. My friends who have had it since it came out still havent finished it and I dont know why they dont want to.
