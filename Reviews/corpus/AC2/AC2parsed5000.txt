I was hesitant to give ac2 a try after playing the first game but I am really glad I did. It improves over its predecessor in every aspect. The combat does not feel repetitive anymore and exploring Italy during the  Renaissance period is loads of fun. I recommend people who want to get into the AC series to start with this game and skip the first one.
