This game freeze without reason every single time at the exact point. If you want to get support you can not contact support. They want you to read through pages and pages of questions and answers. Irritating .. Bought for my son but you cant get it to work properly and buggerall support available. They confuse the issue with U play and Steam and no one knows who the hell they are. You need to enter your password and email endlessly and they never recognise it. If you want to penalise your child do bussiness with these bunch of lunatics
