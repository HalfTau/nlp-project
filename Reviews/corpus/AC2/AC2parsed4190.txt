Great game. Best of the AC series. You play as Ezio and assassinate various people. There is a database so you can learn about each person and place, and it is all taken from history. You work with the Medici family and Leonardo da Vinci throughout the game.ProsAmazing weaponsAmazing kill animationsAmazing hand to hand combatReal people in history that you killParkourThe whole game is a masterpieceConsLagging cutscenes  audio and video out of syncThe default controlls are terrible. I had to spend a while customizing them.
