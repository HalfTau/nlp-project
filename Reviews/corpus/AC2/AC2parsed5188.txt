The sequel to Assassins Creed begins a new story from Desmonds genetic memories of a young Italian nobleman named Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The second game greatly expands upon the original in terms of gameplay as well as storytelling. Using a number of historical figures, Assassins Creed II AC2 successfully immerses you into historical fiction with a scifi twist and will leave you wanting more. Overall, AC2 offers a more open experience and allows you to customize your version of Ezio while also stemming away from the originals narrow/linear gameplay. AC2 is a must for fans, but it should be noted that AC2 require Ubisofts Uplay as the games launchpad.
