I have found the solution!If you are having this problem, here is what you have to do to play your game1. Uninstall Uplay. This can be done from Add or Remove Programs. However, it leaves files behind which you need to delete.2. Go into Program Files x86 and delete the entire folder called Ubisoft3. Restart computer. This is important for some reason4. Reinstall Uplay from the Uplay webdite. Link5. Restart computer again.6. Launch Assassins Creed Revelation and wait for it to update and do whatever it doesIt should work fine after that, it did for me. This aparently works for other Uplay games and issues with Uplay. Hope this helps everyone else!
