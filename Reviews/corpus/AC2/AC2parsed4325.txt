Awesome. Just when you start getting bored, theres a plot twist or a change of pace. A huge improvement compared to the first game. The story line will keep you on the edge not to mention the ending  it is mind blowing. I havent enjoyed a game this much in a while.  It has some minor flaws, but it surely deserves a 10/10.
