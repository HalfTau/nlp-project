Bought for MAC. Have managed to get the game to start once. DOES NOT SUPPORT CONTROLLERS.uplay breaks constantly and thinks i do not have an internet connection.  Once i got to the menu screen and the resoloution was about 1300 X 16000 so i had to turn off my computer without shutting down.A Car Crash , Valve should be ashamed of themselves for selling out and supporting this developer.  REFUND PLEASE.
