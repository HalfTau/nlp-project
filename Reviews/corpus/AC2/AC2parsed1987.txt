Just tried to play this game for a little bit. Launched the game about 30 minutes ago. 4 or 5 uplay updates later and Im still waiting to play. The Uplay updater CRASHED trying to update itself. So thanks Ubisoft for effectively wasting my time for no damn reason.Oh, the game is fun, yes, but geez, its not worth that long of a wait. Uplay is garbage polluting what is otherwise a decent gameplay experience.
