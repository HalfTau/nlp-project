This game on the PC sort of sucks. They did not change the key symbols for the PC so you have to memorize all the symbols and what keys they signify. The game is fun to play, although I think it plays better on the xbox and probably on the PS as well. I will write another review after I have had some time to play the game. I only just installed it a little over an hour ago.
