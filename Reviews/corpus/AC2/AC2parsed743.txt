AC2 is a gold sequel to the first game, improving everything from it, including AI, gameplay mechanics, you dont do the same thing in every mission, the storyline and sidequests are really well made, eagle vision is much better, animus doesnt have the glitch which made Altair die when trying to swim, there are not drunk people that push only you!, they added weapon, armor, etc. shops that wasnt present in the 1st game and last the ingame music is really good. I play it even in 2017 and I like it because it brings the player the experience of a true AC game.
