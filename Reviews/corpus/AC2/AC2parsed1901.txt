After this I am requesting a refund. The ubisoft servers will NOT connect for me at any given point in time. The menu that pops up to a link to trouble shoot but, the problem on their website is it will tell you how to defeat different missions and how to find what requirements your computer need. Ubisoft need to acknowledge the problems players are having that want to spend their money and get nothing out of it. Thank oyu Ubisoft and not helping at ALL.
