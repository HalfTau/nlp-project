This game was an improvement on the first, and it certainly is still fun to play. The story and gameplay are still excellent, and the added variety to the missions dont give it that repetitive feel that the first one had. The customisation element is nice as well, and the interactions outside the Animus are not bad, given there arent many. Ubisoft took a step in the right direction with this game, and it is still worth the buy.
