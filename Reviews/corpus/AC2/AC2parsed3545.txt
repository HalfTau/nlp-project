This is the first review I have ever written, and with a heavy heart I cannot recomend this game. At the very start of the game, right after the intro the entire screen goes white, but the game still functions, menu, sound, ect... I tried redownloading the game, restarting my computer, and emaling both steam and uplay. I will change my review as soon as this problem is adressed because I love the Assassins creed series.
