Wow has this game aged. Was once entertaining after playing through the original Assassins Creed, but many of its dated mechanics and the tedium of the ubiquitous ubisoft open world collectathons has really aged this game poorly. Its a shame, the story is very nice. I recommend youtubing the story cutscenes and playing through revelations, as Brotherhood and 2 are very similar. The combat and sneak mechanics in 2 are also very frustrating as they have a tendency to not work as intended and break immersion. The only really fun part about this game is building up your villa in Monterriggioni, but that is quick to finish. Oh well, thankfully it looks like Ubisoft is taking their time on the next Assassins Creed so there is hope or check out some of the later games like IV and Syndicate which are very entertaining. I own my copy on Uplay.
