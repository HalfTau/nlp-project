Okay... this one is a bit of a mixed bag, and since I havent played them I wont compare it to its sequels.Runs fine on 3.2ghz6, HD6850, 8gb RAM machine, no performance hiccups, nor did the uplay launcher cause issue.  Graphics wise I have no complaint.  Locales are detailed sufficiently to put you the setting, a few building interiors are nice but nothing  wowing.  Game plays 90 fine on a keyboard.Gameplay wise, it improves a bit over its original in options and combat, as well as platforming, but the fastwalk dualmapped to pickpocket, grab / release on hand, and jump / sprint being overzealously applied is quite frustrating at times.  Some enemies are immune to smoke bombs, being shot, backstabs, etc for no real reason other than plot armor, which feels stupid.  The inclusion of the Hidden Gun feels like a nod to the frustration of catching running enemies, but bugs the camera.  Enemy soldiers still pose 0 threat.Story and characters are much better, even if slow to start.
