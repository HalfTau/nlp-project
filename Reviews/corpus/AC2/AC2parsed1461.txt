One of my friends is a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise and he made me buy the game during Steam Summer sale and play it. And Ive to say, Im glad he made me do it.The story was awesome. Kept me hooked for 50hrs  That says something. And the ending was really amazing! Totally worth the 50hrs.What really impressed me is how theyve tried to blend historical and biblical events in the story and puzzles. Also, some greek legends.Reminds me of Dan Brown books. Especially the glyphs. Many times while solving the glyphs I felt I wouldve appreciated them more if I had more knowlegde about the mentioned events.But that didnt affect the overall gameplay experience though. Since the glyphs is just an optional side mission. Which unlocks which again, took me by surprise PS. Ive already decided to buyandthis winter sale.
