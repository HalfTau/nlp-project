huge improvement from the first game! Both in characters and story. The setting is also amazing with lots of buildings perfectly recreated from Venice, Florence and Forl. In the end there is a pretty big cliffhanger tho.Graphically speaking, colors look washed out and LOD distance is awful, the rest is pretty good.I rate it 810
