As the first part of the Ezio Trilogy its one of my favourite parts. It may be buggy sometimes like climbing but its pretty good besides that. The Graphics r pretty good for 2009 and its fun roaming around. It also provides a fantastic first part of the Ezio Story.good Storygood graphics for 2009good engineEziocant use my deluxe bonus key rare bugs11/10 would buy again
