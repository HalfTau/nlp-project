While the games mechanics are a little dated, the game still offers a pretty good story. It runs a little long and can get a little repeative you kill one or two main guys and move on the the next chapter. Its got some puzzle elements that can be hella creepy. The climbing controls can make you wanna put your fist though a wall. But its an older game now, so you can look past all those minor annoyances also since theyre approved upon in sequels. If youre looking to jump on the Assassins Creed train, Id suggest starting here. The first game doesnt hold its age well, I dont think. ACIIs got sealth but not in a super serious style, platforming and theres lots of stabbing. Oh and collectibles, lots of collectibles.
