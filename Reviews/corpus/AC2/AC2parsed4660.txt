The only thing this game has managed to do so far is updating and attempting to update the mandatory uplay client multiple times, timeout its servers for uplay login, and hang up in a screen that says Establishing network connection... when attempting to start the game itself.Granted, the game was relatively cheap during Holiday Sale, but if all I wanted to do was to stare at the abovementioned sentence ad nauseaum, Id fire up notepad, write it down and look at that until the cows come home, for an agreeable cost of 0.00
