ProsGood storyMost compelling protagonist in the seriesHuge feature additions compared to AC1Get to make Leonardo da Vinci do tedious busy workIts ame, MarioConsPresent day storyline is cringey, especially in hindsight after seeing its conclusion in AC3Cant make Desmond and Shaun fight to the deathConclusionMissing some features that became vital later in the series, but still the best AC storyline and a huge improvement over its predecessor in every way. Also, muh nostalgia. 9/10
