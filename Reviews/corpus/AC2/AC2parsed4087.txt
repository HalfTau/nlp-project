Pretty fantastic game and a huge improvement on 1.  Instead of a blank slate grrgrr character, you play Ezio, who is pretty well defined.  Story is more relevant, though not by a lot revenge instead of whatever the  was going on in 1.  Guards are less annoying than in 1, and, well, just... everything is so much better.  This game is great and you should play it if you havent already....Though, how old is it now?
