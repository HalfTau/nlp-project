Assassins Creed 2 is one of my favourite games of all time. Its predecessor, Assassins Creed, is also an incredible game, but the sequel took the alreadyhightened bar and heaved it through the roof. The mix of history and fiction is a beautiful thing, and the inclusion of reallife figures from history, such as Leonardo da Vinci or Niccolo Machiavelli, makes it even more historically interactive. The continued theme and story from the first game in the series proves to remain just as captivating if not even more so. The gameplay is amazing and the things you are able to do with your character in both combat, customization and just overall movement are incredible. With all the things you can do, the amazing plot and the fun customization options, I highly recommend this game for any gamer, with a special recommendation for history buffs such as myself.
