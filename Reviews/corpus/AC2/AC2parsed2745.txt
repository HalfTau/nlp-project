The game is probably very good.  I enjoyed the first one, and by all other accounts this one is better.  I dont know yet, Ive only just begun.The downvote is for Uplay.  Seriously UBI,  off.  The store page says uplay account required.  Since Id already been forced over that bridge by Rocksmith and the conversion of my old account from before Uplay, I went ahead and bought it anyway.  The store page is misleading, because it also requires the stupid client.  Which I had to fight for an hour to even register my copy of the game.  Now I feel extremely dirty for giving Ubisoft my money for something with this travesty attached, which I swore to myself I would never do.
