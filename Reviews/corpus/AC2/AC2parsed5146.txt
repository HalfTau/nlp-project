Just being present in the Renaissance cities of Firenze and Venezia is aweinspiring. Ubisoft should get even more credit for creating an excellent game. The first Assassins Creed had good gameplay, but became very tedious and repetitive though had a great story, an introduction to the eternal conflict between the Templars and Assassins. Assassins Creed 2 built upon the first and introduced so many new gameplay elements to make this version so much more enjoyable. Ezio also seems like such a relatable character compared to Altair...and you literally follow Ezio from his birth  which makes this game a novel of Ezios life. That combined with the fantastic intrigue and historical roots of the Assassins Creed plot, as well as the wonderfully believable settings in Renaissance Italy make for a game, nay a series, worth playing.
