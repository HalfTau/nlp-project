Truly, the height of the series and the inspiration for a deeper and amazing saga of games.Overall  9.2/10, highly recommendedVisuals  Story  9/10Even by modern standards, AC2 delivers a stylized and immersive experience with rich, detailed environments.I combined story and visual style for the ability of a game to deliver that in its own organic way, to which AC2 performs beautifully.1 for a few repeatative structures and minor open world claustrophobia.Audo  Music  10/10I played the game entirely in Italian w/ Eng subs and it was enthralling. The music is perfect.Gameplay  8/10For all the fun and features, ease of control and intuitive freerunning, epic puzzles and quests...1 for the enemies being rather repeatative1 for no epic bosses
