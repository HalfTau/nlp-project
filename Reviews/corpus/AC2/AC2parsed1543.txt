Fantastic game. Almost all the negative reviews come from people who cant connect to Uplay. Ive personally never failed to connect to Uplay either in this or any other Ubisoft game, but I know some people have problems.One other thing I definitely recommend playing with a controller because of the wacky keyboard controls however, there are two files you have to download and paste into the game to get it to work correctly.Other than those two potential issues, neither of which bothered me, its an absolutely great game, right up there with Black Flag, maybe even better. There arent nearly as many of Black Flags infamous tail quests which I wasnt particularly good at. Anyway, grab it on sale.
