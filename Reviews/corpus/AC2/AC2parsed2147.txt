This game does have the potential to be good, but Im sorry to say that it just isnt. Okay, I know that it is old and dirt cheap right now, but I feel cheated not so much out of my money, but more so out of my time. I played a couple of hours to get through the utterly boring training part just to have the game freeze up when I finally receive my wrist blade. Exit the memory to see if I can just go back to that part...no...of course not I need to complete the invisibility training again. No. Then onto the controls Holy Crp! What were these guys thinking? The controls are horrible and that Im affraid is the deal breaker for me. Do not buy this game. 2 or whatever its going for now isnt a fortune, but time is precious and you will be wasting yours.
