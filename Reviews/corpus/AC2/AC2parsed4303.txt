Gorgeous, fun game that I honestly enjoyed.  Ill focus on my criticisms the player is invincible.  Getting caught is no punishment as enemies wait patiently to attack you one by one, meaning youd really have to suck to get killed by them.  The plot goes in a  direction.   I hate the plot twist and I absolutely hated the ending.  I dont see how the whole Animus thing is really necessary anyway, why cant I just be an actual guy playing a guy in renassaince italy instead of actually being a pretend guy pretending to be a guy whos pretending to be that guy? s easy but fun.  7.5/10
