I dont quite understand the hype behind AC2. I may only have 9 hrs behind it, but I still cant get the hang of it. There are times I can run and jump, then suddenly I am only capable of walking and hanging off ledges! Times that certain keys do simple actions and then they dont! When theres a lot of walking to do, I want to run but cant! I dont get it!! !I am hoping that theres a simple explanation for this, but I havent found it yet.Battle combat is convoluted and irritating, and I only just figured out how to chain attacks and select targets. This sort of combat was done simply and amazingly well in Batman Arkham City. Its also weird when I can run along rooftops, climb several storey buildings parkour all over the place, and then get stuck on a simple obstacle like a barrel.I really want to like this I also bought ACBrotherhood when I got this one but I just find it frustrating! No doubt that Ill sink a few more hours into AC2, especially if I havent played it in a while and give it another few tries, but I just cant get stuck into it.
