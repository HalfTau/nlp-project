This has to have one of the most horrid control systems ever, ever.  They are sometimes random in effect same key combo may yield a climb, may yield a bounce off use a very stupid icon based system for keys Head icon is for interation. but you never get told press E to interact o hatever key you assigned to it, no, it tells you to press head icon...IF you remember what key you gave it, fine, but given that there area more than 5 icons to remember...it gets ugly.The graphics are very good given its age and the scenary is lovely, so it is worth from that point of view.  While you are Desmond outside the Animus you cant run, walking is excruciatingly slow, while in the animus you can run.It is an entertaining few hours at best before it becomes so repetitive as to induce nausea.  If you can still find it below 10/10 then go for it, above that, really, it is a cumbersome mess to play sometime.
