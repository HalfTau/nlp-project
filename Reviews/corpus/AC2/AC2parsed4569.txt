Assassins Creed 2 is a good game. In virtually every respect, it is superior to its predecessor. The main character is far more interesting, the gameplay more varied, and the story more interesting. You can read as much in virtually any review, and its true.That said, AC2 has a handful of problems that hold it back from being agame. The freerunning controls feel loose at times, meaning youll often screw up an apparently east jump because your control stick was tilted in slightly the wrong direction. Several of the missions have approaches that arent immediately obvious, which is fine until they stop having viable alternatives.In short, AC2 is a worthwhile game that will certainly give you your moneys worth  but be aware that it still has significant room for improvement.
