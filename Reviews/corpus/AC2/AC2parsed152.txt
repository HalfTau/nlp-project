Oh boy, I dont even know where to start.So, Assassins Creed 2 is by far one of the best, if not the best game I have ever played in my entire life.PROSMany different maps, lots of places to exploreOpen WorldYou always have something to do, you will never get boredSatisfying combat movesTouching storyYOU ARE EZIO AUDITORE!CONSIt will take a while for you to get used to the controlsPERSONAL PERSPECTIVESo, I think Assassins Creed II is definitly a game worth buying. Its worth all the money. It is so great, the gameplay, the story, every single thing. Its also the longest game from the Ezio Trilogy AC II, AC Brotherhood and AC Revelations.I think that geting the chance of seeing things trough Ezios perspective is pretty cool. You can see the way he lived, the way he was forced to live by the templars, all the things that he had and lost, its purely amazing, a real masterpiece of a game. I highly recomand you play the other 2 games of the trilogy as well, in order to understand Ezios full story.AC II is by far a Legendary Game. Best Assassins Creed game in my opinion. I also think that Ezio Auditore Da Firenze, is the best assassin of them all.
