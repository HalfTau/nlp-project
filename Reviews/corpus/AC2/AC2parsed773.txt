This game is a legend to the AC franchise. If you havent played this game, then you cant call yourself a true AC fan. Nah, Im just kidding. XD But seriously I highly recommend this game even if you arent a die hard fan of the series. Its definitely one of the best AC games out there, and if you get it on a Steam sale, you can catch it at really cheap prices. Its also not too glitchy which is, of course, always nice. Although I do get the occasional glitch where when I launch the game the whole screen is glitchy, but its all fixed by a restart. And thats really the only problem Ive found with this game. Im currently working on a playthrough of this game on my youtube channel The Timinator. It would be helpful if you took the time to check it out and maybe sub. I hate promoting my channel like this, but honestly I hate looking a few days later and seeing my vids only have a few views. I just need to promote it anywhere I can. But anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good storyline in a game, or if you like stealth, or even combat in this game can be pretty satisfying sometimes, or maybe you just like seeing an all around legendary, badass assassin named Ezio run around killing Templars. Even if those arent your tastes, Im sure there are some other things youll find interesting about this game.
