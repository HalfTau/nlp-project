This is the first AC Ive played since its the first one in the series that was ported to the Mac. I tried playing the first one and I would still like to finish it, but its horrible to look at on Parallels and I unfortunately do not have a PC.My favorite parts of this game are the soundtrack and the parkour aspects. It has the best soundtrack in any of the games up to Black Flag since I havent seen anything past that. Even when I had to do a mission multiple times and got frustrated when the same music signaling I was in the chase sequence or whatever kept playing and I would mute the music to stop bothering me, I could still come back to it and I enjoy it a lot. The parkour aspect  after I figured it out  was REALLY cool. Its just fun to jump up and around obstacles and not feel limited by where I could go. Its how I imagine Spiderman would work without the webshooters, which is great cause Spidey is one of my favorite supers.They took it out for this game, so I didnt experience it until I loaded up Brotherhood, but I am really, really grateful this didnt have the meet the scene requirements aspect. I get why that matters, and it makes a lot of sense, lorewise e.g., Ezio killed this guy by dropping a ladder on him, if youre reliving a memory, why would you kill him by stabbing him?, but it is SO frustrating, particularly when youre still figuring out the controls. Personally I liked not having to redo a ridiculously long walking sequence so I could try, again, to get ONE requirement done.The graphics are good and the story is okay. Probably the hardest moments were when you unlocked mini scenes with Ezio collecting the feathers for his mother. At 50, your uncle walks in and tells you its hopeless and Ezio lowers his head sadly. He doesnt say anything, but that scene said a LOT.The puzzles were tough and I had to look up how to get through at least one assassination  the stupid boat one  and the guards could be irritating. But otherwise it was a pleasant game.
