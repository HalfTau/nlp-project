An immersive and exhilerating game, you can really relate and get emotionaly attatched to Ezio, the main character as he seeks vengeance for the betrayal he and his family were subject to. One of the better Assassins creed games in story and also quests and events, it adds just enough of different scenarios such as flying and shaking off mercenaries from Learnados cairrage to keep it fresh and engaging. Highly reccomended.
