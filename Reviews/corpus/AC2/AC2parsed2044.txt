If you ever wondered why Assassins Creed games seem to be astronomically popular despite being the same rehashed content with a clingthin story, its becuase theyre still riding on the good will of this game and the next two.Assassins Creed used to be about mystique in the real world revealed through progression in the virtual world, with a whole lot of facestabbing thrown in the mix. Ezio as a main character was extremely engaging and relatable. I remember how much fan discussion there used to be about the historical relevance of the Pieces of Eden, and many a fan theory came about as to how they were responsible for things like Hitlers rise to power, Einstein and Edisons genius, etc.They just dont make Assassins Creed games like these anymore.
