I dont know what its like on other systems, but on a PC this game is really .It was difficult to get my xbox controller work with it, but eventually I debugged how to make that work.Then I find out that this game isnt actually sneaking up and assinating people, its just a thinly veiled 3D running and jumping platformer with an overly complicated control system. Theres nothing fun about this  mess, unless you just enjoy being frustrated all day.
