Assassins Creed II is an openworld Third Person Action/Stealth game that takes place in Renaissance Italy. You play as Ezio Auditore, an Italian noble, as he seeks to gain revenge on his enemies and further the causes of his faction, the Assassins. Much like the first game, gameplay is split between modern times where you play as Desmond and not a whole lot happens, and historic times which is where the majority of gameplay takes place.The game is vastly superior to the first in the series, expanding on nearly every single area  collectables are still present but are not so meaningless, theres an economy of sorts, the missions are not as repetitive, and the combat has been opened up some. However, with the combat becoming more accessible, being stealthy/unnoticed is no longer as important  the game has taken a serious step in the direction of more action game than assassination, a trend which continues throughout the series but which in many ways improves it for how most people would like to play.I played and beat this game on the 360, hence my play time, and I highly recommend it.Note This game is excluded from Steams Family Sharing service, and it requires the use of Ubisofts Uplay program. If either of those bother you, then I would avoid this game.
