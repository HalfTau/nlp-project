I wish there was a choice between good and bad for this game. Running around medieval Italy is very enjoyable, but the game itself is rather mediocre. Combat is too easy, and the game never really presents much of a challenge. Its really repetitive as well. Its fun for what it is, but dont expect anything too mindblowing. I treat this series as historical dioramas to play with, not as actual games.
