I loved Assassins Creed 1, albeit it basically repeating the same formula 9 times for its story, then finishing off with 36 mob fights to check your swordfighting skill wasnt rusty. It does set the mold for what it means to live and die by the Creed  obedience to the cause and suppression of selfidentity/ego.This game flips that on its head, with a passionate protagonist who seeks of his own volition revenge against his familys murderers, gradually learning to be less brash and more merciful in a journey that spans 2 decades. He takes on the mantle of Assassin as a family tradition, and most of the etiquette seems to come to him naturally, with his uncle training him in the parts that dont. The story only gets more exciting, and always feels fresh.The combat system is improved from the first game, in that health is shown  a tradeoff for not being able to onehit counterkill enemies. Fistfighting has also improved unless I just sucked at it in the first game, as countering is now possible, you get a good measure for how many hits the enemy can take, and you dont easily get swarmed by passersby deciding to jump in. Double stealth blades are nice too, and taking out enemies nearby if theyre close enough to the latest person you stabbed. This weapon, and another one revealed in the trailer, are storyrelated in a way that connects to the first games protagonist after the events of Bloodlines. Stealth and climbing havent changed, aside from the jump climb which speeds up scaling buildings. You should buy this game mostly to enjoy how it feels to be able to swim, even if nobody else in Italy can.Would recommend, 4 on sale for a story that took 50 hours to complete and then some, for collectibles is hard to beat.
