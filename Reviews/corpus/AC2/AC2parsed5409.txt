Amazing. In my mind easily the best in the whole series, Assassins Creed 2 has one of the most compelling characters and storylines without suffering from the bloat of later games in the series. Renaissance Italy has never looked so good. Also has an excellent soundtrack to accompany your acrobatic escapades.
