This are my  and  points over this gameblood can be set of if you dont like that.Amazing characters.great looks and graphics can be set low for the badder pcs like mine.many missions and free roam.sometimes against time and that no funfor mejumping is the same button as free running and sprinting so you can be climbing an tower and you character cn jump off.But if i know one thing thtas that this game is AWSOME
