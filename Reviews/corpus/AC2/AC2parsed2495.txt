I bought this game yesterday for 2.49. I tried to play it today, but the screen resolution is completely off  the games top 1/8th appears at the bottom of the screen. It does not detect keyboard input so I cannot blindly change the resolution. Its only 2.49, however I cannot help but be dismayed that this game STILL has bugs that make it unplayable. I probably will find a solution to this soon... But come on...  Why should I have to do this?
