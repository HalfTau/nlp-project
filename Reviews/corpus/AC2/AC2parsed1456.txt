Terrible keyboard mouse controls, boring repetitive gameplay, uninspired plot, unlikable characters, shoddy Uplay interface.   Worst of all, the get fails to emerse you into the character.  Youre supposed to be this special acrobatic assassin bit every random guard can parcore just as well as you can.  I would never recommend anyone to waste there time on this game.
