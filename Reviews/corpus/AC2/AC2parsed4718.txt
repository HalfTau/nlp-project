Phewwwww Just took a trip through Italy in the great Renaissance Times..... and it was fun! This game is a must play one of the best in the year and really took a turn in graphics. It had an amazing story following the first game with a new character named Etzio I think i spelled that right. Still Desmond must fight in the present time to defeat the templars and go in baby to see his ancestors past secrets. Great game I wish I didnt waste as many time on the side missions, but hey i completed it and it was good. I would say all is good except one problem I hope they do fix is when you climb buildings and such that you kind of have a tendenacy to jump off when pressing the A buton. Ah well D I hope you all play it too whoever reads this.
