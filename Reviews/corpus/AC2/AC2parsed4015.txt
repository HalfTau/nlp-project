One word review BAD!Poor controller support used a Logitech F310, VERY confusing mapping, clunky controls you wanted to run up that wall? Nope, Im going to drop you to your death instead!, repetitious and monotonous sneak, kill, run away, hide, rinse, repeat, the WORST fighting system Ive seen in a while and youre forced to do it often not hard, just boring, and infuriatingly slow, the parkouring wears thin see bad controls, and what starts as a mere story of revenge quickly devolves into a ridiculous rehash of the Illuminati and everything you know is wrong tropes with a different name.UPlay DRM is horrible, to the point where Im considering not getting any more Ubisoft games. It HAS to run or else AC2 wont run, and some extras are hidden behind UPlay achievements which just require you to progress in the game but you WONT get the points if youre running UPlay offline.I havent wanted a game to end so bad to get on with the plot since Halo 1, and even that Id play again. But not this, or any Assassins Creed game in single player.DO NOT waste your time or money on this.You want Parkour? Play Prince of Persia. Stealth? Thief, Splinter Cell, Deus Ex. Want a time sink? Skyrim or Fallout.
