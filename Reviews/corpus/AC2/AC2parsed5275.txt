A much better improvement over the first game in many areas. The first game was fun the first few assassinations, but that sensation died off pretty quick. I had actually quit the first game and didnt finish it until I picked 2 up. I think we come to realize early on as to whether or not we are AC fans... if the first installment appeared to have a whole lot of potential, but fell short then I dont think you can go wrong by giving it another shot.P.S. This is one of very few games out there where I spent over 45 hours playing.
