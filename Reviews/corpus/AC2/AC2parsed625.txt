Assassins Creed 2 is a beatiful game, but so was the first Assassins Creed. Much of the praise that a person might heap on this sequel applied to its predecessor, when you come right down to it, and yet the execution this time around has undeniably improved and the scope has expanded. The first game showed tremendous promise. It was the start of an exciting new IP with promise, but thats as far as it went. Assassins Creed 2 is the game that uncompromisingly turns promise into reality, and if you can obtain it, see that you do!
