Improves on nearly every aspect of the first game.  Still has its problems, but city exploration and assassinations are as fun if not moreso than the original.  Some annoying out of character actions in cutscenes can be irritating, but youll be too busy spending 95 of your time having fun in the gameworld to really let it get to you.
