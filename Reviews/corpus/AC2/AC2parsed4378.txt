This truly is a worthy successor to Altars story. The environment, particularly the cities, are lively, there is a lot more to do, from objectives, to interaction, to managing an entire city. While the collecting this to achieve that is still there, the overall dynamic is increased a lot. References to the first game are made, and I would definitely suggest playing them in order.I think you can best compare this to the improvements made from GTA III over Vice City to San Andreas. Everything got bigger, more detailed, and more refined. It takes a little getting used to the new fighting style, and I could have done without the swoosh visuals of hacknslash games, but hey, the additions, including an enemys health status, are worth it. You certainly dont have to complete every single grind quest anymore, although you most likely will anyway.Money plays a big role, because you can aquire upgrades and other items with it, bribe people etc. Citizens and guards react to your actions, and you, in return, have to take steps to make yourself less known. On top of that you will meet well known historical figures, even befriend them and enlist their help! If you liked the first Assassins Creed, even a little bit, you will not be disappointed by this one!
