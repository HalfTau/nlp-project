Really fun game for alternate history buffs.Gameplay  8/10 Challenging and not as simple as future entries.Graphics  7/10 Hold up really well almost 10 years later, although a little blocky on closeup, textures are nothing special.Audio  10/10Story  10/10 Best AC story Ive yet seen, phenomenal acting and engaging characters.Overall  9/10 Great game with only a few shortcomings, glitched out on me only 45 times, which is acceptable for any game, because no game can be absolutely perfect.
