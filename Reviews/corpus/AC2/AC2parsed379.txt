ITS SO GOOD! My personal favourite in the Ezio trilogy, the visuals may look a little dated, but in October 2017 it still plays and feels absolutely incredible. There are a couple glitches here and there, but as far as Ubisoft games go, its pretty darn good. Telling a great story, with a satisfying end and some awesome voice acting, this is the reason assassins creed is a modern main stay franchise.
