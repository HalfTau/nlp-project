Having finished AC1 I went straight into this one and was pleasently surprised.Lets start with the pros and consPros sick characters great story better map than AC1 Italy is far friendlier than the holy land basic game mechanics were included a lot better than in AC1 lots of stuff to do collectables, upgrading villa for that sweet mulah.. cool recalls of AC1 good graphics, even for today 2017Cons feathers. the one and only collectable you have just about 0 drive to actually get except for a weapon reward at 50 feathers rather useless scenes outside the animus minor detail, reallySo as you can see, I was very, very, very happy with this game. Its another one where you could spend a lot of time or finish it in a good amount of time not too long, not too short. Furthermore it gives the series a ton of lore and Ezio truly is a interesting character who truly matures from the beginning to the end of the game as he should, since it takes more than 20 years.Overall Assassins Creed 2 is an amazing sequel and going forward Ill be interested to see if Ubisoft could keep it up.
