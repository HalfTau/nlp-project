As much As I want to like and recommend this game I just cannot Unless you like hard pc angle control and view angles that frustrate you to the point where i will not finnish my 2nd playthrough. I did finnish 1 playthrough because when I buy a game I must try to finnish once to get moneys worth out of the game. I liked the game story itself but hated the view and controls. I have never been so angry and frustrated playing a game. I played both Darksiders video walkthrough needed and they were the hardest games I have and are linear and would recommend them over this game even though the story may not be as goodAfter all of that I just picked up Brotherhood Deluxe for 7.98 reviews say controlls better. I am a sucker for punishment lol. I want to like this series it could have been so good. I wonder if it was more designed  for console and not pcI remember the reason I quit playing I am stuck in a dungeon with water and have to jump to a few poles then bounce of a wall then swing around on some bars back to a door to open. I hit the lever to start and am unable to jump off the 1st pole to 2nd. I can jump in water I can jump back to landing  but will not jump to next pole. Have tried a few time since Dec and finally this week after trying again I said forget it. I have enough other games that work! Now I wondering if it was a bad save.
