Best AC game they have done. And if you only play 1 of the now who knows how many versions, I swear there are more games of Assassins Creed then there are Pokemon now days, then this game should be the one you play. Havnt played Black Flag, but friends have told me its as good as AC2 so... Though after a while it gets dull, same old stuff you do every second, find, kill run...find kil run....find kill fight a hundred people and never get touched because you have mastered countering. 7.5/10
