Its always nice to see an ambitious franchise find its feet. AC2 is a huge leap forward from its predecessor, incorporating more varied combat and mission objectives, larger cities to explore, a more engaging protagonist, and a handful of secondary mechanics that give you more reasons to complete side missions and search for hidden objectives.Its not a short ride, either. 100 competion took me about 56 hours, and I imagine a bare bones playthrough would require at least 12. Youd be missing out though, because the charm of this Renaissance romp is in the out of the way details.
