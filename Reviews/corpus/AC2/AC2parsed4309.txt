Amazing how Ubisoft managed to take a poor game and turn the sequel into something great.The environments and animations are still spectacular, but II also has a very likeable protagonist, an engaging story, slightly better controls, an upgradeable base, better voice acting, and much, much more varied gameplay.If the first AC is a 6/10, then II is a 9/10.
