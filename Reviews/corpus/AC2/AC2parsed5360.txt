Very intersting game, loved the first one and never really got the chance to get the second one until i saw the Steam sale that had all 3 for 30, and i must say that the story, graphics, and game play is pretty polished and well designed.The only complaint i have about the game is that it is ridicuiously difficult to play with a keyboard and mouse, I recommend that you buy a gamepad or a pc version of a Xbox 360 controller. Overall i give the game a 9/10
