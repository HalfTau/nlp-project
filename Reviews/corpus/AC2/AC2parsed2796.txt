Great game.The controls are different and weird, but thats probably because im used to xbox and ps. I dont like the head and feet instead of words... confusing. But ive got there, and now am slaying juggernauts by the dozen. I would love to see AC3 or Rogue on Mac, they are the best in my opinion. Woot
