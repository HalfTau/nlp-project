My personal favorite installment of the Assassins Creed franchise. Heres my breakdown of the gameGameplay 8/10  The combat system is a little more clunky than the newer Assassin Creed installments, but I dont think thats a bad thing. You have to thunk about every action during combat and freerunning, which makes the game more engaging than some of the more modern games. The weapon diversity is a little lacking, and the targetting system for throwing objects/guns is a little clunky.Graphics  6/10  OK, this game is a little dated compared to the jawdropping graphics of newer games. However, there is still so much detail packed into every area. I also think the older graphics go well with the setting of the game. You still need to use some imagination to really enjoy the looks of the game.Story  10/10  By far the most welldeveloped plot of any Assassins Creed game. Ezio is the most relatable character from the franchise, and some of the famous people you meet along your journey arent forced into the story for no reason like some of the newer games. This game is a musthave for any gamer.
