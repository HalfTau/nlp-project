I am so disappointed. This is a good game on the console BUT in order to play it you need a Uplay account and for Mac users this is a real pain in the rse. I read the specs before I downloaded this on my Macbook so I created that stupid Uplay account not knowing the frustration of what would come once I would download that 7.5GB file. When I attempt to open AC2 a message comes up saying theres an internet access problem. My internet is running fine but its the Uplay proxy sh!t that needs to be adjusted. So, because Im on Mac, I had to download WineBottler to open the Uplay application. That Uplay application needed to update then I had to reinstall AC2 just to open it with the Windows Steam application THAT DIDNT EVEN WORK!!! Screw Ubisoft and their  Uplay! MAC USERS DONT BUY! Youre better off getting it on the App Store or, even better, on console. I bought it on this because it was on special.
