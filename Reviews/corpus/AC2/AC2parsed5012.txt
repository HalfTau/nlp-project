I LOVE ASSSASSINS CREED SERIES!! 2 especially!! Ezio is my favourite, and by far the most stylish, charming, and extremely hot assassin there ever was. Really really fun to play, I could get lost in this game for hours. Excellent story line, though while playing with my controller, I did need to play with it a bit to get it to match up as close as I can to the Xbox. Other than that, by all means! Enjoy!
