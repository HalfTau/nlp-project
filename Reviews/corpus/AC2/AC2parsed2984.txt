This game is amazing it has tons of location and history, It is like a history class, but fun in a way. You get an assassin that is actually talking like an italian not like that 90 English and only like 5 French crap that Assassins Creed Unity had. P The game also has tons of locations to captivate the players interest. So much side activities. And believe me GET THIS GAME!!! The only downside FUNG UPLAY!!!! Seriously though just get the damn game!!!
