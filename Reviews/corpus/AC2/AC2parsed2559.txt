Gives you the freedom to explore great historical settings while on a mission to bring righteous justice to your enemies... whats not to love.Having seen other people play I thought Id really struggle to get to grips with the controls but theyre a nice balance between manual and auto that lets you pull off incredible stunts without needing the skill of a master ninja while still being in control.I think the setting is amazing, the controls are excellent, the story is good, the difficulty is well balanced and the characters are interesting... only gripe I have is that the missions can get a bit samey run all the way across the city and do XXXX.
