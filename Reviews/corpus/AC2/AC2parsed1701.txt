It was OK. After watching Videogamedunkeys review, I didnt want to finish it, but I had already bought 14. So now since I know that all the side missions are just repeats I am just going to play the main missions from now on. I only bought the series because of the low prices. Its one of those games that you dont want to play again, but you already bought it.
