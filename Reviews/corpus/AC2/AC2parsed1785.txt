the 3rd party DRM kills your accessibility.i bought this and cant access it or any other game that i have that is a ubisoft title that uses ubiplay.the whole 3rd party DRM has killed my relationship with ubisoft, who i have been buying stuff from since their beginnings.digital rights management, when it takes all access from the user for no wrong doing is no right at all, thats a wrong.buying a game through a second party to be made accessible or nonaccessible by a third party is not really legal is it?im not buying it through UBI, steam is supplying it through them but my dealings are with steam, and though i have paid i still cant access my own games, not just this one, ANY that use uplay, so let me point out that i will NOT be making ANY purchases of games that use uplay because i cant access my account, barring further sales from the sellers end, real logical..buyer beware.
