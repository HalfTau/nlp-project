Holy crap, what a fantastic game! Turns out everything Ive heard about AC2 all this years were true. This is a fantastic game and improves vastly on everything that was done on the first entry.Assassins Creed 2 has a great and lengthy story, that doesnt bore you at all like the first one may have. There are many missions types, which add some longevity to the game since you have lots of collectibles to collect and secondary missions to do.The gameplay and audio have improved severely the freerun feels more natural smarter too! and there are lots of different weapons, that causes the combat to be deeper and more enjoyable. The voice acting is top notch and the music is very atmospheric, as is the fantastic environment and colorful open world. The cities, buildings, persons and historical events are accurate and very well developed. Theres also a new economy system where you receive money as a means of taxes via Villa upgrades, which can be used to buy weapons, armors, ammunition, etc.After playing this game, Assassins Creed 1 felt like a tutorial. This is what the first one shouldve been and its marvelous, a classic and a mustplay.Final Rating 10/10
