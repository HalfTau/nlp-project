Finally got around to finishing the game with 95 completion Ive decided that getting EVERY single feather in the game was a task for another time! and I cannot believe how well the game holds up six years since release. Save for some slightly nauseating camera angles during some timed run sequences, there isnt a lot to complain about this second installment of the grand Assassins Creed series. Looking forward to continuing the Ezio trilogy with Brotherhood!
