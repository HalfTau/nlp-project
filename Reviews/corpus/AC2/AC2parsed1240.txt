The game is sht, the controls always thinks the opposite of what ur about to do so you end up jumping off a tower when the target is right in front of u.Hard to use hidden blade in combat too, sure it grants instant kill except heavy armor dudes, but u have to click right on time to counter kill, and when you predict that the enemy will hit you with a bigger movement and slower hit, it just hits you straight up, no jumping in a stride and swing his weapon half way around himself and land it on u. but when u predict he is going to go for the hit, u see him dancing ballet before trying to hit u, and once u clicked for counter kill, ur basically gonna get hit if you didnt really counter in the clickP.S  Why is the Medici cape still useful even though Savonarola in in power
