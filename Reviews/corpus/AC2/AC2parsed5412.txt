Combat and missions improved from AC1, LOTS of main missions to assassinate instead of just 9 from AC1. The stealth missions can be hard read frustrating/ but overall its a huge improvement from AC1. The story was the best part of AC1 and it is again here. The ending in AC1 was wtf, and this is WTF to the 100th power. Other than the bizarre/wtf endings, the story is really really good in both games.TLDR Good game, worth the price at 15.
