This was such a good game. This was my first Assassins creed game and I love it. I like that there it isnt about guns because I preffer using blades and throwing knives. Also the parkour is great. Climbing buildings, hopping around, and, of course, the leap of faith. I think the only thing that I dislike about this game is that its too easy.
