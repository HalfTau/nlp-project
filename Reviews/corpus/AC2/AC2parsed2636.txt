I had played the first Assassins Creed on XBox and I  was very hesitant to be playing the second one on the pc, since every one said it was a bad port. I was pleasantly surprised. It controlled alright, there werent as many bugs as I expected and I was able to play through the whole game without having and gamebreaking glitches.As far as the game goes, it is a massive improvement over the first one. Huge open world with lots of things to do. That being said, a lot of side quests do not serve any purpose other than being fetch quests. Yeah I can collect 100 feathers but why should I? There is no cool weapon or peice of armor at the end of it. At least the tomb missions give you a nice suit of armor at the end. The codex pages also allow you to learn some new skills, as well as being necessary for finishing the game. But the feathers, templar tombs, truth scans, and picture and treasure collection is just to make your villa look better.I am also getting tired of the climb a high place to reveal map thing that Ubisoft games keep doing, even though AC are the first few games to do so.If you are looking to play a nice long adventure game that has the feel of tomb raider and prince of persia then I highly recommend this game.
