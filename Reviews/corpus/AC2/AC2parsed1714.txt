The best there is, the best there was and the best there will be, i know my review is too late and i had this game since release but never thought to write review until now since i played all later games up to ACSyndicate, believe me, all games after this are subpar compared to this one, only flaw is outdated graphics compared to new ACs, but considering the time it was released, graphics were upto date at that time, and also the combat system is somehow boring NOW after playing the later games as its enhanced by miles except for ACUnity which is a piece of dog crap s.hit, alex Amico Creative Director s.hit should be fired for ACUnity.Ubicrap should remaster this game and port ACB combat system to this one and this will be the best game in history, however, it is still the best AC game ever released by Ubicrap.
