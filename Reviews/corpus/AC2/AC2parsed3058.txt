I dont think this game needs any introduction, and for those it does, here goesYou areId even recommend to play this game and Brotherhood  Revelations before the original AC game with Altar.Good Story, Rather good controlsbit shifty at the start, good after an hour or so.While graphics are good, dont expect any highdef Realism. Its a good game even without excellent graphics.In ShortIf you like freerange games, that still manage to keep you occupied or focused on several things to do, this is a good game for you.
