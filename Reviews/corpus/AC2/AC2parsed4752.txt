I cannot believe I played this game almost 5 years after its release. I run a solid rig with 680s in SLI so Im used to beautiful visuals. That considered, this game matches any next gen game currently available in the visual department. The storyline had me captivated, the ambiance, especially the music, was all top notch. I initially tried AC 1 a few years ago and I lost interest. This game is significantly better.
