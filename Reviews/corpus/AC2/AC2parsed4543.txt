By the time I had finished this game I really wanted to murder something, not because of how awesome assassins are portrayed, but because of the ing fixed camera, the  controls, the low framerate, the fact that you have to shut down steam before you can restart the game, and the issues with the game sometimes not shutting down properly, which means you have to reboot your computer. The storyline and gameplay is really good, so Id recommend the game to people who have a lot of patience and experience with awful ports.
