Personaly my favorite assassins creed game of all time , has a great storyline , great voice acting , has my favorite character ezio in it and follows his story perfectly. The Soundtrack is one of my favorites and i cant think of a better game than this if you like open world ,action , parkour like old times game. the game doesnt have bugs , i cant seem to find one and ubisoft did a great job with the graphics. Hope this review helped you guys and i hope you have asmuch fun as i did with this game D
