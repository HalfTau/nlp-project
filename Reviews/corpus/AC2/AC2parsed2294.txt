A superior followup to the original Assassins Creed. With added roleplying elements and somehwat simpler combat, it not only expanded, but improved on many aspects that made the original such a solid gaming experience. Yes, there are issues, such as easy to acquire cash and nothing to spend it on, but they are minor, if not slightly regrettable issues.Warning I almost needed three hands to control my avatar during some of the more complex jump puzzles while using a mouse and keyboard. I have a somewhat disabled right hand, therefore using a gaming controller is very difficult for me. That being said, generally speaking, a mouse a keyboard worked just fine.9/10
