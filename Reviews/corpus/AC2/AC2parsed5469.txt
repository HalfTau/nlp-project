This is everything a sequel to a promising but flawed game needs to be. Assassins Creed 2 improves on the free running strengths of the original while fixing the weaknesses of repetition. The change from the Crudsades time period to Renaissance Italy brings a fresh look that is rarely seen in video games. Its not quite a rigorous stealth game, a presicion platformer, or a stylish beatem up but something inbetween that works well. Sadly, there is a very obtrusive digital rights management solution that requires a constant internet connection from the user and an online Ubi Soft server.
