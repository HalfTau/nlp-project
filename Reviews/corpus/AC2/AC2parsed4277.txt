Well... Id LIKE to say if this game is good or bad... IF I COULD PLAY THE GAME!!!! Yeah... so kinda wasted twenty dollars there. Those 1.3 hours of gameplayis just me staring at a Connection Error message. And beleive me, its not my internet. Ive reconnected, reconfigured, I have done EVERYTHING in my power to play this. I hope Assassins Creed III will make up for this on my Xbox...
