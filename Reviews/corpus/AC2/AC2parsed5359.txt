Assassins Creed II offers a lot of excellent content and an intriguing story that combines fantasy, history, and conspiracy theory.  More importantly, it expands and improves upon all the gameplay elements from the first game. You get more options in combat, more unique missions, more interesting locations, and more extras to collect. The soundtrack is also great.
