Before I met Ezio, I was bound by rules and supposed truths. This game really was, is, and will be a revolutionary game.10/10 on any criteria except for maybe easter eggs 420/mario for that oneThe fact that I have run through the story several times and spent an additional 30 hours just exploring alone should prove to most that this is a phenomenal game. Those of you thinking about Ubisofts recent reputation on the Assassins creed series should get this just to see why the fan base is really disappointed. But, I think that after a game like this, any fan base would be dissapointed by the next ones in the series.I would reccomend this to everyone highly this and brotherhood.
