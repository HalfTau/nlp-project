Assassins Creed 2 is exactly what a sequel should be It improves upon everything the original achieved and adds its own distinct identity to the series. Instead of following Altair through the holy land, this time you follow his somehow Itallian decendent Ezio from birth to adulthood. The story improves upon the first game in that the first game failed at making a Da Vinci Code knock off, where as AC2 is most definitely one! Right down to the HORRIBLE PLOT LATER IN THE GAME! But anyway, the graphics are gorgeous, the weapons are more imaginative and fun and the controls, mostly, seem tighter. The only issue I have with the controls is that AC2 demands much more precision than its predecessor and theyre just not good enough for some of the timed puzzles. AC2 also succeeds in making good use of cinematic cutscenes that add to rather than distract from the feel of the game. Most importantly, the missions are all varied and are even more fun this time around. VERY highly recommended!
