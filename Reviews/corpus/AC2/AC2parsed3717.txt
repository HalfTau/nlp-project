The sequel in Ubisofts well known franchise We all love so greatly, Assassins Creed 2, is A GEM! Gameplay is smooth and addictive, the fighting machanics may be classified as silly The enemies wait patiantly as you beat up thier friends then when your takedown on the enemy is done, then they attack Graphics wise, great even today, good textures and texture popping is minimal. One problem that bothers be about Ubisoft titles is the Damn softwere needed to play, you need to sign up for an account, put the code in the softwere the play, it kills the mood when im ready for speedrun action. Overall, Good game, buy if you want endless fun blah blah blah, If you like the Assassins Creed series, this is by far the best in the series, so yeah, get it...Now!
