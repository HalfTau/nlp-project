This game is the second part to play an assassin and fight against the templers.is the start to the story of a beautiful character called. Theright from chapter 1 onwards.I like theof the game cause itwhich let me have alot of fun during missions or in the open world. The combat is nice which alot of cool finishing animations but it can be boring after some time.The grafics are really good and i still enjoy them in 2017. Also i really like thewhich made the gameto play it over again.The only downsides are that you encounter bugs but theyre mostly not annoying and the horse movement especially jumpings feels a bit clunky. The boring part of the story was the collecting of the codex pages cause its the same again and again.I still recommend this game since it was a blast to play and a great time and expirience.
