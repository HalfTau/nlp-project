This is my first ever Assassins Creed game Ive ever played and man I wasnt disapointed . For Starters , You had to start at the very beginning of how a young rich playboy found out that he has a long lineage of skilled Assassins protecting the world from the plans of the Templars .the one thing that is most Unique about this specific AC Game , is the story and the little comedy relief of it that makes it have its own charm to it . besides all the side quest and collecting all the items to get special stuff , you will enjoy all the fine details and info about the history of Florence and Venice in Renasaince Italy .
