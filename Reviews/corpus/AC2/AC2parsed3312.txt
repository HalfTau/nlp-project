An improvement compared to the first game of the series, also bigger game. Beautiful sceneries, captivating characters, immersive story and good soundtrack. You can explore, free roam, do the main story missions and optional missions, grab collectibles, almost in any order. There are items upgrades, new weapons, and skills. Many places to go and exploration to do. The Deluxe Edition includes 3 bonus areas, that are not important for the main story but provide additional game time if you had not enough exploration already. This game is worth to be played, even if you are new to the series, this is a good start. This game kept me entertained for more than 40 hours.
