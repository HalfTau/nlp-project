Fantastic stealth actionadventure video game. The story is probably the best and least stupid it has been in the series, but however hasnt aged perfectly. I would say Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is better to a very certain extent. This game, atmospherically, nails it. Italy is beautiful aged by todays standards and traversing it is really fun. I played this first in 2012 on PS3, but after playing a game as fluid as Assassins Creed Unity, I certainly wish for the new traversing mechanics. This one feels somewhat stiff. Combat is crap for the most part. The game is VERY easy too, and combat is more of an annoyance than anything. Music is really good. Characters and voice acting are both great.8/10
