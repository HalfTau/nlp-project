One word I can describe to this game FunThe story picked up where Assassins Creed left off. The combat system is much better than last time, enemy HPs are now shown, you can explore more cities, detection meter is balanced unlike the first game, enemies can now counterattack making the game more challenging, chests are scattered all over, enemies search the area first before giving up, and citizens are more reactive to unusual activities.The negative side is controls. You can easily lose control or make actions that you never meant such as jumping to your death without pressing jump.Overall, the game wellbalanced, calm in Venice, has a good story, and definitely fun to kill those templars.
