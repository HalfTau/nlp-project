Definitely the defining Assassins Creed experience, from before the story went haywire. It took everything bad about the first game and fixed it, introducing memorable characters and more satisfying gameplay. This installment is the pinnacle of the Assassins Creed franchise some would argue that brotherhood is, but I suppose its up to personal taste at that point.Although personally it is not my favorite game in terms of environment and gameplay, it was revolutionary for its time and allowed the series to grow like it has today.9/10P.S  At the time of review Steam says Ive only 4 hours of gameplay time, but thats because I beat the game on Playstation 3 before getting it on sale here. Ive yet to finish it on PC, but Im working my way through the franchise
