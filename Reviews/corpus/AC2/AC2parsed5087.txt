Much more fleshed out and better realized than the original, but still suffering from the same problems except theyre even more obvious this time around thanks to gameplay additions that simply clash with some of the core game systems. Im mainly talking about stealth and tomb sections that really show off Assassins Creeds finicky controls clearly not built for that level of precision. Putting all that aside, what works REALLY works and wont grate on you after ten minutes like the original did  story is more cohesive albeit a traditional revenge story, gameplay is varied up a bit and collectibles are actually worth collecting. Also features fisticuffs with a fat man in a dress and wacky totallynotaliens ending. WTF, man?
