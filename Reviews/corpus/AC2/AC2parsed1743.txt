Overall, one of the better games in the Assassins Creed franchise. Much better story, openworld and characters but offers 0 challenge.Pros Great story with memorable cast of characters and villains. Highly detailed and distinct locations. Cities and countryside are a joy to explore Diverse arsenal of weapons compared to the first game and expanded moveset with great animations. Open world feels alive and accurate full of side activities that do not overwhelm the player.Cons Ridiculously easy. Enemies pose no threat whatsoever and by the end of the game Ezio is akilling machine, able to murder an army of armored guards with no problems whatsoever. The difficulty level in this game is a step down from Assassins Creed 1 which although still easy, required more from the player. Has a lot of performance problems on the PC, even with a GTX 980 Ti and an i7 3770k. Stuttering and aggressive pop in of textures and shadows are not uncommon. One of Ubisofts worst PC ports BUT it is playable and looks better than the PS3 and Xbox360 versions.
