What can I say? Its a classic. This game is ALOT better than the original Assassins Creed game. The story, gameplay and mechanics are pretty good for a console port. I know all games are made on pc first. But it seems that the AC series are more on consoles. Its really great so far. I havent even went half through the game yet, Im still actually like 5 there. I cant really say much. Just that you should get this game because its a good one I tell you. The only thing I hate though, is the uPlay drm. You always have to log in before playing the game, then after it logs in it updates every damn time. After finally doing all of that you still have to press play and launch the game through uPlay... Its the only bad thing about ubisoft games. If you can ignore that, then you should get this game.
