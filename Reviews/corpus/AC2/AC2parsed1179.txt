What seems like a typical revenge plot quickly evolves into an epic story filled with conspiracy and betrayal. Join Ezio Auditore, everyones favorite Italian from the Renaissance, as he spends two decades of his life uncovering and disrupting a very powerful mans plans of world domination, furthering the struggle between Assassins and Templars carried from the first entry in the franchise.Whether you like to run across the rooftops of 15thcentury Florence and Venice, gallop through the beautiful Tuscany countryside or simply learn more about some of their most relevant landmarks, the world is very appealing, albeit rather poor with side content.If the original Assassins Creed didnt quite captivate your interest, maybe this one will. Weapon and armor customization, rebuilding an entire villa, new methods of evading and assassinating guards, lack of repetitive main story missions. The only aspects I can defend from the first game are certain moments in its storyline and the enemy targets themselves, as they had a bigger philosophical impact on the player.
