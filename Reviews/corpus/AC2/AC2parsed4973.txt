Great game. If you dont know, this game is a 3rd person action game with parkour and some stealth. The storyline is excellent, and the music is superb. My only issue is, although the graphics are usually fantastic, they can be extremely ugly at times. Other than that, this game is an excellent game that will give you about 30 hours of gameplay.9/10
