The best Assassins Creed title there is. AC1 was a pile of but this game is so much better. With big cities like Venice and Florence to explore, improved combat, a good storyline and, most importantly, very fun to play. I recommend it not only to the early Assassins Creed fans, but also those who want to play a classic good game.
