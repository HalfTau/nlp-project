This game may very well be my favorite game to come out of the seventh generation of gaming. Seriously, Assassins Creed II fixes everything that was wrong with its predecessor. It has a very fluid albeit slightly complex control and fighting system, it has good variation in gameplay, and the story is pretty good overall. If you havent played this game yet, I do highly recommend it.
