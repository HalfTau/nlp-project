I never understood why this game was so popular and I never understood why people said its the best game in the series until I actually brought the game. And holy sht what a game this is. For a game thats about 6 years old, its.... Its just fabulous and couldnt agree more with this being the best Sorry black flag..The beginning of the story Ezios story, no one gives a sht about Desmond at this point had this charm of 2 brothers just being brothers and not alot of the get straight into the action bullsht. DAnd for the rest of what Ive played... very sad indeed. SPOILERThe soundtrack is very, very good. Some of the music like the famous Ezios family are an absolute masterpieceScenery? From what Ive seen, its beautiful.To conclude, buy this game now
