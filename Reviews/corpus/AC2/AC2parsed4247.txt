Assassins Creed 2 is an actionadventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. Assassins Creed 2 is a sequel to the previous game Assassins Creed.Desmond Miles was about to be executed but were saved due to the intervention by Lucy Stillman. It appears that Lucy is an assassin in disguise. She helps Desmond escape Abstergo. After some rough journey, Desmond finally reach the assassins hideout. There he meet Rebecca and Shaun. Desmond needs to learn how to become a real assassin. So there he goes again, into the Animus. This time, Desmond will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, an Italian Nobleman.The gameplay then. Ubisoft really learned their mistake this time I think, and not just that, the gameplay arent just no longer repetitive, but really expanded. You can now earn money and buy weapons and upgrades to improve yourself. Youre going to pickpocket letters no longer, but youre going to steal money instead. Notoriety system are now included, which mean, the more bad things you do, it will get you wanted and will make the guards aware of your present and at some notoriety level, will attack you on sight. You can also now hire a thief or some mercenary to help you do some task or distract the guards. Ezio can now swim in water.The graphics are also improved. Ragdoll physics are even better than the previous and the Italian environment are really much detailed and feels more alive. The water effects, the skies, the textures, the lightning, everything is better. The animation may look pretty much the same with the previous game, but with better physics.This may be the best Assassins Creed game yet. The game is very stable, giving you much freedom while the story still quite linear. I recommend this.Rating 9/10
