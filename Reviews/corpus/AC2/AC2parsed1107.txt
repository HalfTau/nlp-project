One of the first missions of the game is a foot race against yoru brother up to a church. If you mess up the first time good luck getting past it. Everytime the save reloads the brother is already half way to the goal post. Other then that the game seems to decide randomly if you will climb of a wall or jump kick off it. I cant seem to count on climbing even when its just a two foot wall instead desmond perfers to do his jump kick move off the freaken air. Yes, you read that right. This is extremely fursterating for a mandiatory mission at the very onset of the game.
