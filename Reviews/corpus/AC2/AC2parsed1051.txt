Good game. It is a console port to PC, and it is better if you have a controller, but not impossible to play if you dont. I used only keyboard and mouse. I give this game 9 out 10 stars, as it can be frustrating to play with keyboard and mouse. I also dislike that getting all the chests and all the assassinations didnt add anything to the game. I also dislike by mid to late game, money means nothing. I ended the game with over 700k. Despite all of that, highly recommend playing.
