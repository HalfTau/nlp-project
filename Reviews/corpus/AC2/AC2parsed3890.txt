Assassins Creed II is really good way to spend your time and money on. You are free to roam around the virtual world at your own will, kill annoying guards and people that defy you and loot treasure chests for money. You can basically become a rich man and get all the weapons you need so easily making the game really simple and fun. Definately recommended for people who want to roam around and kill people.
