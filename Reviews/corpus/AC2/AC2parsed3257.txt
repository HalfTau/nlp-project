Amazingly gorgeous game. Interesting story. Gorgeous graphics, good voice work... This game is fantastic. Even my mother, who is not into games fell in love with the realistic scenery. There are some parts of teh game, though, that are amazingly frustrating. Punchthekeyboard frustrating. Be careful to dont break stuff in real life.
