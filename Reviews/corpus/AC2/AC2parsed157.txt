Hands down the best Assassins Creed game ever... i mean Orgins can be good i havent played it Even if it is better i will still love Ezio and to be honest i think he is probably one of the best characters in any game. His character developement is just magnificent! Its a shame we dont have games like these anymore.. but hey what do i know. Anyways the story is really good, the graphics are still decent and if you  want to feel like a badass, play this masterpiece! The Music too is legendary! !One issue i do have on the pc version however is the controls for the mouse and keyboard, i couldnt get used to them... so if you want to play this game play it with a controller as i think it was intended for this game.
