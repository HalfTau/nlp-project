By far the best game in the series and still worth a play in 2016.Great missions, with only a few boring but short fillers sparingly thrown in.Great plot and interesting characters.SO MUCH TO DO Tonnes of great side missions, TONNES of collectables and Tonnes of side objectives.All of these fold seamlessly into the game, just feels like one massive sandbox with great progression.
