A proper sequel of Assassins Creed 1, AC2 shows little changes in its setup.Pros nice graphics, even if a bit simple realism? very nice idea of having your own personal base  luna park also, value to arts and history, which is poorly felt nowadays exciting exploration of fictional templar crypts mindblowing final plot twist which turns your head upside down and insideout fun glyphs minigames, help break the monotony maybe a bit less simple than AC1  some missions require planning, which is good.Cons feather quest in AC2  templar flag quest in AC1. So much pain in the bass, very poor reward races are sometimes frustrating for their request of absolute perfection same old story, final plot twist aside I was more excited in the real world sketches the PC is a lady killer bachelor and when he is surrounded by s he is embarassed. I would have liked the possibility of hiring them not necessarily with cutscenes, to add flavour to the character  no, he is a jesuite in the inside and you have no option of changing itRecommended  for those who like this kind of game. Otherwise, try and test it before buying once you play the first 3  5 hours you know how you will play for the rest of the game.
