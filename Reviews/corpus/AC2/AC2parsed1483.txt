Pros Fantastic story which consists of great character development and purpose, making it intriguing and interesting. Good gameplay although the combat could have been better if the combo kill was added in this game rather than ACB, doing so could possibly make the combat to easy, therefore one could say that AC2s more challenging gameplay is better. Decent open world consisting of multiple cities and challenges for those seeking to acheive full game completion. Great time period. Ezio has charisma, charm, intelligence, skill etc... A VERY likable character and by far the best Assassin, in my opinion.Cons The combat and general game mechanics system isnt as developed as that of ACB or ACR, and is still very plain and simple. But then again, this is hardly a con, what else could we have expected from Ubisoft when this game came out? Im Italian, and the voice acting is quite cringy at times. The accents are stereotypical and their pronounciation of Italian words is also pretty bad at times.In short, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Wherever it lacks in graphics or game play, it makes up for in story.Rating 9.5/10.
