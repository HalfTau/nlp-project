If you ever thought Games For Windows Live was the worst P.O.S. to ever exist think again. I cant even launch the game because the worst P.O.S. that UPlay is keeps crashing. I owned some AC games on PlayStation platforms and Steam for some time now but I never been into AC but finally I thought let me give a try to AC2 cause they say its really awesome and here I am nope UPlay Crash.
