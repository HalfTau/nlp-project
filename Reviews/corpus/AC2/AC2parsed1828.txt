This isdefinitive assassin game. Rich environments, engaging story, and superbly designed gameplay add up to an eyeopening experience.I didnt have any serious issues with Uplay. While the final Uplay action didnt register upon completing the game, Ubisoft customer support quickly sorted it out.In any case, theres a reason Ezio is the very definition of the assassin in the gaming world.
