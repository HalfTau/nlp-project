I am suprised how Assasins creed is really nice game. Gameplay is really smooth, main story is nicely done. What i do not like is side quests,doing same things again and again is not my hobby. Sometimes i have trouble with control,but its maybe i am not used to games like this.Enviroment of the game is beautiful,Italy is very detailed..maybe i will use assasins creed as turistic guide when i will be thereI like how the game adds new things,weapons and so during the gameplay,so you dont get bored.prosevniromentsmooth gameplaystorygraphicskills and equipment progressionmain character is charismaticconscontrolsside quest13sessionsometimes AI
