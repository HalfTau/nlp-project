I know that people have said this is the best of the series a couple of years ago when I purchased it, but its one of THE WORST console ports  ever. I didnt realise? know? at the time. If you play PC and have/use/like a controller  youre good to go  if youre an actual PC player  mouse and kbd  No No No  its unplayable  with a myriad array of keyboard mappings attempting to recreate a controller.Wish I could get a refund.
