I bought this game for two reasons.First, it was the only game in the AC series that i had not played and second, everyone told that it had the best story in the AC series. I bought this game as my first game on Steam and WOW!!!! This game is AMAZING! Its gameplay, story and graphics are stunning! Altough the music could be better but this game is awesome and I definitely recommend it to all AC fans.Lets go pros and consProsGreat StoryGood graphicsGood gameplayFantastic charactersConsToo easy combat except for the palace guards that are rarely foundNo multiplayer
