I would definitely recommend Assassins Creed 2. It was Game of the Year 2009. Many reasons for such achievement .... the story, Leonardo da Vinci, The awesome music by JEsper Kyd.It has also two beatiful DLCs BOnfire of Vanities and THe Battle of Forli. And also two additional MAps... Saving LOrenzo de midici in his PAllazo was really cool.Only con about this Game according to me is the combat or the fighting system or rather the gameplay is not that good compared to the Anvil engine later intoduced from AC 3.TO conclude LAdies and gentlemen ...you should most definitely buy this baby.
