Set over 500 years before the events of the original game in the series, Assassins Creed 2 is a prequel to 2009s muchloved game of the year  Batman Arkham Asylum.Ezio Auditore da Firenze its Spanish for Wayne, one of Batmans longlost ancestors, has his memories perved on by some random guy Batman Incorporated picked up off the streets as an excuse for training  and thus one of the greatest stories of revenge told in video game media begins.Following the untimely deaths of his family in true Bruceesque fashion, Ezio decides to  take on the mantle of the Batman, protector of Gotham Italy Edition and its people. Despite his lack of training, Ezio immediately sprints out the batcave and begins to clean the streets a broomstick is a viable weapon in this game, apparently. With the help of his good friend Leonardo DaVinci French for Pennyworth, Ezio sets out with a positive arsenal of exotic weaponry from an early Batarang, which due to technical limitations of the time, only has 1 hypersharp blade, and doesnt really come back after use, to the grapple, which instead of attaching to buildings from a long distance, functions as a way of holding close targets in place  with optional fatal injury.What unfolds is a spellbinding and beautiful tale of family, redemption, revenge and mass murder.Yeah, the whole no killing thing hasnt really been established yet  but  lets be honest here, I think slamming someone in the neck with a car door and leaving them, broken, miles from the nearest hospital also counts as murder.Along with a majestic soundtrack, the game also improves immersion with a launcher inspired by renaissanceera technology. I found the 30 or so minutes I had to spend getting the piece of horse dung to work highly immersive, which, coupled with the painfully intrusive notification system, really made me feel the wonderment and awe of the renaissance.
