Didnt expect the game to be as good as it was. The stpry was fun and kept me playing till the end. The DLC parts were kinds of boring and consisted of repeated action. Since i got the delux edition, there was no way to skip it, but you are not missing anything from the DLC. Core game is good though, i just find the controlls to get a bit annoying at times.
