This is a prinme example of an excelent game burned to waste with problems.Here is my time line with it1. Oh look it is on sale!2. Buy3. Install4. You must register on UPlay5. Register6. Update Uplay7. Another update8. Chrash9. Works10. Expirience crazy sound bugs and glitches11. Explore the web front to back for a solution to no avail.12. 3.2 GB update on an old game WTF?!13. Entire game is in Chinese14. Another update that fixed the chinese language problem15. Upon examination there are still glitches with the sound and seemengly nohing has changed in the game with that update except it is back in english.16. Some more research on the sound problem to no avail.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! It is a waste of money. It is plagued with glitches and bugs the most common one being the sound.The game itself it awesome. Graphics and story are stellar, gameplay also, voice acting I think it is good but I would not know because THE SOUND IS!!! I posted on Community Hub and discussion board and on Ubisoft also. No one knows how to make this thing go away.I am very dissapointed in Ubisoft and I will save my money on other developers. It is very unlikely that I will buy anything from them in the near future.
