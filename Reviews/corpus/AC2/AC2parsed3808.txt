The game that almost replaced HL2 in my heart, but not quite.Brilliant piece of stroytelling, deep and intriguing, wonderful music, gorgeous immersive graphics and atmospheres, and genuinely believable characters.  Ezio, Machiavelli, legendary stuff.I love the historical accurace Ubisoft carry in all of their games, job well done!
