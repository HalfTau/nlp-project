Written after finishing AC1 through AC3, and this is the best AC game, hands down. Story is amazing, as are the gameplay mechanics. Fun to replay once or twice, but sadly the economy system is largely useless because money buys items that let you make more money ad infinitum, however this is a minor issue that is a major failure in AC3.
