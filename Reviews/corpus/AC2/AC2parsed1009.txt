I love this game, I did a speedrun pretty much and completed it in just under 7 hours. It is a huge improvment on the original Assassins Creed because it has some depth to the story line and isnt just Kill and Repeat. I played this game for the first time on a PS3 a few years ago and instantly enjoyed the freerun style so when I signed up to steam and quite recently bought it, it is almost impossible for me to give it a negative review. I feel like the people who dont enjoy this series have either picked up the wrong genre or are not willing to sit down and put a good few hours into a game. 11/10 would play again.
