This game is a must have for every Assassins Creed fan! I have been a fan of the AC series ever since i started playing my first AC Brotherhood, after that i have completed every AC game even UNITY ,except for Syndicate. I enjoyed most of them and i knew AC2 was considered to be the best AC game of all time. So i picked it up for 5 euros during the Lunar New Year sale. Best decision ever! I believe it is indeed the best AC game so far, AC Brotherhood is 2d en AC4BlackFlag is my personal 3th.The charracter development in this game is amazing, Ezio is a really cool charracter to play. There is a lot of humour in the game and i appreciate that a lot. The story is amazing and Firenze, Venezia and all other areas are equally beautiful. I played the game for 22 hours now and ofcourse i beat the main storyline. But there are still many collectables and side quests i can do.If you are a fan of the series and for some reason havent played AC2 yet, pick it up! it wont dissapoint
