Edit Finally succeeded to play and the port on PC/Mac is a mess for gameplay! Ubisoft is clearly great at level design but gameplay is another thing. Sure you have sweet moves sometimes but when it clearly matters to achieve a mission, you cant get it right. Its impossible to enjoy the combat system because its sloppy and youll cram your finger anywhere doing random stuff or just blocking like an invicible tank killing 8 guards surrounding you one by one.I GOT 99 PROBLEMS AND UPLAY IS ALL.I bought this game for 4,99 and it is still a rip off. Cant launch the game after mutiple reinstalls. The reason UPlay.UPlay is an ugly DRM monster and is the thing that makes Ubisoft a really lame publisher despite good games. I run Tomb Raider flawlessly but when it comes to AC2 a 2009 game that third party platform cause problems you cant even imagine.Prompts, crashes, rewards nobody cares about, slowdowns, unsaved sessions, account ban....Avoid Ubisoft games at all cost on SteamHeres my advice Ubisoft why dont you just trust your customers and together we will kill UPlay!0/10 will torrent next time.
