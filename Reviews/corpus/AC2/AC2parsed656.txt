Probably my favorite among the AC franchise.Love love love Ezio Auditore da Firenze and the tutorial was like no other games.Absolutly a huge improvement from the first game with a lot better control, story and I loved the setting of the ancient Italy  really loved exploring the town...  couldnt stop saying oh, I know it, Ive been there, when my mom told me about her real life trip to the landmarks in Italy DA most have for any real gamer  female or male.
