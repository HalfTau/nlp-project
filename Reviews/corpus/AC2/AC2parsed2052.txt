core game is ok but DLC interupts main story and forces you to play it to get to the final mission. This wouldnt be bad if the DLC wasnt complete and utter garbage. Large amount of pointless, overly long, and frustrating content that you cant skip... ruined my experience of an otherwise somewhat fun game
