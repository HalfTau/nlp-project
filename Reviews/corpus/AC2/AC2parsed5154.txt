A huge improvement from the first one, from gameplay to lasting appeal AC2 is another great installation of the Assassins Creed series. The characters are interesting and add mysteries as well as conflict, and set the stage fro various missions as well as side missions, which unlike the first game, arent repetitive. Collecting diamonds is a fun way to just explore any of the cities available. A particular mission and future memory is the funnest thing in the whole game for me, involving Da Vinci, nighttime and a whole lot of fire....just a couple of hints. This is the game that truly makes the series and gives ti a notable reputation. Brotherhood and Revelations can never top the plot and gameplay of AC2, even with multiplayer. This is a worthwhile buy for any fan of the series or any fan of Ubisofts games. It combines freeroaming with stealth, a gripping storyline and memorable gameplay.
