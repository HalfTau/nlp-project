Firstly, I feel cheated. I wanted to relive good memories of having played AC2 when it first came out.  I first bought this game for Mac but it doesnt work on that format despite supposidly being availiable on that platform.  Im lucky enough to have bootcamp so I installed it on the windows side of my computer.  It worked for 3 hours then Ubisoft updated to require you to have access to their Uplay system.  It requires you to create an account with them which they will use to spam your inbox.  I gave them an email I dont really use anymore and then the CD key was locked to that email.  When I tried to switch it to my current email, I was locked out of the ability to play the game or change to the original email account when I try to log in to Uplay.  I bought the game and Im denied the ability to even play in offline mode despite having my product key and having paid for the game.Before I bought this I felt like I was honestly doing a bad thing like giving money to a hate group or a drug cartel and I wholehardity regret giving Ubisoft my money.  They will have you pay and deny you access to what you rightfully purchased.  I hate to write off an entire developer and love Assassins Creed but on moral grounds, I simply cant justify buying another one of their products.  Hope this helped.
