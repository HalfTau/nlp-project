Assassins Creed 2 is an amazing game. The story is very intriguing and will throw you for all kinds of twists and turns that you wont expect. The weapons are all incredibly fun to use, with a later addon becoming incredibly helpful if lacking in the stealth department. The parkour aspect is really helpful since you can get to areas faster. However, no game, especially not this one, is without its flaws. Stealth missions can become the bane of your existance, especially in the last hour of the game. Tailing missions become a problem when you have to make sure not to lose your distance. Some of the things the game wants you to get can become incredibly hard to find, especially when theres so many of them. Also, the game feels pretty easy. Aside from falling or failing a mission, its really hard to actually die in this game since the combat mechanics give you such an easy way to keep yourself from getting hurt. Still, I highly reccoment this game. I havent played the other Assassins Creed games yet but if youre going to start somewhere, this wouldnt be a bad place. 8/10
