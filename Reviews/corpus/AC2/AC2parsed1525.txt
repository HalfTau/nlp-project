Its good. Running around is fun, etc.For a stealth game, there are very few stealth mechanics. I almost think it was easier to be stealthy in the first game.Controls are alright overall, but when they fail, they FAIL.Good story. Mediocre visuals. The first game looks better in many respects.Also, bad port alert. Im running this on a GTX 970 and there were frequent FPS dips.Uplay is not as bad as it once was. Its still annoying that I have to use two clients to run the game, though.
