Simply put, the best game I have ever played. Ever.Ive played this game three times through, and I will often boot it up just to run around Venice or Florence and drop down on some poor unsuspecting guard.As the franchise has moved on and combat mechanics have evolved to become faster paced and more dynamic, going back to AC2 can be a bit like going from a Ferrari to a Ford Focus. Still a solid game, but the combat can be tiringly slow as this was the last game in the series before they introduced kill streaks.Visually this game holds up very well. It is surprising to thik that this was a game from the earlier part of the last generation of consoles given how well it has dated and how good it really does look.The sound in this game is simply phenominal. The soundtrack is the best in the series by a long shot, and the satisfying squelch when you stab a guy in the back is some kind of peverse pleasure.The story is probably the smartest thing about the game. After you play you might fo to Wikipedia and look up the characters only to realise that, with the exception of the Auditore family, they were all real, or at least urban legends of their day. The way the Pazzi family are finished off is true to the history of the time in terms of locations and scenarios, and the way the game is blown wide open about half way through makes it a great plot with more and more to keep you guessing and trying to understand what is going on.All in all, this game is stellar. If you havent played an AC game yet this is as good a place as any to start. Fully recommended.
