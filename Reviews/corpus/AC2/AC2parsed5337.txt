One of my favorite games of all time.Everything about this game is right.Everything glorious and amazing about the original Assassins Creed is present in this game, and everything unfortunate, or boring about the original there was a lot of that was either tossed out or upgraded and reworked to be completely amazing too. On top of that, this game adds on HUGE amounts of great new stuff to the series, and the hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, is a dozen times more awesome than Altar was in the first game.Hell, Ezio is one of the most awesome characters anywhere ever.One of the best soundtracks of any game ever.Seriously, if they kept releasing DLC for this game Id never stop buying and playing it.
