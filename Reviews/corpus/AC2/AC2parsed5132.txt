Best whirlwind tour of Italy ive never been on, and at a good price too!Seriously though, my favorite AC title so far, before Ubisoft got into the multiplayer aspect and added the minimicromanagethingsyoucouldntcarelessabout games. Great location variety, memorable characters, and a kickstoryline to boot. Buy it!
