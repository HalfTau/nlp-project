This game is just fantastic! Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a character that is so easily loved and fun to play as. The story is so compelling and rich along with the setting and absolutely marvelous soundtrack. The world itself is amazing with multiple cities recreated from the Renaissance era of Italy with tons to do and explore within them. The visuals may not be up to par with modern games but they still hold up pretty nicely. The gameplay is so much fun as well. The parkour is great for the most part sometimes it can be kinda y, the combat system is fluid and satisfying, and the amount of content will keep you busy for dozens of hours. Tons of replay value here with countless collectibles, side activites, and more secret discoveries. If there is one good thing to come out of the Assassins Creed franchise, it is without a doubt this masterpiece of a game. One of my absolute favorite games of all time and will always have a place in my heart as one of the most exhilarating, interesting, and fun gaming experiences EVER. If you are into history, parkour, killing powerful and loveable stories/characters, and vast open worlds with tons to explore, then by all means DO NOT hesitate with purchasing this fantastic game. 11/10
