Although the game is good, the launching process is a TOTAL CHAOS. WTF IS UPLAY DOING IN STEAM? And it even crashes on the intro movie! NICE ONE FOR 20 BUCKS! I am VERY upset for this amazing game.EDIT I now recommend this game because I noticed that it just takes a long while to launch. Very good game btw
