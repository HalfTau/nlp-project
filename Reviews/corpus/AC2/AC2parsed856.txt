Such and Amazing game, I mean AMAZINGGGGGG.First things first, it felt so good running around with the ambient music, it totally gave life to the diferrent cities. Everytime you came back to a city to do something you feel a strong noastalgic feeling, even if only 30 minutes passed. 9/10 Soundtrack.I dont usually complete the entire it of the game, sidequests I will most likely leave them undone but the main story, ohhhh ohhh that is such a golden point of the game. Just gold, its intense and combined with the beautiful scenery and music your gonna call sick to work the next day. Well I dont have that option but it was 3 days, sleeping,  working, playing, eating something in between to keep yourself alive and playing again.Ezio and desmond are such a good characters for you to follow along, that makes the game be worth it.That ending, that twist, that feeling it leaves you I need moreeeeeeeee. So good!!
