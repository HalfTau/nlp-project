This game is still my favorite Assassins Creed Game. It reminds of the days, when Ubisoft hadnt sold out the series yet and Uplay was not invented. Good old times.The Deluxe Edision has better grafics than on the console back in the day. So the game doesnt look as old as it is.9/11 would fly over Venice again in Leonardo da Vincis Flying Machine.
