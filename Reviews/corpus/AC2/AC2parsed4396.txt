Ubisoft, you ruined a perfectly good game.Firstly, AC II for on Steam is a direct port from the console version, meaning its full of bugs. Then, theres the UPlay launcher, which screws up all the controls for the game. Finally, i was about half way through the game, and my save disappeared.Ubisoft, this is possibly the biggest CashGrab Steam game ive ever seen. Youve really let me down.Anyway, the gameplay itself is pretty good. Lots of fun but the bugs make some bits unbearable.
