Derp, bought this game on sale. When buying an Assassins Creed game i looked up on internet about which one to buy and 2 and Brotherhood came out as the best. So i though 2 would be the best choice. I dont like free roam games with linear story and missions, like you have to do one thing to move into another one.This game is good, but its just not for me.
