A huge stepup from the first game and actually making the present day characters interesting was a bonus. Ezio Auditore has become one of the greatest protagonists in video games for his charm, wit and brute force. The masterful writing in this sequel solidified the AC series as a successful franchise that Ubisoft has clearly played with.The graphics? Stunning, even years later. The gameplay? Perfected swordfighting. Some might disagree, but it was so fluid and seemless in a number of the fights. The story? Remarkable. The writers have done their research and not only created characters, but also used historical characters in the correct context. This game is just fantastic.9.7/10
