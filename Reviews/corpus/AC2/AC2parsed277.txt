1st of all , I would like to mention that this game improves upon its predecessor in term of graphics , gameplay , open world exploration , loots , side quest , character customisation , upgrades , visual upgrades.The story is flawless , fun , brutal , saddening at times.Had a lot of fun while playing it.I guess , its best played with controller but then u need to customise the control as the defaults r bit wierd.Just match the color code with buttons on ur xbox360/one controller. Works fine with the bluetooth of XBOX One S controller.It would have been great if this game had Steam Achievements but it does not but then again the game itself compensates it.
