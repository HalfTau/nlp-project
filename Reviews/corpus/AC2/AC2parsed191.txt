What is there to say wrong with this game. All my hours came from purely grinding the main story alone. 33 hours. You dont have to feel youll finish the game too soon if doing side quests arent your thing. A continuation from Assassins Creed, the sequal puts you in the shoes of Ezio. An assassin in Europe seeking not only revenge for his family but also answers as to why. He finds so much more and its truly only comprehensible by playing or seeing for yourself. Ubisoft did it great and this game can easily last a hundred hours if you want to play casually. The story grows ever the more clearer, and your hatred from the modern day enemy only strengthens as you near conclusion. Buy it. Even if you do not intend on playing the first game, its hardly an excuse to not pick up the second.
