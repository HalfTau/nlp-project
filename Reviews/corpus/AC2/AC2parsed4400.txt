Do not buy this game if you intend to run it on OS X. The game runs smoothly on my Hackintosh but the complete absence of any sort of controller support is utterly contemptible. The buttons do not have any sort of proper labeling ingame, forcing you to constantly reference the control layout in the options menu to see which keys do what. However the worst part is you cannot use any sort of game controller with the game meaning its impossible to map the otherwise inscrutable controls to something more meaningful to you. I tried three USB controllers I have and none of them functioned with the game.Do yourself a favor BootCamp your Mac and install this on the Windows side instead. Its far more playable that way.Otherwise it seemed to run smoothly on my rig which is from 2012 but due to the terrible controls I wont be having any of this on OS X, much to my chagrin. I suggest you do the same.
