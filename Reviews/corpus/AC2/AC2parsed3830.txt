Woo Hoo! The 2nd series of Assassins Creed Game.In one sentence  Its better than the 1st series.The story continues from the journey of Desmond. He keeps getting back to the animus to be the assassin.The game itself is about youre being an assassin that have to kill the target. The gameplay lets you which way do you want to go or in what way you want to kill the target.The nice thing here is the parkour. Assassins Creed series is one of the game that give you the amazing experience of parkouring in game.I really recommended this game, because its better from the 1st in the aspect of the engage fighting, the smoothness parkouring, subtitle, weapons, upgrading, and many else.I recommend you to play the 1st series first, because the story continues and you could get confused in the story of the 2nd.
