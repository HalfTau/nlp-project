Originally, I was a very large fan of Assassins Creed 2 when I first played it on my PS3. Recently however I purchased the game on steam in its deluxe edition and cant even get the game to load due to a problem with Unity no longer having an updated system for the game. Thanks to this, Im not able to play the game and have yet to find a fix to the system that will allow me to play. Thanks to this reason, I wouldnt recommend spending money on it unless you yourself know how to take care of the unity launch issue.
