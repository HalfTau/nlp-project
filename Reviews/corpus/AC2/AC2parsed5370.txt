Where the first Assassins Creed succeeds this one this one excels all the more, and then proceeds to add a suite of new features and mechanics that highly impress. The locations are beautiful, and a heck of a lot of fun to run around in. The towns are alive and it is great to just freerun around and be imersed in the hustle and bustle of the cities. Free run is even better this time, with new skills to learn that will make it seem even faster and fluid than in the first game. As for the combat, where to start? The same beautiful animations and fluidity are present here, but in even greater number. Now you can not only wield swords, but also a collection of different maces, daggers, a double dualblade, as well as smoke bombs and other nifty gadgets. There is also a whole new level of customization including a home town you can build up, different armor, and dyes. You cant lose with this awesome game, and I highly recommend it. 9.4/10.
