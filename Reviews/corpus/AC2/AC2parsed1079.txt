Great openworld RPG with a historical twist.The assassins creed series is a firm favourite with the community and I am not going to be able to add anything here.  However for me it is another example of a user interface done right.  If you compare it with, for instance,  Mad Max its chalk and cheese.  Max has 2 keys for jump  one for sillly little jumps over small obstacles and another for big jumps which have to be designated with yellow paint so you know which key to press.  On assassins creed you just jump and the game knows how high. You can just concentrate on being awesome.Fantastically enjoable game.  Please make more!
