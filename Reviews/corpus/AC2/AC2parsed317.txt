Assassins Creed 2 is very nice game.Can easily get lost in it with its open world and freedom to do things. There are many places to explore and story is super long. World is quite huge. Has many varieties in assassinating and in compat ways. There is upgradeable gear system which I really enjoyed. Specially the dye changes in different cities  customization plays always big roll for me.Assassins Creed 2 was many times better than first game. Eventho it was better you still should play AC I first due to story connection.I recommend the game but only if have played AC I first  story will make much more sense.xTzharkz Eric.
