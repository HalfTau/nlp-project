A beautiful, immersive, and spectacular game that follows the adventures of a young but brave assassin named Ezio Auditore de Firenze.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!Plot The plot is pretty complicated, but Ill give you the short versionEzio becomes an assassin and tries to hunt down the people who ended his fathers and brothers lives.GameplayGameplay is smooth and fluid.GraphicsAssassins Creed 2 is almost 6 years old. However, the graphics still shine and look great!ControlsControls are very annoying at first, but comfortable once you get used to them.Optimization The game is capped at 59 fps. Well, at least for me it is. Its pretty well optimized and Ive yet to see any frame rate dips.However, the terrible DRM known as Uplay makes a return, and it is pretty damn bad.SCORINGPositives Great plot, gameplay, story, and easy controlsNegetives Typical DRM that you would expect from Ubisoft.Overall I would give this game a 8 out of 10, and I would recommend this to a friend.
