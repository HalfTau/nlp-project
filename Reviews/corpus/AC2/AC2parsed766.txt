Seeing a lot improvements and new elements in this game comparing to AC1, the life of the new assassin Ezio is scrumptious, the storytelling is in great pace, the side missions now have many nuances and backstory, you can upgrade a villa and display stuff you bought, still this game is filled with boring collectibles. What really make this game stand out are the thick realistic ambiance of Italy in the renaissance, furthermore at the end of this game the story unveiled an epic event, while before that the game was already sending out mysterious vibes.
