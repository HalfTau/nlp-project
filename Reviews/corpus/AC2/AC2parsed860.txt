I recommend the game, just not on PC.The game itself is fun, but is barely able to run on a rig thats more than capable of running modern games on high settings. No option of tweaking graphics options other than whats in the game. Some people are able to get 60fps consistently whereas Im having trouble getting 20 at any point in the game.Im hearing horror stories about the next few AC titles, so Ill probably not buy them and waste my money on a 20fps experience. Its a sad day for the PC MasterRace.
