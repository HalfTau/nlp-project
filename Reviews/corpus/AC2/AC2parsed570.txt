ACII is way better than the first game, but its still just not very fun to me.  The story is good and all, but the game just lacks something to keep me playing.  I made it almost to sequence 6 so I did give the game a good chance.  Im playing with a keyboard and mouse which I dont recommend.  A controller would be way better.
