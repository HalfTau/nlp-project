GREAT game. much better than the first game and has a great story line. I found the controls to better than the AC3 controls and has great missions that include sneaking into restricted areas WITHOUT being detected and most of them were really challenging. I think this is the best AC game ive played so far and i hope the developers dont ruin the future AC games as i would love to enjoy them as much as this one.
