seeing so much talking about assassin creed throughout the internet, I decided to buy it, this is the first assassin creed game I played, cant believe this game came out 6 years ago.not only its graphic is fine, I do enjoyed the gameplay too, but still cant figure out why does assassinate from the edge raise your notorious level eventhough nobody has seen it. anyway the storyline is very long, took me days to beat the story, I enjoy how Ezio took 20 years to seek out the truth and avenge his familys death by taking the Templars out one by one, this game definitely worth buying.
