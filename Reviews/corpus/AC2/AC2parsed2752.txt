The story and gameplay is awesome but unfortunately it is lagging although it is over 5 years old and I have a PC which should be capable of games like this.In addition you have to install uplay which takes a lot of ressources from your system. Why do I need another social sht program when I already have steam? Do those companies really think that I will use their fcking software for any social activity when they force me to install it? Wont happen!Steam Sale or not I wont buy any more Ubisoft games and I cannot recommend them.
