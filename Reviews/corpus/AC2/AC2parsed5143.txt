Alongside brotherhood, this game is the best in the series. Like Mass Effect 2, taking the greatness of the original game and matching it up with new and great content has proven amazing. The conclusions of each game can be a little wacky but Ive never accused the series of being realistic, to say nothing about video games in general. Another must have.
