This games aged a bit, but its still a stellar title.In ACII, everything from the first game is improved upon. I mean everything. The climbing, combat, music, etc ends up being miles beyond what ACI offered.Playing as Ezio Auditore, youll explore Renaissance Italy on your personal quest to avenge your family, but theres much more to Ezios character arc than just REVENGEANCE.ACII is quite long, itll take you more than a few hours to complete, and thats if you dont bother with any of the side stuff. Of which there is a fair amount of.Combat is rather simple, but its satisfying and visually entertaining. No real difficulty to it though. Brutes are a needed addition to the enemy combatants, but they really arent very intimidating in comparison to how they need to be.The PC port works fine in my experience, though the Uplay client can be a bit frustrating.
