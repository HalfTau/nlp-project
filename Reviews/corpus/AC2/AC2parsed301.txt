This game is still compatible with Mac devices, from snow leopard and above. Startup varies for different Mac devices. Most of the time, you wont be able to see the setup and launcher window as it will be either invisible, black or white. When the startup and setup screen appears, the buttons wont be visible but still work, similar to having your brightness on the lowest setting, you wont be able to see anything but will still be able to click and do normal functions. Setting up Assasins Creed 2 will be very annoying and will take a lot of time, random clicking and raging.You will need a Ubiplay account to log into Assasins Creed 2, Ubiplay accounts are only creatable on windows devices so you will need a windows devive to create a Ubiplay account which you use to log in on the invisible log in page.The Start button is on the bottom right of the screen after you have logged in.Hope this is helpful, gl  hf
