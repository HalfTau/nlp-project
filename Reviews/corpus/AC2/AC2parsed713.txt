Assassins Creed II is vastly superior to the original game and has a lot more depth to the story. Honestly, I could care less about Desmonds storyline. But the story of Ezio and all the historical references in the AC II trilogy make it extremely interesting as well as fun. There are way more things to do in this game than the first Assassins Creed.
