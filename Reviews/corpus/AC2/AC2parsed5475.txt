Ezio... Italy, new game, new setting and a brand new game to explore the story that was developed in the first game. I believed it to be revolutionary, adding jump n run into an immersive, mostly open world, experience.You are an elite Assasin, well thats nothing new I suppose, hunting down the traitors that have something to do with your personal life. Interested yet? You should be. Ive could have not asked for a better world to statisfy my lust for silent but deadly stealth kills. Or just run in, jump up and stab them to hell in full view, so it caters for all kinds of killing lusts. Just dont expect a first person experience.Graphics have improved, controls are the same and you get the same package but a new story as the first one. Just right. Immersive story and interesting ending. You should give it a try, especially if you loved the first game.4.5 / 5
