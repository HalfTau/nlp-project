Assassins Creed is very intriguing. The first few games of the franchise are the best in my own opinion, as they introduce a very interesting and different approach to the everyday game. The second installment is one of the best in the series, as it perfectly blends in unique features allowing you for several ways of approaching missions and quests.Interesting storyline with real lifeinspired factsParkour and freerunning over the roofs or RomeGreat progression of protagonist he ages as you playStill has the Assassins Creed vibe to itThe Uplay business is bearable but quite annoyingNo Steam AchievementsTrading Cards Emotes/BackgroundsSome missions can be really frustrating
