Good Great graphics  attention to detail. They did a good job integrating history into the game. Easy to get all the weapons  armor.Bad  Had to reinstall Uplay manually to get the game to start. Camera is frustrating in enclosed environments. Controls were very difficult to learn. The game presents you with notes like press hand to tackle, without telling you what button hand is. Very frustrating when the character doesnt move the way you want especially when fleeing or fighting. The character has tendency to grab on to the environment. Eg. running close to a wall, and hell stop and try to climb it The Truth puzzles were too difficult.
