To begin with this game is one of my all time favorites. The grafics and gameplay lack a little in comparison to newer games. The story on the other hand is one of the most intense and is beautifully supported by the amazing soundtrack. Ezios transition from a spoiled knowitall to a stone cold killer is brutal and fascinating at the same time. To anyone who for some reason has not played it yet and likes the renaissance italian setting, marvelous OST and intense fights, should definitely check this one out.
