Its on steam sale, so I buy it and it just doesnt start. Uplay works fine, and when I press play I get a window for 0.1s with a sound and then nothing. Its not even in my processes. Tried many fixes that are on the internet but NONE WORKS. So I just got robbed for 2.50 by Steam/Ubisoft. Also brotherhood is not working either, AC4 Black flag does. Did not try Revelations /AC3 yet but I already got a bad feeling...So what now? Do I get my money back? Is this fixable somehow? They just selling these games with discount while not working, but with like half the people writing reviews got this problem, not Steam nor Ubisoft seem to care.If I cant get this working in a week I demand my money back!
