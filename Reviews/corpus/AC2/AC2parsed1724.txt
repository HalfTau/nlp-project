There are a few problems i have with the game1 The t i had to go through to get the damn thing to start I ended up refunding and rebuying it to get a different code which fixed the startup problem2 The camrea angles, i know that third person games tend to have camera angles that are rather inconvienient but wat im talking about are the fixed camera angles such as in the Assassins tombs or the Templars hideouts. I find them very annoying and they will chang how the controls work depending on the angleaside from those two things i found the game really enjoyable and would reccomend playing it and if youd like a little challenge going through out the game only get supplies like smoke bombs, medicine, throwing knives, Etc. from looting dead enemies.all in all, Id rate the game 7.5/10
