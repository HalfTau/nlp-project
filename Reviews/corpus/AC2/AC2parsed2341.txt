Ok this review is poisonous and yes i am butthurt but this is steam. we do not require multiple game launching applications. and certainly not one that pops up with the ubishaft has stopped working error message every time you alt tab to the other ubishaft website to reset your password. ive played assasin creed games before and it was hardly worth the price when i bought this thing on sale for half off. but to make the user jump through hoops like this just encourages piracy. enjoy playing this game illegally but to do it through their pathetic UI you would have to be just an uneducated consumer.
