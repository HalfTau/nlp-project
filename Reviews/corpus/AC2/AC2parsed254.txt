Yes, hours are low but I have played way more of this game on the PS3 soooo...yeah.This game is a master piece in the fact that it started The Ezio Trilogy if you will who quickly became the most memorable assassin and I personally havent felt the same way about any of the protagonist of AC since Ezio. All assassins have been incredibly dull since Connor in AC3.The character of Ezio alone makes this game enjoyable. The story, setting and theme, weapons and combat make the game too but cmon how many of you found yourself with a dropped jaw the first time you saw EzioBe honest now.The game also does something else that I like. The game gives the player motivation to kill off The Templars by making them generally unlikeable. Characters that are introduced at the start of the game and annoy you dont stick around long if you know what I mean.Really good game.
