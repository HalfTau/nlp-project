Beautiful visuals. Very authentic and various locations Florence, Forly, Venice. Easy and somehow fun acrobatic. Godlike music from Jesper Kyd. Too easy fights which is a bit of bad. As silver lining  animations are good. And setting and plot looks like it was taken from Dan Browns books. Guess, it is must have. Want to take a look on Brotherhood.
