I cannot belive this game.... I actually liked it... BEFORE it crashed... I went to my friends house downloaded it then when I came to my house, 2 things happened. 1 It would not let me play in offline mode then, 2 It temporarily banned me for account sharing... I AM USING THE SAME MAC I want either a refund OR a solution to these problems because I paid 19.99 for this game and I dont want to have wasted 19.99 on a game that refuses to work...
