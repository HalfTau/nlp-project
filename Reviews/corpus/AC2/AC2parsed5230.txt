TLDR BUY THIS. NOW. DO IT, ASSHAT.Longer reviewWide open world? Check, with three main cities Florence, Venice, Forli and a lot of open space Apenine Mountains, the Tuscany and little towns of San Gimignano and YOURE OWN FREAKIN VILLAGE Monteriggioni.Sidequests Check, most of them are really fun to complete and give you insigths on life in the Renaissance. You dont have to complete them though, but many are rewarding. Restoring your town to its former glory for example, and seeing it slowly grow more prosperous with people visiting and the run down walls and buildings repaired.Characters OH GOD YES. No offense to Altar but he is as charismatic as a block of wood. Ezio feels like a real person, whom we see grow over the years from a brash punk into a wise man. And the enemies are great! Which brings us to...Story The story of the first Assassins Creed was a little rushed and offered no explanations to what the  was happening. They fixed that here. First, you have a codex that you can read for reference on the time period, people and buildings you visit giving much needed context.Second, the grand scheme of things is set, the events that happen in the past and present make sense and leave room for interesting mysteries and developments and COMPLETE THE SUBJECT 16 QUEST FOR EXTRA MIND.Overall Very few flaws, my second favorite game of the series!
