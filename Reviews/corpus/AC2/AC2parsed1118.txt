Ive played through most of the Assassins Creed games, and this is definitely my favorite. They improved upon the first game in almost every way. Ezio is a likeable character, and I loved how they wove the Renaissance history into the game. Its incredible to climb up iconic Renaissance buildings like the Florence Cathedral.
