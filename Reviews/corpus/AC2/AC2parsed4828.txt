The war rages on between the Assassins and the Templars, this time the two groups have officially disbanded, while their fight still continues in the shadows. Sadly this game marks a fall from the grey morality featured in the first game, with rather simplistic villains and side characters, with Ezio being the only character that truly stand out in the game, reverable in the same lines of Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr.The gameplay and mission design has been signifigantly imrpoved in this iteration, including side missions. Although some of the side missions are rather mundane and dont make sense overall with the story, they are nice deviations and most of the side missions are rather enjoyable.Desmonds story falls short in this one, barring the introduction of side characters such as Rebecca and Shaun, because you are restricted to the Animus for most of the game and you arent free to get out and walk around whenever you wish.91/100
