Improves upon the classic Assassins Creed gameplay. Good story, large map with different locations and lots of sidemissions. I also like the RPG elements like buying weapons or armor.It is not as repetetive as the first game, but it has some flaws. For example the fight system is fun, but its still too easy. I should also mention, that this game uses Uplay. It can be annoying if uplay updates otherwise you hardly notice it.All in all you can have a lot of fun in this game, but if you look for a challenge youll be disappointed.
