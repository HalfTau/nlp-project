Do not buy the game if youre planning to run in on OS X. Does not matter what version of OS X you are running, the game port is UGLY. It wouldve been great if uPlay just worked for me after I installed it but NO, why should it?If youre forcing me to have uPlay and have my device connected to the internet all the time, make sure if friggin works before you enforce it on every platform.
