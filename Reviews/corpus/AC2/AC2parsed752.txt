AC2 is absolutley amazing. The story and characters really drive this title forward. I basiclly bombed my way through. However, while the missions and story are appealing, the open world ability to explore and collect items within the game are fantastic. Beautifully crafted and orchestrated, AC2 is the cornerstone of the entire franchise.
