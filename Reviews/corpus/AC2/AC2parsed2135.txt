Assassins Creed II continues where AC1 stopped, Templars are still trying to locate Pieces of Eden using the genetic memories from the Assassin descedant Desmond using the Animus.In ACII youll play as Ezio Auditore, son of an Assassin from Italy, during the Renaissance and easily the favourite character of most AC fans.Assassins Creed II is by far the very best of the franchise and it was the game that boosted the popularity of AC series.Pros and consPros Ezio Auditore Amazing story Amazing characters Amazing scenarios Gorgeous robes and armors seriously, Assassin Robes are wonderful, I wish wed dress like that today Lots of replay value.Cons Repetitive gameplay its not as bad as AC1 though Repetitive combat mechanicsThis game did try to make right what AC1 did wrong, and it did in parts.While the game is still a bit repetitive, its a lot better than AC1 was, you have a little more freedom, you have subtitles, the story is better explained, the characters are better.Overall this game was a huge improvement over AC1.As I said above, this game is easily the best in the franchise and its the game that made me LOVE Assassins Creed.
