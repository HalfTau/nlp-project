As far as the plot and customization go its probably one of the best entries in the Assassins Creed series and it may have been phenomenal on consoles. Unfortunately the PC port is an absolute mess. The control layout is THE WORST I have ever encountered in my 20 years of gaming. No exaggeration. The freerunning system that made Assassins Creed popular is a st show in this game with your character frequently leaping in a random direction off ledges to his death even though you are aimed at a platform that you can climb. Ive tried getting through the game twice and almost finished it a few years ago but after playing it again it simply isnt worth it. I got to a point where you have to unlock code sequences to reveal The Truth mini game and even though Ive completed the same puzzle 5 times Im still stuck with the prompt to complete the puzzle taking up the upper right corner of my screen. Ive walked around for 20 minutes trying to get it to go away with no luck.Im going to play Black Flag again and pretend every AC prior to it doesnt exist.
