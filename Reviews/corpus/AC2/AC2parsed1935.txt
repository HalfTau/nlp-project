After tedious first installment in the series Ubisoft seems to have found its way of progression. So well that they even continued the history of Ezio Auditore in the rennaissance Italy for two more games, not worse than this one. And this one is really good! I love the story, I love the music, the setting and the gameplay, which is much more differentiated than the same 4 sidequests over and over in Screed 1.
