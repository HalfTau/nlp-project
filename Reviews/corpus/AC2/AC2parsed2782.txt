Before I thought that people saying AC 2 was good, was having nostalga. As I bought and tried the game I learnt that I was wrong. This game is absolutely a masterpiece, and I would recomend it to anyone who have found interest in later or earlier Assassins Creed games.If you have a problem with Uplay, try to run it as administrator. I steppet on a problem where it always would crash, but if I ran it as administrator, it worked.
