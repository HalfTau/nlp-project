A huge step up from the first game. AC2 is a good game with absolutely loads of content. Really, theres a lot. Too much content one could argue. The best comparison I can think of is GTA meets 15th century. This is what the first game should have been. My only major complaint Ubisoft please fix the screen tearing, its ridiculous in this game no matter what the settings are. Kind of brought me out of my immersion. Definitely worth a play.
