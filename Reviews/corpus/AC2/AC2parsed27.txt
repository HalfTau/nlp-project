After a rather dull first game, this series comes back to life with the introduction of Ezio to the player which they will continue to play as for the next three games. The fact that Ezio is introduced to the Creed rather than being part of it when the game starts creates an ability for the player to also be introduced to the Creed. In my honest opinion would Assassins Creed II be a better introduction to the IP than Assassins Creed I was, even though it was revolutionizing.Assassins Creed II brings a lot more to the table than Assassins Creed I did. We have left the dull setting of the Third Crusade and there is now room for love, jokes and actual entertainment. Since the setting and the lore is more entertaining, I myself percieved it as more entertaining. Long gone is the repetitivement of the first game.Even though the first installment of the so to say Ezio Collection is the weaker part of the three games, I can still recommend it fully to anyone interested in the series.
