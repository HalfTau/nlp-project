Yet another lazy port Why do we have to use UPlay? It crashed 3 times and I had to close Steam to get me logged in. And whats the ing point in putting mouse acceleration into your game and not including the option to turn it off? Well Ubisoft is now on my blacklist.PS. Gues what? They probably let their interns code this I lost several hours of gameplay because saving online has a random chance to fail and thats the default setting.
