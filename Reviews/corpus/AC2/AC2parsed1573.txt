First of all, I must say Ive got about 50hrs of gameplay of AC2 on PS3. I have finished the game twice and it is still one of my favorite game ever. The graphics are still good in 2016 and the story is amazing ! you should very get this game  ACBrotherhood. In a negative way, you need Uplay to run the game wich I dosent like very well...TLDR Buy the fcking game right now.
