Assassins creed 2. What a work of art. A true masterpiece. Argubly the best Assassins Creed II, the story consumes you. The art style and direction devours you. You truely feel like youre in old Italy. Being an Italian myself, I can confirm this is very well built. I love Italy. I was born in Italy and Ive never there, but if I have, it would be just like this game.
