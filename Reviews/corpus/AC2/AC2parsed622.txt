A big step up from the first game, Assassins Creed II succeeds in improving many aspects of the franchise.Pros Many side quests and puzzles were added and helped a lot in making the game less repetitive and boring in its missions, as it happened with its predecessor. Namely, this time you get your own house villa and have various accessories to collect in order to improve it, as well as your character Very interesting conspiracy story, with many real facts mixed with fictional ones, which made for a good history lesson in Renaissance Italy as well Many interesting characters, both allies and enemies, based on real historical persons, with the best one being the main character, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Getting to interact with Leonardo Da Vinci was also great and the way he was portrayed was very good too Many weapons and ways of assassination were added, giving the game a bigger variety in gameplay Huge and detailed map, which included Florence, Venice and a small part of Rome, as well as some smaller cities, each containing a big variety of secret places too Hearing the characters speak in English, but with an Italian accent was funny Mindblowing ending, this was probably my favorite part, since I didnt expect it to include a twist of these proportions and I found took the game to a whole different levelCons Despite the many added side quests to keep you busy and the improved weapon and assassination system, the main gameplays structure remained the same as the first title. You follow someone until a certain point or you fight or you run, that pretty much summarizes what you do for the whole game, failing to avoid repetitiveness to a certain point, although not as much as the first game an aspect that the Arkham games managed to handle better, in my opinion The fights and assassinations, though stylish and cool to watch, felt a bit too easy and not much challenging with some exceptions The soundtrack was just OK, in fact it might be the only field that I found weaker than its predecessor, since the first game had a very good theme when you were being chased, absent here. The tracks were good generally, but mostly forgettableThese minor flaws aside, Assassins Creed II is a great game and I definitely recommend it, be it for the various added improvements or to get a detailed taste of Renaissance Italy, mixed with conspiracy schemes.That said, I still consider the franchises ancestors, the Prince of Persia games, to be overall better in structure and more fun, so its a pity Ubisoft discontinued them to make way for this series, but since things turned out this way, be sure to step into Ezios footsteps and learn the ways of the assassin!
