After playing the masterpiece that was the first game I never imagined how could a game improve so much in the sequel. I was wrong, and this is the game that AC wanted to be. Taking the main story to the Renascence introduced Ezio, who might be less interesting as a character, but the future story arc more than makes up for it, not to mention the improved gameplay that resolved most of old issues. Dropping the DX10 engine cant really hurt the brilliance of this game.
