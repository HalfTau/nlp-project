Ignore all of the reviews for this game that say that this was the best Assasssins Creed and that the new ones are terrible. Its true the new ones are unfinished pieces of crap but this is... double crap. The new games at least have the fun climbing and freerunning going for them, while this game has horrible clunky controls yes I use a plug in Xbox controller and the story is If you want a good game with the Assasssins Creed controls then get Shadow of Mordor. Just go get Far Cry 4, thats a good game. Or The Last of Us. Check out my library, theres some good stuff in there.
