Beautiful and fastpaced game where you feel the pulse, while you jump head loose from building to building, in constant fygt of falling down. The game is incredibly beautiful and the player is rewarded for his exploration of the many achivements and collections that can be done. The game is delicately balanced sword in the degree, as that you get better weapons and equipment, the enemies also more challenging. A small minus is that when you are about halfway through the game, money is no longer a problem and that removes a bit of the joy of buying more and better equipment. In all I enjoyed the game and am looking forward to going to roll with Assassins Creed III.
