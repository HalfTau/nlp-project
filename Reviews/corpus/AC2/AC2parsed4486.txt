Assassins Creed II is great. Its so much better than AC1 the missions are more interesting, you dont climb as ing slowly as Altair does, the storyline is more interesting, Ezio is a more interesting character, Renaissance Italy just seems so much more interesting than Third Crusade Middle East... a lot of things have improved between AC1 and AC2.I do admittedly have a quibble with the replayability you dont really have the option to replay missions, which kinda sucks.
