The continuation Desmond Miless story, where through the Animus, he becomes Ezio Auditore da Firenze during the height of the Renaissance in Italy. The gameplay is quite similar to the first Assassins Creed with quite a lot of upgrades including a Villa where you may generate money to purchase items for the missions. The optional missions also includes collecting tons of stuff throughout the maps and solving puzzles which is quite fun for those who are interested in a challenge.The freerun controls however, are still the same to the original Assassins Creed which is quite frustrating at times, but youll get used to it eventually. The story at times do not make sense and have plot holes due to the fact the time span is throughout several years. Overall, Assassins Creed 2 is a good game to play.
