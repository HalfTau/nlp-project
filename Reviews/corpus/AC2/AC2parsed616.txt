It has been 7 years since I have played this game originally on the XBOX 360. I decided to pick up all of the AC games to play through them all on PC before Origins came out.All I can say is I cant believe I forgot how great this game is. Seriously. This is a game that, if came out today, would still easily be a best seller. The story is well done, the game world is just incredible and vast, and it feels so alive!If you are looking to get lost in a game over the summer then I highly advise this game, especially if you havent played it! It is a must for every game collection! I would also say that the price it is during the Summer Sale is pretty much a steal as well!
