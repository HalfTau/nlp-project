Great game. Compelling story. Very immersive. Step into the well equipped role of Ezio Auditore. Stalk the streets of Italy and end yoru prey. This game is a must play.That said, keep in mind that no game is Portal read damn near perfect. There are a few caveats that make this game annoying. First and foremost UPlay. Even the retail version of this game is wrapped in Steam, then has a second layer of UPlay. Youre efectively running two game platform clients that effectively do the same thing in order to play this game. The only difference is UPlay doesnt have a store. Second is the controls. Its clear that the games primary SKU was a console system and the PC controls suffer for it as they did in the original. After a while, they become easier to use, however the occasional jumping off a building unintentionally, grabbing the wrong ledge, or jumping the wrong direction will happen all the way to the last level.I encountered a single progression break where one target kept standing back up after killing him and the other that was supposed to be there did not spawn. It was a simple matter of restarting the memory, so it wasnt a big deal. I also encountered a UI bug where the Windows working cursor was visible. This happened often when I accessed UPlay while in game. Its not a deal breaker, but it IS distracting.Even with these faults, the game is spectacular. It gradually introduces you to the tools used by Ezio while keeping you enthralled by the story.
