Many people consider this the height of the series, as did I for a very long time. I think Black Flag really encapsulates the best AC has to offer but that doesnt mean I dont respect the hell out of AC2. I never really did quite love Ezio the same way other people did but hes an alright character and I appreciate that they take the time to develop him throughout his apperances in the franchise.But, definitely play this game. Theres a wonkyness in the controls which can be kind of rough sometimes but its a huge game, thats for sure, with a long story and lots to explore and get stuck in.
