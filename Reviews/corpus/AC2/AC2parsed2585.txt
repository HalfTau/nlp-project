A very enjoyable game with lots of interesting historically inspired content.Cities to explore, secrets to discover and a captivating story.Id definitely recommend it to anyone.Also I would really recommend using a game pad to play this game.Played the first few missions with mouse and keyboard and it was quite a pain.Using a game pad is way more intuitive and makes the game much easier to play.
