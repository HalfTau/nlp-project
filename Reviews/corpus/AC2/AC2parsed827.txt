An awesome game. Everything about it is an improvement on the first installment. ACII is up alongside Arkham City, Tomb Raider, Gears of War, GTAV and God of War when it comes to great 3rd person games. It takes everything that was good about the first Assassins Creed and improves on it. Then it gets rid of everthing rubbish about its predecessor and replaces it with fun side quests and varying gamepaly.If you like 3rd person games, you need to buy ACII. Dont wait for it to be on sale.9/10
