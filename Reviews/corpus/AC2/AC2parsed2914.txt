Its almost the best game in the series, if not for the slightly poor performance compared to AC Revelations thats even newer than this.Other than that I have nothing to complain about, I like almost all the characters from Ezio, Leonardo, Claudia to, well, just about everybody... aside from Lucy, but I guess that means Lucys story is well thought out that I already started to feel uneasy about her even before I played Brotherhood.
