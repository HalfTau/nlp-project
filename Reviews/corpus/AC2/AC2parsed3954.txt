It requires you to install UPlay which is an application that has to be online to let you play. By installing this product you are obliged to terms of service concerning players privacy which I do not found to be acceptable for me.I will buy no more games from Ubisoft unless they drop their stupid DRM policy, which affects only legitimate users. I will save my money for other developers, who respect their customers, and I suggest you to do the same.
