Mostly teh same as AC 1 except maybe some less exhausting travel.  A great game with great albeit very simple and easy combat, Excellent platforming scaling detailed walls where teh main character grabs onto handholds realistically for a super assassin and where intricate leaps can be made onto small skinny poles and lamps and what not.  Overall the platforming is very well done.  Unfortunately, this very promising and potentially great game is plagued bydialogue and downright monotonous cutscenes that caused me to quit about a quarter through, if that.Nothing remarkable, but definitely passable.  Overall good.All good, nice horse sounds, city sounds, crowd gossip and what not.An extremely promising game, ruined by certain sequences.Atrocious, unless you enjoy boring, lengthy dialogue/cutscenes/sequences.Out of 60 USD,Coulda been excellent, spoiled by poor game design.  Still, worth checking out if
