This is by far one of my favorite Assassins Creed games. Ive followed the series from the beginning... playing as Altair was fun, but Ezio just has so much more depth to his charecter, not to mention style. That moment you get the second hidden blade is just satisfying. Then ezio gains a hidden pistol, which was also fun. Ive played through this game several times... IDK, maybe I am partial due to my nostalgia and overall love for the Ezio games.The game is not perfect though. As with most AC games, thee main charecter, Ezio in this case, does not always do what you want him to. Trying to climb boxes in front of you sometimes leads to running up the adjacent wall, or just jumping over boxes atogether. Most of the time this problem is negligable, except during the most frustrating aspect of this game timed puzzles. Specifically, a good number of Assassins Tombs. Many of the tombs have timed areas and if Ezio jumps in the water or at the wall instead of jumping to that beam... welll, you have to start over. If you dont care about getting 100 or getting Altairs armor, then skip these puzzles. Honestly, you can beat the game easily without upgrading your health much. The only reason I fully upgrade Ezios heath is so that if Ezio decides to jump off a tall building without my permission, he will live.Wow, that was a ramble. You have earned yourself a cookie for reading this far.
