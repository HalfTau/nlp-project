Alright, let me tell you my expierence. This game looks great but for some reason just cant launch, I think it has to do with Uplay but I dont know. I tried to launch it just updated and then almost never tried to run. Then I tried reinstalling which did absolutely nothing. I really would love to play this game but sadly it just doesnt work, and after looking at other people having similar problems they say the solutuion is to allow access with any antivirus which yet again did nothing. Also I thought I should say I use PC. I would love some help or advice if anyone could provide some.
