This game is great. Great story, gameplay and music. Graphics are decent.Story is quite long in this game and you dont have the feeling it was too short like many games these days.I only had some issues with controls. Keyboard controls in this game are little weird and takes some time to get familiar with. Game prompting you to press head symbol button or empty hand button etc. I had to check keyboard configuration several times to see which symbol is which button, but dont let that stop you from byuing/playing this game. Its realy good game overall.I enjoyed playing this game alot and recommend it to everyone.
