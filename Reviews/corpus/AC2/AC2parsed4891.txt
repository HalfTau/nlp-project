One wouldve thought itd be hard to top the predecessor in the Assassins Creed series, but I cant help but say that AC 2 is the best of the 3 games thatve been released so far. Set in renaissance Italy, the game puts you in the boots of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young assassin who is out for answers, and revenge. If you are anything like me, youll soon find yourself caught up in the story and sometimes, the sheer beauty of the game.The gameplay is smooth but if you play on a PC, you can definitely notice that the game was originally designed for consoles. The hotkeys and mechanics can take some time to get used to but youll soon find yourself running along the rooftops or the streets of Firenze with a lot of angry guards trying to catch up with you.  Not that youll ever let them, right? I do absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend Assassins Creed 2 to anyone who is either, a fan of the genre or the series, or one who is simply looking for a game with depth, momentary brilliance, gorgeous scenery and backgrounds and an amazing story. Deep story. Good looking. Smooth gameplay. The adaption for PC couldve been better. A few minor, but annoying bugs and glitches.
