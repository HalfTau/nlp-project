Assassins creed 2 is a great game and I can recommand this game if you like stealth/action game. The story begins with a noble man named Ezio Auditore where his assassins days begins. You will also meet a test person named Dismond Milles. He seems to be connected to Ezio Auditore. I wont say so much more since I wont spoil anything. But I can tell you this you wont get disappointed with this story. Well there is one thing you need to this game and that is patience. Why patience you think, I will tell you why. Some of the mission can be hard so you need to take your time before you strike if you dont do that you have to start over again. You can be frustrated in this game so dont buy or play it if you are a person who gets easy frustrated.
