Where do I start with AC2... well first of it has a huge world consisting of 3 major cities the Tuscan countryside and Villa Auditore. The gameplay itself is far superior to that of AC1 although if you are new to the series I would recomend starting on AC1 just to appreciate how much better AC2 is. Combat is great, Ubi added a system of buying weapons, short weapons, and armor, where as in AC1 the player was spoonfed a certain set of items as they leveled up. Counter attacks are great, combat sounds are much better than in AC1, Ubi also added much better ways to assassinate people such as fixing air assassinations, adding assassinations from haystacks, adding assassinations from benches. Graphically AC2 is far superior to AC1 considering that this game is from 2009. The story is much better and much longer than AC1, whereas AC1 had 9 assassinations where you do the same thing over and over, AC2 has i think 14 or 15 assassinations, and NO SITTING ON A BENCH REQUIRED! A GUI was added to the game aswell as the ability to upgrade Villa Auditore the more you upgrade the more money you get. Cosmetic details were added such as the ability to dye clothes each region Florence, Venice, and Tuscany have their own colors. Ezio wields dual hidden blades, hence the ability to kill 2 targets at one time, as opposed to Altar with his single hidden blade. AC2 includes people that accually lived such as Lorenzo de Medici, Leonardo da Vinci, Katerina Sforza, and Girolamo Savonarola in the DLC Burning of The Vanities. The parkour/freeruning system is greatly improved, the wall climbing is faster, and more fluid, and the character no longer hits invisible wals.Overall Ubi took everything good about AC1, gave the game a better main character, a better setting, and a better story, and made AC29.5/10 9.5 cuz of minor glitches and such.
