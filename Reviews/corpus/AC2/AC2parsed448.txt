I am confused on keyboard commands. Often sybols come up for actions on the game controller. But in PC gaming we dont have this device so why isnt it fixed so we know how to move about the game without having to go google figure out the keys. Thats just lazy, With the billions ubisoft is raking in you can afford some intern to fix the pc version, instead of saying  Who cares they can figuere it out on their own.  Edit also I run 4k desktop and game would not load until I brought the resolution down to 1080p. How is it even a possibility the game cant change the resolution to 1080p.
