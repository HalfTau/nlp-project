Ill start with my bad experiences and go for the good later. Like having puding after a meal.The BadI still think that the game shouldve had an official steam release so we can get rewards and so forth but its not the worst thing about the game. My worst experience about this game is the fact that in some cases the screen is forced at a certain angle I suppose to better view where to go and what to do. What I dont like about that is my keys change. Left isnt left anymore and back isnt back anymore. So if your after the fast paced parkour, this game on PC will frustrate you lets say a 5 of the time. Another thing that annoyed me about the game is the rooftops running, Again with the fast paced parkour. Its as if Ezio is a fearless idiot, by the time I can see he wont make it and leave the keys it tends to be too late. So he bravely flies off of the edge of a building hoping for the best results and usually dont get the best part of it. So again, if your after the fast paced stuff, not a good idea.Now for the good review part.Again, like Assasins Creed 1, I think the game has a good basis. The finishing and graphics of the game is well done. I like the fact that the collectables in the game has meaning and rewards. I think the story is well thaught of and if you take your time and plan ahead you will have Many, MANY hours of fun. All in all I think its brilliant.
