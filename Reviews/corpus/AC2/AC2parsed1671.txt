This is the second to best AC game, no doubt... 9.8/10.0 Florence, Venice, Toscana, Vennetto... this game is a feast for explorers The story is brilliant The diversity of activities brings a lot of alternative things to do The music is greatCriticism if any AC Brotherhood is the part II of this game, but if you add them, the score break records It really has no other issues, its just AC IV Black Flag is slightly bigger/better
