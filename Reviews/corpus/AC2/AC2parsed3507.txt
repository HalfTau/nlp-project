I cant the describe the feels this game gives me. I think tha AC2 and Brotherhood are just 2 masterpieces in the AC saga and probably the whole modern gaming generation. I remember playing this the first time on a ps3, and some days ago it was on sale, and I got caught by nostalgia and decided to buy it. Probably the best spent money in my life. Also, I live in Italy... so the feels are really. The places are so well done and just look so real, like they where taken directly from here! The graphics are the only thing that might disappoint you... in 2010 we had some really good games with amazing graphics, and AC2 really wasnt up to the standars, and it still isnt of course. But you know, the emotions a game gives you is what really matters. Great game. Get it.P.s. the mac port is fairly decentP.s.s. you might have to rebind some keys on your keyboard and find the best setup thats good for you... cause default is seriously messed up
