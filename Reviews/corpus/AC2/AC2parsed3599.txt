It aged well. Ive been running it for the story, since my introduction to the series was Brotherhood.Pros it has all the textures, there are no FPS drops and you can play it unlike Unity even though its the second game in the series and alomst 5 years old, you get a wide variety of weapons AC is known for best looting mechanic of all AC games the story is interesting... both of them music is great no lockpicking I dont know why they added it in next couple of games, but its good that its dead in Black Flag againCons colors seem a bit washedout and everything is leaning towards pastel controls on the HUD are linked to icons instead of actual keys. It takes a bit of learning to get used to it, but its fine after a while action camera, especially in closed spaces and exploration sidequests is bugged to hell and can cause frustration. There is, for example, a mechanic where you should pull a lever and run the course before some gate closes. The first time I missed the lever and ran to the closed door with a normal camera and it was fairly easy. But as soon as you pull the lever, the camera from hell activates automatically and even changes how you are moving and the controls. Luckily, the camera activates mostly in exploration sidequests so you can easily skip those.Overall 8/10.
