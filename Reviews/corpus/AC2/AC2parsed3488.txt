What a fun game! The game play, character interactions, voice acting and the world settings are all top notch. You get to explore Italian cities, make friends with Leonardo Da Vinci and fight the Pope Those things alone make the game worth playing.If you are getting this game, buy Brotherhood along with it. Brotherhood is just as fun and adds a few new things to the game that really make it worth playing. Revelations seems to be missing something that makes it not as fun but it is not a bad game and I would recommend it just to finish out this part of the series.
