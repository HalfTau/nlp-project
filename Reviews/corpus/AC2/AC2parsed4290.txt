Ok, by far this is the best Assassins Creed game Ive ever played. Why? Well, one reason is because the storyline is personally my favorite as it features a very atmospheric touch to it, and the missions arent 510 minutes long. You have to spend some time on the game if you want to get the very best rewards the game has to offer. Also, if you pay attention to the dialogue and read the subtitles, you may learn a little bit of Italian. Lastly, even though the game was made in 2009, it offers pretty good graphics and shader quality. All in all, this is truely the best Assassins Creed game so far, and Im excited to see what else Ubisoft has to offer in future AC titles.
