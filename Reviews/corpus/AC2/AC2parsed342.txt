The story is decent, and the parkour truly is very fun... for the first few hours. After a while you begin to realize that the core game is a total grindfest of boring copypasted escort quests in copypasted locations. Playing Assassins Creed is a bit like clam diving, except the ocean is made of bullsht you can find some truly good stuff in here, but only if you comb through the copypasted crap. Personally, Im happy I experienced this franchise, but I cant say its good, nor would I say its worth the time.
