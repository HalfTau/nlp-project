This game is much better than the first game  much more variety of game play.  There are different types of missions, weapons, and ways you can kill.  I really like how there is an economy system now and you can own shops to get discounts on buying new things.  You can also get history lessons on the Renaissance in Italy, if youre interested in those kinds of things.  The storyline is very matrix like and is an interesting story development from the previous game.  Theyve also incorporated a puzzle/brainteaser like element which I feel most games nowadays lack, the puzzles are quite challenging and require much thinking.  If youre not the type of person who wants that in a game, just look at FAQs.  But I really like solving riddles  puzzles, so that element is perhaps one of my favorite parts of that game.  Overall this is one of the best games of the assassins creed saga, and has great replay value.
