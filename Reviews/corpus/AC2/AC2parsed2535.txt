This game contains everything a gamer wants.Then there are the characters.The character design is just great. This game may be old and the graphics may not be the best, but compared to the games today, its just phantastic. Even after years of not playing i recognized all the characters.The missions are varied so they dont get boring.There are also side quest, like finding all codex sites, accessing Altairs armor, finding secret templar hiding places,The Truth and much more.You can even build your own village up. Its just renovating, but its nice to see the village going from ugly to back to glory.Of all Assassins Creed parts this is the best together with Assassins Creed 1.Go and buy it.Reqiuescat in pace.
