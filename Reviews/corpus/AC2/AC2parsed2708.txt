its pathetic that this is still the best ac game yetbut that doesnt mean its a bad game  its ing amazing, one of the best open worlds i have ever played in,a surprisingly accurate depiction of 15th century florence with an amazing story.but one would think that after all these years ubisoft would have made THE ultimate AC game, but all they make is a rehashed version of ac3 with the same bugs, overly easy combat, forgettable characters, shitey pc port...but they dont give a crap... seeing as they earn millions anyway... what adeveloper.
