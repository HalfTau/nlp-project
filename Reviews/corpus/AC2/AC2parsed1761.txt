The game started out pretty good and I was having lots of fun. But around the middle the fighting got reaaaally annoying.You get attacked pretty frequently, even if you reduce the heat meter to zero. But the fight consists of you standing still like a moron, waiting for the assailant to attack you so you could counter it and then hit him. You have to do it that way, because the assailant blocks all of your normal attacks. So even getting from A to B is annoying, because you have several of suchencounters on the way whre you basically stand around, waiting to hit a button.Also, Ive no freaking idea what the plot evolved into. Granted, I had a few beers while playing, but Im at a point where characters are name dropping all sorts of people and Ive no clue who they are or why I need to murder them.Still leaving my recommendation, as at least the first part of the game is good, with fantastic voice acting. Perhaps, youll have better luck with the second part than I did.
