Ive come to the conclusion that this series has become too boring and unimaginative to be worth playing.  The game gives you too much culture and demographic history, and not enough gampeplay or variety.While the game is poluted with scenic settings, the static gameplay basically, either climbing one of the 80 towers in the game, some kind of foot race, or taking out someone  whos never challenging unless youre on a timer of a sort.The interesting characters in the game are very very few and are more workedin as cut sequences than anything else.  The vast virtual world quickly becomes very repetitve and immensely lonely.  The weapons are nearly all the same as is every combat sequence  all 90 of them.  Leveling up is far  too easy, and the game is not challenging on any level aside from failing monsterous jumps, and finding hidden objects.    There is a lot to do within the game therefore, it takes a long time to complete however, its all the same generic fluff scattered throughout different parts of the game.How it can be fixed1.  The protagonist needs to rely gameplaywise on the supporting characters  in order to complete missions.2.  The weapons need to change.  There needs to be situations where the protagonist must use certain elements in order to pass.3. Side quests need better rewards, like special weapons that dont play like every other weapon in the game, etc.4. Look at Metal Gear Solid for inspiration.  Its a stealth game however, it integrated various elements  and characters to make the game a challenge.5. Combine Splinter Cell Gameplay with a Metal Gear Innovation/Story, taking it back a few years and youre golden.6. Look at Skyrim.  The game is an oblivion iv mod however, the variety of weapons and quests make it unique, despite the engine.
