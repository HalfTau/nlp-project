A beautiful game with a great storyline. Though the game has some technical and POV issues. Still I plan to play the whole franchise and wasnt sure Id like the game with the parkour movements and all. Its much easier than Prince of Persia in my opinion  even with keyboard  gaming mouse  and doesnt take away from the game except in a few spots where the camera angle is borked.
