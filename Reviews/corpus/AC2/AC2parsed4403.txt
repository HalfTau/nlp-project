Before Assassins Creed became a yearly franchise, it was a pretty basic open world game with hint of verticality that was only explored properly in later games of the series. Assassins Creed 2 was overall a vast improvement from its predecessor and some would even say it was the best game in the Ezio Trilogy. Though the main quest is really fun to play, the secondary missions lack variety. Overall would recommend it when it goes at a discounted price.
