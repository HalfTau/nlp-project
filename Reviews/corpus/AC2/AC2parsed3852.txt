For me this game was pretty fun for a first play of an Assassins Creed game, even though the mechanics are outdated it makes up for it with a fun freerunning and combat system. Im not too sure about why this game is the best AC game to be honest, I think its because people are comparing it to Assassins Creed 1, and yes, from AC1 to AC2 it was a huge leap, but I wouldnt call it the best Assassins Creed, the combat system is updated more in Brotherhood but if you want to get the whole feeling of Renaissance Italy and get to grips with Ezio Auditore da Firenze then I suggest you use this as your first stop and work to Revelations. Its definetly worth it.
