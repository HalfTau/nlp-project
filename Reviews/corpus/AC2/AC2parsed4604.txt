I took a chance on getting this game after reading on several websites that the game didnt run well or at all on Macs running OS X 10.7 or higher. Well it does indeed run on 10.9, but the graphics stutter and the shadows dont appear to be rendering correctly. Perhaps I need to adjust the graphic settings, but it appears as if this isnt a clean port of the game or needs to be updated for the latest graphics drivers. As for the game itself... I find it hard to get into it. It takes so long for the actual game play to start and the story is a little confusing. Then when it actually instructs you to do something, you have to search through the menus to find which key does what so you can move or perform the required action. A better system to teach you the game could go a long way...
