Im comparing this to the first assassins creed.Heres the pros/cons.Pros  better graphic than the first one ez combat system ez getting alot of money subtitles hidden gun FLYING No more over suspicious npc, now they think im an entertainer or a desperate loverOkay  the free run system can be annoying but can be helpful too the button pressing in a scene are too fast. But it doesnt matter anywayCons  Horses still cant get into the city Cant fast travel in the same city smoke bomb pouch are too small symbols hud got really confusing sometimesOverall obviously better than AC 1,I give it 9/10
