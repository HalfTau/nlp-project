i like the assassins creed series and assassins creed 2 is my personal favorite with the use if the dual hidden blades and its upgrades are outstanding and the free running is cool i always like to run and assasinate the gaurds  but i recomend this game for those who are asking which assassina creed game to try and if you have a uplay account you can get cool little stuff like altairs outfit from the first game a underground assassins tomb in monteriggioni but overall i love assasins creed 2 and will always play this game for the time being but anyway thats my review for assassins creed 2
