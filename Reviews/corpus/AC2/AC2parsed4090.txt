This game is no doubt a great one.Staff reproducing the beauty of Florence and Venice so perfectly that I want to be there badly.I got the same feeling playing AC1, sightseeing in Jeruslem.Beyond question, Ezios family is the best tune of AC2.In this sequal, assassination operates more easily.You can kill the target either from above, or from below, let alone from a hiding spot.You have different methods to assassinate your target, rather than walking quietly and stab in the back, or cut throat.The DLC contains several mission in Florence, which are quite challenging. I practically learned by myself how to infiltrate a highly protected ship and assassinate all the staff after, no less than 20 failures.Above all, no matter what type of game you usually prefer, this one will NOT let you down.
