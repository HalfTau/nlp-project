Such disappointment.I was excited to play through this serie and had amazing experience with the first one with minor issues with the controlling but this one.. is more then pain in the butt controlwise.First of all it does not register and also not support controller. I tried six billion suggestion to fix that, but nothing worked to by pass that. Already frustrated decided to stick with KM just to figure out that it doesnt lock the cursor and even program cant lock it so it just keeps alttab for me every now and then.The game could be amazing  this port just not let me get to the point to enjoy it. Like at all. Pure pain and suffering and zero gameplay experience.I just hope my friend can play this from my account so at least I can see the story. Whatever.Dont buy if you have dual monitors. Unless you willing to disable the secondary everytime you launch the game.
