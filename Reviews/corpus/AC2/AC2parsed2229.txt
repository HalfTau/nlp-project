My biggest complaint about this game is that it requires UPlay to be installed. This means that UPlay will have to update itself every time you open the game, delaying actuallying playing the game. This also means that the game will randomly quit when UPlay doesnt speak to the server often enough to ensure that youre not friends with pie rats.My second biggest complaint is that this is obviously a port of a console game and really is intended to be played with a controller. Playing with a mouse and keyboard is doable, but there will be plenty of moments where you fight the autocamera and think No Ezio, why did you leap THAT way?! The controls dont always play nice.Combat is easy enough since countering is not always an instant kill, but its never really a challenge. More of a delayer. Most fights will be bypassed or cheesed with lots and lots of knives, or if its just simple mooks, counter away.Aside from that, its stabby stabby slicey slicey. The protagonist is likeable and relateable enough, exploring and running around is fun, the collectables give rewards now and arent completely impossible to find without a guide, and the story is decent. A worthwhile pickup if youve liked any other game in the franchise.
