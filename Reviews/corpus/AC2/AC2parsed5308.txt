This builds on the previous game, and becomes so much better!  You may find the early parts of the game frustrating, while you go through the whole retraining.  Get used to it  The game will toss you new mechanics all the way till the end!  The game in general is much more forgiving... and you can swim!  Lastly, as I mentioned for the previous game, this is quite possibly the best story arc Ive seen in a game.  You should really pick up all three and soon four and play them in otrder!
