Ill start out by saying that this game is an improvement in every way over Assassins Creed. The main improvement is its NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.Your hero in Assasins Creed 2 is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Ezios sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story ignoring the bits outside the Animus is a great revengeconspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezios life. While I wont pretend all the characters are memorable, theyre all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note you can even switch to playing the game in Italian with english subtitles!.The gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more storybased, actionpacked missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are VERY fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.Also, it easily has one of the best soundtrack! The music is not only original and cool, it changes perfectly to match the action in the game chase scenes, flying, hiding etc. The developers really went out of their way with this one.This remains one of my favorite series of all time and I highly recommend it to all gamers. You might even learn a little italian too. xD
