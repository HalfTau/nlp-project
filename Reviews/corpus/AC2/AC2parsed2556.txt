Although I havent played all Assassins creed games yet, I can tell this game is a GEM, a MUSTHAVE for the AC fan. Its graphics are beautiful and the gameplay has a lot of variation. There is a lot to do in the 3 Italian cities and your own Town, including assassinations, chasing evil messengers, finding secret drawings and even DUNGEONS freaking dungeons!!!. There is also a part where you can fly!! If you are not in the mood for the story mode, you can always show your moves like daggers to those guards and run for your life, trying to escape them or beat them with the fair and fun combat system. And if you are in the mood for the story mode....you can expect a big storyline incoming. The only thing I really miss in this game is the fact you cant moonwalk to act like a boss.Anyway, you should buy this game. There is no way around it.
