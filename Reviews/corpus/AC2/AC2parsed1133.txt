Really the best Assassins Creed game. Except for the stupid modernday parts. Those are a slog, and they never should have done the whole Were going to beam you back into the lives of your ancestors thing. The series would have been much better if they had just had you playing the game as the assassins the whole time. But that a problem with the series, not with the game. This is by far the best one, best climbing, best combat, best secret levels to get good gear.  Buy it and have fun.
