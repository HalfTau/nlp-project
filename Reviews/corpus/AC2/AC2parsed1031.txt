Assassins Creed 2 is a story, well possibly one of the best stories in the AC world, about an Assassin named Ezio Auditore da Firenze. A man thats naturally born into the true form of the order. This story will keep you in suspense, hit you in the feelers, and make you smile at some real historical figures set in the AC world, including places.I will tell you that you can spend lots of hours on this game alone just with the side quests, treasure hunting, codexes, seals, so on. The world is beautiful graphically and the every single character is lovable. The replayability is high, Ive completed this game once before on console and had to buy it for PC just to experience it again. I highly encourage gamers to give this title a try if they havent yet.
