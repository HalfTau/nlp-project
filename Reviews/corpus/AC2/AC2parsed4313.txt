Theorically a stealth yes, really. No, I didnt invent that, check wikipedia game with freerun elements. In practice its a despicable console port with the worst maniability Ive ever witnessed in a freerun game.Since the maniability is so bad, it quite logically severly impairs the stealth gameplay. But that is not all, the stealth gameplay itself is utterly sabotaged by awful level design coupled to incoherent AI behavior, going from allies and ennemies alike randomly jumping  and therefore, dying  into water Ezio  the main character  is the only human who knows how to swim to ennemies never detecting you when they should, but detecting you when youre not moving and hidden.Now, the freerun aspect is far from being spared in this havoc, being worsen not only by the shameful maniability, but also by a very buggy detection collision.In the end, it is a much greater chore than the first they didnt learn from their mistakes, they did add more mistakes instead. Also, unlike the first one, this one looks like a playmobil game has a very boring and overplayed story to the point where you want to skip almost all cutscenes but, of course, you cant even when you have to replay the same bit from last checkpoint dozens of times and plot elements.
