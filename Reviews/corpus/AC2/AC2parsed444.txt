Its good but the autosave is kind of unfriendly to a new player.Less than 5 mins in the Assassins world, your dear brother askes you to climb a church to compete with him. If you lose the battle and try to start over againunfortunately, every time you load and your dear brother is already 5 steps ahead. The circumstances totally changed, making it harder to beat him.At last, before applying for a refund,I deleted all the data and started from the very beginingand yes you can not skip anything. Fortunately, this time the brother was playing a fair game and I won.Still, the bug wasted my time.
