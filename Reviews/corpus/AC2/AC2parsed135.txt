A pretty solid game. Stealth wise its a bit shallow and Desmonds section of the plot is by far the worst part about it.  Not the pinnacle of greatness, but Ezio alone made it enjoyable to play. It was good enough to make me want to finish it, so thats worth something, I guess. If you want to play just one AssCreed, go for this one.
