Better than the original, if I do say so myself. Theres just as much to do  if not more some of it tedious and unnecessary like collecting flags. The graphics alone are reason to play the openness of the world and landscapes are absolutely breathtaking. The gameplay and controls have been revamped ever so slightly, combat upgraded, and improved, but are still similar enough to the previous game that you can transition seemlessly from one game to the next.The story continues in Rennaissance Italy from the perspective of the Assassin Ezio Auditore and you learn much more about the Assassins, the Templars, and the plot thickens...Unfortunately, the vastness of the world and the limited means of mobility running, horseback, sparce waypoints lead to a lot of time spent just travelling around and this can become tedious, but not enough to detract from the adventure.9/10
