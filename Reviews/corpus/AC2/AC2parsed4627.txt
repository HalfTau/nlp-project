Probably one of the worst games I have ever played. I hate this game with a passion. The story tries to sound smart but is incredibly cliched and the missions are repetitive. You have to unlock the cities in a GTAlike fashion, but expect to be playing hours upon hours of Follow people for five hours then stab some old guy who you dont even know. The combat is hilariously easy and offers no challenge, and the freerunning element is one of the most broken things I have seen in a game. No precision, no smoothness, this game was the biggest disappointment I have ever bought.
