I liked the game very much. It loses something story wise from the first chapter of the series Ubisoft has this thing for lousy revenge story, inexplicably. The main character is not that great  even if everybody apparently is crazy about him  while the bad guy is not that bad.The cities, though. They are just flippin awesome. Running on the roofs of Florence and Venice is just gorgeous and you can play the game just for that. The fact that one of the most intriguining parts of Italian history is the background is a very big plus.
