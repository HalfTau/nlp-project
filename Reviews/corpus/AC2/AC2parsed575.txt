When AC I made a huge success, Ubisoft obviously wouldnt miss the opportunity to make a sequel. And its amazing how much work they did to make AC II an awesome game. They made everything better, gameplay, story, the map. Just forgeting the fact that Ezio wear a Assassin suit all the time and no one cares, the game is perfect.
