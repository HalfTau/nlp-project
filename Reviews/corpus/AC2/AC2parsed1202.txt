I cannot recommend for one simple reason  they botched up the mouse movement.. The mouse feels very wonky when trying to play this game, for the brief time I was trying to tweak and play I really felt like I had to fight it... it seems like a great deal of mouse acceleration and unfortunately there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to remedy this if you want to play with keyboard and mouse. Outside of this it looks fine, and should be perfectly playable with a controller. But not having good functionality with a mouse in a PC game is an instant no for me here, especially when the first game had it working perfectly fine.
