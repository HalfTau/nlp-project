I did not consider the fact that this is outdated game. Graphic was good. Very distinguishable environment. It has a unique way of attaching your emotion to this series. Until that I was baffled of the fact that this game is famous. I mean Ezio is just arunning like a fool! God The irritation I got everytime he rides the wall while sprinting. The game itself was straightforward. Reasonable Campaign length too. The only trouble is the mental agony you get from controlling Ezio. Puzzle was fun. If controlling was optimized it wouldve been fantastic so thats a little shame. Sprinting is same as riding the wall. This was very irritating thoughout the campaign. I hated the key setting menu. They should just told us wha the key represents, instead of giving us this icons that we cant really know what it is until we play.
