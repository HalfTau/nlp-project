An excellent game, it improved upon the best features of the first and got rid of most of its failings. The storyline is very engaging who doesnt like a conspiracy theory that spans millenia and well told through cutscenes, flashbacks, items, and in game events. Combat is more varied than in the first one and took some practice to master, which is always good because it then feels like it takes skill rather than button mashing or simple timed clicking. Again, the open world was excellent and climbing random buildings was great fun, though I did find at times that I couldnt go somewhere that I expected to be able to which was frustrating. The developers also threw in some more collectables and the ability to add items to a house, which seemed like just a gimmick at first, but was somewhat addictive when actually playing.Definitely going to play the other games in the series.
