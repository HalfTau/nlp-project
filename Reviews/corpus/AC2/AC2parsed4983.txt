I thought itd be more or less the first one. Its not. Story, my main complaint from the first one, is actually better here, played by voice actors who actually feel like they care about this game. The fighting system has improved slightly, though its more or less still the same. Lots of buildings to climb, plenty of action going on, tombs to raid. Its just overall a great game. Thought it was weird that they implimented sidequests at first, but it works to its advantage here. Cant imagine a better way to play it.If you liked the first one, you are going to love this one. If you hated the first one, you may think this is a step in a better direction.
