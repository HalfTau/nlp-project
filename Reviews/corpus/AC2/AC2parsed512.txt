This game is beautiful and clearly has tons of money put into it. However, I cant reccomend it for a few reasons. For starters, combat, which has tons of different options and features added in for no good reason, just gets reduced to countering attacks by the opponent. Enemies quickly become skilled enough to block your attacks and grabs, meaning that the only way to do anything to them is with a counter which is an instant kill. The boss fights are even lamer  nothing but chain grabbing. You grab them, punch them a few times, and while theyre getting up, you grab them again. This works 100 of the time, and could be done forever. I didnt take any damage at all in the final boss fight using this method, nor did I do anything other than grab him. Its worse than wobbling in Melee.Climbing is a super cool mechanic at first, but quickly gets old. Its honestly all the same and really just boils down to holding up, left, or right. No interactivity at all, and it can be painfully slow.Missions in this game are usually just frustrating. Almost every mission is just go assassinate some guy or follow some guy, the latter being incredibly annoying. This gameplay is fine at first, but when it becomes almost every mission in the entire game, it gets old fast.My biggest problem is the lack of good stealth elements. The things is, all the groundwork exists there for it to have strategic stealth sections much like Dishonored a game I wholeheartedly recommend. This would actually be quite interesting and fun, but it doesnt exist. Theres almost no strategy to any of the missions and trying to be stealthy usually isnt your best option anyway.The story is pretty meh. Nothing to see there.In conclusion, this game isnt that good. The only good parts are the cool animations and the welldesigned world, but the actual gameplay is repetitive and uninteresting. I wouldnt buy it again, honestly.
