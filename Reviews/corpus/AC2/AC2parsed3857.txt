So I bought AC2 at the same time i bought AC1 and thought The sequel should be better as i hated the first game.I found this game to be a sequel true to its predesessor. Good graphics, with a bad sorry, unforgivibly bad voice acting, and more tempar t.And to top all that off, you have to sign up for this Uplay bull that ends up lagging everything up and never wants to turn off.I have to open my system tray and end the process to get it to shut off.Screw Uplay.I really wish i hadnt spent money on this game.
