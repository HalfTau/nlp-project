No matter how many years passes by, AC 2 is one of the best AC games out there. In terms of story and progression that is... Jumping from one end to the other is fun but frustrating. The best espects of this game is its concept of height. Even to this day, AC 2 still gives me the scare whenever I am jumping across platforms on high places, like the level in the massive church I dont know what it was called.Now to the problems of this game!1. Parkour is stiff but manageable. If you think before jumping and climbing, especially on those dugeons.2. Combat is as easy as counting A,B,C. Maybe a bit too easy.3. 100 completing this game isnt that hard, but you will feel like it is a waste of time. Basically, the collectables are not worth the damn.
