Although the controls leave something to desired actually, they leave a lot to be desired, and can be really frustrating at first, this game is an overall excellent combination of great story, nice graphics, great ambience and soundtrack, etc. The gameplay itself is topnotch and the mechanics are awesome and really entertaining. If you were turned off by the first Assassins Creed, this is definitely an improvement, including a better setting 15th century Italy.
