A sequel that triumphs over the original in every possible way!Few games so deftly balance the contrasting qualities achieved here. Its at once both epic and intimate, earnest and lighthearted. The scale of it is truly magnificent, but often its largest and most moving moments come from the smallest and most carefully composed scenes.Note Besides a somewhat fantastic game, the only downside is that Uplay on PC is terrible. This goes to most if not all Ubisoft games here on Steam.
