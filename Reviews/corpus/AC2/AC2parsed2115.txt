Today I have to agree with some previous reviews  the controls of ACII are dogCannot even beat my sibling using xbox 360 controller not to speak about the PC keyboard  my guy just does not move fast enough and most times jumps 180 degrees the other way he should go!So paid for only being able to play it for ca 20 minutes. Nice!Will never buy an AC game any more.
