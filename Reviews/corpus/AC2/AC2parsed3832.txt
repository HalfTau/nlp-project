Because of connection problems of Ubisoft servers and although this is a single player game, Story Mode is trying to connect to the Ubisoft servers and I can not play the game. If this is a single player game and I have installed the game to my PC, why do I need to connect to the servers? I do not know. Ubisoft has connection problems more than 1 month. Thats why I do not recommend any Ubisoft games.
