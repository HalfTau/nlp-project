Assassins Creed II is an amazing game. Ive played all but III and IV, and II is still so good that I crave going back and playing it again. If you didnt like ACI it had its issues, but I still loved it, then give ACII a try. Some people suggest skipping ACI entirely, but I dont. Pick it up for a fun experience, but know that almost every issue with the game is fixed with ACII and beyond.
