I am a extreme completionist. Ive purchased all of the assassins creed games up until black flag, and may I say I have never played a series that had a story so immersive that I feel compelled to activtly communicate it to my PC bretheren. This release in particular allows you to relive the memories of Ezio Auditore de Firenze, a boy, turned assassin by the death of his family. From the perspective of this assassin you learn the code of manhood, and the assassins creed. The extreme pain of seeing death to being able to deliver it numbly. You see a boy broken then reborn. His story ties the series into the future with Desmond, the past with Altair, and in his own time. It is argued that Altair is the best assassin, and by far he is but after literally living the life of Ezio, you feel as though part of his morality has been transfered to you... the player. Altair was a cold killer only bound to the creed by himself and a few friends where Ezio devotes his soul to revenge to the point of nearly quitting. What can I say, the bleeding effect didnt only alter Desmond.
