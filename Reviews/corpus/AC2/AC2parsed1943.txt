If youre a fan of the series, then get it.The gameplay throughout this series is naturally very similar. That isnt a bad thing for me, but I know it puts some off. If you want to try one of the games as a standalone or a first purchase, I suggest Black Flag.Visuals a little dated, story is cool and/but a lot of cutscenes.Would cautiously recommend/10
