Awesome game! One of the best sequels of all time, improves on nearly every aspect of the first game.The Setting of the Italian Rennaissance is very Exciting and the Soundtrack is Eargasmic.It is perhaps the best Assassins Creed game in the series, although I personally think Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is an overall better game, this one is the one to get, if you want to get into the franchise and didnt play any of the other ones before.
