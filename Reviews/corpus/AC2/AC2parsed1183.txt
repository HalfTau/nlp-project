Wonderful atmosphere and lovely music. Many varied elements that werent implemented in the first game makes this a much more varied and enjoyable experience. Disarming guards and having them flee before you, or using their greatswords or spears against them, gives an incredibly empowering feeling. Its also refreshing that they got rid of the drunkards/mentally disabled people who would cause a lot of frustration in the first game.However, with the current amount of bugs I wasnt sure if I wanted to recommend this game. On one early quest the objective would not show up on the map, so I had to restart the game to bring it back. Around that very quest the game would also crashes or freezes.Notable is how the frame rate drops beyond sluggishness every time I access the map. The menus tend to have an FPS drop as well. Must be some weird programming, as Im running on a brand new fairly high end desktop.Also worth adding is that the game at first wouldnt start at all. I had to uninstall the Ubi launcher that came with the game, then download and install a new version of it, as recommended by other players. One would expect to be able to play the game straight of the bat.I will give this review a final edit once Ive completed the game.
