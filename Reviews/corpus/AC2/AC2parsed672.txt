I hate giving this game a thumbs up. I have to, it has moments of pure brilliance, and it would be one of the greatest games ever made... Except for the controls. Words can not describe how absolutely awful the controls are. You will die, and fail, and retry things over and over, not because theyre difficult, but because the controls are so, so bad. Sometimes what your character is doing and what you are telling him to do seem have almost no relation to eachother. Usually it doesnt really matter too much, but then you combine it with anything with a timed element, like the races and tombs, and it just becomes pure, unadulterated cancer. Thats using a gamepad by the wayxbox 360, if anything its even worse with a keyboard and mouse. Other than that its a brilliant game, but I think I hate it almost as much as I love it.
