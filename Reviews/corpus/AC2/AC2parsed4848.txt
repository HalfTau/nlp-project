The social backdrop of Assassins Creed II is the birth of modern Europe in philosophy, engineering, architecture, art, commerce, i.e. the renaissance in northern Italy, that marked the beginning of the end to religious rule. Rapped up in an action packed freerunning/parkour form factor, Assassins Creed should appeal to any adrenalin seeking gamer with a taste for beauty and history.
