Recommend is an awfully strong word. I like this its a strong game and a clear improvement over the first game. Its beautiful. The story is well told, but its Italian revenge story doesnt always mesh well with the pseudoscifi trappings. The polish and detail is incredible, but the pacing is way off. You have all your abilities perhaps a third of the way through the game. This results in a lot of repetition as the game wears on. Side quests that dont have any real weight to their completion and a host of coincidences and false endings that undermine the far tighter first half of the narrative just add to the sense of My God, when will this game be over? This game does what it does incredibly well...ad nauseum. !!!!!A note on UPlay turn off the online synch when playing. It has a habit of loading cloud saves that are days old and overwrite your hard drive saves. Turning off the online synch solves this!!!!!
