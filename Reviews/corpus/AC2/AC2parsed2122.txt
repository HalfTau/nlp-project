Ah AC 2, arguably the best in the series. This game puts you in the role of Ezio Auditore de Firenze,son of the nobleman Giovanni Auditore. Ezio is a very interesting character, with a very easytofollow backstory.ProsExcellent graphics for its timeFreerunning is a blast, as its very fluent and easy to control not as much as say, AC 4, but it worksTONS of stuff to do like Raiding tombs, beating up wives cheating husbands, and moreThe story is very easytofollow and interesting, but has a few dull momentsThe dialogue is ok with pretty good voice actingThe villans are great, from phsycopathic bankers to the POPEConsThe pointless opening with Desmond that couldve been done in a single cutsceneIts me, Mario! Really?UplayI really want to talk about Uplay, as it made me worried that my 20 was spent in vainIf youre VERY VERY VERY VERY...VERY VERY lucky, than Uplay will work for you. Most likley, it will not. To fix this, run AC 2. You will be prompted to log in to Uplay, but when you do, it will crash. This is fine, as we will fix this later. Now, open Control Panel and click Uninstall a Program. Scroll down to Ubisoft Game Launcher, or something like that, and click Uninstall. After this, you should probably delete any leftover files from Uplay. Go to CProgram Files x86Ubisoft On 32bit Windows this will be in CProgram FilesUbisoft and delete the foler named Ubisoft Game Launcher. Then, you want to reinstall Uplay or else the game wont run. You can download it from hereAfter you reinstall Uplay, log in. This should work. Now, you have to click Redeem a game or something like that. Enter your Steam product key and AC 2 will be added to your Uplay/Ubisoft library.
