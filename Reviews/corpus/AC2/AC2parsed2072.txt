Ive never had any issues with Uplay as it has stopped people from launching the game but the main problem for me is the framerate. My laptop has a i7 4500U and a nvidia GT 740M and I thought Id be able to run the game easily but no. The constant fps drops from 3045 to 1525 was an extreme killer for me and the were for no reason, not much crowd density, action or anything. The game itself is good but the performance and optimization is terrible
