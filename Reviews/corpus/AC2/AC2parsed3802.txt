UNPLAYABLE!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOURE ON A MAC!They really messed up the controls, the keyboard doesnt respond the game thinks the MOUSE is the keyboard so the only way to move is to disconnect the mouse when you start the game and reconnect it again when the game has started.The mouse input is terrible, there is NO control over sensitivity or anything and stutters a lot and there is no way to get rid of it.Again NO NOT BUY THIS GAME, at least not if youre on a Mac!!Its a ripoff, very disappointing and truely sad that such an old game isnt properly ported and yet still sold.Even for 2.5 it feels like a waste of money.
