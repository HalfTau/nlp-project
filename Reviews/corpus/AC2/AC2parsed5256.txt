a sequel... none of a kind which are match the original well. It has become larger?. It has more action?. Lots of fun, you know. But, truth to be told,andare very different games, and I do appreciate the original much more than its sequel. Sometimes I even ask myself hey, am I playingnow? No, wait! Its! and thats what is really sad.
