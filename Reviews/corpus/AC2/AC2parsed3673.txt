This game has some of the best character development in any game. You start off with Ezio being born, a small defenceless baby. You translate that into an irrogant teenager, thinking he is invincible. A family tradegdy then converts him into a mess of emotions. By the end of the game he has grown into a fully mature man, realising what life is really like. Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted  the interpretation of this phrase shows you where he is at, maturity wise.Overall, a great game with many improvements from the original, but its the complexity of character that compells me9.5/10
