Its been a long time since Ive played Assassins Creed 1 on Xbox, so Im trying to catch up on the series. Havent played the 3 newer ones yet but I really enjoyed this one and feel like it may be the most developed and interesting of all of them. Plot twist at the end was NUTS and had me hooked on playing the next enstallments.
