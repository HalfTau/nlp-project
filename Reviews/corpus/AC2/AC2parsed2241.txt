Assassins Creed II is one of the best in the series and it makes it more enjoyable because its in Third Person, so there are many places to explore and just basically a free open world  stealth game packed with action. It is set in the 15th and early 16th Cenuturay Renaissance EraIf you download this game you may need to download Ubisofts Uplay which you can find on there website. Its simple although it took me awhile to figure out, because after installing you get a mesage that Ubisofts Uplay in not available etc
