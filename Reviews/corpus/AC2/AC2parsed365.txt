This is my first ever Assassins Creed game, and turns out it has gave me one of the best experience in gaming.Finished this game after the game is already 7 years old, and it doesnt feel old at all. Amazing graphics, soundtracks are pretty good too.The background of the Italian renaissaince added a lot of charm to it as this is one of the historical event I like.The main story is just awesome, and the ending was a twist for me, at least.Assassins Creed 2 is rich of content, assassins tomb, hired mission, historical details, memory glyphs etc.Even though steam does not have any acheivements for it, I still spend a lot of time finding and unlocking everything in the game, just to enjoy more of those unlockables.Cool platforming, combats is very fun and you could kill your targets with any style you like, but some of them have some serious requirements that cannot mess up.The game doesnt require money grinding at all, unless you want more survivability at early game.Easily one of the best assassin games ive ever play, and highly recommended to everyone out there.9.5/10
