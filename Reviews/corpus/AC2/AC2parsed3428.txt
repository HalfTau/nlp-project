Before you purchase this game, a word of warning. Be prepared to  possibly go through what I have gone throug, which is installing and updating uplay, activcating this game, and then not even be able to play it.Every time I try to launch this game whether through steam or Uplay, it attempts to launch and then hangs at a black screen indefinitely, and forces me to either sign out of windows or restart to gain control, because it wont even let me end the process once it hangs.Add to this the troubling occurence of Uplay disabling my sound driver forcing yet another restart, and you begin to see why Im not recommending this game and its DRM within a DRM issues, absolutely no developer support, and lackluster programming preventing it from even starting, and why you shouldnt even bother with this hassle.I have tried all the suggested fixes including refreshing Steam, verifying game integrity, witchhunting all the uplay files after uninstalling and then installing the updated version, etc. Nothing has worked and so I have come to the logical conclusion that this game and Uplay in general is just broke, invasive, and doing things that it probably shouldnt be doing, similar to a root kit, or a security policy bypass.Save your money and give it to a company that deserves it. Better yet, do a Google search and see what I see, that this problem Ive described is painfully common.
