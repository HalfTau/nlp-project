I previously held a very poor review for this game describing its poor controls. I recently went back and fixed everything to my liking and I can say with confidence that this is a good game.PROSFun, quickpaced assassin actionNice graphicsCool storyCONSControls take getting used toMissions are repetitiveUPlayMy take is that this is probably my favorite AC game to date. Once you get the controls down things smooth out and side quests vary your gameplay experience. Overall, Id say it get a 7/10.
