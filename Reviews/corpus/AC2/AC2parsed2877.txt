I bought this game becuase I recently went on a trip to Venice and I wanted to revisit it, but I couldnt actually afford another plane ticket. They get a lot of things right, but the streets are too wide, and its not crowded enough. You dont get lost as easily when you have what amounts to a map, compass and GPS on your HUD at all times. They also left San Croce, one of the districts of Venice, out of the game entirely. This might be because it wasnt worth making into its own district at the time the game is set. Other than that, its a whole bundle of fun. I especially enjoyed the section of the game in Dorsoduro.As for the rest of the game, its fun. I wish you could remove all armour, since after you finish the main quest you dont really need any of it to complete the missions, and you cant see your dyed robes as well with it on.
