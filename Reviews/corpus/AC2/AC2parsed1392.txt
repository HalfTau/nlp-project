This game, in my opinion, perfects the Assassins Creed formula. The story is really engaging, and I absolutely love the depiction of Renaissance Italy. The assassinations themselves felt fun and challenging to play out. There are a huge variety of weapons available in the game, letting you carry out missions in different ways. The side activity of renovating a village is also a lot of fun  it is cool to see the area change over time as you acquire more wealth. The game may be old, but it still feels fresh and fun to play.
