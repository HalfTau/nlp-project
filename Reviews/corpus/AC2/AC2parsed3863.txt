Well, Ive played all AC games so far except the minor ones, like Liberation and I can say that this is the one who made the saga an epic win. Brotherhood overall is the best one, and Black Flag is the most complete one... But this one has an especial place in my heart. Dont get me wrong, I like the first one, but Ezio outstands among all protagonists... And doing parkour through 15th century Italy is an utterly amazing experience.Try the classic.
