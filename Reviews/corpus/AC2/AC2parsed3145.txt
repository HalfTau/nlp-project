On the whole, this is a very well made game. In terms of gameplay, its kind of like a cross between GTA and Prince of Persia. The bulk of the action effectively takes place in 15th century Italy, using real locations and landmarks. The story is fictional, but it references a number of real historical figures and situations.PROS Almost complete freedom to run/climb/explore everywhere. Many ways to complete various objectives. Believable ambience in the cities lots of people roaming around. Moderately good range of weapons depending on your preferred fighting style. Fairly good story although a bit weird at the end... Good animation and voice acting. Short loading screens. Fairly easy to play and enjoy even if youre not very good at most action games.CONS Controls are sometimes very fiddly/glitchy probably better suited to a controller than mousekeyboard. A few missions are just annoying, particularly towards the end of the game. Probably too easy for some people. Some game elements feel like a poorlyplanned afterthought.
