An amazing followup to Assassins Creed that fixes most if not all of the flaws and gives you a beautiful new city to play around in.The story is solid but does feel a little spread out at times. The transitions between story segments in and out of the animus is really top notch in this one. Plot on both sides always felt relevent, something I think lacked from most AC games after this one. I really enjoyed the characters, the main cast is funny and relatable but still manages to feel mostly period accurate.Graphics are great for their time and really hold up for the most part. Environment feels alive and by the time I got to play it most of the bugs were ironed out. Cities feel big, churches and streets are fun to explore just to see the art work on the inside.Gameplay is solid, its not the best in AC to date but it is a great improvement over the original and is still fun to play. Missions are fun and varied, for the most part. You will still notice repeats of certain types of missions, go here kill that, go here get that, and the god awefull tailing missions that I still hate. Blending in with crowds feels silly, maybe thats just me, but if an armed dude walked up to me and some friends while we were talking, I dont think we would just continue the conversation. Combat is varied, fun, and satisfying. At a certain point the mission is combat is not to stay alive, its to make a spectacle of slaughtering your enemy. This is where ACII really shines. Planning out an assult and following through is one of the most satisfying parts of this game.Aside from some annoying tailing mission and some minor glitches ACII is a beautiful, immersive, and fun game that I would reccommend to just about anyone.
