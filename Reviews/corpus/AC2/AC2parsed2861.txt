Overall Great story in the animus, fixes gameplay flaws in the original mostly, story in the real world a bit lacking.The story in the animus is gripping, with the exciting chases across varied landscapes.It fixes the wierd blending system, you an now hide in crowds, or hire groups to be a crowd, greatly improving the stealth aspect.There is still a lot of horseback riding, but it is nowhere near as bad as in the original.The combat is more complex, allowing more room for improvement, in the original you hit a glass ceiling were you could counter everything perfectly.The story in the real world is the biggest flaw, it is interesting to begin with, then has a few stops and starts in the middle with the british man keeping your interest alive with his cynicism, then ends with a shameless cliff hanger.
