Yes this is the best assassins creed game, sure, but even with an x box controller, the controls are not the same as in the original console. You have to invest time into getting a ubisoft account and setting it up, it is tedious. The 360 controller is not fully compatible even though it says it is, the right and left triggers cannot be assigned it cannot be played with a keyboard, it is not meant for it. The whole process of trying to play this game is that, a process. Ubisoft needs to find a way to be able to make it easier to play it, and be compatible with the very controller it was originally meant to be played with. Worst purchases I ever made on steam. With that said, If you have an xbox 360 sitting around collecting dust, yeah get this game, play this game, beat this game. But dont play it on the pc.
