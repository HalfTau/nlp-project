I cant get this game past the login popup because of the faulty Ubisoft Launcher at least, thats what 5 other people having the same issue with the same damn game have concluded, another 20 people blame Uplay. Ubisoft is mostly to blame for this Im sure theyre sort of notorious for being less user friendly than the Xbox 1 in its 24/7 spying days, but I still wouldnt recommend paying 20 for this game if you wouldnt be able to fix that on your own. Im incredibly disappointed about all this because 1 I spent 20 fking dollars on a game that wont work because it has a busted launcher inside of a game that is SUPPOSED to have its OWN FKING LAUNCHER, and because the music and gameplay Ive seen look beautiful...
