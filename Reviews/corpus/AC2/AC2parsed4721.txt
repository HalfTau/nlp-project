Can i refund this ?the game is fine and its fun to playit has a good story but the QTE for pc are terrible .and ontop of that when sprinting on roofs its almost impossible to navigate accuratly 100 of the timethis game is clearly made for console the only ups i can give this is how good it looks / runs on pcoh and there is the huge issue of not being able to play offline or alt tab if your running on a mac...ye this litrally makes it impossible for me the play the game a lot of the time .... this is a wast of money for me
