This was my first AC game, so I came in with almost no expectation. Through the first like 15 hours, the game kept blowing me away with cool gadgets, excellent combat system and a great cast of characters. However, I felt that the mission were getting very repetitive and the lines were getting a bit cliche. Overall, I think that you should definitely give this one a go first if you are interested in AC simply because of the story and the visual itself I thought that the game has aged exceptionally well.
