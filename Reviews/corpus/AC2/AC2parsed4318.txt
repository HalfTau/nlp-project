This game is pretty fun, I just think it drags on a little long. After the first 20 hours of playing it, I thought I was near the end and tried to hammer out the rest in a day. I ended up playing another 20 hours in the course of a day or two, thinking I was near the end, which made it feel like a chore to complete. Otherwise, Id say that this is one of the best Assassins Creeds, probably after Black Flag it takes second place. Definitely recommend, but dont make my mistake and try to beat it in a weekend haha.
