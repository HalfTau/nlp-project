Listen.I play until sequence 9, got LOTS of frickin feathers and 100000 florin, but guess what? This morning when i decided to start it up, all my savedata was gone. Well... I tried restarting and reaching out to support, NOTHING.Dont buy this, unless you manually backup savedata or turn off cloud sync. If i could, id want Ubisoft to refund me 20 for this garbage.
