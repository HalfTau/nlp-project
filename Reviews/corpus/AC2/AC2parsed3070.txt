This is probably one of the best Assassins Creed game to start playing from. Its graphics are amazing and the story is great. This was the first Assassins Creed game Ive played and now I own 6 of them. You do not even have to play the first Assassins Creed to fully understand what is happening, and if you are confused you soon enough understand it.
