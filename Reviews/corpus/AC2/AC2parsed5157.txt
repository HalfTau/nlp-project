Everything about this game is fantastic  the story, the gameplay, and especially the characters. The gameplay can take several hours for the really dedicated going immediately between the main storyline missions, but the time can be stretched indefnitely by the size of the sandbox, and the number of side missions races, assassination contracts, ect. I absolutely love it, and it Assassins Creed is easily my favorite game series.
