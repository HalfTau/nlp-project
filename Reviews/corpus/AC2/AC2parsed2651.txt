Ezio is one of the characters I love most in videogames!He had the chance to evolve in 3 different games and the story was awesome, inside and outside of the Animus.After the Ezio era, neither hero actually mattered. The story was meaningless, the protagonists weak and the youre the characterfps version of the present day is just horrible/inexistent.Dont get me wrong, I bought every single AC game that was released. Love them, theyre fun to play. But none had the impact the 3 Ezio games had on me. Not even close... The cliffhangers at the end of each one of them were breathtaking and I miss that feeling...
