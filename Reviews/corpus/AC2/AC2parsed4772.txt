Open world Parkour  Assassination game. Modern day sections of the game suck and the Ancient World content is brilliant it makes complete sense when Desmond the main protaganist wants to go back to Italy.Voice Acting, Story, Dialogue, Characters and Combat are all good. Campaign is lengthy. There is a vast amount of content/sidequests and a reasonable amount of variety. The aged graphics are still good because of the attention to detail and no uncanny valley.Gamepad strongly recommended. Get it on sale.
