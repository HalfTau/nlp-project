A remarkable sequel to a classic. It brings so much more to the assassin experience, with new weapons, new locations, and a fresh, well written story creating a well deserved sequel. Once again you take on the role of Desmond, but this time you play through the memories of Ezio Alditore. Ezio is a young lad who finds out his father was an Assassin all along, not a banker, and everyone else seems to know it but him. He finds out after a tragic turn of events, and now hes on a mission to get revenge. Little does he know, there is a force pushing him along behind the scenes. Its a beautiful game, and quite fun at that. Buy it, play it, love it.
