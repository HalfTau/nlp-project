Its Such A Good Game especially because it came out in 2009!! !So much fun, if you dont want to play the story theres a sort of open world, where you can do what you want. There are also some side quests. And you can hire some mercenaries and hookers to distract the guards! The storyline is also good but you have to pay attention if you want to understand it.With everything said, its a very good game and a must buyer!
