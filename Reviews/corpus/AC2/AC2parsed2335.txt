Cant play the game cause some Ubisoft service is unavailable. It didnt even state you couldnt play the game offline when buying. Last time I bought a game from Ubisoft, that I never got to play cause of a loading bug, they replied to only one of my many mails saying since I allready have pressed play, they wouldnt refund allthough it couldnt be played. Ubisoft gets another vote for worst gamecompany, and Ill have to never play their games again. RIP Heroes of Might and Magic Hehe and funniest part is I cant review it without 5 min playing.... Have to look at service unavailable screen for another 4 mins...
