Assassins Creed 2 was a game I wanted to try and love. It looked very cool, amazing and interesting.Sadly, I ended up dropping it before finishing it up.It kinda got bland and boring too much menial labor for little reward.There are cool costumes and world, but theres not enough to do in the world. Enough anything fun, anyway.The weapons wound up disappointing me after I got them to the maxlevel. At least having that as a thing to thrive for, would be something to keep people playing.It just gets a bit boring at some point. You stop caring about the characters and moving from one side to another in a big city becomes tiring and mindnumbing.The story and characters arent particularly interesting, and even if theres a fun character they dont end up getting enough scenes and time.The combats a bit boring and repetitive too many same enemies to fight and kill.Jumping down on someone to kill thems pretty fun, but after a while it loses its charm, sadly.If its being sold for a cheap price, go for it and try it out. Maybe youll like it.I recommend rushing through the game so you dont end up having your will to finish it up sucked out of you by menial labor and side stuff.
