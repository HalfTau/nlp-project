These games are all the same, so my recommendations will all be the same.The world we get to assassin in are quite nice and great at representing these ancient cityscapes. That said, the storyline is bad in every game, and the games try their best to make them as historically inacurate as possible. PC port is terrible  fair at best. Just dont buy them.
