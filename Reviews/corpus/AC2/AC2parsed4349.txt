My favourite Assassins Creed game of all time. Ive played all but Syndicate and Chronicles and going back to this one just feels like I am playing Assassins Creed. The story of this game, the art style, the movement. You feel immersed in the world of Assassins Creed when you play this. Assassins Creed was great but I felt more at home in a sense with this game. Its not boring and clunky.
