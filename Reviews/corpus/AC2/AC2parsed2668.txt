This is a fantastic game ruined by UPlay.The improvements made upon ACI are brilliant, not only has the graphics taken a bit of a leap but the gameplay additions just make this game far more memorable than the first one.Continuing the AC storyline Desmond finds himself in renaissance Italy. I personally find this on eth best backdrop for any of the AC games and I find that this one ahs far more gameplay involved with it also.I highly rate this game but only if UPlay was removed. I had to go about fixing UPlay itself as it will not work on Windows 8.1, Having to do this automatically ruins the setup of this game. However just rating the game, I have to recommend it.
