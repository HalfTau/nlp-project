Takes all the good things from the first game, and leaves most of the bad things. The action flows quite well, but its unfortunate that to give the game name credit seemingly all you do is assassinate people, with the occasional mission to run around for a while.Guard behaviour is at least greatly improved over the first game, and guards wont go running after you just because youre in a hurry to get somewhere.
