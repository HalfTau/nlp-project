I just started getting into the AC series not too long ago and so far this has been my favorite out of the three I have played thus far. The story is solid and the missions are fun as well as challenging. I will say that I did not like how the controls where portrayed since they do not show you what the binding is to the picture. However, after playing for awhile, you never needed to go back and look since you got used to it. I really enjoyed the game and the story kept me interested the entire time... and lets not mention you get to rumble with the pope something you wont get to do in any other game. If you love Adventure, a good story, and getting into trouble I recommend this to you.
