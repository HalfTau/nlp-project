This game has really pretty grafics, a jaw dropping storyline, awesome assassination possibilities and authentic buildings from 500 years ago. The crowd is the most interactive crowd i have ever seen in a game! i can spend a lot of time just messing around with people. GO BUY assassins creed 1 first, because that game is almost as awesome as this!
