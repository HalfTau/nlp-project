I ended up unloading a lot of time into this game. The world is big and plenty of things to do. In 2013 the graphics and the world are dated but still holds a fine beauty and thrill. The game play is solid for the most part. There were many frustrations at times with the controls on a KB/M a game pad would probably be a wise decision for this game that drove me up the wall at times but about 8090 of the time playing it worked alright. It works perfectly fine with a KB/M but a game pad would be recommended if you have one. Story wise this is an absolute treasure to have been told. If you have a few bucks to spare Id say its a fine investment of a game that took me 19 or so hours to beat without doing many of the secondary objectives. I focused primarily on the story and its a large one that will be fun to experience.
