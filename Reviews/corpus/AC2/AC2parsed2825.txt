Marvellous game, mostly due to its got loads to do with the Renaissance Italy the period of the Borgias acsending to power which makes it a nice historical backgrownd plus theres the inimitimble Ezio with all the remacable skills. The scenery is amazing. Great story , great architecture and a seemingly endless game, only seemingly though. But dont get frustrated! Therere such a lot of them out there already! Although my fav has always been the Italian thread. Thank you all. Totally recommended. Best adventure ever. I ONLY WISH THE REST OF THE EPIC SAGA WAS AVALIABLE ON MAC TOO. Makes it much more comfortable. Please consider.
