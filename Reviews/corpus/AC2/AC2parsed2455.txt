This is a hard gamethe underground dungeons are pretty hardHowever,there is an immense satisfaction when you get all the statues of the Gods and you see them in all their gloryplus the 10000 gols they provideI feel that the rewards should be 10x more for the statues of the Great Gods like Apollo,myself and Diana my sisterAlso renovating the city gets you lots of money every 20 minutes so it is worth it to invest there and skip the useless weapons and not so useless armor upgradesThe first true open world and exploration gamea little bit dated now but an excellent game for Artemis my sisterok,even with cheat codes there are some missions which are incredibly buggy and hardyou get into a memorynot sure if here or on Brotherhood where the parkour is much easier as you have allies to help you all the time where I cannot jump and make love to a beautifull girl wating for me in a tower because the jump platforms are too small and I have to jump on an angle...anayway great game
