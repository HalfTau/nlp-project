Some Pros  consCampaing is very long and good. But some missions are repetive.Protagonist is one of the best in AC.Other characters are very fun and good too!Assassin tomb missions.Sneaking and assassinating guards is always fun!Combat system is ridiculously easy when you master it.............................spearmen and brutes are only little bit harder enemies.Parkour on roofs is very fun.But controls are not best in this game.You can beat up Pope in final mission!ALLAHU AKBAR!
