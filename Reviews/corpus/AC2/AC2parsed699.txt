Assassins Creed II is a very special game for me.It is the first AC game I playedand it was exactly the game that made me love Ubisoft.The story,the parkour,the music,the city and the imagination of it made me feel like that it was the type of 3A Ive been looking forward to play.Glad to see Assassins Creed Origins being announced at E3. Fortunately the ancient Egypt is a perfect theme for Assassins Creed.I hope we will see great chages in it.
