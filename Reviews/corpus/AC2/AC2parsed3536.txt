Here is what you will experience after buying the game.1 After you download and start the game, you will be rerouted and a Uplay client will be downloaded.2 You will be forced to register a Uplay account if you want to play.3 After you register the account, the Uplay client will crash. It will continue to do so everytime you start it.4 To solve this, you will need to Uninstall Uplay from your PC, restart and reinstall the latest Uplay client from the Ubisoft site.5 You will now be able to start AC2, and register the game.6 If you are using the Controller as recommended, you will soon realize the controls are messed up and you will have difficulty getting it to work.7 The only way I managed to get the controller to work was by downloading these files and putting them in the Ac2 directory.8 Now you are ready to start the game.Playing this game requires you to go through the Uplay client even though you are using the Steam client. Starting it from Steam routes you to the Uplay client. You will need to register a Uplay account, which you will as you already paid for the game.I have not finished the game and so am not in a position to review the game itself. Just thought you should know this before purchasing any AC games on Steam.
