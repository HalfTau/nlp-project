All Ubisoft games NOT WORKING, after recent update of Uplay. It has been over a week, ubisoft support has not replied me yet. Dont bother with ubisoft / uplay games.Summary Installation. uplay error on  window 8. Solution Run as administrator / set compatiable in window 7 mode Movement control is more freely when jumping / in air, making it more difficult to jump from AB than AC 1  The start menu took time to adapts to, after playing AC1. The camera switching is really bad. Venice / Florence storylines may be too long.The story is finely written.Missions are no longer about repeating like in AC1 Graphic is soooo much better. Especially with the Eagle Vision view. No more blur The system of money exchange is kindly considered. Money was not a concern once making investments into the city.Casual playing, 100 completed around 37 hours.Difficulty of completion Average / NormalBought through Steam Summer Sale. Worth it. Recommended.Note Lucy had a plastic surgery. I miss Altair ...who is afraid of water
