In my opinion, the best AC title to date sorry Origins, I love you very much but ACIIs still on top. The graphics may be outdated for some more nitpicky players, and AC1 actually has better graphics at least, in my opinion, but ACII still manages to be an incredibly immersive experience. Its main locations Firenze, Venezia, Forl, Monteriggioni and San Gimignano have their own characteristic aura and their own charms and even soundtrack. Firenze is passionate, colorful and vibrant. Venezia is colorful but at the same time it retains a dreamy feel to it. Forl is gloomy and humid. Monteriggioni feels like home, not only because it is the headquarters of the Assassin Order, but because its warm and welcoming. San Gimignano is a small but busy medieval city, and feels imponent. I have personally been to Firenze and Venezia before playing the game and Im being serious when I say that the game brought me back to those cities.Storywise, its very compelling. There was no moment in which I felt like the story was dragging out. And unlike other AC titles, ACII is a game that lets you become attached to the secondary characters. They have their own story and character development.It surely is not as good as Brotherhood graphically or gameplaywise in Brotherhood you have many more combat and weapons options, however I do think that ACII is the best game out of the two. Brotherhood has far more side content also very much varied, but the main story is just not as compelling as ACIIs.ACII is a classic, not only for Assassins Creed fans, but for any gamer who enjoys a great game. If you havent played it yet, do give it a try. If youre too scared of spending money on something youre not sure youre going to like like me, watch a gameplay or two on Youtube, and see if youd like to take on the experience yourself. I did it that way and found so many things on my own that those gameplays had never shown. It was totally worth it.
