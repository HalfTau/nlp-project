Nothing is true and everyhting is permitted...exept for not owning this game. This is the second game from the Ac series. The story follows Ezio Auditore da Firense as he becomes an assassin to avenge his familys death, uncovering a secret conspiracy at the same time. This game expands grately on the first game addding an economy system, more wepons and makeing the game a bit less repetetive. If you are looking to start the Ac series then II is the seccond best option.
