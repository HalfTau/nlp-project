As a fan of the assisns creed franchise, I must say that this is my favorite game. The story is memorable, the character is interesting and the enviornment really gets to you. FOr the game is a 10 out of 10. no doubt that ubisoft really put a great effort in this game and probably we will see a lot of  games of this franchise.
