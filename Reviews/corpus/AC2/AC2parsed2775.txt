EDIT25 06 2015After playing for around 2h the game decides to crash after accepting a mission called No man left behind... so seeing a window informing me with save sync info im not affraid of losing progress, right?? ?WROG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG Dr. Cox SCRUBSIM BACK AT MISSION ASSASSINATE EMILIO BABARGIO JUST LIKE THE LAST 3 H OF GAME PLAY NEVER HAPPENED...PEZZO DIUPLAYNO I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONERANT ALERTUPlay ... cant run the game through steam because of it but you can when you open Uplay first from the c/programfiles/ubisoft/uplay.exe file... i dont need another steam/origin type of software asking me permission to use my network or sending anonymus t to ubisof,  juggling the mentioned before 2 is enough hustle as it is...RANT OVEROn the plus side the game is a big improvment over the 1st title would recommend it, but it is handicaped by Uplay that you are forced to use even when u purchased the game on steam...
