I loved the 1st AC. But this one is an all new level of amazing. The plot is absolutly emersive. The graphics are stunning for 2010 standards. All in all, i am now completly in love with the AC series. I have already started AC Brotherhood when i was writing this and i see the story really ties up. Ezio is a very complete character, and his world is stunning. The end of the game is awsome and gets you really hooked up to the saga. Awsome game!PS Took me 25h to finish this campaign including side missions. But if wasnt on a road to Origins i guess it could be stretched to some solid 35h.i recomend you to not only buy this, but di has i did, buy them all!
