Game is decent.  But there are still game breaking bugs even though its been 8 years since it has been released.  Ubisoft support is crap.  All they tell you is that the information is sent to the development team and thats it.  They even tell you that you wont receive another response.  So basically, the game is bugged and some random team knows about it.  But the game will never be fixed.  Wasted a lot of time collecting feathers.  Got to 90/100.  Even though I picked up the 91st one, it didnt register.  The feather is not there anymore, but my inventory is still saying 90/100.  Reloading the game doesnt help.  And Ubisoft support is useless as I already explained.  Searching online showed me that this is a known issue from 8 years ago when the game first came out.  Plenty of time to have been fixed by now.
