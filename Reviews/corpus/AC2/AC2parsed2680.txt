This game is the first Assassins Creed Game I played, and I am not at all disappointed. The story is amazing, and the graphics dont fry the PC while still looking pretty good. I like the fighting system and the different quests. The only downside is that I had to install Uplay, then uninstall it, restart the computer, reinstall uplay and then I could finally play. While Uplay is a nuissance in the beginning, once its set up, you dont have to bother with it anymore. Just make sure you dont have the money equipped when you are trying to assassinate a guard from behind.
