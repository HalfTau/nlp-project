Once i got the game, i downloaded Uplaybut it didnt work, I looked on the help page, it told me to restart my PC bearing in mind that I copied the code, which was now deleted, the computer came back on and it worked and then i had to insert the code which is now deleted so i couldnt, I have tried every single way but they didnt work, so the next thing i did was request a refund on steam, steam looked at it and verified it but when i look on steam it says 0.00 9.99 pending, so it says it has verified it, which is a lie but when i try to open up AC 2 Deluxe Edition it says PURCHASE, so steam have took my money, says they were going to put it back, which they havent and whats worse, I cant even try to open the game im trying to fix. I play games on Steam almost everyday and i love steam so can you please give me my 9.99 back or return the game, Thanks.
