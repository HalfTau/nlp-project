Took me 45 minutes to get into the game.  Get through the first cutscene and the game freezes. No fix that I found ws worth my time to try, I could torrent the game in the time it would take to get this to work.  Im welcome to trying it out, someone let me know if Im doing something wrong.0/10, great lying down on the animus table simulator
