Assassins Creed 2 was made close to two years after the original game. And its really hard to describe it without going into what the game improved upon AC1.AC2 introduces a lot of things to make the world much more interesting. The sidequests are significantly more varied and dynamic. The guard AI more competantly follows the player and checks nearby hiding spots. The guards themselves come bearing different weapons and tactics to attack the player with. Assassinations can now be completed in several different ways. They added an economy to the world that not only allows you to customize your equipment and outfit but also utilize coins as a means of distraction. To top it all off general pathfinding and movement is a lot faster and more pleasant.AC2 in general is just a really pleasant sandbox game, and one thats worth playing for that. Its an effective mesh of well designed mechanics and polish, and theres little wonder why people consider it the best game in its series.
