While I am sure this works fine on a console, it is just not meant for PC, massive incompetence of whoever wrote the PC code for the game. For example, in competent games like Far Cry 3 it says  Press space or press x whereas this POS says  press the leg button. What the hell is the leg button? Massive confusion,  graphics, highly overrated game. I am happy I only spent 5 dollars on this, otherwise I would demand a refund from Steam. Thats how frustrating the controls are.
