Good game but the last sequence was just too easy. I got the feeling that they made that last part of the game just like if they were making the final of a movie. You just sit and watch whats happening. But its a very interesting story and the scenarios are just amazing. I love Italy and I need to visit Florence and Venice so badly. Cant wait to have Brotherhood installed to explore Rome!
