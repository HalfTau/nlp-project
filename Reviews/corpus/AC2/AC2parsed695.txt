This game is drastically better than the first in the series but still lacks something needed to make it fun for me. I cant quite put my finger on it but I found myself frustrated and angry the majority of the time while playing this title.Much like its predecessor, the controls are wonky and annoying when you use a keyboard which leads to some frustrating moments when you are up against the clock or trying to chase after someone that you cant fall too far behind.Also like its predecessor, the combat is fun to watch but extremely slow paced and makes the game feel like it is dragging on longer than it needs to.The story is fun though and the voice acting is pretty good. The map and environment looks a lot better than the first game in the series but to make it run smooth I had to enable Max Prerendered frames  4 in my control panel. The mouse movements never really felt properly smooth to me but that is a minor annoyance.All in all, the game is a huge improvement over the original in the series but to be honest I didnt like it enough to recommend it to anyone. I would only say you should play it to get the story experience from it so that you can understand the sequels better.
