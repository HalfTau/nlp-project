Assassins Creed 2 is imo either the best game in the series or the second best behind Brotherhood. The storytelling is compelling and the writing really works. Even though its a story of revenge like weve seen countless times before, its welldone enough that I dont see that as a drawback. Besides, the overall AssassinsTemplars plot of the series adds some spice.The main story is definitely the most compelling part of the game, but that doesnt mean the rest isnt good. Itll take a good while before you run out of things to do in this game, though some of those things may end up being climbing every viewpoint in the game and obsessively collecting feathers.When I play it, the part of the gameplay I enjoy most is freerunning and climbing around the various cities you visit  which is something I personally think is very important works well in an Assassins Creed game and this is part of the reason why I consider ACII one of the best games in the series.
