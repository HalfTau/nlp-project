You arent missing anything special. All the good qualities are drowned out by the overly repetitive gameplay.Combat consists of you being surrounded by the same copy paste mooks the whole game, which you can only effectively dismiss with countering. Bosses are underwhelming, and the wide arsenal of weapons other than the gun!? are entirely superfluous.Youll be doing a lot of tedious walking and cutscene watching, seeing as you cant skip the nearly pointless conversations. The citydevelopment minigame felt downright insulting, forcing me to return because apparently theres a ing cap on the amount of money I can fill my coffers with. What ing commie horseis that? I can make as much money as I ing please you insufferable .Your reward for sticking it out and sloging through this hot mess is a completely nonsensical ending that breaks the 4th wall by having the ai cyber computer god talk to the player in cryptic riddles that make no sense.The cities are all immensely sprawling, but this only works against the game as it feels bland and uninteresting. Youll be forced to backtrack to and from randomized points on the map just to pad the game out a common problem for Ubisoft games.Exploring the sometimes isolated tombs has to be the highlight. I love the parkour puzzles in those sections. What a total badass.Sadly this game isnt worth the price of admission, let alone your time.
