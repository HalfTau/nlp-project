The first Assassin Creed game Ive ever played and arguably one of the best, AC2 is an excellent open world action game. While the Desmond Miles timeline is a little boring, its Ezio and renaissance Italy that really steals the spotlight here. This game really pulls you in the enviroments atmosphere much more that the first game and the combat is quite solid. The graphics can be alittle oudated, but its still really good, and this is the perfect game to get started in the fanchies before they milk it away, lolIn my opinion, this is the third best assassin creed game to dated.
