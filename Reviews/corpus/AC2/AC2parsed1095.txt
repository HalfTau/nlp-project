Simply amazing, what a wonderful experience.Pros Parkour and fighting mechanics have been expanded extensively from the first Wonderful story line digging deeper into the mystery of the Templars, Assassins and pieces of Eden If youre a collector nut this has a ton of them to search high and low for Wonderful visuals from the environment and its people Nods back to the first game Great dialogue and soundtrackPersonal complaints/thoughts I didnt find Ezio the most interesting assassin to play as but as I played more of the story his development throughout the years as a harderened assassin by the end of the game gave him more importance taking upon the mantle of his father. I still prefer Altair to Ezio that being that hes already an established assassin who everyone knows about as an assassin but not his name other than the people in the brotherhood. The one thing that put me off is everyone knew Ezios name and who he was with his getup, there really was no point to him wearing the assassins outfit other than paying dues to his father and family. Ezio felt like a very rookie assassin to me, it really bothered me that I felt 80 of the game I was just avenging his familys losses out of revenge and you were put though the learning process of Eden, Templars and the Assassin brotherhood.Bringing power back to the people and ridding each area of corruption had its satisfaction on its own and felt great knowing you made a difference to the areas you visited making Italy a better place again. It is a bit silly however you are given capes of recognition but simply climbing a rooftop is considered a crime? I understand if the guards attack you with the cape if you have killed a civilian or another guard but the cape itself is supposed to be an entitlement for your services to the city and its people so why be targeted for climbing or accessing restricted areas?I dont like collecting coupious amounts of items for such little gain and this game has a ton of them, little more less than the first game but still a lot.I didnt particularly like having to read subtitles for half english and half Italian spoken dialogue, I do appreciate it added depth to cutscenes and learned some Italian here and there but I couldnt help but get lost a few times or spaced out. I thought in the first game all was translated to English when Desmond asked Lucy. Perhaps things have changed I guess.8/10. Not bothered to collect the other assassins stone tablet things at this point in time, maybe after I finish AC 3 to access Altairs armor.
