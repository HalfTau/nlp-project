REALLY great game! Youll fall head over heels for the gameplay, the history, the characters, and the atmosphere. AC makes it so that you really need to think, and make quick decisions, like choosing the right path to avoid some guards, or making sure not be seen in the crowd while making your way towards a target.I also recommend the AC games, they are all just as good as this one!
