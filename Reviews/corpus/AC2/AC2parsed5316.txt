Equally good looking as its predecessor AC2 features a much longer maybe a bit too long and more interesting story based in medieval Italy. The basic game mechanics are the same but they managed to make the missions far less repetetive than in AC1 by breaking missions into smaller subtasks and weaving cutscenes into them. Another new thing is the possibility to equip your assassin with various weapons and accessories. If you liked AC1, you wont be disappointed with this game.
