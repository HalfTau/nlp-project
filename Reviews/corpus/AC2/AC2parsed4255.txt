In short the best game ive played up to now basta! This is a real love baby from Ubisoft you can see and feel all the effort that is put into designing en developing the story and gameplay.Not only lots of action, but also very educational too. The story evolves in Renaissance Italy and is based on real cities, buildings, persons and historical events. All important buldings and persons are in the database of the game with all details about architecture and what a person achieved or did. Very interesting and very, very well done.Lately i was watching the Giro dItalia and the buildings/roofings/cathedrals were exactly like in ACII!Theres tons of side missions, an open world, beautiful graphics, great voice acting, great drama and violant fights. This game can be placed in several categories, not only action. You ride horses, fly in Leonardo da Vincis plain, sail boats etc.This game is for me a 9 out of 10 too bad there are some bugs towards the end that affect gameplay.Still this game is a must have its brilliant. Go get it.This is an addendum 2 years later. Ive played several new games the last 2 years, but still ACII is one of the best ive ever played.
