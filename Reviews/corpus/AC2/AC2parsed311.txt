Surely the best Assassins Creed game in the series, it has the best main character Ezio is just very charismatic, interesting and you feel with him. The story is also pretty good, just end rather aprubt. The control mechanics are also the best in the series, and just lets you really cntroll the character and doesnt let him climb ever single wall there is around except the one you want to climb  Im looking at you Black Flag. Just sometimes the perspective changes a bit weird. The graphics surpisingly aged pretty well and Florence and all the old italian cities still look beautiful. Really recommend the game, go and buy it.
