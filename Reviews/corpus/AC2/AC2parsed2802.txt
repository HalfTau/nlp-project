Worth it, old and on the cheep, like most of Ubisofts stuff, although Unity seems a rip off there,  As for this its an ok story, and a slow battle discovery system, less buggy than modern. But that is how it is, more buggy every sequel. Maybe not Rogue. Way too nice to Lorenzo Medici, course its 1/3 of the Story.
