This is a great game. It keeps upgrading the formula from the first game, as we travel to amazing locations at Italy in the XVI century. The graphics are very good, also the design is superb. I like a lot the first Assassins Creed. That is one of my favorite games ever. I like as much AC 2. Ezio Auditore as a character is a fine piece of work. Likeable, you follow his story with interest. The combat is the best thing you can imagine if you like the AC combat philosophy. Assassins are unstopables, so the combat simulates the power of a killing machine. If you want something negative, there is a physics glitch on corpses killed on roofs that was fixed on the next game of the saga. This game is real value. 10/10
