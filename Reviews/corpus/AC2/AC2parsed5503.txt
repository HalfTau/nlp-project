Assassins creed 2 is one of the best stealth games I have played within the last 4 years. If you like actionstealth games you should play Assassins creed 2. If you hated the first Assassins Creed you really should play Assassins Creed 2. This game has done what the first assassins creed fail to do polish combat, customization, and side content. The combat now feels way more believable because enemies actually simultaneously strike you, unlike the first one where they took turns. The variety of weapons and items available to use also increase the fun factor in this game. I feel like a ninja when I use my smoke bombs to evade my enemies. I feel like a modern assassin with my throwing knives, and I feel like bat man when I use my flying machine. Lots of content to be had, Ive been playing for over 2 dozen hours, and still havent beaten this game to 100 completion yet. The historical realism in the storytelling also makes the game very believable. Good Game. BUY
