The best Assassins creed game. It is an enjoyable play, but no more. It is nothing really special, and is rubish compared to games such as Tomb raider2013 or Skyrim. Still worth playing though. Problem is, once  youve already played a few assassins creed games, you will get fed up of this one very quickly, as all the games have pretty much the same storyline, and playin as an assassin gets very annoying very quickly.THIS IS A GOOD GAME, BUTIT IS DESIGNED FOR PLAYING ON A CONSOLE NOT ON PC, AND  AS A RESULT IT IS  EXTREMELY DIFFICULT YO PERFORM SOME OF THE PARKOUR SEQUENCES! furthermore, the tutorial stages in the game tell you how to play the game on a console, so you will have to waste some time reading the controls on the main menu. UBISOFT NEED TO UPDATE THIS GAME FOR PC!
