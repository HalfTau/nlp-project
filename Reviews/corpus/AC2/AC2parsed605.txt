Ive played the game for almost 15 hours now and I love the story and the design but theres one thing bothering me very much. Ive never raged that much of an AC game ever before. I really hate it that, for example, when you enter the Family Grave at the Villa, you need to parkour your way to the end. Seems fun right? Well, the game just turns the camera right at the moment you want to jump, so that the chance is very big that you jump against a wall and fall all the way down and need to start over again. And than youre down there, and the timer is going on, second time, you make the first jump but at the second it turns AGAIN. So you fall down again. And that for like 30 times. Oh, and overall I really hate the freerun system in this AC, never hated it so much in any other AC, and Ive played 5 or 6 of them. Despite that, I really reconmend playing this game.
