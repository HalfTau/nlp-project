I dismissed AC for a long time on the basis that it was a painfully obvious console port which simply didnt work at all with a Mouse  Keyboard. Then I played it with a controller  which makes the game not only bearable but actually very enjoyable. It is not a perfect game by any means, but leaping about rooftops and assassinating Italians is great fun. The storyline seems quite good and there are a lot of side missions although more than a few of them are classic copy pasted fetch quests which add a bit of depth. The game world is not the most immersive I have ever seen but it is nevertheless very much alive and the atmosphere is well conveyed. A lot of the game revolves around platforming, which is for the most part a fluid and enjoyable experience although occassionally Ubisofts daft One button does 200 things! design philosophy means I end up leaping backwards 15 metres when I actually wanted to silently climb up to the next windowledge. Overall I think it is a very solid action adventure game with a decent world and a good storyline, but it must be played with a controller or the game will offer only frustration.
