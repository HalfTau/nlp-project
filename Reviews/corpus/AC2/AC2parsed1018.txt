Honestly, I mediocre game for me. I get the hype and I understand that this game deserves to be considered one of the best games made, but honestly I didnt enjoy it that much. Overall, I would still recommend this game, because I realize that many of my friends love it, and other may have a better time with their experience. But I honestly found flaws with the parkour system, because often times, it just doesnt work out for me, and I find myself constantly jumping off roofs and high buildings automatically, leading to my demise, or a restart of the mission. Also, I feel that the combat system just doesnt offer what an average gamer would want simple, efficient, and easy when combatting crowds of guards. But overall, really great storyline, great character designs, and very indepth feel to the game. 7/10
