This is how the first one shouldve been in the first place. The graphics are great except for the faces maybe and the gameplay is fun. There are more diverse missions this time around and you get to spend more time in the Animus instead of walking around in real life with Desmond. Go get it if you like third persion action games, this one is a must and after that play Brotherhood.Rating 90/100
