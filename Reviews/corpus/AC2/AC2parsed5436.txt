It was a great storyline, with a good amount of history and rich character development. Just challenging enough without being excessively hard. Using the controversial timeline of Florences history was ingenious on behalf of the writers. The ending was awesome and completely worth it. All in all a 10 out of 10 on my personal scale. Definitely a game I will remember for a long time to come. Cant wait for the third installment, AC 3 Revelations.
