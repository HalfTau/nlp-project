Only a few hours in, and I am having such a blast...This truly IS everything the first game wasmore ways than i could have imagined.Absolutely recommend it!Every aspect that was also in the first game is so vastly improved upon that its stupid...stupid good that is.You no longer die instantaneously if you fall into bodies of water...because Ezio can swim. He can also row gondolas!All parkour elements are better in every way, so is the fighting!Absolutely love it and would recommend it to everybody, even a sheep with downs...
