I really want to like this game, but this is probably the worst form imaginable to play it in. First of all, this game desperately requires a controller, but the mac version does not support one. It barely even supports my keyboard. The controlls are incredibly clunky. I have literaly spent 90 of my time on this game trying to get it to work. Not to mention the fact that it requires UPlay, one of the greatest sins humanity has ever commited. This is a good game, but it is the worst port to pc Ive ever seen.
