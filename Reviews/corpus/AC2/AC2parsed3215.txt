You may notice Im writing a review with only ten minutes logged on this game. This is very misleading because I actually have zero minutes logged on this game. The reason for this UPLAY!!!!!!!. Uplay launcher has stopped working. Im sure the game is incredible. However, I give it this thumbs down and an endless number of more thumbs down because of Ubisofts garbage Uplay partnership. This trend has got to be one of the most ridiculously pointless things that has ever happened to video gaming. Get it together, Ubisoft...
