Every year, there are many games that do a few things right. There are games that have compelling stories, amazing aesthetics, engaging gameplay, or other elements that make a game great. Few times, however, are there games that can combine all these elements into an experience that transcends the medium itself. Assassins Creed 2 is a game that almost always has been and perhaps always will be the best game Ive ever played. This game is the heart and soul of Patrice Delisets design, working in conjuction with an unforgettable score and compelling storytelling. If youre not sold yet, I cant help you.
