This is a fantastic game, not as great as the next game, Assassins Creed Brotherhood, but by golly, it sure was an adventure. Who wouldve thought I would just play the game for the storyline, the action, assassinations and etc, just so I can remember the whole game start to finish, all to begin playing ACBrotherhood, was it worth my whole Christmas break back in 2011,  no, but when I got to finally play AC 3 later, well worf.
