One of the games that I finished 100.Assassins Creed 2 Deluxe Edition begins where the first part ended. If you are new to the series, I suggest to play with Assassins Creed Directors Cut Edition first because of the story.Where to begin... History is playground.This game is one of the most enjoyable game Ive ever played. The music is a masterpiece, I will buy the OST on Google Play. The cities are full of life, the environment and graphics feels real. It is now impossible for me to go outside without mentally assessing climbing routes and synchronization points over all the buildings in the historical downtown of my city.The second game and sequels are better than the original, with easier controls, better gameplay, and more fluid combat. Only the respawn system is a step back compared to the original Assassins Creed, it doesnt make any sense in this game.Although Ezio is probably one of the best and wellwritten characters in gaming history, Im a little disappointed in the last mission. After perfectly built large cities Ubisoft made a mistake to let Ezio go to Rome, which was only a limited wall, a tiny part of the Vatican.Luckily the end of the game isnt screw up, I cant wait to continue the story.This is not just a game. The cities has historical buildings, events, and people. In the game you can access information about the characters life, the story of the place you are. You can find hidden signs to explore the truth. You can access side missions, and you can collect and purchase items.All things considered this game is probably one of the best of the Assassins Creed games, I highly recommend to buy it. Even it with Uplay.
