Great game, absolutely blows the first game out of the water, the main character is a nice change of pace from Altair. The new weapons, fighting techniques, gadgets and setting really make this one a lot of fun. The story is much better in this one by explaining more of the back story to us, the voice acting is top notch and the game still holds up really well to this day.
