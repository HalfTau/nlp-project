Generally a good game, consequent continuation of the first one. Finally our assassin learned some moves so much needed before like attack from above. The Only thing I didnt really like was an ending  I think at some point it was overdone.Finally  I think I preferred the first game better  but only because I could feel the XIIth centrury Holy Land somehow better than XVth century Italy... Personal preference Recommended of course
