Just bought a couple of AC titles II, Black Flag, Syndicate and quickly prefered this one from a flavor and story perspective over the more lush graphics of syndicate. The political and personal drama stories unfold and the locations are ripe with flavor...also the mix of italian with english and the clear latin emotional over rational cultural flair nicely captured.Only complaint is that it does not support xbox controller like the later titles.If feels like a daVinci code story and the quests to find codex and assassins tombs very flavorable...
