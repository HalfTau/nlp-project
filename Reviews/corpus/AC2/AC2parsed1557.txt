This is the game Assassins Creed should have been. Its smooth, quick, fun, and has a genuinely likeable and human character. Hes not as interesting as he might be, but neither are actual people. Whether shooting close to reality without consideration for whether reality is, itself, interesting can be called a good thing is a question that has been at the heart of literary analysis for generations, but for those who come in for the gameplay, which is excellent, the story will certainly not detract from it overmuch, and for those who come in for story, well... hopefully youll stay for the gameplay.
