Well, basically it was a story of another Assassin named Ezio. Yeah, I liked the story. Gameplay wasnt repeatetive like the previous one. Never felt boring to be honest. There was enough variety and twist in the gameplay. The control was a bit disturbing while playing with gamepad. Will not explain or summerize the story as I think, you should play to understand the deepness of the story. Wont long the review. Looking forward to play the next Assasins Creed game.Highly recommend this game if you are Assassins Creed fan or a rich story lover. Overall rating 8/10
