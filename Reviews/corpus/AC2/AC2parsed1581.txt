Its the first stealthbased game that Ive actually enjoyed, and Im not even done with it yet. I cant quite put my finger on just why I enjoy it, but theres a certain charm to the game. With an engaging storyline and moments of sheer badassery, this game is an easy thumbs up for me. I highly recommend it to all gamers.
