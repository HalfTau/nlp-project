I have nothing but good things to say about this game. It is one of the best games I have ever played. The story and gameplay are both fantastic! I wont spoil anything but I just want to say I really enjoyed the story. The game takes place in Italy during the Renaissance and it has great places to visit as you progress through the game. The game does not get boring after you finish the story. It has tons of side missions to do and interesting things to find scattered around the map. This game deserves a 9/10 just because its story and gameplay are AMAZING! I would recommend this game to anyone.
