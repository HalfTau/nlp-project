All the hard work that must have gone into making this classic game. Youd have thought somebody would have bothered to debug the control system. Keyboard and mouse support on OSX is flaky  lots of restarts required. And if youre intending to use a game controller, as is totally undowithoutable if youre intending to Ezio about with catlike grace, you can just forget about it. The App Stores Joystick Mapper wont get you anywhere for now, though the developer claims to be working on a workaround.Ubisoft oughta face up to the fact that they have, possibly by accident, made a video game which offers an occasional glimpse of The Sublime. Take some responsibility. Make this work. And see to it that were able to play in Italian with English subtitles. Us OSX people are heavily into that sort of thing. Show us some love.
