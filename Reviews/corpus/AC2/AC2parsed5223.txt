Definitely an improvement over the first one. Missions are more varied and the game has a larger sandbox element. The main thing I didnt like about it was learning the controls, since you have to check the controls in the options menu in order to figure out what the symbols mean. The locations were really cool, and I really liked the jumping puzzles in the assassin tombs. Game could get frustrating at times cuz Ezio would do the wrong move and that would ultimately end in your death, but it was a fun game overall, definitely worth playing. It took me 30 hours to finish it 100.
