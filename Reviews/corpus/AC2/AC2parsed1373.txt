This was the first Assassins Creed game that I played.  I got it on sale for 9.99. Totally worth the amount I paid. Ive played this game for 72 hours and I have not even finished all of the side quests and missions. This game was a big success to me, despite the fact that it launches through Uplay. I would recommend this game for its story and length of gameplay. If you take your time and not rush through missions.
