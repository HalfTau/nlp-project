This is the pinnacle of Assassins Creed. You start off with the new great and charming protagonist, Ezio Auditore. Because the protagonist is new, you can hop right in here and not lose too much information. The Story is amazing and keeps the game going at a good pace. The gameplay is very different from AC 1 less repetative, , no more mandatory synchs and the missions are very diverse. The atmosphere of the game is very special. Each location feels different and is easily recognizable. Combat is nice normal arkham style, while not as good as Brotherhood, it still feels nice.The worst thing about this game is one of the final missions, where before you can continueIf you want to try AC, get this one and nothing else.Great StoryBest AC ProtagonistLots of Improvement over AC 1Great AtmosphereHuge Open WorldHistorical But lets be honest, youre not going to read thatuPlayDLC is not worth itIts not Skyrim filled with contentLots of FillerIf not paced correctly, the ending is slowtldr 10/10 would assassin again
