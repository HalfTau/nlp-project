Assassins Creed 2 is a great game that still holds up today. While its graphics certainly havent aged as well as the original or Brotherhood, it still looks pretty good. The gameplay has been improved by the longhold in 2 when compared to AC with the addition of swimming. It also helps to have one of the best protagonists I have heard and seen in a video in a while. Ezio is a charismatic young man, and to avoid spoilers, something happens to him that causes him to seek revenge. The story is absolutely great, but this game is meant to go with both Brotherhood and Revelations. Overall Id give this game a 8/10. This is because while the game is quite well polished it does get a bit tedious near the end especially with the nonoptional DLC segment near the end which I wish was skippable. The DLC segments with Caterina felt like filler, which it honestly was. The DLC consists of two pieces, which altogether consists of twenty missions. A decent number of those missions are just assassination missions. Honestly if you could still get it Id suggest just getting the standard edition but since they have removed it off of steam you are required to get deluxe edition which isnt that bad. This game is definitely worth buying and should be bought with Brotherhood and Revelations.
