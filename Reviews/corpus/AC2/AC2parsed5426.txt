Just as good and better than the first game, the renisanace flare really sets this game in a different mode, the story is the best imho of any game in recent release with all the makings of a great interactive movie without any of the interactive movie t they have been trying to sell recently. Combat is fluid and intuitive, the PK is still top notch, a little hard to control with the keyboard suggest a controler. Nothing says badass quite like the AC series, a dutiful sequal. 10/10
