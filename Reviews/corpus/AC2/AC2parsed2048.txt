Assassins creed II is an action game. Developed by Ubisoft in 2009. It is a second part of story about Desmond Miles. In this part of Assassins Creed series you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Storry stars when ezio was young and didnt know nothing about assassins. But later his family father and brother are executed and he will uncover the secret of his father.He became an assassin.So I will start with gameplay. It is very easy to learn controls and complete the story. The story is not so difficult but it seem long if you do all secondary quests. The graphics and visual part of the game is very positive. The colours and environment are just great.9,5/10  I think that it is one of best games that can actionlovers play.
