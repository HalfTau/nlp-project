Assassins Creed IIProsAwesome StoryExcellent Parkour SystemFun and Creative MissionsExtremely Well Made CharactersConsReally Bad EndingToo Much Focus on Gaining Value to MonteriggioniAssassination Side MissionsThe game has a few flaws just like pretty much every other game out there but is still a really good and enjoyable game. In the end this game deserves 8.5/10 since the game is so excellently done with no time leaving you bored and the flaws that it has are no gamebreakers... Well the ending kind of is but you see my point!
