Forget Unity, This is perhaps the best made Assassins Creed game to date. Despite others moaning about it, Uplay worked first time for me! Perhaps it was because i purchased and played AC4  Black Flag before this one. Nevertheless, a working fix can be found on the Ubisoft website as far as Im aware. I highly reccomend!
