oh boy. Ive been playing this game for a week now and I cant get enough. the ammount of sidequests, collectibles, puzzles and other content is just amazing. easily the best 10 euro I spent in the last 6 months. the protag, ezio auditore da firenze is also very likeable. this game improves on the first one in absolutely every aspect. it requires uplay activation, though, and I had a little trouble with doing it, because steam was being an idiot and couldnt download uplay. I downloaded the client manually and registered the game it requires online activation the fist time you run it, but they lifted the always online DRM after players were really butthurt, works like a charm now
