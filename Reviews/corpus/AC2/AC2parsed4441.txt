I play through AC2 for 2 times, first time I followed the plotline and the second i try to diggout all side quest, hidden stories, hidden place, viewpoint, tombs codex and so on,  I rly find finish the plotline is just a start for this game, there are so many factors for you to explore, if u are a action game fan and are addict in doing puzzles, exploring in the open worlds and searing in maezs, this is the best game for u. and the story of Ezio is also very attractive. The controls of AC2 is humanized and ez to get familiar withcount out the direction button, only about 45 buttons are frequently used in game, and I play it using a PC with i5 core, 6G ram and there is no lag and frame loss. I bought ACB and ACR for a better view of the whole story of Ezio, also the story of the combat between assassians and crusade
