Evidently, I enjoyed the game enough to play it to completion however, I dont feel I can truly endorse it.Even with a good gamepad, the controls are unwieldy, which turned what should have been a fun freerunning romp into an unfortunate series of the player character leaping from ledges to his death whilst I attempted to sidle elsewhere.  Most of the game consisted of me screaming at Ezio to GO UP!! GO UP!!Control scheme aside, the game suffered from stale combat mechanics, repetitive tasks, boring assassinations dont bother sneaking about just make a bline for your target, do the deed, and run away frantically, and repetitive tasks.  For a game about assassins, there were disappointingly few stealth tactics.Finally, my biggest frustration with modern games was displayed prominently in Assassins Creed 2 Gameplay takes a backseat to the story.  If I wasnt stabbing those obnoxious lute players for my own twisted amusement, I was running to get from unskippable cutscene A to unskippable cutscene B... to unskippable cutscene C.  Frankly, I didnt find the story or its characters to be terrifically compelling.  For a nobles son, Ezio gains his aptitude for senseless killing suspiciously quickly.  And two games later, Im still not sure why the Templars and the Assassins are forever at war, but I am sure that I dont care.I know Im in the minority here, but AC2 is all about freethinking and individuality.  Or something.  I wasnt really paying attention.EDIT Oh, and for what its worth, I didnt have any problems with Uplay.
