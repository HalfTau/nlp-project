Okay, to bw honest I bought this on accident thinking it was with the older Ezio. However, I cannot complain about this accident... infact, Im thrilled that I accidently recieved this! The story is unbelieveably addictive, the time our protagonist is in is mind blowing, and the system is incredible!To be honest, I never enjoyed any side quests... but, the game makes me want to tackle anything that they throw at me!I mean, I cant be bias... but in my opinion I see nothing wrong with this game... well, except how we must download a silly launcher and must translate the buttons/moves... but this earned my 9.5/10! I would recommend this game if you are curious about Ezio and a great open parkour game
