Maybe Im missing something because this game has gotten really good reviews. However I noticed the following problems early onyou must hold three buttons simultaneously just to run. Not one, not two, but three. This is a cumbersome mechanic and I cant even tell you what the profile button does. the main tutorial for the control keys consists of a one minute review of your characters birth.at no point in the game does it actually say what key to press in the game to do something, sans the control mapping screen. Instead, for just about everything, from attacking to exiting out of a game menu, there is an icon which corresponds to what the control key does. So instead of telling you hit x or enter or whatever to do something it will tell you to hit the fist button or the legs button. Wow, I use the legs button to kick and run? The head button to taunt? Very helpful, game designers! I never would have guessed these things! Talk about being lazy!while scrambling up a wall, several times I could neither see the footholds and handholds, nor would my character figure out where they were. This made climbing the wall frustrating and several times my character jumped to his death instead of moving forward.youre pretty much thrust into the first few fights with little chance to adjust to the learning curve.
