Assassins Creed II offers a lot of gameplay and will keep you entertained for hours, the story is beautiful, the play style as well, overall better than the first Assassins creed, of course youve to play the first one to understand the playthrough.Whats also good but interests me the less is the graphics, theyre pretty great.I give it a 4/5.
