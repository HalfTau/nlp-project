Well, uPlay managed to be marginally less obnoxious than whatever broken DRM they had in AC1, so I actually got to play this one. Decent enough, but way too long even doing only partial collection stuff. The game was certainly ambitous but it also seemed pretty stale/uninspired in some areas, especially combat and the rather uninteresting use/nonuse of stealth. Ill be curious to see where the series goes though.
