Finally finished this game on PC. It is a dramatic improvement upon teh first AC. There are many more missions to do, the story is easier to follow, and the gameplay mechanics are much smoother overall. There are many more tricks Ezio can perform that you wished Altiar was able to do in the first AC. Highly recommend you picking this one up and playing if you are an AC fan!
