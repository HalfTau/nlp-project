The best Assassins Creed game to this day. A tragic story with a charming I mean come on he is Italian character. It is in every way an improvement to AC1 and you can feel that this was the AC Ubisoft wanted it in the first place. The music is excellent as expected because its from Jesper Kyd who also did the music for the Hitman series. The controls with M/KB are awkward but you can get used to it or use a X360 controller however it doesnt show you the button prompts. The combat can get dangerous and isnt simplified like in AC3 where you just have to tap the B button at the right time and take out a whole battalion, so you may take out enemies in stealth first or retreat with smoke bombs. There is a little bit of HP Reg but that doesnt help you much so you still need to use medicine AND repair your armor if its damaged otherwise you loose some needed HP Points you cant refill anymore. The Highlight for me was the Venice carnival part.
