Personally the AC series is probably one of my top favorite game series. I have played every AC game and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. However AC 2 is the best one so far because of its fantastic story, its revolutionary features that changed the series, and its just plain fun. Period. I would highly recommend this game as well as all the other AC games. If you enjoy them then Im happy to know that AC got more fans. If you didnt thats alright, its just not for you which is fine.
