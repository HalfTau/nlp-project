h1 Simply a great experience/h1Assassins Creed was a great game. Assassins Creed 2, though, was more than that. With it I truly got invested in the series. The game is set in Renaissance Italy and portrays that setting masterfully  from the political fights of the Medici to the bustling streets with vendors. Also, a high accent has been placed on the artwork of the period which is a nice touch to the overall experience.If you liked the first AC, youll love the second one. If you never played it, its still a good point to start from!
