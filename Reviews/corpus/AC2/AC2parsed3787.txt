I write it while still not finishing the game but the release although stable for the most part, the control feel akward  and frustrating espcially during the timed sequenceusing 360 controller, and there is some game breaking bugs here and there for some missions.I wish there was more meaning to the collecting, as its really ruin my expereince to work on the game for 100 and get almost nothign in return in most casesas for the game its mediocre but if you are in mood for some collecting its decent, really hate the historical part of the game as its feel more like bland background and the world  in itself feel quited dead in general and most of the time its made me cringe a lot more.on the graphic side its decent, faces feel weird  espcially with the low res textures for the body, but the world itself feel natural, espcially good work with the shaders on the different cities that give different atmosphere to them
