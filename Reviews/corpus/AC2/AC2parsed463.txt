I want to like this game, and I do for the most part, so thats why Im giving it a thumbs up... overall, its a great game and I love the series I own all of them but I dont know what it is. I guess it just boils down to the missions and story are just too repetitive and always on the verge of putting me to sleep...This game in a nutshell for me Oh.. we need to kill this dude... oh wait, this dude needs to die now... oh, and then theres his mean uncle, too. Kill him next... lets see... I guess you can kill this next guy, hes kinda a jerk. shrugs
