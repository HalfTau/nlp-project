Far better and superior to first game. Ezio is just more sympathetic character to play with and renaissance Italy  Florence and Venice are one of the best places you can visit in video game and also in reality too. The idea to have list of people to kill to get revenge for death of your family and slowly remove the names from the list and from their lives is satisfactory experience. Nicely combines real history and characters with made up stuff from the video game.
