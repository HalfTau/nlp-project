Say what you will about the repetition, Assassins Creed has always been about highly refined movement and control, crisp aesthetics, and a somewhat risky plot, by todays standards. Assassins Creed 2 improves on the original exponentially by adding useful collectables, an upgradable home and town, and a twisting narrative, while preserving the same great gameplay from the first game, with a few surprises. While the assassinations themselves are still a little disappointing, the architecture and setting makes for some of the most fun exploration youll get out of any game. One of the few games Ive been driven to complete 100!9/10, easily.
