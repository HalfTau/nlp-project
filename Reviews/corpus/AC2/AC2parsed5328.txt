An interesting revival of the Assassins Creed series.The storyline feels almost the same in aspects like  someone screws up and you gotta fix the mess, but that seems like a way to explain why you have to gain your skills.There are more interesting things happening in this version of Assassins creed as new weapons are introduced and you are no longer safe in haystacks but you gain abilities to counter all these new tricks.The sequel to this game is Assassins Creed Brotherhood which continues the plot after finishing this game.  Only Assassins Creed Brotherhood has multiplayer and that is seperate from the singleplayer.
