Do I recommend this game? Where is the Hell Yes button?If you are new to the series, this is a great place to start. The controls will be taught to you in the early stages of the game very clearly, unlike some other games in the franchise which teach some things but expect you to know others already. This is also a great entry to the story of the series if you dont feel like playing through the first one. this game is far superior to the original in pretty much every way.Ive owned this game for some years now and it was basically one of those games that were part of my backlog of games, most of which will never get played despite my intention to play them all. Im sooo glad that I decided to play this game over some others in that backlog of mine. The game still is visually pleasing, not yet too retro feeling This review written in 2015. I was still in awe of many of the visuals. More importantly though, this game has great gameplay, a great story, great characters, great acting and animation. This is the real deal, a gamers game. Stuffed so full of content, I didnt even do all the extra missions not even close and I spent 30 hours in this game enjoying every second. I really cant recommend the game enough. It starts slow and you might be bored for the first bit but trust me when I say that it gets GOOD and fairly quickly. I am now starting to play the next game in the series, Brotherhood, which picks up right where this left off in a very epic way. Make sure you sit at the start screen in these games for a minute or two before pressing start/enter to watch the opening cinematic. It wont play when you start a new game and the opening cinematics in these games are very good.
