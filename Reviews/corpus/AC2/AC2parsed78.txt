Pretty much Antonios Bandarss Zorro, but with more revenge, and Italy.A straight charming gem. Favorite of the entire series. Since its release the devs have been screaming Bigger World, More Gadgets, Excess that presentation, however this game was wonky, boxy, and broken, but its still the most loveable.
