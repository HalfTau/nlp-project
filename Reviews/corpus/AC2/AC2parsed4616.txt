Really a great game, even now in 2014 I would suggest this game to a friend. The gameplay is pretty good, the graphics are nice, even today, and the entire feeling of the game is really good.Presentation 8/10  Really feels like I am exploring areas of Italy. The game comes together nicely, sure some of the menus are slow to load and a little clunky and sure the options menu may be a hassle to get to sometimes, but that shouldnt spoil the game for you. The reason I didnt give this a 9 instead of an 8 is because of the horrendous control scheme.Graphics 9/10  Nowadays the graphics arent amazing, but they are still really solid. They looks pleasing to the eye.Sound 9/10  The music is perfect for Italy and sets the mood perfectly, that includes during fighting and exploring.Gameplay 8.5/10  I like the gameplay a lot, but since its a PC port, the controls can be really, really awkward. You also have to use your memory to remember the controls because instead of telling you, Press C to crouch for example, it will tell you Press the Foot Key to crouch. then you must remember what button you set as the foot key.Lasting Appeal 8/10  Decent replayability here, if you really like the story and just like the progression of skills and the game in general, you may want to replay this, maybe 100 the game. Either way, it should keep you busy for a long time as the average time for this game to be completed is around 18 hours, and thats not including the people who 100d the game.
