Intially I was turned off at the beginning due to the differences from the first, which I finished a few months before namely having to buy health and having to shop, but after going back to it I was able to get into it within an hour or two and really ended up enjoying it. It ended up being a lot more fun then the first, although I would have liked a more compelling story.
