Even if this takes a lot on assasins creed stories. I recommand not buying it if you want to enjoy assasinating or killing.Because its kinda old, graphics are not great. Almost same graphics as Dishonered 1. Parkouring is bad too. He is soooo slow compared with assasins creed 4 or syndicate. Also it doesnt like automatically finds its way e.g  when youre climbing the buildings, it doesnt go where I wanted to go. I would save up for black flag or syndicate. they are waaaay more better.
