I am unable to continue past The Race Challange, to get to the church roof first. This is because I either do not have enough time before desychronisation or there is to much desynchronised map around the path to the roof. I have spent almost an hour and a half trying to do this. If this was a result of a difficulty setting I could understand, if there was a way to end the current quest or challange, or exit the animus, or even go back to a previous mishion or manualy save and manualy load rather than this auto save auto load buisnessI like the graphics, I would say the graphics are excelent, I have only just started this game last night, looks like the story is going to be good as well, and from the programing techniques used in the game, and the graphical user interface, I would compare this to a medievil vershion of a final fantasy type game.Currency, shops, charicter interactions, plot changes, side quests, free running, challanges, mishions, charicter homes, upgrades, map areas, in game training etc...etc... this game has a lot going for it.I can only say if the company that made the game can not improve it, than maybe it can listen to technical suggestions from players of the game.Apart from that it is an excelect game to pass some time, and based on real events, you have the option to learn about italy and other places as well as the people and events that took place.Since it has a gore controal setting and parental controls, it is also suitable for older kids, a very good method for passive learning.
