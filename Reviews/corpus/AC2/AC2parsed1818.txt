Big fan Assassins Creed 1, but halfway through this game I realized that I was doing the same thing over and over and it got really boring.Looking at the further sequels to Assassins Creed, little seems to change, so unfortunately Assassins Creed lost me at II. Jokes on me though because I bought the entire set...
