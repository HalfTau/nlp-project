Salute, Claudia.This game is vastly superior to Assassins Creed. The combat feels a lot better and the environments are much better. The minigame of maintain the town feels rewarding, and the fetch quests to find feathers and things feel a lot better than finding Templar banners in AC1.My one complaint is that its a stealth game about assassintions, but there are some scripted sequences where you always get caught and always have to fight or escape from large groups of guards. I would have preferred if the game rewarded stealth gameplay by allowing you to bypass combat.
