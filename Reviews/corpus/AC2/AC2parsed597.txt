The introduction into the Ezio Auditore story arc, the best of the series in my opinion and also the one that establishes it as the flagship IP of Ubisoft. It vastly improves on the first game, but you can already tell that its going to steer towards collectingon the map to keep the player engaged. Well, it worked for me.
