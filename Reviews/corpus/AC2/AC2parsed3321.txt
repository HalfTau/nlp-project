Okay  I changed my Review from Bad to Good  That I could not start the Game in the first Place and I had to look for solutions for more then 4 Hours is still bad, but it was a Driver related Story. The Game stopped loading after it passed the UBI Launcher  so it was a long time my Main Target. But then I paied more attention to my Sounddriver. I deinstalled and installed the Sounddriver and right after that the Game started properly and runs stable and great now  happy New Year
