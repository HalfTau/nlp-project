Now i know why they say Macs are not for gaming. I own a Macbook Pro 15 Late 2014 and this game doesnt work properly. It crashes spontaniously and I have to adjust the resolution of the game everytime without seeing the menu. So basically I know press enter, two times down, enter, .... until I have the RetinaResolution. Will be my first and probably my last game I buy for a Mac.
