Assassins Creed 2 is a wellaged openworld action game with an epic storyline and immersive environment.  The graphics have held up surprisingly well over time though the cutscenes certainly look dated.  I completed the game not 100 collection in around 25 hours.  The freerunning aspect of the game feels intuitive after a little practice.  Theres a good mix of platforming and combat.  Amazingly, uPlay isnt even that annoying anymore.I did experience one desktop crash, but the game loaded right back to where I was when it happened.  The keyboard/mouse controls can be a little awkward WASD vs. joystick and presenting controls as symbols instead of buttons is frustrating until you get used to them.  Going for 100 completion is very repetetive there are a lot of unmapped collectibles and generic assassionation/race contracts.Overall, I highly recommend this game in 2017.  The main quest is enough, though.  Theres no real need to seek out a 100 completion.  Search the internet for  the completion cutscenes and save yourself hours of searching for collectibles!
