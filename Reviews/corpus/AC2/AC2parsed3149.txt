This ing game sucks. I tried. I really ing tried. I obviously tried too hard. Played for like 20 hours. This game has the little bugs. At first its okay. But the bugs... They really get to you. The story is not that bad, but its In the end you gotta collect all the ing pages.  THAT. You wanna spend 10 euros? Go buy some weed, not this game.TLDR Dont buy it. Its frustrating.
