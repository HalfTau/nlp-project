This game is very good. Its challenging Ill admit but the game manages to mix that with fun and atmosphere. My only problem is the unnecessary missions that add nothing to the story and how the control symbols arent normal keyboard keys, but instead are weird symbols that have no correlation to the action being done.Overall, I recommend you get this game if you like puzzles and a great story.
