Well..... This game is fun despite it being old. I like the combat, story and its open worldwell I also like Da Vinci for some reason. I also like the weapons especially the hidden blade and the gunweird there is a gun in the Renaissance. I like jumping of edges and doing the leap of faith. Its pretty much it, but I do recommend this. If you have money try this outor other Assassins Creed game.
