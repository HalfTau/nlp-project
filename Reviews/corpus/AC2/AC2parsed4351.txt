Was pleasantly surprised by this one. This was a lt of fun and the fact that the annoying DRM is gone made it that much better. Ive had a lot of issues with DRM issued by Ubisoft in the past and had sworn them off. Im glad I tried this game. The modern settings of the game dont look great but the other 95 set in Italy is amazing,
