Im always years late to the party on AAA titles. But thats cause I pay 5 instead of 50.....anywhos. WOW. What a stellar  game. Great graphics, awesome story and super fluid gameplay and battle mechanics. Everyone tells me Brotherhood is the best. If so, its gotta be one of the best games ever made cause this thing was a masterpiece. 9/10 all day long.
