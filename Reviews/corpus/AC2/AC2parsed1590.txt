A beautiful game.  One of my favorites for sure.  I have played through it twice now.  Which is saying a lot because the biggest downfall of this game is that IT SEEMS TO GO ON FOREVER.I love the historical aspect of the game.  And the architecture.  The story line, although fiction, is amazing.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is a history nerd.  For its time and genre, one of the most beautiful games graphically from the standpoint of the city backdrop.Again, the only downside of the game is the length.  Although the ending really ramps up in intensity, it just feels like Assassins Creed 2 could have easily been cut in half and made into two games.  I feel the game should have ended after fighting Rodrigo Borgia in Venice.  The aftermath with Forli and Rome seem grafted on.  In my opinion, this would have been better suited to be the beginning of the next installment or an entire game in and of itself.But this is my only complaint.  The game itself is enjoyable and you can learn a lot about Italian history.
