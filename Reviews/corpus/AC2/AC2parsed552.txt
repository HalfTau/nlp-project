i have to say i liked this game despite the issues on xbox 360. i like it here too, but it has issues. while the templar lairs actually work for me on pc, it has problems because the game RECOMMENDS using a controller. its designed to be played with one and it feels like an xbox port  the problem is you need to download a 3rd party zip look on steam discussions for the game to make the controller work properly.the issue with it, is the triggers on xbox controllers. because they are analogue the game wont recognise them or allow you to set them. so unless you use the two files a dll and another file contained in the zip must be copied into your AC2 folder, the controller cannot be set up in any logical way, and the default controller setup is basically unworkable. for example the triggers spin the view around instead of lock target or high profile. to high profile someone says they have to hold the start button in another thread on discussions! the zip fixes this, BUT it means you are unable to reconfigure the controller  it basically gives it the  xbox 360/ps3 controller config. once you have done that its playable.other issues are present regardless of control method. the big one i have is that unlike console version, the icons for the thieves, courtesans and mercs do NOT appear on the maps no matter how you try and fiddle with the config. this means you will play this slightly differently since you will not want to spend a lot of time hunting around for a distraction group to set on enemies  you will most likely run out of patience and just resort to combat more. this is a shame in one way but its also an advantage in making this slightly fresher than the console version.despite the issues its still a good game worth having with a good storyline and great to play this then go straight into brotherhood and then revelations if you own those two games also.
