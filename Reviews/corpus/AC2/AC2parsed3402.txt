Assassins Creed 2 is still the best Assassins Creed game to me yet. Its story, the setting and the very much well liked Ezio Auditore is a fan favourite. Till date, Ezio is still the Assassin with the most character and charisma. To the extent that Ubisoft went on to make 2 other games featuring Ezio!Set in the Italian Renaissance, the game features famous italian landmarks you can visit while playing the game! The story in AC2 is also beautifully crafted as you go round hunting down the men responsible for your father and brothers death. The combat in AC2 isnt on par with later AC games ones as the combat in AC2 isnt as fluid as kill streaks werent introduced yet, thus the combat is a little similar to AC1s. Just that now there is a taunt function to get enemies to attack you when you get bored of waiting for them to attack!Overall, AC2 is still the best AC game to date!
