After Assassins Creed 1, Assassins Creed 2 is a great improvement. The game is fun to play apart from some minor free running quirks that takes what worked in AS1 and actually makes it fun. Being able to customize your villa is a nice touch, but, apart from being a completionist, theres not a lot of incentive to completely finish upgrading it  and once you do the villa mechanic feels a bit flat.Overall, a great move forward in the franchise.
