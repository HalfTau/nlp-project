For me the Ezios story still the best. I love Ezio, so dont talk to me about Connor, because I really dont care.Assassins Creed II is much more complete, the story is better, the characters are more charismatic. The scenario of Florence is beautiful, I love Italy. The graphics and gameplay are good, but if youve never played AC before, you can take time to adapt. However, I think the fighting and missions are easy. In the moment when I started to play I lose the time in my mind, but its tiring to collect all objects..I only give advice to you, GAME, just GAME IT.5/5
