You play Desmond again who is playing a guy who is running around Italy killing everyone who is linked with the murder of his family. He is also is an art lover, and collector.This game is better than the first in many ways, but it is long. I felt more accomplished at the 20 hour point when I had collected every painting in the game and upgraded montenegro than I did in at the final story mark. Though collecting all the assassin gear in the crypts also was a big moment for me.Again, you cant skip the cutscenes, but this time they slip QTE events in with them.The game seems to borrow some elements of the openworld from Far Cry 2, which in essence just lets things react to you, rather thant strategically enable you to change the world based on your actions as in the first game.Good game none the less. Loads of improvements, but the Game aspect of it all really ended at about the 20 hour mark for me and the rest of the game was rolling out the assassin targets and finding chests filled with f oh and feathers, erg.
