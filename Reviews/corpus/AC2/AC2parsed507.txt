Tho i dont know much of this game anymore after playing Assassins creed Brotherhood. I still know i freaking loved this game sooo much! This was my favourite game of all time now beaten by ac brotherhood ofc. But you definetely MUST play it if you even think about it. The story is soo compelling and after a few sequences you got sucked right in to the hard but beautiful beginning of assassins creed. Sometimes i didnt feel the need to finish the game so much but once i got closer to the end I just NEEDED to finish it. This games deserve a freaking wonderfull pie or something, BUT JUST PLAY IT!
