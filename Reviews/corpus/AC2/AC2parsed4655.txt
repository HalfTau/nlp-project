God damn it, Steam. I really wish youd list when a game has an extra layer of DRM that I have to jump through to play the game. I had heard a rumor that Ubisoft had dropped Uplay from their games... so I took a chance and bought Assassins Creed 2. Didnt see anything about Uplay listed on the store page. Unfortunately, it still fires up that crapware and makes me register with them in order to play the game.My mistake for trusting a Ubisoft game and giving them a second chance... but I really wish you would mention this stuff on the store page. I seem to remember that you used to.
