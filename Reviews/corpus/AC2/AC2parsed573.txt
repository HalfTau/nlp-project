Definitely my favorite entry in the Assassins Creed series. If not for future desmonds irrelevant sideplot the game would be perfect. Ezio is probably one of the most likeable characters ive ever seen in a game of this genre, you feel the desire to take the story to its completion and the game is long enough to make you feel satisfied.
