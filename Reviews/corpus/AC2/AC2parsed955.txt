Others have succeeded where, thus far, I have failed. I cannot recommend a game  any game  where the DRM prevents me from ever communicating with the Vendor. I have repeatedly tried to get support for this problem  Steam wipes its hands of it and Ubisoft cant seem to register my, er, registration. Which is to say, no matter how many times I set/reset an account password with them, it never EVER works. The ace kicker is that you cant communicate with support if you dont sign in so . . . anyone else see the problem here?Now, Ive been gaming for nearly 30 years and I pay to play. While I understand the claimed need, DRM doesnt have to be heavyhanded and intrusive. It also should NEVER detract from the play experience. So, Ive tried for days and days to work this out and cant. I petitioned Steam for a refund but, since I didnt immediately play the game right after purchase it was a good christmasNYs sale, after all and the game wasnt the first on my play list  they arent having any. Granted, Im out less than 10 but it still . . . ahhem . . . steams me.I dont think theres much of a chance that Ill make any further attempts at playing anything Ubisoft might put out unless there is a lot of gamerchatter that indicates theyve learned their lesson. And, Steam? Ill be thinking twice before shoving anymore coin your way. You didnt do the right thing. Not at all.
