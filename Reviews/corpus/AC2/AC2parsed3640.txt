Well i was going to screen share this game since my gf bought it for me a while ago and i wanted her to see me play it. and then it started with desmond standing in place like a lout...and not accepting ANY of my keyboard inputs. so based on what i was able to experience id give it a 0/10 since i like games where you can at least open up the damn menu to quit the game rather than having to force quit out of an application. that was awful, wasted her money and my time to dl this crap. Ubisoft dont port games if u wont dowith them.
