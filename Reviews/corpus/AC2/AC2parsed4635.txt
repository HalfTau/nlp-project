My absolute favorite of this series. This was the game that got me into the Assassins Creed Franchise. Ezio Auditore fighting the templars for vengance then turns into fighting to find answers as to what the templars are upto. The storyline and gameplay is really cool and fun to get into. It may have been because I just got out of an Art History class that made me get into the game even more. Since they used historical buildings, paintings, and people in this game. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes Action Adventure in anyway.
