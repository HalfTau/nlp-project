To start off I want to let people know that this game uses uplay and for some people thats a no buy but if you can look past that then you will find yourself playing one of the best games that has ever been released. Truly this is without a doubt the best assassins creed game that has released or will release the story is honestly fantastic and the gameplay is some of the most enjoyable that I have ever experienced in an assassins creed game or any other game. I own 3 copies of assassins creed 2 on ps3 xbox 360 and pc so if that doesnt tell you the game is great I have no idea what can. Do yourself a favor and purchase this game you wont regret it once
