Free running and city/crowd simulation saves this otherwise abysmal game concept.Just the thought of some studio exec seeing the game and saying Hmm, its just medieval? Like that? Well, why not spice it up by adding some random scifi poo poo in it? Like what if... THIS GAME WAS A SIMULATION MADE FROM SEQUENCING A GENETIC INFORMATION OF A DESCENDANT OF THE SECRET ASSASSIN ORGANIZATION?Well, the games relatively fun otherwise.
