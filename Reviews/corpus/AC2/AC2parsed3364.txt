AC 2 is possibly the best in the series depending on who you are. Not me. Black Flag is the best in the series. However, this is the second. Though many of its features feel old at this point, but its still has good game play with many very interesting locals. The graphics are bar none the best on the PC so even if you have the console versions I would still recomend this. The story is good, even if I think the animus feels tacked on.Not as bad as the sequelsNow the negitives I found with the PC version is a short list. The 360 controller isnt great here, and the other one is that its optimization. It staggers and drop frame rate from time to time. For the most part I get 60 fps maxed out, but for no reason it will drop to 45/50/48/60/45. If you are a console gamer switching to the master race you may not notice, and only really noticable if you watch for it. For most PC gamers it is livable, but not optimal.Still I recomend this game, and you should already know what you are getting into.
