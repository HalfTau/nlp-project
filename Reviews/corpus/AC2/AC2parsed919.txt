ITSA ME, MARIO  MarioNow, this is a great game, in a open world with lots to do, your gonna need a confy chair, because ive found myself up night just trying to find every nook and crany arround this games awesome map. Youlle quite often find yourself staring at the Vast cities and wanting to climb up on any of those towers, yknow, becuase you just can.Now, this game offers more options than the first, wich is always good, like Weapon purchasing, Tailors for Puches, Dying your clothes etc.
