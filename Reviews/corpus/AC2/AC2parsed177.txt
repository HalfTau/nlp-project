To be honest i love the AC games and im thankful for ubisoft to release this legendary game serial.I would say confidently Ezio Auditore is the best assassin ever in the whole series.This game is narrating us a Ezios birth and how the Ezio is becoming the greatest assassin ever.If you have a curiosity about this game serial you dont have to start with the first one.Because obviously the first ac game is a bad game and have a bad control mechanics but this one doesnt seems like the first game.And as for me Altair who is the main character of the first assassins creed game is worse than Ezio.Its not the problem of Altair but ubisoft doing better with ac2 game and people love the new game than the old one.I hope you like this game as much as me.3
