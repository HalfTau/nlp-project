Assassins Creed 2 is an excellent game. Shame about UPlay a game playing service that somehow manages to work even worse than Origin, because at least Origin SOMETIMES works when you want it to being a requirement to even play the game, huh?Worse still, in its current form, if you want to use a 360 controller to play the game, the default map is garbarge pause with the right stick??? and the trigger buttons straight up arent mappable. Im currently in the process of finding how to fix this issue, but I think its safe to say that, despite being a good game, this PC port is unacceptable in its current form, and the hassle isnt worth any price you may get for it.Screw Ubisoft. Seriously.
