I dont play games like this, but Assassins Creed 2 was an incredible experience.I got the whole AC series in a game pack, and downloaded AC2 first based on online reviews. I really felt like I got the entire experience of Assassins Creed, and was so satisfied that I actually havent played any other AC games despite owning the first four. I would strongly recommend this game for someone vaguely curious about Assassins Creed.
