What can i say about Assassins Creed 2? Well, its damn near perfect in my opinion, and EASILY the best game of the series. Everything is just so well done, from the graphics, the storyline, the characters, the setting, the world, the gameplay and the soundtrack. Oh the soundtrack... it really is amazing and helps a ton when it comes to immersion.The game brings historical characters to the table then adds a little conspiracy into the mix, which makes for probably one of the best thought out storylines in a game yet. The series has just failed to deliver in the same way with all of the other games. I had this game before it was on steam and have completed it probably 4 or 5 times, and i will still end up replaying it again at some point. It is just that good.The game really has aged incredibly well, and for the price, it is definitely a game you should have in your collection.
