The best game in what still is the finest trilogy of games Ive ever had the pleasure of playing. Beautiful storytelling, incorporating various historical figures of the time, such as Caterina Sforza, Niccolo Machiavelli and Leonardo Da Vinci. All whilst being captivated by some of the most sensational scenery of Renaissance Italy.You can also fly the famous Da Vinci Flying Machine to kick guards off of buildings.10/10  Would Da Vinci Kick again.
