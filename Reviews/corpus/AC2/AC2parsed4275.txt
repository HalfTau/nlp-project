Back in Ubisofts better days....What can I say about Assassins Creed II? Its the excellent first chapter in the Ezio trilogy, followed by another great game, Assassins Creed Brotherhood.Storywise, this is the best in the series. No spoilers here, youll have to play it This game will take quite a lot of time to get 100 but its worth it!I recommend getting this game when you can. Its worth spending your money on.
