In one mission I was supposed to assassinate this guy. I cleverly snuck around a horde of enemies, climbed up the tower the guy was in, and prepared to kill him. Then the game decided to desynchronise kill me because I didnt stand in the right map markers and do everything in the precise order the game wanted. That is, at its core, all this game is. You stand in quest markers in the order the game wants you to, and doing anything else means youre a failure for some reason.If my copy of this game came with a disc, I would calmly eject it and snap it. Not out of rage. It would be the most sensible, rational response. Games like this need to die.
