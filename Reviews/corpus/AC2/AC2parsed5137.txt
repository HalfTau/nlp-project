If youre a Prince of Persia or just a straight up parkour fan, I highly recommend this game. I would also recommend skipping the first game and going straight to this one and onwards. Assassins Creed II is the most fluent game Ive ever played, with a very rich story that never fails to deliver emotions every time you play it.
