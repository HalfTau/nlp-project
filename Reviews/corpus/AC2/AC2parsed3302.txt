I bought this game today and will download it tonight. edit cannot write review if played less than 5 minutes, so already downloaded. But I finished it years ago on XB360. So just by buying it Steam Sale it means I really enjoyed it and want to play the extra stuff in the deluxe edition. The only other AC I have played was Revelations, and found it not to be very good. I missed what I experienced in AC2. The only thing I did not particularly like in AC2 was the mad races, but I guess it is part of the game. After finishing the main story I still tried to find everything and that is rare for me.I also bought Brotherhood because it seems to be a worthy followon. But if you are thinking about buying AC2, it is really worth it. A lot of people seems to have problems with UPlay, but honestly I have not really have had any. Only problem with the game is xbox 360 wireless controller support. Download ACIIWireless360FixbyKhemitude.rar and extract to AC2 folder. Otherwise it is really an awesome game.
