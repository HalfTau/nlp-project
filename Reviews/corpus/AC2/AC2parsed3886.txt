Biggest let down of the week. Ive looked online and found as you will see that people are having trouble with Ubisoftslaucher that crashes every time you try and sign in. Which seem ok. Well you need to sign in on that stupid thing to run your game. Thanks Ubisoft. Dont waste your 20 dollars. I love the Assasins Serise dearly, but trust me when i say get it on console.
