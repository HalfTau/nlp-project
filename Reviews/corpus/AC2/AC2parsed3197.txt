Absolutely amazing 11/10PLUS Very long, tons of side activities, amazing graphics not dated at all! and still does not need a monster PC unlike new AC games that dont look that much better, beautiful locations if youve been to Florence youll be surprised how realist it is in the game, creative and absolutely fantastic story with a fantastic main character, good balance between stealth and fighting, beautiful soundtrack that youll keep listening to after finishing the game... This game is fantastic!MINUS Cant think of anything!
