Dont bother wasting your money.Pirate it if you really have to play it on PC.This uses Uplay, Ubisofts own little launcher for all of there games so they can be a special little snowflake.They got the special part right cause the damn program barely works at all.I got AC2 to run by starting Uplay in offline mode. It started in windowed mode, which I couldnt change and then when I hit story it just was stuck at a finding network connection screen. The only option at that screen was to exit to windows.Needing to find a network...for a SINGLE PLAYER GAME.
