Wow, this is downright IMPRESSIVE for a very old game. The story is fantastic and complete with historically popular people. The graphics are beautiful and gorgeous. The combat is very good, and one of my favorite features of any game, parkour. The parkour is actually not very good because it seems kind of limited in a way, but it is certainly a great, easy and fun way to navigate. Another cool feature of the game is customization. It is a big thing in the game and very important. You can buy items and gear with your well earned dosh. The protagonist, Ezio Auditore, is a great and legendary character of the AC Series. AC2 shows he is a funny and charismatic guy. The execution of his brothers and father is what built him to become the Ezio we all know and love. So I would recommend this game. 9.5/10.
