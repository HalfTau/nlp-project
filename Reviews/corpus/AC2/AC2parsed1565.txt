TLDR If youre looking to buy an Assassins Creed game but unsure of which to get, then make it this one. Its a few years old by now but still one of the best, if not the best in the series.Full ReviewAssassins Creed 2 is, for me, still the most enjoyable game of the AC series. The game follows Ezio Auditore ,an Italian descendant of the first games protaganist Altair, as he goes from a young man who witnesses his family killed as part of a Templar plot to an experienced member of the Assassin order. The game has some beautiful locations with the cities of Florence and Venice as well as some smaller countryside areas. Theres a lot of side stuff to do like assasination contracts or doing up your villa but the main story is still really enjoyable with some great missions thrown in.Good pointsFlorence and Venice both look amazing and feel completely different to each other with the beautiful buildings and streets of Florence and Venice having its famous canals. Ezio is a great character as hes both likeable and charismatic and its easy to sympathize with his journey. Compared to Altair or Connor from the other AC games hes still by far the best protaganist. The story missions are both fun and enjoyable a lot of oppurtunities to put your assassin skills to work as well as the variety of gadgets and weapons Ezio acquires.This version comes with both DLC expansions, The Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities.Bad points Combat is a bit too easy. You can win most fights by countering enemies and hammering the attack button. Enemies also tend to stand off and attack one or two at a time so its easy to take on big groups of enemies. The parkour free running is good but canbe frustrating as it tends to be a bit inaccurate at times. Id often have Ezio jump the wrong way or crash into a wall which is especially frustrating when your chasing someone or trying to flee from guards.
