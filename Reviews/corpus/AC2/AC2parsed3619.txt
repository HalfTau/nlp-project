Hate if need to register and login somwhere else afer launching game in steam. Trying to register as a new user and got answer that username my email is already associated with uplay account. Ok. So Im forgotten the password and recover the password could be a good choice. But so far no recoveri mails found.. And so is gone 1 hour playing time already.. Muahhahahaa DSteam storepage should have info about needed extra accounts and staff like this to avoid this kind of fun.Dont know anything about game yet.
