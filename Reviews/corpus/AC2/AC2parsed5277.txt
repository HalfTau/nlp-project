Assassins Creed 2 does, like its predecessor, a fantastic job depicting real historical locations and creating a deep level of immersion. It never gets boring since there are many things to do in this game, many locations to explore and quests to complete. The story however is a bit disappointing not unlike AC1, but it is still a great game worth playing.
