So far and from what  little i have played to date, it is one of the best games i have had the pleasure in playing.. It is not overly hard on the graphics, and actually i must say, the graphics alone are impressive themselves as you can see the quality as well as the detail in the clothing.. . I would recommend this to anyone reading this review, simply because you dont know what your missing out on.I am using a Gigabyte 8GD R9 390 G1 Gaming OC Version with, 8GB and no OC needed for good graphics either..Pros,Have not noticed any lag since playing the game...Great graphic detail.It is not hard on the eyes or on your system resoursesCons,It takes a bit of getting used to the controlls on the XBox 360 for windows controller..Not being able to leave the game straight away, because it is so good..I have found that you need to have Uplay open in order to run this game and when you do have Uplay open, the game wont run unless you start it with steam.. which is kind of strange having two different splash screens opened to run a single game.
