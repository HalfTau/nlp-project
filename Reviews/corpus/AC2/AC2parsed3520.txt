While this is a really fun game, I do have to say it has some major issues.ProsFun parkourWelltold storyAssassination is funLots of extrasAuthenticfeeling historical settingOpenended levels with multiple ways to do thingsConsInconsistent narrativeRepetitive combatCrap controlsStealth is near impossibleUplay integration not really an issue for me, but might be one for youIn all honestly, its a game worthy of twenty to thirty dollars, and its a fun way to kill some hours over the weekend. Just know what youre getting into before you give it a shot.
