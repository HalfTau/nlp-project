I cant comment on the gameplay as I havent the chance to see it in action. Ubisofts notorious Uplay DRM has locked me out of the game completely, and I can not play a game which I paid money for.The game itself may be grand and I have no doubt it is from what Ive heard, but Im giving this a thumbs down due to how the antipiracy has been implemented. This only hurts willing buyers, and I will not support Ubisoft any longer if they keep this up.
