It is a completely white page.My computer is macbook proearly 2015 and match the recommended requirements, systemOSX10.12.6So I suggest you guys to play it on windows.And I dont wanna attend my university in Montreal now.This sale of AC series let me buy 3 games.AC2,AC3 and ACSyndicate.Mac only can play AC2.I buy the other two only windows version just because I love the series and I want to support it.Again,I love Ezio.E
