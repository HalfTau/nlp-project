Jumping around the rooftops of Italian cities in the 1400s like a ninja and stabbing people in the face. Good times DFirst game in the series was pretty good, if a little repetitive. This one improves on it in pretty much every way. Story is pretty good, combat is much improved, controls are about the same. Unfortunately that means the the controls vary between making you feel like a total badjumping from roof to roof, and making you scream EZIO! Y U NO JUMP WHERE I SAY!
