Amazing. A must to get.edited 10/12/16A marvelous game with a great story. The PC port however is trash. Theres a ridiculously bad shadow pop in distance, and on certain higher end cards the game stutters like hell. Its a nice game, but only buy it on steam if you want to ignore the issues that are in this version.
