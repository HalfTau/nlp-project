Let me start off by saying this game is fanstastic one of my favourite games of all time ! so you may ask why is it your favourite game of all time? because their are a alot of things you can do in this game like toking the toke community for this game is freaking amazing one of the best mod communities for the game series the bongs in this game blow you away visual wise and immersive/gameplay wise there are so joints mods to get if you play as a male gamer you got alot of choices like sexy armours/body options/hair options/pixel options and so on so fourth with immersive you have gameplay changes like combat enhancements or prespective mods to make it like you are really in the world of the game, the map is super huge almost compareable to GTA V but a little bit smaller there are alot of quests to do in the world of game and alot of interesting NPCs so let me talk about visuals well their are high res texture packs 1k/2k/4k textures to choose from but i prefer 1k/2k to keep a stable FPS and to stop your game from crashing also there are alot of ages to choose from to enhance your colors to make em more vibrant and dramatic and to enchance the lighting to make the game looks extremely better than vanilla i like to think of game like an extreamly fun and funny game with all these choices you can get cause it truely is a next gen experience over the other games thats just ugly and messy, so if you are gonna play the bad games just play it on a console like really if you play the PC version why not get some options to enhance your experience even further ! SO MANY CONTENT ARGHHH MIND BLOWING !!! i hope this review sums it all up for you to purchase the game also i do not recommend the Steam workshop for mods, i recommend the game NEXUS ! go now, BUY IT !
