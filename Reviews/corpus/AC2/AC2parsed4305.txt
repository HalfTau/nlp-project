My All time favorite game. An absolutely incredible game thats so stunningly crafted throughout that its blown my mind through the years. Story is very well crafted with fantastic progression. Three beautiful cities to explore as the greatest character of all time Ezio. Everything from the graphics, story to the gameplay is top notch. The music from Jesper Kyd adds so much to the atmosphere of the game that its unbelievable. The attention to detail in the game is mindboggling. Ezios and Desmonds storyline gel together brilliantly. This is the Dark Knight of a sequel. This is not just Ubisofts crown jewel, its the industrys finest piece of art ever created.
