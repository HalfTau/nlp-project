The first solid AC game. I loved AC1 sure but AC2 just completely overshadowed it. The features made it a one great experience that after playing it I never felt like going back. The only other steps forward in AC were the Brotherhood and Black Flag. But this one will always be in my mind for introducing Ezio and most importantly Cristina. The story, great characters and gameplay make it an absolute classic.
