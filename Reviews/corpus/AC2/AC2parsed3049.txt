Great game, great storyline, after u launch ac2 through uplay the first time, make sure to launch uplay in offline mode after then, because I my uplay kept crashing and i lost all the progress in game, only months later i finally got the game again and downloaded a file from internet and got my saved files back, You follow the path of Ezio and learn the skills to be the ultimate assassin. The game is amazing, and AC Brotherhood is even better, the game might be pretty old, but still way ahead of the time. And if you always wanted to go to Italy, nows your chance
