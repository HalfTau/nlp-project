Assassins Creed II was way better than its predecessor scenery looks beautiful and musics are awesome! The ability to buy things is a great increase and side missions are better. The game made me even want to start learning Italian! I fell in love with Rosa and my heart broke when Ezio and Rosa didnt become a couple. I recommend this game warmly, even if I got upset for Rosa.
