This game is a good example of a developer knowing the flaws of the first game, and fixing them.Here one can find everything in the story from major drama through comedy to love affairs not like AC3.All characters are made belivable again, not like AC3, at least distinct from each other, and the historical fiction is executedjust great. And the gameplay? Its not obfuscated by unnecessary stuff, its not trying to be a clone of other gameAC1 felt like a Zelda clone Imho spoilerFinal Battle was just like Gannondorf forest temple boss/spoiler, AC4 feels like Zelda Wind Waker Clone imho.This game and Brotherhood are the only two games in Assassins Creed series worth playing.
