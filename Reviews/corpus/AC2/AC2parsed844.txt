Good game, bad company. 2 outrageous bugs.1. Uplay tries to update every time the game loads, and always fails. Most of the time this causes the game to fail to launch. A big waste of time.2. For mac users, the keyboard does not work most of the time. This causes you to have to restart the game for at least 10 times before you are able to play the game. A bigger waste of time.I dont understand why such simple bugs are not fixed.
