Fun game, beautifully detailed environment, interesting story especially if you are following the series, BUT this game has the worst save system I have ever seen in any game. While in game it keeps autosaving very frequently, but in order for the autosaves to register you need to exit the game and sync with an Ubisoft server which authorizes cough DRM cough the save game.Gameplay 8/10 lots of action, movement is fluid and controls work well once you are    familiar with themInterface 5/10 the button layout displayed on the screen is ported directly from console and is more confusing than helpful at timesVisuals 9/10 not the best graphics, but I was impressed by the level of painstaking detail they put into designing the buildings some were awe inspiring.Plot 7/10 If youre into conspiracy theories you will love the storySpecial Features 1/10 DRM that can and has prevent me from saving progressOverall Experience 6/10 Had fun playing it until it failed to save
