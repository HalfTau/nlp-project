Completed AC 2 3 times on Xbox 360 and once on pc, it never gets old. The graphics back then were good but are now outdated however used with reshade it looks a lot better. Reshade adds more colour to the game and adjusts the sharpness so pretty much it looks like the remaster without the ed up faces. If the game is on sale i recommend you buy it, hell get it if it isnt even on sale. After 4 times of completing the story i must say, the blades and fists are more op than the god damn swords. You can insta kill pretty much anyone with the counter with the blades and you can disarm people with the fists and kill them with their own weapon. 10/10 would choose fists or blade again
