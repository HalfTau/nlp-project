Assasins creed has been fun once but not anymore. Im sick of crappy uplay launcher which crashes on W8 unless you launch it as an administrator which also requires steam running as admin. The dynamics of gameplay sucks, tons of boring animations. The game was unable to get my attention within 45 minuts of playing...
