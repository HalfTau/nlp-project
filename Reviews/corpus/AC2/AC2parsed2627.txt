Most of the Assassins Creed games have gone to st after Ezios games. I am a huge fan of AC but I cannot play some of the other games in their series.AC2 is the best. Far better than the newest ones Ill tell you right now.If youre considering buying one AC game but dont know which one, its THIS.This is really the only AC game that really matters. Brotherhood and Revelations are alright too after this one if you want to continue Ezios story.Im bad at reviews so all you need to know is with this game, its a no regret choice.Actual assassinations, a quality storyline, and with a decent soundtrack? Fck yeah this game.I will not ever stop playing this.
