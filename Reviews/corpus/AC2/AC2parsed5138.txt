You play as oblivious Desmond again but this time hes playing ing Cool Ezio Auditore da Firenze as he sorts someout against some templars that killed most of his family and with some help from Uncle Mario Not THE Mario but might as well be.You run around as desmond for a bit but all he can do is jump and run and get thetaken out of him by the british guy and his lesbian friend. Considered the best in the franchise but it is Ubisoft so dont get your hopes up.
