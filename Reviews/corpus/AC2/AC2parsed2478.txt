To preface this review, Id like to say as simply as I can that this is one of the greatest games ever made, and a constant reminder of how games can serve as artistic and intellectual hallmarks in their own right.Why is this?To be perfectly honest, in the case of Assassins Creed 2, this is certainly not caused by the gameplay itself. While entertaining, the action within the game has come to be dated and clunky, and while this is a massive step up from the headacheinducing interaction of its predecessor, it still leaves much to be improved upon. To Ubisofts credit, they did do just that. For better gameplay, move on to later installments of the Assassins Creed Series.What makes this game stand out is the atmosphere. The feel. The setting. Renaissance Italy, as it turns out, lends itself greatly to action and adventure, but allows for that extra bit of flamboyance that only a night in Florence can give. The intrigue of the period makes for unparalleled experierences amongst games of this type, and the very placement of a game into such a familiar let unexplored time period brought diversity to the use of historical settings in game.From Assassins Creed II, you will be introduced to a cast of characters and a canvas of settings that will, even after  years, come to surprise and delight you. While I cannot describe in full the emotional effects of this game on myself or anyone else, I can say without question that it is worth whatever price and that I strongly recommend it for all gamers, serious or casual.Thank you for reading.
