Assassins Creed was the first title to not only employ, but invent the Ubisoft formula. It featured sheer infinite content compared to the first game and a lot more to do to break monotony during story progression. Revisiting AC2 more than seven years later I have to admit it still hasnt lost a single ounce of its charm.Most of the equipment is entirely optional, but theres a lot of versatility in AC2 which AC1 was desperately lacking.Assassins Creed 2 might not be a masterpiece, but it is a milestone of gaming history. And it does pick up more and more with Brotherhood and Revelations, which are the second and third entries of the Ezio trilogy.
