An excellent game with progressive pacing, hunkered down somewhat from the Always Online DRM that will often refuse you access to it.Certainly, a blissful experience and overall improvement from the original. Ezio is a more charismatic character than any other in the series, and if you were ever curious as to what glory Ubisoft seeks to return to in the series, this is it.The game has excellent orchestration and electronic compositions from Jesper Kyd, who left the series right when it was going downhill a la Hitman.Replayability of the main missions are limited, since they are presented in the order they are recieved and cannot be redone once completed. However, the game sends enough variety your way that you are glad its not a game of killthis, steal that.A few misgivings of the game are its muffled pedestrian dialogue just like the first game, only less compressed and the occasional stiff parameters the game sends your way, challenging your skill as you attempt to complete them or risk failure desynchronization.It is no Brotherhood, but if this game is cheaper on a Steam sale or you just want to play them all, choose this one first. You will find the narrative bridging the two games incredibly rewarding.
