Just like the first game, A Le Parkour enthusiast larks about on impressive historical architecture. Fans of the first game will find a familiar gameplay but with some additions. While there are many improvements at the core, other elements are annoying. While death side soliloquies are mostly gone, you will find that the game cant make up its mind if it wants you to stab people or be an RPG where you race people and complete silly side quests. While the Voice actors chew the scenery with gratuitous Italian accents, AC2 still has decent character development and depth. Complaints aside, it is a good addition to the franchise.
