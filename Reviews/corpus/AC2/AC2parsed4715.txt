I came to this series very late, and with much skepticism. I remember the first game being hyped endlessly, and what a subsequent critical let down it was. Still, I eventually bought the game on Steam, and it sat in my library for ages. A few months ago I decided it was time to blow off the cobwebs and dive into the franchise at last. Its true what youve heard about the first game  its tedious, even with the PC additions. Still, its the foundation for an incredible series, and I recommend plowing through just to experience the story fully, and from the start.Assassins Creed 2 was a game changer. The moment you start it up, it feels different. The visuals, the gameplay, the music, the characters  everything is gripping from the beginning. I wont spoil anything, but the Ezio trilogy ACII, Brotherhood, Revelations has been one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences Ive had from a video game  and with my lifetime of nerd cred, that is no small praise. From the ridiculously gorgeous score, to the endearing characters, and earnest, intriguing storyling, play this franchise  youll thank yourself in the end.
