This is a great game, possibly the best in the series. However, I would not recommend getting it for the PC because you are required to use UPlay. I got the game working on one computer, but UPlay doesnt let me play it anymore because I had the audacity to try to play it on another computer. Everytime I try to play it UPlay tells me the game belongs to a different account and that I need to log on to that account to play the game, but I only own the one account. I think the problem is that it binds the game to the first computers IP requiring me to buy the game again if I want to play it on a different PC this is a known issue for every PC game on UPlay and at the time of writing this review there is no solution and Ubisoft hasnt acknowledged this as a problem. If you really want to get this game get it for the Xbox or Playstation, they still have UPlay, but it works as intended.
