Assassins Creed 2, continues the story of Desmond from where it was left off in the first game. You are playing as a new protagonist, rather than Altair from the first of the series, while in the Animus. The story is twice as longs as the first game, and is more compelling to follow than the first iteration of the series. The game improves on all mechanics from the previous game, and adds plenty more to spice it up. You can scale buildings even faster than before, and on top of that, new equipment and assassination techniques to the game as well.Some of the basic things that had me dreading the first game have sort of returned. I didnt necessarily like climbing the numerous numbers of viewpoints around the cities to view my map. Though the first game wasnt as bad, this game introduces well over 70 different viewpoints to climb and explore. Being a completionist of the game, I found it very repetitive to say the least. However this isnt hindering the gameplay but adds to it, as almost every building you scale is different in some way.Combat mechanics are better than ever, though dislike heavy soldier quite a bit, as you cant counter their attacks, as you can with almost every other enemy. Without going into much detail, and without spoiling the story, the game is definitely a must buy. I look forward to playing the next game in the series, Assassins Creed Brotherhood.
