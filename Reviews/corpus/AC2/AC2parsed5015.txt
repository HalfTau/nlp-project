If you thought the first Assassins Creed was good, this is even better. A great work from the developers you will be able to find 4 huge cities to explore, while you see Ezios grow from a common citizen to a an armed to the teeth assassin.There are lots and lots of stuff to do in this game, the story is quite enjoyable and is fun to get out of Abstergo using Desmond. Graphics are really good and pretty detailed too oh! well, you should be able to tell by now that I enjoyed the game a lot!... believe me I did, very much... and if you enjoyed the first, most likely you will enjoy this one even more...
