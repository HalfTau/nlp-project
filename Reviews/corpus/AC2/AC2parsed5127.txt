Arguably the best game in the series, at least prior to Assassins Creed III release.Almost every aspect of the first game was improved. Assassins Creed II starts right where the first one ends, exploding with an astonishing whirlpool of events, only occasionally slowing down to let the player take a deep breath before diving back in. Newly introduced puzzles with hidden secret messages that explain and connect our worlds biggest mysteries in a very surprising and clever manner make the story feel dreadfully real and even more fun to explore. And just when it feels the game has already exhaused all of its ways to surprise, it blows the player away with its amazing ending.Assassins Creed II is a large step ahead of the first game. But dont forget this is a second episode in the story of Desmond Miles, and it is highly recommended that you start with the first game where this story begins.
