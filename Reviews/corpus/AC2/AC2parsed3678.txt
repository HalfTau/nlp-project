This game ends in a what the fck moment. Literally said by Desmond.Awesome combat. The combat has more options compared to AC 1. Unarmed combat is now the most overpowered combat of all. Able to take on 5 BRUTES without getting injured. Just keep disarming and killing them all the time. Now with multiple Assassinations options, you dont have to run up to your target and stab him all the time.Storyline is decent. And as usual the history is a little bit different with so many controversial conspiracy theories.I have killed so many innocent guards. Makes me question this creed.Would Reccomend.
