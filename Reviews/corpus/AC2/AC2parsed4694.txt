This is easily one of the most amazing games I have played. And I am an avid gamer.The environments, the voices, the music, the story, the combat, the thoughtprovoking intellectualism, the conspiracy theories, the freerunning, everything about this game is extraordinary. Years after I have played it, I still come back to it and marvel at its beauty. They just released Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, and this game still beats that.
