This is my favourite console game, but Ive had endless problems trying to run it via Steam on desktop or laptop PCs due to UPlay nonsense. For me, this was a complete waste of money buying this version, because instead of actually playing this great game, I got to spend hours trawling forums simply trying to get it to run, and eventually gave up.
