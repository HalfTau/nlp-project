Im sure this is a great game. It looks fantastic. But because I own a Mac it takes a lot of tampering with my computer to get this to run. Then, its a battle with UPlay and a bunch of trial and error to see if it will even connect to UPlay even though your internet connection is fine. And once you do get it set up to actually run, you find that you cant have a controller, mouse, or anything plugged in, because if you do, the game locks all your controls. Meaning that if you want to play this game and youre on a laptop, youre stuck with a keyboard and trackpad. This game was not designed for a keyboard and trackpad. Its almost impossible to play. I dont have access to a Windows PC at the moment so Im stuck with this horrible port that I paid for because I wanted to see if I could get my Creed on.
