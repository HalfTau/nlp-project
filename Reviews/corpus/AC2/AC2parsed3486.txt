This review is not a commentary on the game itself which I should imagine is quite superb, but that only rubs it in as much as it is a commentary on the shtty combination of Uplay and Steam.Bought the game during the exploration sale, downloaded it or so I thought, and then waited as Uplay started to patch itself.An hour later it hadnt finished.Three hours later it hadnt finished and I decided just to go to sleep.The next morning, it hadnt finished.Finally it finished patching itself approximately 26 hours after attempting to launch the game the next afternoon. Slightly flustered, but eager to finally jump into the game I had been waiting an entire day for, I clicked the icon in Uplay to launch.It crashed.Moral of the story Either Ubisoft needs to fix the  out of their delivery service or Valve needs to get a contract with them which avoids the necessity of downloading Uplay.
