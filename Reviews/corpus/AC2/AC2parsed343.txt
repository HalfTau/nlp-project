Absolutely amazing game  entertaining story, characters and increadibly beautiful Florence and Venezia  It took me almost 100 hours to finish the game because everything  was so breathtaking  here I met Leonardo da Vinci and Machiavelli   I used Leonardos flying machine and participated in the Carnival di Venezia  I should mention that I played the game in 2015 for the first time and it impressed me so much even after a few years after its launch. Unforgettable experience. Thank you for this amazing piece of gaming art!
