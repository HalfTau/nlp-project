In my opinion this is the best and most refined assassins creed game. The story is good, missions are great and the parkour is fast paced and fun. The characters are memorable and the only bad thing about this game is when you are out of the animus. Desmond is boring there is allso a mission where you play as altair and have to do this impossible jump but this is easily fixed with a mod or do as i did and try it over and over again for an hour.Overall, a very good game and a must have.
