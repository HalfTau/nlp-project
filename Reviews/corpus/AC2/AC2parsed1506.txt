While the game is more enjoyable than Assassins Creed 1, and lets you play landlord with upgrading your own little village, there is a sheen of Ubisoft quality the culmination of which could be seen in the floating eyeballs and dentures of AC Unity all over this 2010 release. The DLC included in the Deluxe Edition disables two of the three hireable factions from Florence mercenaries and courtesans except for missions that specifically have them dont wander around for hours trying to find ladies of the night, because there arent any youll have to distract the soldiers guarding those codex pages some other way. Additionally, for some missions the game might also decide not to place the actual assassination target on the map, forcing you to abort the mission and try again once you discover that there is noone at the target marker. Once you stop expecting the game to work all the time and resign yourself to the fact that it will just randomly break on occasion, youll have a much better time playing it.
