Assassins Creed II took what was flawed in the first installment in this series and corrected it, plus adding a ton of new content and a less monotonous gameplay. The story is probably still the most fascinating and awesome in the series, and so is the setting. I am italian, so seeing the historical sights of my country in this game is even better than it already would be for others. The main character is generally considered the most interesting protagonist in the series, and for a whole bunch of good reasons. The gameplay has its highs and lows parkour is sometimes broken and combat is kinda boring and waaaaay too easy to put up a real challenge. And yet, this game manages to be a vast, varied, interesting, fun to play open world that has enstablished a very high standard for the series, a standard it did not always live up to. Brotherhood may be more refined, AC III may possess a way better graphic and technology, AC IV may have an overly awesome pirate setting with sailing and stuff, but this is still the episode that stays in my heart, and one of the last where the plot still made mostly sense. If you love this series but have only played the recent installments, buy this one ASAP.
