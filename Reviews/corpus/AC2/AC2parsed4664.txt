Assassins Creed II is probably the most accurate update simulator up to date. Not only do you have to wait for the steam install first, but after that it prompts a weird Launcher Updater after which a slightly less weird Ubisoft launcher updater appears, only for an Assassins Creed II update window to appear It might have happened multiple times, waiting for it took a bit of time so I dont remember after which yet another update window appeared for the Uplay store.Have almost an hour on it on steam at the time writing, have yet to play it! 10/10
