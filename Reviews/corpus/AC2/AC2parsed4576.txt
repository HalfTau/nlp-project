Very very good.In Assassins Creed II you play as the Assassin from Renaissance Era Rome, Ezio Auditore Da FirenzeEzio is an interesting character that sets out to seek revenge on the Templars who set a conspiracy against him and his family.The gameplay is much better than the first entry in the game and overall much more improved.The port is good and the story is amazing.Great game.
