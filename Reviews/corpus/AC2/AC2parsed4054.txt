Honestly huge improvement over assassin creed 1, and the main character feels more human to where I can maybe connect with him. gameplay is much more smoother and better. If you were like me and quit AC1 half way through because of boring gameplay then this game will not disappoint! the atmosphere is much better and more real. Also note you prob have to configure Uplay for 3 hours before actually getting to play this xD, but its worth it for me, at least its awesome
