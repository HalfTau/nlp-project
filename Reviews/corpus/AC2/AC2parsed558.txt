So i played the first Assassins Creed game for several hours before it got boring and thats when my friend told me to play AC2. When I first loaded the game I did not realized how big the map would be. The story is amazing to play through and I watched as Ezio grew to be a great Assassin. It took me several days before I finished the game because I was exploring the map and the viewpoints and doing side missions. I just enjoy this game a lot better than AC 1 because there is a lot more to explore and I find the setting of the game to be beautiful.
