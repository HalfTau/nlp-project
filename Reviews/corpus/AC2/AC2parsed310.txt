Its beautiful.The storyline, the injustice, the redemption, the enchanting 15th century Renaissance Italian backdrop, all together provide an immersive and moving experience. The best Assassins Creed game with the best Assassin ever to live. Ezio Auditore captivates us with his charisma, his good humoured nature, his sense of justice though that takes a while.I played the game for 2 hoursofficially. I was in a trance for 3 weeks.Buy it. Youll remember AC2 forever.
