Assassins Creed II has narrowed the gap between expectation and reality to the point where its really more of a crack. Its a game that has bought me from a slight sneer to the point of obsession, and the sort of game I can happily play for four or five hours in a single stint without looking down at my watch. If you liked Assassins Creed, this is better. If you felt disappointed by Assassins Creed, this will restore your faith. And if you mocked Assassins Creed, stop laughing. Assassins Creed II deserves respect. 5/5
