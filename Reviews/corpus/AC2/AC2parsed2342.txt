Great game, improves everything good about Assassins Creed 1, one of those few games that I felt I just had to 100. Great story, great gameplay, great content. Unlike the previous game, free running was still fun even after doing it for the past 40 hours, as it was so fluent and responsive. Genuinely a little disappointed when it ended. No complaints apart from uplay really.
