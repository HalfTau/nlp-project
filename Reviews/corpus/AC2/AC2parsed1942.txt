I will not recommend this game because it is bad  because obviously it isnt, in fact, it is by far the best game in the series and I loved when I got it some years go I will not recommend this game because of Uplay, because you simply have to install Uplay in order to play it its just that simple, guys... I will not recommend this game because the controls might seem weird for mouse and keyboard.The reason I will not recommend this game it is because it has performance problems. For a game of 2010, me playing on a PC bought in late 2014, it is pathethic that I have to deal with imense stuttering over and over again. It does not the make unplayable, but it makes it boring having to deal with it every 10 seconds, or even less. Supposedly, you have to roll back your graphics card in order to fix it, but I would you do that, just to play 1 game??? And it appears this performance issues does not only occur in this game of the series...Ubisoft just throws the game on Steam, not giving aabout this issues. Shame on them!
