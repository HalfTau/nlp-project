I really enjoyed the game.. It ran on my old laptop fro 200 without a problem with all the settings on high, and the graphics are quite good actuallyThe only thing that grinded my mind from the start and made me eternaly hate some of the climbing mechanics, is that when I try to climb something it jumps back mostly happens when Im trying to escape from guards and Im kind of panic clicking. With some experience you can control it but at the beginning its quite annoying.Overall 8/10, the game is great but it has its bad sides, which are quite a lot and Im too lazy to mention them, but dont get me wrong its still worth buying!
