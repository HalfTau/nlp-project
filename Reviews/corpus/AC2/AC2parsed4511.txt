More of the same, for better much more so than for worse.Im not an AC vet. I played the first for a few hours, likewise here. I had no gripes whatsoever the combat was some of the most engaging Ive ever sampled, the story pulls you straight in, the setting is beautiful Im of Italian descent so Im going to pretend I know and in general there is absolutely nothing wrong with my experience, there are simply times when a part of my brain that enjoys games just says AT CAPACITY and some games I played at that time are never returned to, this was unfortunately one of them, maybe some day I will have at it properly though. Until then, please check it out yourselves I doubt youll be disappointed.
