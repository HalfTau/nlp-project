Played it a long time ago. Tried to play it again. It is associated through an old account with an old email. Cannot play it on my new computer since I do not have access to my old email. Cannot play it now, thought going through steam would help me avoid that kid of sh!t. It does not, but it is not their fault. It lies with Ubisoft and UPlay who put in the ridiculous antipiracy steps in which has only kept a legitimate copy of the game from being played.Downloaded ACIII since I could not play II. Vomited, and now will never buy another AC game ever again.Avoid Ubisoft. They are a cancer.
