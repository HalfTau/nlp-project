Starting from Assassins Creed 1 and moving up the franchise, I must say that this game is certainly among the best of them. Now of course, if you start at the top then youll likely find it lacking, but in perspective, it is still a simply superb game. It added on everything in terms of environmental freedom and side quests/activites that Assassins Creed 1 didnt have. The combat is now all the more excellent with double hidden blades, various weapons to suit your kill style, various types of armor and awesome execution sequences. Plus you have the option of varying your costume just for fun. In terms of storyline, this likely has the best out of the first 4 AC games. It delves you much deeper into your new main character, Ezio Auditore, and makes the plot much more complex with a wide variety of characters which may be your friends or adversaries. Is this game worth your money. YES!!!! Plus, Ezio is a total badss.
