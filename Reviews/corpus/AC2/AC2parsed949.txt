just finished the game. i dont know what to do with my life now.pros1. nice and solid storyline.2. great graphics, it works perfectly even on potato PC3. awesome gameplay.cons1. the story is kinda short.2. requires joysticks for better game experience.Its designed for casual gamers, no modding, relative small maps, and short but strong storyline. the gameplay is nice, much better than Skyrim I hope Bethesda read this.i dont think i will play this game again, but 8/10 would buy the other series. the story is really something.
