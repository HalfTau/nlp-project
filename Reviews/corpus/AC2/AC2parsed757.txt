Assassins Creed II, my first AC game I played, first on XB360. The game is amazing and while the graphics DEFENITLEY dont look the best, and the combat is as great as something like Batman Arkham series or any other combat related games, the story is amazing and the character, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, is one of the BEST characters in any video game ever.Story 9.9/10 Not perfect but one of the best stories in any gameCharacters 10/10 Relatable, have alot of characterCombat 7.5/10 Not too great, but good enoughOverall, I think you should buy this game if you love storyheavy games. You even get all of the DLC. Though it is kinda annoying you have to install Uplay which sometimes doesnt work 100 of the time  it kinda sucks tbh
