Tried to install it, Steam needed Uplay to run, I installed Uplay but didnt give it my true birthdate, because the company does not legitimately need it and its a potential security risk to give out. Now when I try to start Assassins Creed, Uplay starts and then the following message box appears Uplay has stopped working. And since it appears to be impossible to cancel the Uplay account and start another account fresh, I cant play the game. Nevertheless, Steam reports that I have played the game 9 hours today. A friend reports that Assassins Creed is fun  I guess Ill have to take his word for it?
