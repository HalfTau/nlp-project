Although Im recommending it I have some strong criticism towards this game.The whole thing with the Animus and Desmond and everything is really weird and unecessary.Although the climbing and freerunnig is fun, it is painfully obnoxious when your character does the complete opposite of what you wanted, and it is rage inducing.Towards the end I saw a lot of fille rmissions which were honestly boring, pointless and underwhelming.I get the point of the game being fight or flight but sometimes there is too many people around and it is not fun.I enjoyed this game but it could be a lot better.
