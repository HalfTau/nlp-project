Great gameplay, story was interesting at the start but starts to drag at the end.The game starts out all guns blazing and the first few chapters are fantastic. Its great taking Ezio from a teen to grow man and a Master Assassin. I also enjoyed the supporting characters. Its a new spin on famous personalities from 15th century Italy and they fit in well with the story.The gameplay is solid. There are lots of ways to take down enemies, some quite hilarious. However, the camera angles are really annoying, sometimes. Please, please play it with a controller. KBM gets frustating especially in the chase sequences.If you havent played an Assassins Creed game, this is the one to start with. Oh, and the world theyve built is just amazing, especially if youre into architecture and all that.Personal Rating Must play
