Uplay wont let me play this game as they say I  have to prove I bought it with 6 or seven different pieces of information which they already have. It seems I dont actually own the game once Ive bought it after all.I did get to play it  a few months ago and it seemed okay and I have generally tested games from Steam to comply with the return rules if the game doesnt work but now, I can access it at all .Maybe Ill try one of the later games when Ive calmed down about it all......
