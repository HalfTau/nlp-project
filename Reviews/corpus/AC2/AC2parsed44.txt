I mean the game is almost ten years old, it has flaws and pros. I think the nostalgia makes it one of the best Assassins Creed games out there. It has cathcy story and aesome main character, as we all know Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the legendary Italian assassin. But still it is not only the nostalgia what makes it good.
