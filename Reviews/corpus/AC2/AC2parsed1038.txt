Will always love this game. Got me through so many bad days. Ezio is an incredibly loveable character and his story is very moving. Even though its an older game, therefore doesnt have the graphics of nowadays, it has this feeling of nostalgia that cant be beaten by the newest games even though I like those too. I can highly recommend this game because theres no way you wont love Ezio and the very soothing music, especially in the beautiful cities like Venice. Thank you Ubisoft for this amazing experience. This game has a special place in my heart and I will probably play it another thousand times.
