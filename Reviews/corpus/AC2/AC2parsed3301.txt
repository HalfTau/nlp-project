Definitely worth a purchase even at its current full price. AC2 is where the series comes into its own and starts to flesh out a narrative that is worth returning to. What happens later is up for debate, but everyone was enthralled by the plot of AC2 and trying to figure out the motives and goals of various characters in the story. The AC2 trilogy gets better later as well, but this is a must for not just stealth/action game fans, but all gamers.
