It is ridiculous to have to install so much software just to launch a game.   UPlay is a pain.   And to have to remember yet another account for something I did not ask for, and do not intend to use.To top it off, after patiently waiting through a dozen updates and patches, the stupid UPlay app crashed after I registered.  Useless.I will NEVER BUY a Ubisoft game.
