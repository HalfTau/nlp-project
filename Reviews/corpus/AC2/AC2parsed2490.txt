I have played assassins creed 1 and liked it. I had first played it on xbox360, i have a windows 10 system though and the pc version here on steam doesnt support it, waste of money, and they never tell you either, Thieves! but sofar srteam has been good and has started refunds so....way to go STEAM support. YOU EPIC WIN this time!
