This is probably the best Assassins Creed game i have played.This game has an amazing storyline, great graphics and animation for its age and i really love the soundtracks!If youre an Assassins Creed fan, you know that Ezio is the easiest assassin to relate to and get attached to.If youre going to play this game on PC i highly recommend using a XinPut controller or use an emulator for a DS3 controller. PS4 controller works great on it, but using a keyboard and mouse on Assassins Creed is going to hurt your experience...
