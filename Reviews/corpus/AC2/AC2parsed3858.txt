If you are interested about the series, but are not sure how it plays out, I recommend not to buy this one. Buy AC Brotherhood which is a better game in gameplay and level design. This I recommend only to those who want to start the Ezio Auditore da Firenze plotline from the beginning. For the subplotmodern day, one propably could go for this or the first. The subplot doesnt advance that much during one game, so it really doesnt matter.Ezio plot isnt that great in this game, its a bit illogical revenge story. Its feels occasionally quite forced and all the side quests feel like just something extra to do, but not relevant in any way to anything. I understand the game has a bit long time scale, but it still kind of feels funny that Ezio would be spending his time running races on the rooftops against random people just for few florins. Especially since florins are quite useless after 1/4 of the game.Level desing is good most of the time and the cities are quite interesting places. On the other hand, player spends most of his time on the rooftops. Theres not much to see on the streets apart from walking people, so theres no reason to walk around just for fun. Also this game takes place in many cities, so one does not get familiar with any of them. General flaw in a sandbox game I think make the city so big that no one never learns to recognize anything else but the minimap screen. Then again the game artificially constrains some areas as not available until later in the game.I also recommend having a controller to this game. I played my first with kboard and mouse and now I played with controller and it felt so much better, even though not as good as AC Brotherhood. Especially since this game doesnt have a proper key mapping.All in all, its not a bad game, it just has some annoying flaws and almost everything is made better in AC Brotherhood. So I say I recommend this game, but with a grain of salt.
