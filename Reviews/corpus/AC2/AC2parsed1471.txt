I picked this up in 2013, didnt play it until about a month ago...This game is incredible, while not the graphical quality of a next gen game it certainly had me hooked.I never really was into assassins creed when it first came out, but boy am i glad i had picked this up in a sale.This is the godfather of all assassins creed games, with a storyline that actually made me gasp, fun gameplay and cool content.tldr grab dis its good
