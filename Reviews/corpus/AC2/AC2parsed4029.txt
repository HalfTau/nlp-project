This game is definitely the best in the Assassins Creed series. You dive into the memories of Ezio, a distant relative of Desmond and son of the wealthy Auditore family during the Renaissance. The events of the game mostly take place in Italy, as you discover that Ezios father was actually an assassin. Ezios father and brothers are hanged in front the public due to a framing of the Auditore family, leaving Ezio all alone with his mother who was struck mute by the horrific deaths of her husband and sons. Ezio discovers his fathers assassin robes and dons them in hope to carry out his fathers legacy and bring justice upon those who deserve it, in hopes to avenge his family. The story is very immersive and the character of Ezio is extremely welldeveloped. The mechanics of the game are far improved over the first game and the story line is by far my favorite of the series. 10/10, would play again.
