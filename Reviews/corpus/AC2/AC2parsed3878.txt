This was perhaps my favorite of the franchise so far. The story with Desmond really begins to pick up, and I loved the aestheic of towns in the game. Game play as pretter standard for the AC franchise. Although I did see some improvement to the rooftop running and jumping around. Soundtrack is also amazingly well done.
