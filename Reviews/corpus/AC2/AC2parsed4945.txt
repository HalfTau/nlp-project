Quite an improvement over the first game. The characters are interesting and memorable, and the gameplay is less repetitive with more stuff to do. It also doesnt hurt that its completely stable, while the first one was pretty crashhappy for me. Unfortunately its still not enough to really get me into the series. Running around the world exploring and goofing around is pretty fun, but the story wasnt really grabbing me, and many of the story missions themselves were kind of underwhelming. A lot of stuff tends to degenerate into stand/dodge around holding the block button, then counterattack your way to victory. The franchiseencompasing presentday conspiracy t plot is still as terrible as in the first game and is the source of many of the worst gameplay elements, like synchronization I genuinely do not care what your made up historical character did I want  to play the game however I feel like or the inane puzzle solving when you find glyphs. I can see why some people like it, but the most fun I had during the several hours I spent playing and not finishing it was all the time I spent doing everything except for playing the game which was admittedly pretty entertaining at times. Going back to attempting to make forward progress in it is what drove me to uninstall it.
