With this game Ubisoft started to add more and more timewasters into the game. Whats worse they are also included in the main story. While some praise the variety of gameplay, I fee the game loses focus on whats important.I stopped playing this game for monts raging over a sequence of play our minigames tht didnt do anything to move along the story. One hour wasted working towards an invitation you will not recieve, so you just go there without one. Dreadful.
