You need uplay to play this game. After you download uplay it will keep constantly crashing. I couldnt play even a bit of it. I always wanted to play Assassins Creed, but ubisoft made uplay that doesnt even work. Hopefully, I bought this game on sale when it was just 2.50.By buying this game, I made my biggest mistake ever. I shall never buy and play ubisoft games anymore.So to everyone, dont buy this game even if its on the lowest price, ever because it wont work!
