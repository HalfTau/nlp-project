My favourite Assassins Creed of the series so far. Ubisoft managed to take everything that was great from AC1 and fix everything that was bad. More variety in missions, good and charming story, excelent presentation, better combat, better climbing, stunningly beautiful cities and interesting characters. Its very hard to find cons in this game! I loved it, especially the soundtrack! Except maybe, final boss fight, its was a bit dissapointing, but nothing major. This game will entertain you for at least 24 hours just like the first one, but the content is much richer and theres tons to discover and sidequests to do.Gameplay 9/10Story 9/10Sound 10/10Graphics 9/10Polish 10/10Overall 9/10 outstanding game
