Dont bother buying this game. First and foremost, the god damn fing control icons. They are not in keyboard or mouse. Secondly it forces you to install and launch uplay in order to play the game you already got on steam. And finally, CRASH CRASH CRASH. The first 2 i could handle but the crash is the last straw.
