Its a fantastic game, and gorgeous to look at.  The attention to detail in each city, particularly the Duomo in Florence is amazing.  Its easy to lose track of time while playing, it draws you in, and although the missions are similar particularly assassinations and racing against other characters, if it makes it easier to come back to, and something you can play casually after completing the main story, and finding all of the clips from The Truth.
