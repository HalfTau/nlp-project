A major improvement on the first game, this game is the basis of what makes an Assassins Creed game.If youre used to the newer combat system from AC3 and 4, or if youre used to the faster paced combat of Brotherhood and Revelations, combat might seem a bit slow in 2, but its definitely not a huge annoyance.A word of warning for people who would buy it for mac there are unresolved issues no keyboard response, is just one with the mac version, and theres no reason to think these issues will ever be fixed. If you can bootcamp, I definitely recommend to do that, as the game will both RUN better on the SAME hardware AND there will be no issues.
