This game was above average, expecially if you compare it to AC D. AC2 didnt repeat itself like AC. Youll notice this when you play AC and AC2 through, because in AC you have three or four citiesdont remember and there you have a little different looking buildings but the boring part is that missions in these cities even story, are 99 the same each time you do example The assasination of  The bad guys is always the same no matter in what city youre currently terrorising the people.AC2 stands out in this part, beacause only few of the side missions are the same as in the other cities, but every story mission is unique...exept when you visit Leonardo...Ezio, so good to see you. Oh, I see that youve brought an another one. Lets see, if i put this here and AHA. etc.I really enjoyed playing this game so much that I think im going to buy AC Brotherhood and Revelations, maybe AC3 afterwards D.
