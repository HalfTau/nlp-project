As usual, people who bought the game got screwed by useless DRM protection and pirates got it easy.Uplay is the most useless piece of software ever invented  did I say useless? I wish! It is not only that but counterproductive, since it stops you from playing a game you actually bought. After hours of trying to install this software and seeing it fail to launch every time, I just came to the conclusion to never buy Ubisoft products ever again, and pirate them instead. This way, I hope Ill be able to actually play them!
