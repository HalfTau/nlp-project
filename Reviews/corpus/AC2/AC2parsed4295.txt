Absolutely loved this game, miles more indepth and immersing than the original AC. Brilliant story line, somewhat improved controls, and much more longevity given the amount of sidemissions available.Far less inandouting of the animus, something I found incredibly annoying in the original, and when you are out, you actually have things to do as opposed to listening to someone speak, sleeping, then waking up and getting back in AKA pointless time wasting to make the game seem longer.The fact that you can live Ezios life, by making money, speaking with family members, using different character types to assist you in missions, means you become more invested in the game. If I had one gripe about a certain character type it would be that the courtesans automatically leave you to distract gaurds when theyre near one, even if you didnt want them to and you were only passing by. I find thieves to be the most effective distraction personally, even if they do accidentally die falling off rooftops a lot.
