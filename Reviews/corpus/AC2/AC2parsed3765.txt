High premises, low delivery. The game is very iffy, it can crash just because youve opened the men or else, like walking. Ive lost almost 25 hour because the game decided to crash while autosaving I wanna meet the Ubisoft executive who decided that manual saving is outdated and UPlay kindly decided to sync that file in, therefore losing almost a complete game. Its very good as game, but also its very bad being a game.Pro the original Assassins Creed lack some gameplay qualities that where introduced in the II making it almost perfect as game mechanics.Neutral Even if the original Assassins Creed was based in fiction it had strong historical basis. However this game starts to feel even more fiction than accurate.Con UPlay, forced automatic saving, weak program in general.
