The best game in the franchise. I love pretty much everything about it. Its got my favourite videogame soundtrack of all time and one of the best video game locations ever with Venice and Florence.  The attention to detail and a realistic recreation of those cities during that time period really help to make the game world feel real. Ezio is one of my favourite video game protagonists, he is very likable and watching him grow as a person throughout the game was beautifully done, just amazing character development. The story is gripping from start to finish, you really get invested in it. The parkour and combat is brilliant of course as well as all the other small gameplay touches. I just love the game its really a work of art.10/10 Masterpiece
