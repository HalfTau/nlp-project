This is definitely one of the best games in the Assassins Creed series and an absolute classic. The gameplay has aged decently. Combat isnt as good as later entries and at times Ezio seems to jump in a completely different direction to what you wanted, but overall its a fairly solid experience. The story is the strongest point here, and the protagonist, Ezio Auditorie, is arguably the best in the entire series. The events of the game take place starting from his birth until he is about 40 years old, and you will notice him mature greatly as the story progresses. Theres also a lot of different cities and areas to explore, my personal favourite being Venice.Try to get the game in a sale if you can, but I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to get into or already likes Assassins Creed.
