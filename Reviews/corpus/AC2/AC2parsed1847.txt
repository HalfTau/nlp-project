i enjoyed the first assassins creed and wanted to explore the assassins creed games. however, i bought the AC 2 game and i cant play it due to ubisoft. I dont know what to do, it keeps telling that it cannot find the server. im afraid to buy the other games incase this happens again. so im unsatisfied with this.
