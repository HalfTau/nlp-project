So, now Ive played the game for roughly 100 hours, 100ed it twice hehe. And I gotta say, the story was mindblowing towards the end of the game. For the price this would be a 9/10. Before playing through this I also played trough the first Assassins Creed game, might have 100ed it, but still, every change they made from that game to this game was beatiful. I even got surprised when I found out I could fight with only the hidden blade, not like in the first one.9/10
