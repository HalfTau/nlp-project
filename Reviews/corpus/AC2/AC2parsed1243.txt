The start of a legend and stars one of the most likable characters in the franchise. This game puts you in the shoes of the young Florentine nobleman, Ezio Auditore. As an origin story for Ezio and the ongoing story for the metaplot involving Desmond Miles, you uncover the plots unrecorded by history as Templars and Assassins continue to wage war against one another for the ultimate prize in both the past and the present.Whereas Assassins Creed 1 introduced us to the idea of Templars vs Assassins here it is fleshed out further with conspiracies and intrigue. Assassins Creed 2 is also an interesting dive into historical Italy during the Renaissance. Very few games have pulled off a fully involved historical drama with attention to detail that this one does.I fully enjoyed Ezios origin story and his journey of selfdiscovery. He is literally Renassiance Batman with a very similar revenge plot, but at the same time the plot twists and turns keep the ideas fresh and interesting.While graphically dated by todays standards, AC2 still stands the test of time. Combat mechanics are still very fluid and easy to pick up and play.If you enjoy alternative history or enjoy a good open world game, AC2 is definitely a good pick.
