This game is absolutely amazing despite its age. The voice acting is ok but the fluency of the gameplay is amazing. Im playing this game on an average work PC with an Intel pentium running at only 1.7ghz so its pretty slow but the game plays at a good 30fps. btw the graphics card I use is an Intel graphics so its pretty bad but runs well with Assassins creed 2
