WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO PLAY THIS GAME!!?? This is a great original IP that tells an interesting story. Embedded with enough non fictional history to make the player very much a part of the experience. The game is less linear then AC and offers more elements of an open world environment. Much better controls for mouse and keyboard too! Cant wait to dive into AC2 Brotherhood and Revelations!
