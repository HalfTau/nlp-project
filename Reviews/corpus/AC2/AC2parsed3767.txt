A huge step up from the first Assassins Creed.The gameplay mechanics, the layout of the cities, the diversity of the missions and the amazing story make this game one of the best AC games made! And Ive seen all the other AC games up until AC 4 Blackflag.I recommend starting from AC 1 then going all the way up to AC 4 to get the most out of the story, especially Ezios story. You dont want to miss that one.
