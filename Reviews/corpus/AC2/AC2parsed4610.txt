Second game created in the Assassins Creed series.ProsGood storylineNew weaponsNew charactersVariety of missionsRetains original Templars vs Assassins WarConsSomewhat complicated mechanics you cant air assassinate a person 2m away and high from youWay too much waterin VeneziaYou dont go out of the Animus a lotConclusionThis game is really fun if you enjoyed the previous Assassins Creed game with Altair. Ezio is the Assassin for this era, and the fact he has more weapons gun blade, poison blade, second hidden blade, smoke bombs, etc. means there are more ways killing people.Rated M because of perverted scenes that are censored.9/10
