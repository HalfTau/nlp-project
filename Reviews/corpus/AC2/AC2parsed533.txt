I am writing this review while having played maybe a third of the game. But my impressions over this first third are such that I recommend this game to any interested in giving Assassins Creed a chance.I recently posted a negative review of the original Assassins Creed, which I found mechanically frustrating beyond any potential for enjoyment. So for Assassins Creed II, I want to start by saying that most of those issues were addressed. The game still doesnt have a Quickload or Quicksave function and still uses checkpoints, but checkpoints are regular while pursuing the story and readily available while simply exploring. The games interface and menu systems, while a little difficult, are far more userfriendly. Character movement is much improved, and camera issues are mostly gone. You can quit to desktop quickly and easily, and getting back into the game is a fairly standard experience now.The game isnt without a few flaws. At random points, it wont be clear what you need to do next. Helpful hints will flash on the screen only to disappear before they can be read. Control instructions are often controllerexclusive or contain partial or inaccurate keyboard instructions. If you are playing this on PC, you will be thankful for Google. But these instances do not significantly detract from the game experience.There are plenty of improvements and just enjoyable extra elements in the game. Taking advantage of the setting, the game adds an economic system  an extremely welcome improvement. The game also includes a home base that you can improve. This is a feature I absolutely love in games, and has elevated games such as Might  Magic 7 and Dragon Age Inquisition to be among my favorites. I look forward to seeing what else is in store as I delve farther into the game.
