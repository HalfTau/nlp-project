Okay, so this game takes things to a new level. It isnt as repetitive as the first, and still has a great followup story that surprises you since its a sequel. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and the entire feel of the game is like a really awesome movie. New features in this one Swimming, using a canoe in the style of the era in Italy, guns are now involved, you can use more items which are all found in your inventory, health potions, poison coating for your wrist blades, upgrade your weapons and armor. If you thought the first game was too repetitive, try this one, because its not. A word of warning, however This games controls dont always seem to REACT as they should.
