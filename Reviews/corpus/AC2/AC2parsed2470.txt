Im not sure what happend to my game. When I launch it it shows me the cd key and then when I click next, the game freezes and says A ubisoft service is unavailable at the moment please try again later. If anyone can help me with this issue that would be great. For now I will say this is a unique issue because I diddnt see any threads in the Assassins creed fourms or Ubisoft Assassins Creed 2 support page. From my expirence on the xbox 360 version I can say this is a really good game and it matches up to the landscape in the real Italy.
