Requires uplay DRM and launcher seperate to Steam. Will be deleting it immediately and avoiding all future Ubisoft titles. Will wait for it to come out on GOG one day. Happily I got it at the sale price, so that cuts my loss.If a car manufacturer started selling thier cars as normal, but with two locks on each door and two ignition barrels...then explained that the new 2nd lock didnt always work but that you could still sit in your car on your own and make Brrrrrrmmm noises, you would probably go to a different manufacturer. Why is this acceptable Ubisoft?
