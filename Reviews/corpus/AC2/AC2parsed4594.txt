Cons Obvious console port with vague controls/prompts and occasionally wonky controls. Graphics are decent but facial features are just terrible.Pros Excellent game. Overall Id agree with the metascore of 86/100, and the questionable controls work well enough.I wish there were some additional things for the PC version of AC2. Better graphics, more attention paid to the controls, etc. Definitely worth picking up if you see a good sale, and Id recommend this over the first game. The story might be a little confusing if this is your starting point, but theres wikipedia and such.
