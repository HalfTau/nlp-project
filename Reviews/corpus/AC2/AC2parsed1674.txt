there are many improvements all over the board, and plenty of new mechanics and necessary changes from the first title in the series. Assassins Creed II is a solid title, and the first of a trilogy  AC II, Brotherhood, Revelations  that is considered by many the best story arc in the whole series. It is a highly regarded title in the series, especially if you follow up with the next two games in succession.
