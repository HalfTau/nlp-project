Great story, Great gameplay, Best Assassins Creed,i havent had the same feeling i had playing this game since the first time i plaied Ocarina of time,if your readin this and you havent plaied this game, fix that, easily one of my favorite games of all time,the only reason i dont have more time is it is that i knew if i plaied any more id never stop,ezio the main character is an interesting character that most people i know would relate too.youll get attached to him and his story, and might need to get brotherhood and revalations because you like the character so muchthe only proplem is that you need uplay, but its a small price to pay to experience this game 10/10 will play again
