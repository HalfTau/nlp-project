Words cant describe how amazing this game was on release. It was such a vast improvement in relation to the original title that it even went so far as to make the first game feel terribly uncomfortable to play. The visuals are beautiful, the combat is more brutal and fluid, there have been countless gameplay additions and tweaks, the AC story goes deeper down the rabbit hole, and we get a protagonist that isnt as flat as a cardboard cutout sorry Altair lovers. A nigh perfect game.
