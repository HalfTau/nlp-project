Im not sure. Bought it because it was on sale and Ive never played Assassins Creed games before.No idea wtf this Uplay is or why I need it. I get points on it but okay. I guess thats the world we live in.The game itself is pretty meh. It feels like a copy of Tomb Raider with a different motif. Very awkward controls that often just feels like button mashing. Ive spent a good 45 minutes trying to pass a single quest jumping off buildings and stuff. Its a timed quest and one single mistake means you have to start over. Not really that big of a deal, but when I make a mistake right off the bat, theres no way to restart mission that I can find. So I have to sit there for 60 seconds waiting for the time to run out so I can start over.5/10  Stick it on the back shelf and maybe play again
