Instead of writing a fancy review, Ill just write a few things.  This game has been out for 7 years or so and it has been reviewed by many of people so I doubt there is anything more I can add that hasnt been said already.  Eitherway, this game has stood the test of time as it plays very nicely.  Graphics are naturally lower than modern games, but it was really good stuff back in the day.   The story is great but ending is cliffhanger, characters are enjoyable, voicing is great, music is great, overall feel is great.   My only gripe besides having to use that d!mn UPlay thing, is that there are some features in the game that are just too easy to do.  Main example is upgrading the Villa.  After doing a chapter or two of playing, you should have enough money to get the thing maxed and then eventually enough to get all possible weapons and items.   Still, it was a great game and makes me realize how good this game was when compared to many of the future titles in the franchise.In short, if you really have to ask yourself whether or not to buy this game, then clearly you are over thinking this, because the anwser is Yes.
