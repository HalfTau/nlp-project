Immersive Gameplay and storyline. This game kept me on edge with all the things that happened so quickly.Various tactical and stealthy techiques to learn as you are placed right in the middle of Renaissance Italy. A thumbs up for me.The only cons are that the controls are a bit complex but you can change them at the beginning if they are not comfortable for you. THUMBS UP! !
