First of all I was a bit sceptic about the game. Always thought itll just be another fight game. Untill a friend told me to buy it when it was on the summer deals. Till now Im not disappointed at all. The music is epic, the fights are amazing and the storyline to good to be true. Im playing it with keyboard and thats the only thing that bothers me a bit when doing strange jumps like the side walk jump. Sometimes its even hilarious when you see the cutscenes. The story really got to me especially after playing for a bit and I only end after playing like 23h.
