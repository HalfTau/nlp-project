Great game, the gameplay is fun much better than the first and the story is an interesting retelling of history in the style of The Da Vinci Code interestingly, Leonardo Da Vinci is one of the main characters here.I have two complaints First, you have no control over saved games, and you cannot go back to replay any portion of the game without replaying the entire thing. Second, the game comes with some pretty lame DRM that requires you to be online at all times while playing.Other than that, its well worth playing and Im looking forward to playing Assassins Creed Brotherhood when it comes out for PC.
