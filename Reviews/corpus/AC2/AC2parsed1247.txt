So how to start...Well lets start by saying that this game is though a little bit outdated in mechanics and graphics one of the most awesome expiriences I have ever had in a Assassins Creed game, no in a game in general.A exicting story with a charming and reasonable character in the form of Ezio Auditore. His motivations though very basic at the beginnnig lead him to a difficult path that the player is most of the time fully into, not least because of the funny and in general well done story telling.The music is on point and the voice actors, though lacking in audio quality because of the age of this game, are doing an excellent job.Summing it up I think that AC2 takes what AC1 did right and continues, and improves its wrong, while stilll adding a whole lot of new content.A safe recommendation for everyone who loves video games.
