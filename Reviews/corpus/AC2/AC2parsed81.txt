The only thing i love about this game is1. Ezios Family2. When Ezio know all of his helper , close friend , and his family is an Assassins3. That highest leap of faith buildingi saw everyone keep saying AC2 is THE BEST ASSASSINS CREED GAME IN THE FRANCHISE but in my opinion .. its notmaybe because i dont like Ezio that muchand i started to play this series starting at modern one AC4 , AC3 , UNITY , ROGUE and then the Ezio TrilogySo .. should i give Yes or No ? hmm .. maybe in middle of them .. because THIS IS A GOOD Assassins creed game but ...... ah ill give it No
