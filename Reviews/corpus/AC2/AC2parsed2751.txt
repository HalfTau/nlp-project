As a owner of almost all Assassins Creed games, i give this game a 10/10!ProsIts Ezio Auditore, the best assassin ever in my opinion.Good parkourAmazing StorylineYoure hidden blade is a gun. WTF?You can hug Leonardo da vinci.You can get the armor and weapons of Altair. The assassin of AC 1ConsCombat system kinda basic, but thats aight since its fun to just smack everyoneThe reason why Ezio became an assassin makes u cri everytiem.If u dont hug Leonardo Da Vinci he will make a sad face that makes u wanna kill urself.You need to download Uplay ////////In all seriousness, this is what most AC fans describe as the best game, and i honestly agree. There are pretty much no bugs and for a game that is from 2009, and ive played this game like 77 hours total. That just proves how amazing this game really is. Its just an epic game for people willing to try out the franchise and enjoy a good story. I do recommend getting a controller though, since its kind of weird to play with keyboardThanks for reading!
