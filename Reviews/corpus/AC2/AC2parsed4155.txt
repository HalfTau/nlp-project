At first, I thought this game was good. Oh boy, how wrong I was. Horrible chase sequences, an endless stream of guards for you to kill with each missionyou might be better playing PAYDAY 2 instead of this game, subpar story, and on top of all that you get horrible mechanics and controls. After playing this game for 25 hours, I didnt even get to finishing it. I got to the last part of the game, but then the game refused to let me finish until I return to old areas to collect half the pages I missed. I ended up watching a playthrough and being massively disappointed. Only good thing about this game is the character you get to play as and that is not enough for me to recommend it.
