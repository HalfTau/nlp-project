Still amazing 5 years after I first played it. Picked it up cheap in a sale and was well worth it, Uplay issues aside.Not a particularly challenging game, and sometimes the free running messes up and you jump off a building to your death, but otherwise a very enjoyable story.10/10 would learn Italian again.
