This is the first AC game Ive played  had a lot of fun with it. Good story. The open world approach suits this game very well, although the side missions do end up being a little repetitive after a while. As some others have said, its a bit of a lazy port, and there are a few occasions when you curse the camera, as it gets locked into a more dramatic angle unexpectedly and certain tricky moments, causing you to fluff up otherwise easy moves. Its also apparent in the menus, which are a pain to navigate with a mouse. But overall worthwhile. It hasnt convinced me that jumping into haystacks from tall buildings is a good idea yet, though...!Edit After playing later titles, the clunky menu navigation is presumably by choice... quite a chore to navigate.
