In my humble opinion I have to agree, that this Assassins Creed version is by far the best part of the Assassins Creed tetralogy.Yes, the graphics got a lot better in the following parts III and IV but you have to admit, that the ambience and atmosphere is what the Assassins Creed games should also be well provided,e.g. follwing the Credo of the Assassins brotherhood and acting like a true Assassin is just at the  peak in this second part of the tetralogy.Plus the story AND the gameplay will make you satisfied, if you love the genre.
