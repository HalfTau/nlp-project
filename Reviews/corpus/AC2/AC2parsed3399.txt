Whenever I launch it. The screen is just black, the top of the games screen is right at the bottem. i can see a part of it. This has happened since the first launch, I think I know why. I run on Mac, They couldnt be bothered to give the correct Mac files, but instead just gave me a .ini life which is designed for windows.
