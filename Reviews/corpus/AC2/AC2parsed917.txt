A Classic game and one of the better Assassins Creed Games. Albeit an overall clunky game in terms of movement going through crows and climbing is sometimes frustratingly unnatural as well as combat which is horrendous compared to games such as Shadow of Mordor and Arkham Asylum, the game is a very fun, very indepth journey with many positive aspects, most of which are enhanced in Assassins Creed Brotherhood, which is very similar in feel to this game and follows the same storyline.
