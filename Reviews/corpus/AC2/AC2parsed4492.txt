Assassins Creed 2 is a great sequel from where AC1 started it off. Its true the original can be considered a prototype of an original idea with many things doing wrong, I played the directors cut, its still lacking... Even though there is a fasttravel system in place...People will enjoy AC2 a lot, though it is true that many will find lacking in challenge. The soundtrack is great, though going back on AC1 youd agree that shouldnt really be a surprise.Combat is yet again quite poor, the economy of the 15th century Italian states seems to be in flux as well people call it Renaissance era, but in all honesty its the late middle ages.Btw Ubisoft started its Uplay system with this game, good or bad, we have it now
