For a person that started the assassins creed franchise at 2014, the year of the unity failure, this game came to me as a big pile of hay and disappointment.Terrible controls, highly mechanichal combat system and overly complicated endless plot.All elements of this game were surpassed by other games made on the same year . The combat was far supperior on batman arkham syklum and the parkour fell far more reallistic on mirrors edge. Graphics compared to other open world games are also outdated.The pc port simply doesnt show any keyboard key on screen. Instead if shows press right hand to perform action, something only a very careless dev could achieve. Not a surprise.I tried to give this franchise chances but I really wish I didnt had spent 2 bucks on this game.
