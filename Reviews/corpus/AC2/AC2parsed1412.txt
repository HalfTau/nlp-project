What is there to say about Assassins Creed 2 that has not already been said? This game consumed my Christmas Break of 2009. Wonderful setting, characters, and side missions that were actually engaging. This is an essential gaming experience that everyone should have. 10/10. Also, come on, you know you love Ezio.
