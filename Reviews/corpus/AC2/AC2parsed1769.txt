Really enjoyed playing this game pretty scenery, didnt matter that the game is old so not so up to date graphics story line and voice acting okey okey, I do love the italian accent side tasks dont focus only to story line, just enjoy the cities and do some treasure hunting, assassin contracts etc. every now and then Had difficulties to get the game working because of Ubisoft service error. Problem was quickly solved with their customer service. The Uplay that came with game was old and needed to download a new one. Controlling character was awful with mouse and keyboard, would say that get any controller to connect to PC incase dont have one yet as it makes it much easier to perform the actions.
