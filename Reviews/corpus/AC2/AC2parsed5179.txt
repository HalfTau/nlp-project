AC2 discards everything tedious, boring and annoying about the first game and instead improves massively upon the good things. Assassinations out the upgrades out the gorgeous cities out the its just wonderful. This is the first game in ages I got 100  in while actually enjoying it. The storys also engaging, even though its your typical conspiracy BS and the moral ambiguity of the first AC is largely gone really the only part that I missed. So yeah, play that You wont regret it if you like some of that assassin business.
