While the Assassins Creed franchise might involve an interesting story and a great open world atmosphere the PC version of the game, especially of the earlier versions of the game are horrible ports. What makes them so bad is that the control scheme is not translated in a way that is intuitive at all. Whats worse and super lazy on Ubisofts part. Which isnt a surprise given Ubisofts recent history of lazy bug ridden ports is that all the controls are displayed during tutorials and such using their XBox symbols. So if you are using a keyboard none of it makes sense. On top of that even using an Xbox controller the tutorial and camera scheme still dont really give you a natural sense of the parkour that you the Assassin is suppose to become at home with. So quests that you are forced to take including tutorial sections require you to learn the the horribly awkward control scheme while also timed that if you dont figure it out in the 15 seconds they give you means failure and that you have to retry from the last check point. IDK if the newer versions of the game got the PC controls any better, but the older AC games are just awful in regards to controls.
