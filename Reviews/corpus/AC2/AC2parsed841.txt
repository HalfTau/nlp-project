Story 10/9 probably the best assassins creed storyCombat 10/10 For me the combat is soo realistic and fun you really feel like you are in a battleParkour 10/8 The best in the series even dough syndicate gives you more freedom about climbing buildings it feels very automatic and boring. Sometimes the climbing can be a bit annoying but you will get used to itUplay 100/10 How can i say this... Origin is even betterGraphics 10/9 It is very good for its time. They aded some darkness probably for the atmosphere but  kinda disliked it. BUT you can solve this by mods.Voice acting 10/9 very good. Most of the main characters have fantastic voice acting espacially Ezio.Open world 10/7 Well it really feels like Renaissance but dont expect to feel Italy very alive.Music/Sound 10/10 EPCMissions 10/8 It is repetitive however I never felt it.It is a very EPC game if you played the newer ones and disliked them i recommend you playing this one you wont regret you decision.requiescat in pace
