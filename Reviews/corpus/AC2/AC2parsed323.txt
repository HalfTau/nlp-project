Awesome game. For the time it was released it is a very good game making it one of my favourites. I highly recommend this game. Below I have listed a few pros and cons.Pros Excellent story what was well developed and although partly predictable it was always fun and ending with a satisfying  conclusion All characters were well devloped and memorable Excellent open world maps shows variety and different groups Excellent well balanced economy micromanaging Excellent skill balancing with equipment progression rateCons Like any ubisoft game, copy and pasted enemies make combat predictable and easy Does not encourage weapon variety in combat Minor bugs only fell through the world twice
