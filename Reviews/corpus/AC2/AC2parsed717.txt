It was absolutely fantastic. Excelent gameplay, good story, so much to do in any moment.A vast improvement from Assassins Creed 1. Better combat, story, controls,same camera, same problems with Ezio climbing walls you dont want to because...controller, same Get every viewpoint obsession, same badass killing blades, better game economy, shops, not repeating same stuff 9 times....I should stop now.Cant go wrong buying the game, especially on salethen its a no brainer!!9.5/10
