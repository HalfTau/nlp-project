Another disappointment in the Assassins Crud series. After the first 27 minutes of the game I had been controlling maybe 23 minutes of that. Using the keyboard, I had to constantly go to the controls to see what buttons corresponded to the controller input  thanks for showing me that game, and not what I was using... Had to update ubisoft software 4 times to start this crummy game. Dont play it.2/10
