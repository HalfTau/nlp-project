One of my favorite games ever.Ezio Auditore is a lovable character who gets struck with quite the tradegy. The story of his revenge turns into something of a journey that leads him to places he wouldnt have thought of before. Everything about this game is memorable. The voice acting is superb, the music is heartfelt, and the digital tourism aspect of the game really makes you feel like you were there with the characters living life next to them.
