This games is a storydriven epicits an engaging story about revenge, love, royalty, and family. Ezio is a lovable hero, we saw him evolve from a young and lighthearted teenager turns into a master assassin, swear to have revenge on those templers who killed his father and brothers in this game, it was just like the 14 th centery version of The Godfather. the gameplay is fluent and dynamic, the graghics still holds up to date. The map of Italy is huge and beautiful. Plus, Desmond didnt appeared a lot. Which is a great thing to happen. The buttons that shows you arent keyboard buttons, nor controller buttons. But rather, Body parts buttons. The first time i saw it when i was controling baby Ezio was extremely frustating. Since i didnt know what the body parts really means which button, so i have to keep constantly checking. The AI arent really smart either, they are too easy to be killed.constantly making dumb decisions, etc.VerdictOverall, AC2 is still a fun game with a great story, fun gameplay, and beautiful settings, its a shame that the buttons and the AI arent really good though. But its still great to play as Ezio to finish his revenge story, and kick off his trilogy, in a epic way.My score 85/100
