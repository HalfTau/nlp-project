One of my favourite  games off all time, ive become a big fan of the franchise after this game, including collecting most figurines, great story and great character, will be very difficult to match Ezio and Desmond. If you havent played this game what you waiting for,  10/10 from me, Shame all the latest ones are no where near as good.
