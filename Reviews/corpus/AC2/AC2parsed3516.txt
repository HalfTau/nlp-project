Wow,I am so upset with myself I did not play this game when it came out,The game is awesome and its SO LONG,with campaign 21 hours  10 misc. that game has to offer,there is more to this game,History about Italy in the the past 15th century and the smooth gameplay. I like this game,give it a try 8/10
