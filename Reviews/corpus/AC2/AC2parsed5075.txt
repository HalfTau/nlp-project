for the most part its AC1 with a villa and a few misc changes, but pretty much the same, wasnt a boring as the first one, but I would not recommend AC1 at all or this one for more than 4.99 if you can get a package for the 2 for 4.99 buy it, just dont say I didnt warn ya about AC1, snooze fest. By the time you are more than 10hours into these youre like  my god is this gonna end soon  and I dont usually say that about games, I like a lot of hours played, but not if its in sheer boredom.
