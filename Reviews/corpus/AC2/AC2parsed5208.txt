Way better than AC1. In fact, I cant really think of another sequel that improves more on the original than this one. Whereas AC1 had you repeating the same types of missions over and over, AC2 has a huge variety of missions right up to the end. Likewise, combat also has more variety with upgradeable armor, weapons, and home bases giving the gameplay a tiny bit more depth. But perhaps best of all, while AC1s plot was silly, AC2s plot takes things to a level of complete insanity that is kind of charming in its own unintentionally absurd batway. I cant think of another game, for example, that lets you storm a medieval castle, beat up a pope, and mild spoilers hobknob with alien beings all in the space of a few minutes and all with a completely straight face. Its pure, pulpvideogame, guilty pleasure, trashbut in a good way! Mindless fun.
