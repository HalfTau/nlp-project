Okay, first up, I recommend this game. Its massive and yet, at todays price very cheap!, youd be a fool not to give it a go. However, I feel somewhat mixed about this game...I played for 23 hours...thats a long time while mainly focussing on playing the main campaign missions, alone. I did have some silly sidemission parts temple puzzles, but for the most part, I stuck to the story. Still, after finishing Assassins Creed 2, I was almost left feeling a little bored. And the ending didnt really clear much up. In fact, it left things in a very ambigious way. Playing this 4 years after it came out, Im glad I left it as long as this, as I can buy the next game in the series and play on!The good points  The combat is pretty decent, lots and lots to do, plus those silent assassin kills, awww yerrr. The bad points  The control system...the BLOODY control system!! The amount of times when my character jumped ways I never wanted, meh! OR, when I was chasing someone, while being pursued by guards   my targets in front of me, so I press the lockon button, but it locks onto a guard following behind! WTF?? Truly, these moments brought out my younger self, cursing the game and the controls, LOUDLY! I cant think of another game that does this to me.Anyway, Im rambling a bit. Overall, its a massive game and if you love that kind of thing, this is for you. However, beware the controls. Sometimes, they justyou over. But...if like me, you want a fairly shorter, less tedious outing, perhaps Assassins Creed 2 is not that game.Hopefully this explains my mixed feelings about the game. It was a better AC game than the first, thats for sure. But, a little overly long and somewhat repetitive at times. Still, have at it!
