Straight from the depths of Rennaissanceera Italy, Ubisoft brings us the second, and by far best to date, entry to the Assassins Creed franchise. This is a game about options, usually. Most of the game allows the player to roam freely and choose to complete the game in either a stealthy manner or an openly violent and crazy manner. The mechanics are good through most of the game, though there are moments where the game tends to cause issues like having trouble seeing or reaching objectives. Ironically, most of these problems arise during a sequence in which you play as Altair from AC1.Overall, though, the game works. I give it 4/5 Florins for being mostly functional and fun, despite a few gameplay issues.
