Probably the best received game of the original trilogy...Assassins Creed was originally planned as a trilogy, through which is wound a modernday thread to give it depth and meaning, and to tie the three ancestors lives together with meaning. Assassins Creed 2 was the Deus Ex of the series, it set the standard for all that followed, but was never bested. often copied, never equalled as the saying goes, this was to set the theme and style for all that followed but they were mere essays in the craft as a famous author once wrote.Set in Renaissance Italy, it tells the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Ezio of the Auditore family of Florence. Renaissance Italy was a formative time for Italy and mainland Europe, and was an era where famous architects and artists abounded and marked their place in history. Here in this very city you can climb Florence Cathedral, designed by Giotto and engineered by Brunelleschi, wonder at the many recreated towers of San Gimignano and take in the beauty of Tuscany and its many recreated landmarks.This whole game is rich in history and has had entire regions of Italy, complete with its famous people and landmarks, transplanted into its very core, and this is your playground.Following on from the original Assassins Creed, which introduced you to Altar IbnLaAhad who was a member of a cult based on the reallife Hashishin, more correctly referred to in history as the Asasiyun, Ezio continues the storyarc of Desmond Miles, a modernday descendant of the original Assassins, on his unbidden quest to seek out the Piece of Eden, and to recover it and use it in defense against The Templars. A typical them and us scenario but beautifully executed, immersing the player into selected regions of reallife history, and merging it with a simple yet intricate fictitious concept.Throughout the game you, the player, become Ezio, a rogue, a charmer and a parkour master... and possibly one of the mostloved characters of the entire series. You start off with nothing, but following the ingame death of your father and brothers, you very quickly learn the arts of stealth, stealing and most important of all, the deadly art of assassination. At fist it is only for revenge but surrounded by friends and family, you are slowly guided and trained to become an efficient killer in order to take out various city officials who are actually Templar Agents, bent on the domination of the people.As you progress through the game you learn more about the Templars and the Assassins, and the reason behind their longterm enmity, and the importance and urgency of trying to thwart them in their own deadly quest to dominate the entire earth.All this contentrich plot is set in a beautifully recreated and innovative period of our own history when creativity was at its peak and when famous people such as Leonardo da Vinci and Machiavelli actually lived and contributed to all that we know today.Playing this game is more that just playing through a simple plot, it is an opportunity to experience  one of the most important periods of European history, and to virtually walk the very streets and admire the legendary architecture of Renaissance Italy, which has been an inspiration to us right down to this day.
