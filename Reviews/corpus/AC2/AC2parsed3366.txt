The story continues right where it left off and it is great. My gripe with this ones gameplay is that the lockon does not work very well. By not work very well I mean it fails spectacularly at what it is supposed to do, that is, LOCK ON. It does not lock it only sticks. If you move the camera angle too much such that you point of view centers on another NPC your lock will transfer to that person. Its not a lockon at all, its a stickon.Other than that, most things are unchanged, and thats for the better. Story still good, gameplay otherwise good.
