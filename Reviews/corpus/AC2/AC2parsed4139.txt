One of my favourite games of all time. The story is stellar, the gameplay is refined, the graphics feel dated, but the art style is timeless, Venice and Florence will always be beautiful. If you havent bought this game in the Steam sale for something as cheap as 2.98, then you are crazy, it is a classic.
