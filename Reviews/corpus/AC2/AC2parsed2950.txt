I can recommend this game despite the fact I had to spend fifteen minutes fighting Uplay just so it wouldnt crash, thats really great praise right there. But do not fear, oh reader, once you properly install it the game runs smoothly, at least it did for me.After the stunt with Uplay I was ready to growl, complain and call it quits, and yet this classic deserves all the praise it gets and once I started playing I couldnt stop.The controls on pc, with mouse and keyboard, were kinda weird at first for me. But then I started liking the sassy main character and learnt to jump from roof to roof without falling on top of innocent bystanders, and things improved.The story is compelling, Ezio is charismatic, the gameplay makes you feel like you can do parkour in real life. Even collectings things all over the cities wasnt boring because the landscapes and atmosphere are quite immersive.I loved it, and thats coming from someone who was ready to dismiss it because Uplay sucks and Im quite skeptical of things that turn into long sagas. Now I feel like some of the ramdon NPCs, who stare at Ezio in wonder while he climbs a cathedral and mutter things like Santa Madre di Dio! or I should find a way to stay in shape too. Yeah. Go buy it.EDIT BEWARE, IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN PARKOUR TOO, BUT ITS A LIE, DONT TRY IT AT HOME, MUCH LESS AT WORK. THANK YOU.
