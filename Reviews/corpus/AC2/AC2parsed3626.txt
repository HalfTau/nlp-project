A true example of how a third person adventure/action game should be made. The game is solid on any aspect that makes a great game.The storyline was amazing I can see now why Ezio Auditore is such a beloved character in the gaming community. Aside from Ezios unique personality and growth, the game features a number of interesting main characters such as Ezios relatives, friends and enemies. Ezios assassin training and story are well worth the playtime.Aside from the main quests, the side quests are numerous and can become repetitive, but quests such as the assassination contracts always helped spice up the gameplay. Although the gameplay is as simple as it gets, the ways to go about combat with the various weapons really does enhance the experience. The interaction with the environment is also quite impressive, you can hide in crowds, bribe heralds, and hire mercenaries and thieves, ride horses, climbing buildings and even finance a town, these little things are essential for a great game.The graphics and visuals are stunning, the way they recreated the time period, the architecture and the cities is breathtaking, and these views kept on rewarding with each city I visited. The streets full of people, the buildings and events like the Carnevale in Venice really make the game shine. Truly a great work with the visuals.The game also has a fantastic soundtrack, any song played while playing is really well done.As for the negative side of the game, I did experience a few glitches but nothing that kept me from playing and having to use Uplay all the time is a bit frustrating and useless since we already have Steam.Aside from these minor issues, the game is definitely worth the price and a great example of a third person action game !
