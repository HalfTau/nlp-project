Fun and exciting game, with a great plot. Thoroughly enjoyed playing it. It contains a fantastic mix of fighting, exploring, and quests. Im not a fan of cutscreens, but they were fairly entertaining, and certainly important for the plot.Graphicswise, it runs smoothly and perfectly on my early 2011 15 inch MacBook Pro.10/10.
