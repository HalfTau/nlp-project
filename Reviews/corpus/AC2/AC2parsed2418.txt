I bought the game, but after ten or fiteen minutes of trying to log in followed by a few hours of trying to tangle with Ubisofts customer service, Ill just play the game on a console.The developers seem to fear that somebody would actually try to play the game after purchse, so locked it up effectively with UPlay. It may be a good game, but it isnt on Steam.
