Better than the first Assassins Creed, in both plot and variety though I honestly kind of prefer the Crusade theme over the Italian Renassiance..., AC2 is a pretty fun game, with some fantastic graphics and gameplay.However it does start to outstay its welcome about a dozen hours in or so, especially when you realize the game has a ways to go in its convoluted story, and isnt going to introduce much new, other than the occasional use once, and forever ignore gadget. And honsetly, the game should be called Duelers Creed, because you do a lot more of that than assassinating...Recommended for those who are either hardcore completionists or gamers with patience.
