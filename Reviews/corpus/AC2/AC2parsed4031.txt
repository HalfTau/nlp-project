I fell in love with this game after I beat the crap out of AC Revelations.  I love the AC genre.  Ive played all the series, but this is the only one that I truly annialated all the way through.  I have 58 hours logged in this game and I can come back to it just about anytime to check on my victories.  The only collection I havent completed in this game is the feather collection.  If I decide to get back into the animus, Ill use a walkthroguh to find all the feathers for my next attempt.  I highly recommed playing through this.  Ezio is one of the funnest charcters Ive had the opportunity to learn.
