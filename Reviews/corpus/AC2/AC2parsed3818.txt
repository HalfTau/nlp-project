Farcical set up. Getting thrown out of the game. Ive spent over an hour just getting this to work and Ive played it for five minutes and Im just giving up. Id write a little more but Im too depressed. Ive always wondered why people get driven to suicide. Now I know and its not in a taxi.There may be a good game in there somewhere reviews have stated so but Im done.Id go check out problems on line before a purchase.
