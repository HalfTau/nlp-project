This game was quite good. The gameplay was fun and enjoyable and the graphics were alright speaking for a game that was made a couple of years ago and was not in with the cool new advances in technology. However, with everything said I have a couple of problems with this1 The freerunning was not always responsive and sometimes I run straight off in the other direction making me seeth with rage and no longer willing to play for the next 3060 minutes.2 The requirement to have a UPlay account was seriously stupid and annoying because for some reason the launcher always crashes now whenever I put in my login information.3 You need internet to play this game, you cant play it on the rode like plenty of other games which is also because of UplaySo allinall this game is excellent, I would reccomend it to everyone who I know.P.S Does anyone else have that glich where the launcher keeps crashing whenever you try to login?
