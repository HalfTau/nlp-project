Solid 2nd installment to the series with only one aggrevating flaw. The game will cut off at random intervals. Sadly its not just me, talked to others and they had the same issue. Aside from that, gameplay is great, graphics are very good, and storyline is extremely immersive. Looking forward to Brotherhood, and am in hopes that it does not share the same problem.AMD Phenom II X6 1100T 3.3Ghz.6GB DDR22.5TB 7200RPM, 16MB, SATA II16MB/s Cable/N300 WifiXFX 2GB Radeon 6950Vizio 42 1080P 3D LED
