I can recall awaiting the release of the original Assassins Creed with so much anticipation and, though enjoying it overall, being a little disappointed by some of the repetative elements of the gameplay. ACII takes the best of AC design, graphics, story, etc. and improves  the gameplay. My favourite entry in the franchise so far.
