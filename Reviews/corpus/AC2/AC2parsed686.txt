So I finally got this and completed it.Its definitely showing its age not only graphically but also gameplay wise. The freerunning was still at its infancy here and it requires pressing 2 keys to do it  which, naturally, brought a lot of problems until they figured a way to make it work with just one key  so expect a lot of frustration. Plus, theres the keyboard and mouse aspect... These games were developed for consoles and controllers, not KBM  and it definitely shows. Still, you can mostly get around this except for a few areas where the lack of a joystick shows.Story wise, its fairly good Enzos a likeable guy and you get to meet a lot of characters from the history books. They did overdo it a bit when putting Machiavelli as an assassin  but its something you can overlook. Theres also a vibe that you just havent seen since AC3  which mainly comes from Desmonds story arch and his encounters with the precursors.Soundtrack is classic Jesper Kyd...nuff said.Overall, 8/10. Recommended to fans of the series and even casual players, like myself, who may be looking for a good game to immerse themselves in when they want to kick back a bit and relax.
