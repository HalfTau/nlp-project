Dont let my low playtime fool you, Ive played it through to 100 completion on PS3. Such a great game, a vast improvement on the first game this is what Assassins Creed should have been. The overall story and characters are much better, the game and progression is far less repetetive, and it runs smooth as silk on PC thanks to being a mostlygreat port. With admittedly few options to custumize graphics settings and not recognizing the triggers on my 360 controller as button inputs.Its disappointing that Steam doesnt have the achievements built in, since they were satisfying to get and werent ridiculous to try and achieve. Its also a pain that you have to use UPlay in addition to Steam, but at least once you get it set up and installed you dont really have to mess with it again.This is an easy game to recommend. There are some refinements and additions in Brotherhood and Revelations, but as a whole this is still my favorite entry in an excellent series.
