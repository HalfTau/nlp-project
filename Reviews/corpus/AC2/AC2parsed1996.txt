Thats what I expect of an Assassin Game.The first AC game was a real let down for me... no real story just some random assassinations in seemingly generic cities. I couldnt identify myself with Altair.But Ezio is a whole different story there. You got everything, charming characters you get to like or dislike, a really large challenging universe with a background which has its twists and way way to many collectibles.Completiontime about 25 hours with most side quests and challenges done.
