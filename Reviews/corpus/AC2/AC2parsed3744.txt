While I will always be partial to the original Assassins Creed inside, Assassins Creed II improved on nearly every aspect of the first game. Better graphics, mechanics, more weapons, more varied missions, Ubisoft really improved on the core mechanics set up by the original. While later games in the series suffer from being too similar to one another, II really raised the bar for the series in a  way they didnt do again until Black Flag was released, and even it is clearly the child of AC II, not I. Great game, great mechanics, great story that will probably lose you in the next couple games.
