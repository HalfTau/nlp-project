Controls for PC are a little confusing at times, and menus in game have habit of popping up with the graphics for the console version, but the game plays fairly well, and it was nice to not have to play on a console to get to begin Ezios story. Loved the game, loved the story. Enjoyed the extra content that the Deluxe Edition allowed me to play with.
