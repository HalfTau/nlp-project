The second in the classic frustration series, however we have much improved controls and a character who finally will not drown in a heavy rain sarcastic joke there for those who cannot sense sarcasm over the internet tubes The continuation of the story of a poor sap yanked off the streets and stuck into a machine to relive his ancestors past apparently his ancestors moved from the middle east to Italy at some point and his suddenly hotter? lab geek assistant and their merry adventures in stabbystabbyland.I kid, well not about the frustration levels, Ubisoft seems to love programming in what I call the DMove you figgure it out where cameras suddenly wont face the way you need them to in a timed race, your character jumps off at weird angles not of your choosing and so on, but I really did enjoy this game.If youre hell bent on yelling at a screen until everyone around you thinks youre totally mental and need to be medicated then this is the perfect game for you, btw I had to type this review with my toes because the straight jacket prevents me from using my hands, enjoy.
