This is one of those well made games and one that actually ignited the franchise if as of lately kinda becoming in stagant stage Im feeling about it without a established modern protagonist and this is first of third games starring Ezio in of his grand adventure. This one entails a bloody rampage on a Templar conspiratory.As for the game itself, the story is well done and actually gave you two Heroes, Desmond Modern and Ezio Past, and it follow up with from the last game Assassins Creed 1 with a intro narration to tell you what happened so far marks for that and a escape from facility that is ran by people who kidnapped you and kicked off the story for the franchise as well as to birth of our beloved hero whose humble rich style life is shattered later by machinations of a conspiratory. Throughout the game youll visit different cities with different information on different locations, buildings at the time of late 15th century, and both fictional and actual real people.Besides from the amazing adventure and good graphics at the time of actual release, game does offer you some side activities that actually would either contribute to the story graphs puzzles come to mind, serves mostly to enlarge your pocket to ensure you can get better armor, weapons, ranged ammunition, and smelling salts to restore your lost health, or get you a amazing armor set while doing the side activites that involve Assassins Seals. Later on in the game, you can get involved rebuilding a villia that seen better days has passed and look run down and murky that later, with investment, repay you later and build up its intrastructure as well unlocking new areas to explore as florins ticks in at treasure box.All in all, this game is perfect for those who want to be introduced to the franchises, if anyone chose not to do the very first game, and beloved Ezio series and Desmonds misadventure. Also, do not be fool by my amount of hours as I finished this game quite a few times on Playstation 3 game console as well its sequels.
