The game itself is a substantial upgrade from the first Assassins Creed, pretty much everything from the first game has been redone and polished to perfection. Everything from scenery, weapons, enemy AI, proper placement and design of buildings for climbing, level progression, difficulty curve has been implemented magnificently.Graphics are very pretty especially the scenery during the daytime, however sometimes the faces on people look...laminated.Variance on assassinations have expanded greatly in this game, you can pick and choose how you want to execute your kill. Everything from knives, swords, hidden blade, guns or just using plain fists.A masterpiece of a game, its like they actually listened to all the suggestions and criticism aimed at the first game and made Assassins Creed II.
