Following on from the first Assasins Creed, I had extremely high expectations for the second, however im afriad to say that it just simply did not live up to the expectations. The game spends far too long on building reputation and gaining skills and after a few hours of gameplay, the game itself just becomes intensly boring. Also, due to the graphic levels of the game, which admittedly are good, the game has to run on a very good quality PC/Laptop in order for the game to run will without sufficiant lag iin the gameplay. I would definately not reccomend this game, even when its on sale.
