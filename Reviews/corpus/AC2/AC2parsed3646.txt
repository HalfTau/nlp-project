I just played this for the first time and was compelled to keep on playing until I had collected and done everything. I never understood how Assassins Creed was so popular after playing the first one and writing the whole series off, but now I get it! This game is a modern masterpiece and is probably the sole reason that they went on to make so many Assassins Creed titles. You owe it to yourself to experience this game, if you havent yet done so. The story and the world is compelling, the mechanics are fun, I spent hours just wandering the city, chasing thieves and assasinating soldiers, and the lore is fascinating. I cant wait to try out the other Assasins Creed games!
