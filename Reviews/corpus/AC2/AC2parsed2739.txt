I just bought this game because i had it on my PS3 but my younger brother has the PS3 to himself because he has more games he plays than me, plus i have a better computer, but i bought this because i was missing the game, as soon as the download finished I started the game up to only get stupid Uplay saying that it wouldnt start i tried several times, restarted computer and looked up a few fixes this is the fix that made it work for melocate Ubisoft program folder eg. cProgram Files x86Ubisoftrightclick on the folder, select Propertiesclick the Security Tab and click Edit. Select your Users and set the Allow column of check marks to Full Control. Click Ok and close the rest of the windows.after 10 mins of dealing with Uplay i already hate and despise everything about it but i love the AC games hopefully no other problems arise.
