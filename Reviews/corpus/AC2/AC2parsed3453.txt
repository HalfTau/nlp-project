The games itself is a masterpiece. However Uplay ruins it. I had many problems installing the game and now steam doesnt detect whether Im in game or not. I cant shift  tab to open steam. And many other problems. Why, because Ubisoft is smart. Im buying games from steam because i want to play them from steam, not another silly app. I recommend this game and voted NO only because of Uplay.
