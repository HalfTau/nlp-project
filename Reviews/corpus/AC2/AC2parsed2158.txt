When the first Assassins Creed game came out, it was met with huge success right off the bat, but It did have a few essential elements it was missing, Such as being really repetitive, and being unable to swim. But the game itself was really good....But then Assassins Creed II came out and HOLY TURDSTAINS BATMAN. This game BLEW UP as soon as it came out. Everything wrong with the first game was perfected in this game. Give the player two HiddenBlades, A Friggin arm mounted pistol, and so much more. More quests, collectibles, Shops, Currency, more rewards. Great game.  9.9/10, Would insert itsa me Mario meme again.
