Not nearly as good as I remember it to be. I remember when I bought this game when it first came out on the Playstation 3, the audio was crystal clear. In this, its horribly compressed and sounds like the voices were recorded over the phone. This game also installs UPlay, and all of the t that goes with it.And when I went to play with my xbox controller, it didnt even recognize my triggers, and half the buttons were unmapped!In game, there are no prompts to tell you which button to press to do what. Only icons like head, attack hand, off hand, legs etc. It would have been much better if they actually which button to press like A,B,X,Y, or in the case of a KBM, E,Shift,Space,LMB.
