One of my favourite Games of all time. This mainly relies on the great atmosphere created, sucking you into 15th century Italy. The story is solid, with no special twists, but seems realistic and can offer great characters, before all, Ezio himself. Gameplay is fun, you can spend ages just running on the roofs of venice and firenze. Combat is just a bit too easy if you just wait for the right moment to counterkill, but if you just decide to try to make it hard yourself, it can be fun too. First Playthrough took me around 60h much of it just random freeroaming. Both, Controller and Keyboard work very well here.
