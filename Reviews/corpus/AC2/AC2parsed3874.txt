In my opinion, AC2 is the pinnacle of the AC franchise. It has a great story and atmosphere that was never quite matched by any of the other AC games.Ive recently come back to it after playing some of the newer AC games and I miss many of the small improvements that have been made to the combat system killstreaks, dual wielding, crossbow, call assassins but overall this is still my favorite AC game simply because this is the most polished AC game in the series. It also helps that Ubisoft finally relented with their misguided alwaysonline DRM so the current version of the game is playable offline.The only glaring issue Ive run into is the horrific xbox controller support this game has out of the box. The strange thing is that the game recognizes the xbox controller, but default control mapping is absolutely terrible and doesnt match the xbox version of the game at all and cant be made to match it. This appears to be due to a poor controller implementation where they treat the xbox controller as a generic gamepad so that the triggers are analog inputs that cant be mapped to button actions. Thankfully there is a fixbut its still sad that Ubisoft hasnt bothered to officially fix it despite the popularity of this game. I was able to use an xbox controller with the newer AC games without any issues.I still strongly recommend this game if you have any interest in the AC franchise.
