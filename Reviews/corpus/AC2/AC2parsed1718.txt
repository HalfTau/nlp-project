A MASTERPIECEIve played all the Assassins Creeds but the story and development of Ezio throughout 2, Brotherhood and Revelations truly makes me cry.It is rare in a game to find yourself so emotionally attached to a character as many are to Ezio. You literally track his story from birth to a young teen to a disciplined master assassin and later, in revelations, the most senior rank of Mentor.This game is truly one of the greatest gems in the entire gaming world, the gameplay, the open world, but most importantly the story, emotions and character development is like no other.I salute you Ezio Auditore da Firenze.
