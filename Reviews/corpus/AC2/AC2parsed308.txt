Assassins Creed II may well be the best of the series. I have been a fan of this series since the first game and between my PC version and the Xbox 360 version, I have logged close to a thousand hours on this game. Graphically, it is not the prettiest to look at by todays standards.However, it has an amazingly compelling storyline that will leave the player enthralled. The game world has so much to do and collect, youll not be able to put it down.
