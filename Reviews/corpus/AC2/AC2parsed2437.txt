it works well on mac mountain lion. But as a game.. just lame and boring, you just run around and have to press two buttons and you are set, just boring. Maybe because I had different expectation, and imaginded it to be like tomb raider where you have to solve puzzles and stuff but here is everything straight forward. Furthermore this game is declared as a stealth game, which I wouldnt call so. You cannot crouch and if you have to assasinate someone you cant bcause they immidiatly see you when you are behind them. Luckily I bougth in the sale otherwise I would have been more mad about myself for buying this game. Also I dont get the hype about the series.
