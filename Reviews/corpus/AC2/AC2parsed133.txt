I got a controller especially for this game because its just too hard to learn to play when all tips on how to do stuff are given in controller format rather than keyboard. Once you get a controller its lots of fun, its easy to get into and easy to fall off buildings, sometimes super frustrating but its very forgiving to let you try again. I especially enjoyed the stealth  missions, although it can be frustrating to get detected over and over. The tombs were you find the seals are difficult but interesting, and a very welcome break from the outside city area, because after a while it just seems weird to always be outside. I liked that the hardest challenges didnt involve overpowered monsters but just your own skill and a ticking clock. I loved the way you can try different vehicles, they all handle differently and keep things interesting. The npcs get in the way but theyre sassy and its fun to steal their boat. Im close to the finish on this one but looking to get the Brotherhood edition to conclude the story, that should tell you enough.
