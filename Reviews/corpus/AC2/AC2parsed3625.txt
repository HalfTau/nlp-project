A NEARLY FLAWLESS AND MOST EPIC EXPERIENCE, INCHES CLOSE TO BE RUINED BY THE VERY DEFINITION OF DRM AS A BURDEN TO LEGAL USERS.After so many years I finally got around to play Assassins Creed 2, from begining to end, I devoured the thing as if I had in my hands a classic of the golden era of gaming. Of course, it helped that my internet connection was down for a few days so it was just my and my backlog of games.While in the technical department it becomes obvious the game was held back by consoles, some texture pop in can be seen and the shadows, while full dynamic and very complete, they are also pretty low res, with no way at all of fixing both issues through configuration files.I really dont want to spoil it for those that still dont play it but suffice to say, the story kept my interest up all of the time, the missions being varied and enough side quests available to cover around 2030 hours of pure content, with a few hours set aside to pick every single item available.Now, this UnotPlay thing, when I got my internet connection back, it decided not only to lock me out of accessing the Uplay specific unlocks for the game, it also removed every single Upay units I had. Uplay units are a kinda neat idea in that instead of mere achievements, you gain points to unlock additional game content. Be that media, wallpapers, songs, or actual ingame stuff.At least I used to think it was a good idea, because now I have no way of accessing that last side quest that you can unlock with UnotPlay points. So, my nearly flawless experience was somewhat spoiled by a totally unnecesary layer of DRM that is poorly maintainted by UBI.Even with that, I still fully recommend everybody to play this, and the entire Ezio Trilogy, if anything, so you can appreciate the decay in the direction the series was taken to, and also the terrible efficience with which UBIsoft ruins their IPs.
