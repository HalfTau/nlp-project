A total step up from the first Assassins Creed. That was a great game, but AC II is even better. It has better controlswhich for AC on PC, the controls are already weird but once you figure them out in one game you have an easy time with the rest of the games, better gameplay, more to do outside of the main story line, and it has captions.
