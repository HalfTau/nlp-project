My oh my what a game! I loved it. Pretty much obsessed with it. This is the first AC game Ive ever played since Ive heard its the best AC game ever. The storyline is amazing, the character Ezio is very charming and hes friends with Da Vinci. The story is placed in Italy. You will NOT regret playing this game. PS instlal Uplay and you should be able to play this game with no issues.
