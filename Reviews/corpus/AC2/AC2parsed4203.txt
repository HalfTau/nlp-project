It was on sale and I deicded to finally play it because I was promised a realistic Venice beyond that, I hate the main storyline of AC games that messes with history and portrays assassins as good and templars as bad. I can never get over that.The good Better interface than Assassins Creed 1. Better everything than in the 1st game. Great atmosphere. Cities look great. When it works, the acrobatic action is really fun. There is enough stuff to do.The bad It is not openended when this kind of game clearly should be You cannot replay an earlier part of the game. There is only one savegame!!! Some of the acting is kind of lame, though most of it was ok. Some faces look/animate pretty badly It often forces the main storyline down your throat and wont let you get to the cool stuff if you dont go with it. Again, the game feels like it should be sandboxy and openended but it isnt really. You are forced to install and use Uplay from Ubisoft to play the game. Uplay will glitch out and not let you play or mess up your savegame and is just generally annoying and forced and I will make a consious attempt not to use it anymore. Obviously this is not entirely the games fault but, for such a famous game, I am surprised to see almost no mods for it. Again, the surprise is in the fact that sandboxtype games like this one usually have good modding support. When the parkour acrobatics system fails, it looks quite clumsy and annoying. The player has little control over the process as it simply involves holding 3 buttons together, so you cant get much better at it except by trying to turn your character better. The controls and interface clearly show that its a console port.So yes, there are many points that annoy me, but the game is still awesome.
