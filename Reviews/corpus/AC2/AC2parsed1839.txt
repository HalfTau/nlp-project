I cannot recommend this copy of this game. Its a great game to play dont get me wrong, but you cant use a controller. That makes this game almost impossible to play. If you really want it, get it on console or find something that allows you to use a controller. The first one did the same thing and it made me rage more than I needed to. Hope this helps.
