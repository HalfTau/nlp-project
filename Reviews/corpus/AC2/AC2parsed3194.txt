dont be fooled by my rating i love this game on console, and guess what this isnt on console. Ubisoft launcher broke so many times. i only got as far as getting the hidden blade than uplay just said  it, he got his 20 worth and didnt let me play the game anymore also the controls are . i know everyone else is praising this game i love it too but for the love of god dont play on PCGG Ubisoft you done ed it up
