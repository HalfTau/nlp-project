I loved the first assassins creed and I also love assissins creed revalations Both played on PS3. But I did not like this. But I dont believe its the actual game that is the issue. I believe that it is the fact that it is a terrible console port. Games made for console should stay on console, the transistion never works out well. My recommendation dont buy this on PC. Get it on PS3 or XBOX.See alsoThe other Assassins Creed gamesAny other shameless console port
