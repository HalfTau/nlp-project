If you played Assassins Creed or any of the other sequels but skipped this one, dont skip it any longer. They improved on much from the first game as well as its length. Each time I thought I was nearing the end there was more to do. Plenty to collect, plenty of optional missions and plenty of people to kill. If you like action games ala Tomb Raider, Splinter Cell etc, Id recommend this game. While they might be more shooting its still similar in some ways. The stealth isnt quite splinter cell and the jumping and climbing isnt quite Tomb Raider but combined its something different and great all its own. Im looking forward to playing the other sequels for more assassin goodness.
