Amazing Game! great graphics, gameplay was awesome. A little tricky at first but once you get it the game gets that much better. Different styles of assassination, different weapons, swords daggers throwing blades, refurbishing a city in the process, different armors, different variations of the colors for the armor. 5/5 Stars here
