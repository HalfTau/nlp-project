a great game, well made, love the story and the whole setting, but combat its more like key mashing.... which was kinda of a turn off, and control was a bit difficult to get used to to the point where i have to customize my own XD. ubisoft and uplay sign up is annoying, especailly when u r living in a not google friendly countryi would give 9/10 if it wasnt for uplay
