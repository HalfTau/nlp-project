With cities like Florence and Venice renaissance period reproduced on this scale its fun to just walk around and read about the buildings etc in the databasefor me anyway, lol. Improves on Assasins Creed 1 in every way. Some of the best mini game puzzles I have ever encountered in a game too. Well worth picking up for the price.
