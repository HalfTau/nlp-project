After 10 years and 35 hrs in game I finished the 1st assassins creed .only after I installed AC2 and started playing it .I found a new hope in finishing the first one .everything i didnt know i didnt like about 1st one was better in AC2. like all but the last  part of that 10 years was spent in Masyaf on the pick pocket mission granted it wasnt constant playing that whole time.It took AC2 to give me the will to finish it. with some reconfiguring of the controls to  make it easier to play i finished it. now im deep in to Ac2 and loving every minute.and cant wait to finish to play the others  working up to Orgins.
