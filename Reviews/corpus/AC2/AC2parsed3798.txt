Liked the game itself is fantastic, beautiful, and fun to play, with great story and music.Did not like game does not save. At all. Many people have a problem with save files being deleted in assassins creed. In my case, it does not appear that any save file are ever created. Everyone else describing save issuses seems to say that the game occasionally does not save progress. My game just does not save at all. The diamond saving game icon is normal and not stuck on my screen.I have tried turning off uplays CloudSync, which did not solve the problem. I have tried using a crack to bypass uplay as much as possible, did not work. I have tried copying save files to a backup folder, which one person claimed had worked for him. All to no avail.I have spent more time trying to fix this game than I have playing it.
