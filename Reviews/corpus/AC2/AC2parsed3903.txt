Assassins Creed II is the second game in the Creed Franchise No Sht Sherlock and is a great starting point. This is one of the those cases where the sequel is better than the original. Thats a good thing because thats what a great sequel should be, better. The Story is very intersting but can be confusing during some parts. One thing I kind of had a problem is putting Leonardo Da Vinci in the game because after about 1/3 0r 1/2 through the game he just stops being involved in the plot. The Gameplay is very fun like the Parkour but the combat is just Blech. I try to avoid combat because I dont like it very much and the noriety bar will fill up making guards recognize you faster. But since theres a lot of combat I recommend getting good armor and using the hidden blade as much as possible. One thing I didnt likeabout the ParkourThis is kind of a nitpickis that I would sometimes fall from 4 stories up and land onto a 1st story window being just fine. I know you could just say its Video Game Logic but Ive been doing more Parkour IRL and I find it Ridiculous that Ezio Auditore can do this kind of stuff. This next thing is random In the begining you play as him as a new born child.SPOILERISH I warned you. The ending doesnt make a lot of sense but I kind of understood it. at first I was with Desmond like, What. The. . but it kind of made a little sense.TLDR  Solid Story, Fun Parkour, meh CombatFinal Rating  8/10
