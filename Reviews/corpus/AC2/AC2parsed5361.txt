50 Hours to complete it to 100.The game is great as a fun tale to tell and be a part of, engaging characters and some very nice effects.The biggest problem is the controls. More suited to the XBox, some of the movements  in particular wall jump  really need to be revamped for PC. I actually spent 4.5 hours in the final Assassins Tomb to get the armour, because I kept falling off the ledges or doing a reverse jump into the water instead of jumping to the side.Some of the later missions are a real pain in the backside, as you spend ages quietly sneaking around and killing guards only to be spotted 3 feet from your main target... thereby having to restart the entire damn mission  and then once you get frustrated enough and just decide to use your sleeve pistol... the damn thing works and it only takes 2 minutes.Id recommend getting it and playing it only if you have an XBox joypad hooked up to your PC or if you like very tricky controls.
