As of right now, this doesnt work at all on macOS Sierra, I found out the hard way after downloading and installing it, with the Ubisoft Launcher stuck on a blank screen. Not happy at all! Sorry but I cant recommend this game at all if youre a Mac player. Assassins Creed 2 is a great game, but please buy it on another platform and save yourself the hassle!
