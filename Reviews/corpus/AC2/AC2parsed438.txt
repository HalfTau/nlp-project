If this is the best the AC series have to offer according to fans, i finally know what Trump did with his loan of a million dollar.ConsThe controls are made by monkeys, for monkeys.The optimisation was done by me one random night when i was wasted on liquor.The amount of glitches in this game make my life look like perfection.ProsHaving a large amount of freedom to approach each mission is pretty niceAssassinations are pretty satisfyingOverall 4/10Also, im gonna suggest a new death sentence to my local law enforcers, Death by using Ubisoft DRM. I can still faintly hear my computer crying for help against this monster
