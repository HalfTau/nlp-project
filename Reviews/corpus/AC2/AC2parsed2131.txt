Im sure the game itself is wonderful. But I cant say for sure. Because UPlay wont work. Thanks for nothing UbisoftEdit  Finally got the game to work on my computer after some digging around.  I still dislike connecting through UPlay and every once in awhile the game randomly closes while Im playing.  But the game itself is great.  The buildings and artwork are nicely detailed, transportation is nice, missions are interesting.
