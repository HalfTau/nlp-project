I think this is the 2nd best AC, only to Black Flag. Even without all the improved gameplay from the newer ones, this is probably the most compelling storyline out of them all. Enzio is a very welldeveloped character, and you feel that completing every quest main and side are a necessity to fully experience the game. Highly reccomended.
