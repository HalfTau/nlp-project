For everyone who is whining about UPlay, why not check the community, this is a great game, and most of the reviews are about UPlay. I had the issue also, thats when I found this Guideits easily fixable, took me 5 minutes. Some people also might have a soundcard issue audio playing through speakers and usually a quick restart will do the trick. And side note, controls are easily changedHopefully this helped and/or encouraged to purchase this fantastic game
