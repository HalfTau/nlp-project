U see now children before I had my eyes on the one and only Will SmithChan I always wished to be ravaged by a dashing Italian gentleman. It was always a dream of mine to have Ezio el Detorreto assassinate me, but that I would be able to seduce the fine italian some other way. He would grab my hand in his and we would go to the Sisteenth Chapel. I would lay back staring at the works of the Great Michael Angelo whilst he whispers sweet nothings in my ear. Oh he would penetrate with his blades alright but not the way that he had once planned to. Overall 2/10 passable.
