This game is AMAZING. You get to get into a fist fight... WITH THE POPE, you can climb all over REAL italian buildings like the Basilica de San Marco, fly Da Vincis ornithopter around cities, and make all these frickin epic assassinations on people who actually existed during the time period. Uplay isnt really a problem, it just gets annoying sometimes. Overall, AC2 is a great action game with many challenges and parkour. Even when you finish the game, there is still a ton of stuff to do. Revenge never felt so good.
