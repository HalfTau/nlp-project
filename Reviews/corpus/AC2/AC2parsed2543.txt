This is still my favorite AC out there. The game play is so clean and so solid that I had nothing horrible to say about this...Even when you finish the game and get all the achievements you can still have hours of enjoyment afterwards!I completed it on Xbox but Ive yet to complete it on PC, if you dont have this game, YOU SHOULD GET IT! Its extremely worth the extra cash.
