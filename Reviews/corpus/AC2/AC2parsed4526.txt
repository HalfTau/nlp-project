AC2 is more of an interactive history lesson than just a game, optional as it may be. If the history interests you its there in large amounts and you will likely learn a lot along the way. That aside the game is fluid and easy to enjoy. Its only downfall is that a Uplay account and a login is required, painful if you prefer singleplayer games and arent always connected to the internet. Id still give it 5 stars out of 5 especially for the price. Controller recommended but by no means required.
