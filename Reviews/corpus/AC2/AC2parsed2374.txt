UbiSoft gives A Service Not Availible error everytime I tried to launch. You would think that after all these years they would just patch it to DRM free. Their support website has nothing.Not worth buying, even for 5. Dont waste your money on this. Problems when it was new, problems now that its old. The only way to play this game seems to be a pirated copy.
