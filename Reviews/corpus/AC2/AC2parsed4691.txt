Ha, Im a bit late with this one.This is the first game in the AC series Ive ever had, and with just about 5 hours of gameplay Im enjoying it immensely. Graphics are very impressive considering its a 2009 release, and doent make my system struggle at all even though being a port. The historical effort put into this game shines through  Story outweighs other factors quite a lot. Only negative point is that the head, fists, leg etcetera symbols seem pointless, Id much rather them be keyboard or mouse keys, as in quicktime events I just dont know which button it wants me to press.4/5 overall review.
