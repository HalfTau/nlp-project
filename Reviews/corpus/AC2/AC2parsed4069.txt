Ubisofts Uplay malware blocks the game from working, never played it, waste of money. Steam and Ubisoft tech support ignore polite requests for help, probably because the Uplay malware is so shot its unworkable so they cant help anyway.I enjoyed the first Assassins Creed which I got free with a graphics card but looks like Ill not be able to enjoy another.
