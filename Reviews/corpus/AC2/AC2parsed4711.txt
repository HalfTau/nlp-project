The 2 more common complains for Assassins Creed were the amount of bugs, and the repetitiveness of the level and mission design. And Ubisoft really learned the lesson about the second one. Each city is huge, very huge, with hundreds of sidemissions, places to explore, objects to search and collect, a village to improve and much more. The plot gives a turn, showing for the first time was is really going on, and mixing science fiction with a touch of fantasy. And the multiple plot details, based makes the story much more credible. The visual aspect, even when is quite remarkable, is not what really stands out, but the absurdly amazing art and design. Again, each corner of the renaissance Italy is detailed, rich, full of life. One thing is disliked is that the game feels stretched, and when you think is going to be over soon, still has at least 3 hours of plot related gameplay. With only that flaw aside, the second title of the Assassins saga is a game that I wont stop recommending.
