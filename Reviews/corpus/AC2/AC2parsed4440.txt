Because I was so underwhelmed by how monotonous Assassins Creed was, I approached Assassins Creed II with much skepticism. I was pleasantly surprised by how much more likeable Ezio Auditore was as a protagonist, how the story was more captivating, and how the movement and combat systems were more refined. In short, Assassins Creed II was everything that the first game should have been! The game would have been just fine  nay, even better  without the embedded Desmond Miles storyline, too.
