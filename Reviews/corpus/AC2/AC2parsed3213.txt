Awesome game.Only con is that I didnt start to play it earlier.Yeah, combat is rediculously easy, but you dont play that game for combat I think. Its for the freedom of climbing everywhere and killing with awesome moves, where you afterwards have to remove a poster so everyone forgets that you are the only person walking around with Assassins clothes and tons of weapons. An ordinary citizen I guess.I dont really understand why Uplay is such a big problem, Steam just opens another Steam.Just get the game.
