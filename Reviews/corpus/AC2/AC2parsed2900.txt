I played through this game twice before, once on the PS3 and again on the X360, and I liked it so much I played through it again on the PC. I have to say this older game still looks great on the PC now in 2015 when I am writing this review. I really enjoyed the first game in the series, and this second game was such a wonderful surprise to see how they expanded upon it. I really enjoyed the story as well as all the explorations and variety of gameplay.With that said there was still some VERY frustrating moments in this game as the running/climbing/jumping controls still feel clunky. So many times Ezio will try to run up a wall instead of stopping, or will run along a fence instead of the street, or do his mime routine of stopping with his hands up in the air, or my favorite of jumping and completely  missing the haystack and crashing into the group.If you can find this on sale give it a try, very entertaining!
