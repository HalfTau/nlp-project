TLDR If youre not afraid to configure your Steam Controller, this is THE Assassins Creeds game to try out.You get to explore and scale Italys most beautiful monuments and locations although the outdoors might feel a bit empty, the short and enjoyable puzzles and collections will likely do the trick. Even the most annoying featherhunts are not too much of a bother in this first chapter of Actual Badass Ezio Auditores life.Although the combat might be clunky at first, the various approaches are equally fun you get to either sneak around or execute badass takedowns with a wide arsenal of weapons at your disposition. Of course the hidden blade stays the coolest!As for the the story and its pace, it might not be revolutionary, but you do feel invested by Ezios vendetta as it slowly unravel bigger stakes. Without spoiling the big plotpoints, the dualnarration of the game is really neat.If you dont mind the slightly outdated graphics, go for it!
