Im still getting through the franchise, but this one is a must. Ezio as a character is very well written and his story is quite touching. You will meet familiar characters from History lessons, probably kill some of them and hell will you enjoy it! All italian cities in the game are very nicely rendered and are just beautiful to look at from Eagles  synchronizing points, yknow, the big buildings you climb on, synchronize and then jump off? Yeah, these ones. Truth be told, buildings tend to repeat themselves, but thats a minor complaint. So hop on that flying machine that Leonardo built and kill some people! You wont forget it!
