The best of the AC series, by far.  Beautiful environments, much less slow/clunky/repetitive bits in comparison to the first game.  After this game, the series started taking a nose dive and becoming just a made for profit series, but this is the gold standard of AC.  Amazing story line, awesome/improved fighting mechanics, incredible graphics and scenery.
