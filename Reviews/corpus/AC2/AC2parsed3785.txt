I hate what Ubisoft did to this game. The autosave feature is broken. I put over 8 hours into this game and nothing was saved. I completed numerous missions which were all saved in the Animus DNA menu yet my saves where gone. I searched several forums where other users complained of the same problem and there were no solutions from Ubisoft to be found. The Uplay cloud sync was also dysfunctional. I completely regret the time and money put into this game.
