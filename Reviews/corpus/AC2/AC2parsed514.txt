The best Assassins Creed game there is. There have been more grandiose games that came later Brotherhood, Black Flag. But AC2 makes you feel like such a badass. Ezio is one of the best protagonists Ive ever known, and though I feel the Desmond storyline should never have been there, it feels good to see a modern connection to an otherwise Renessaincetimeline game.Combat is fluid and stylish, movement mechanics are so much better than AC1. Theres just so much to do and explore. I ended up doing almost everything with the exception of collecting feathers.1 would replay.
