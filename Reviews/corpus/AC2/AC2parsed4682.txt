From a gameplay perspective, this game is far superior to its predecessor. There are more weapons to choose from, more things to do, and more ways to deal with situations. Jumping around and climbing on buildings is still fun, and if thats all you care about, you might like this game.But I find the story in this game to be disjointed and confusing. If youre a history buff, you might find it easier to follow, but Im guessing that a lot of the historical names, places, and dates fly right over the heads of most players. I had to constantly look up characters and dates on Wikipedia to even know what was actually going on in the story.Ezios motivations seemed pretty strong in the beginning of the game, but after a while, I found myself wondering why he still cared about the Assassins or Templars or anything else. Sometimes I wasnt really sure why I was supposed to be killing my target, and as a player, that starts getting weird really quickly.And it would be nice to see more of presentdayguy I cant even remember his name! I think it starts with a D instead of focusing on Ezio for a almost all of the game. Playing through memory after memory of Ezio doing things that dont seem to relate to the presentday main character got old after a while.So somewhere amidst the plots twists and turns, it lost me. I havent finished this game and Im not sure I will.
