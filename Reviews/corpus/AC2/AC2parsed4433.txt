Assassins Creed 2 is considered by many to be the best in the series, personally I dont agree but its definitely one of the best.  It has a solid soundtrack, fun gameplay, and a good plot, the game is an improvment on Assassins Creed 1 in almost every way. However, be careful buying it as it doesnt seem to be very good at using the computers full hardware I have beyond the optimal specifications and I can only play the game on normal and it still seems to lag during gameplay more than a console, however I had a lot faster load times than a console when loading screens did appear.Now that I said something about the gameplay allow me to put my cents in on the dlc, there are two extra sequences added to the game through dlc and both are included in this deluxe edition. I was afraid the dlc might be a little weak compaired to the rest of the game but dont worry its pretty good, although I felt the second dlc featuring florence was pretty tedious as most of the missions are the same thing. If the game is on sale and you dont already own this game I say buy it, if you havent played Assassins Creed yet this is a good entrance to the series so dont be afraid to start here.
