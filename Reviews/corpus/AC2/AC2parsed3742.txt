Wow, i was so impressed, i heard about, Assassins Creed is the best Game ever, but its better. Yes, its better because its Assassins Creed 2, haha. I love Florence, and the history about the Medici. The Gameplay with my Controller is perfect. After i learned it, i never wanna play a game without controller. This game is a must have, for everyone. Gamedesign Controls Story
