Assassins Creed today is an annual franchise with plenty of spinoffs, and a cash cow for Ubisoft. But back in the day, it was a respected franchise because of the games own quality. For me and for many, the best game is still Assassins Creed II. And what an experience it is, following the story from an young Ezio to a more mature one, while visiting Florence and Venice. The story is well written and gripping, along with Ezio and its allies, especially its friend Leonardo Da Vinci. The recreation of Florence and Venice in the 15th century is an immersive one. The gameplay, although not incredible, makes of a good job in both combat and exploration. Theres also plenty of side quests and collectibles that really matters, and youll feel compeled to 100 the game, which isnt hard. The modern day sections are a bit dull, but they are rare. And the soundtrack is well composed. My only complain is that you cant replay missions. But still, its truly a modernday gaming gem.I also need to speak about my Uplay expecience personally, i didnt had major problems with it, except for the saves never uploading to the Uplay cloud, which is very common. It was more of a second launcher, and ingame youll forget it. But despite not having problems except for cloud saving, i dont support Uplay because it felt useless, has little features and still causes problems for many honest customers. I admit that Steam is still lacking in many aspects, but its truly the king when at least compared with Uplay.
