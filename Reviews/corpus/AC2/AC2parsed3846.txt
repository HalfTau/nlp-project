The start of the Ezio trilogy, considered as one of the best character to have such compelling background. Started of when he was only 17 years old and since then the beginning of him as an Assassin. It took me 46 hours just to complete this game. 2 Tries. And thats not even 100 completion. There is just so much in this world. The hidden secret and all of those things. Despite being a 5 year old game the replayability of this game is just amazing. The game start off at an amazing pace telling you what happen in the previous game quite well.I have never played Assassins Creed, but I heard that this one is the Holy Piece in the Assassins Series and boy I was not disappoint by it. Great game.For me here is the pros  cons Pros  Great story. The story of Ezio from the age of 17 till he is around in his 40s. The game graphic still looks Ok for my eyes. Stabbing people in the back has never been so good. So many hidden secrets. Great replayability. Gameplay pretty fluid Requiescat in PaceCons  F UPLAY is sh Still some minor bug For me this is an 8.5/10. Get the whole trilogy of Ezio if its on sale. But be prepare for the shtty Uplay.
