This game is quite impressive, even though its got a few years on it, it remains a strong and enjoyable game, that I can honestly reccomend to anyone seeking action, adventure, lots of insight into a new world, and a ton of awesome free running.This game has a very solid story, maybe a bit fantastical to some degree, but solid nonetheless, by that I mean it keeps you hooked, you want to know what happens next, you want to know how this happened, and you want to excperience this feeling over, and over again.I might be a bit biast, but Im not too worried about that, this game is great,which is why I would wholeheartedly tell you to get it personally if I got, but I cant, so this should do.
