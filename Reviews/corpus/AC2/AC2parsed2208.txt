This is a massive improvement on the first Assassins Creed game. Lots of new features that just make gameplay more enjoyable. Things I liked A noteriety system. Instead of guards being more easily aggravated as the game progresses, you build noteriety through assassinations but it can easily be reduced by tearing down some wanted posters. No more accusations of infidelity for climbing a ladder! Dungeons to explore. Theyre like mini levels and at the end you get some treasure and money. Theyre laid out for optimal leaping and climbing and very satisfying to complete.No more galloping around the Kingdom to get to places and then never exploring the area again. You just go to the edge of the map and click where you want to go. Also a bit more believable than Damascus and Jerusalem being a 2 minute horseback ride away. This is a hard one to say whether I like but you dont investigate the assassination targets anymore. Personally I found that quite dull and repetitive. You dont have to save monks or beggars anymore either. It feels a lot more like you choose what to do which is great because for me AC will be about having the freedom to do whatever you want like climbing the Sistine Chapel, punching lepers etc.The music is lovely.Things I didnt likeThe combat is a bit too easy, it would be nice to have a bit more of a challenge but it does make you feel like an unstoppable badass.Leonardo Da Vinci. Yeah hes in this game and gives you upgrades. I know AC is really historical and filled with real figures but he just feels weird and out of place. Very small niggle though. At least hes nice.GET THIS GAME! Its great if you liked the first one and if you didnt its still a lot better and more engaging so buy it anyway.
