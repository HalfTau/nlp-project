Mostly an improvement on the first Assassins Creed game apart from the three annoying sequences where you have to control various vehicles, but still not worth playing today.Some of the biggest problems Platforming challenges some of them timed where only the real challenge is the awkward and uncontrollable camera angles. The most fun part freerunning around the cities is restricted to stop you actually having too much fun. All combat situations and most assassinations can simply be blundered through without any need for skill or improvement. Gratuitous sexism and cultural insensitivity. Pacing and uninspiring writing make it a pretty tedious experience that feels much longer than it is.Good things Its very easy to amass an obscene amount of money quite early on, so you never have to scrounge to afford better equipment. Upgrading the villa and finding the collectibles is pretty fun. I like that in several missions, failing to achieve an objective is unavoidable  I dont play many games where this is the case, although it does feel very forced at times.The most intriguing thing about the game for me has been wondering if Michael Gough is the voice actor I thought I recognised from Skyrim, or if that was someone else who may or may not actually have worked on Skyrim.Arkham City and Deus Ex Human Revolution both deliver much better gameplay experiences of the general type this game seems to want to deliver. I recommend playing one of those instead.
