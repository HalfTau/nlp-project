In my personal opinion this is the better Assassins Creed Game, it has a good plot, great gameplay, graphics are good for the year of release, exept for the horrible draw distance, a lot of side quests and character improvements, armors, weapons , art and s.h.i.t for your villa, that produces more money if you invest in it, etc. well ...very good game buy it.
