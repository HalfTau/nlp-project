Unfortunately I have to be critical in my review here, but let me make something clear as a game AC2 is good, but not as a product. At least, not in my experience. Having purchased through Steam, I was forced to use uPlay. This was broken from the off as I could not play the game with an online connectionsearching for a server or whatever and so I had to disconnect uPlay.The game did not run well either, but I wont whine about why it should. My PC will run games such as Crysis, BF3 and Skyrim fine on moderate settings, but no matter what I tried AC2 just ran poorly. I accept this is sometimes the way with PC gaming, but I felt it was just another nail in the coffin.My recommendation here is no simply because I have been put off playing what I purchased by the sheer hassle I encountered.
