So much better than the first! When I first started this one I was disappointed that it wasnt as dark as the first and seemed lighthearted and goofy. Then I realized that that was the point, and the end was plenty dark and spectacular. Gameplay still is ed in terms of controls, but its something you get used to and can cope with. It doesnt subtract from the game too much. The music is really good and immersive. The voice acting is sooo much better than the first. All around, this is a great game. And everyone says the series gets better and better so I bet Brotherhood is going to be amazing! 9/10
