Assassins Creed 2 is by far the best game in the franchise. The gameplay combat, missions, roaming is excellent and the storyline is quite compelling. A minor point of criticism is that the ingame economy is pretty broken to the point where money literally wont be an issue in the longrun.Overall, Id definitely recommend playing Assassins Creed 2 first instead of the other games. The first game lacked variation in missions and wasnt as immersive as I thought it would be and it clouded my opinion of the franchise as a whole. If youre just getting into the franchise, Id recommend playing this game first and play AC1 after youve finished AC Brotherhood.
