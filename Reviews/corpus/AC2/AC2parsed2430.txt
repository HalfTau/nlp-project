This is the best AC game ever made, and Ezio is indeed one of the best character in gaming history which is why the made 3 AC game about him. The best thing about this game is its awesome character development. Everyone is a lively person with flesh and blood, with unique personalities and ways of speech. And plus, it is very historically accurate, and LEONARDO DA VINCI is your homie, whats not to like?
