By far the best Assassins Creed game in the series. The story gets you instantly involved the moment you start the game and it flows in a manner that avoids repetitiveness. Aside that, the characters are all unique in their own way and none of them feel flawed as they help shape the story during progression Not to mention the voice acting is top notch. Theres a wide variety of weapons to use that you also unlock throughout the story, and each one has special uses which can shape the outcome of approaches during missions.The economical system in Assassins Creed II is fantastic. You can buy weapons, armour, armour dyes, medicine and artwork. This system in general gives the player the choice to do what they want with their money.When it comes to graphics, the cities are extremely vibrant and attractive. Models and textures for the time are appealing and hold up well. Optimization wise, the game runs pretty much flawlessy and presents no stutter, lag or other FPS issues.The only downside to this game is that you need a Uplay account with the Uplay launcher running with the Steam launcher. Thats if youve bought this game on here.Overall, this is an Assassins Creed game worth buying. The first game would be a sensible starting point for those interested in knowing Desmonds story the main character.9/10.
