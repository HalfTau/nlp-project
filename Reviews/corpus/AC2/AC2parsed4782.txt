This was my first introduction into the Assassins Series and it would be an excellent beginning point thanks to the ease of gameplay and the excellent story. It begins Ezios line of story and is very engrossing and the freeroaming mechanicals are fantastic. I still thoroughly enjoy playing this game, and the series revolutionized the sandbox genre by paving the way for compelling story AND gameplay.
