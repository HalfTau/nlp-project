Overall 8,75/10Careful! While reading my review you are exposed to a risk of breaking into tears. Read at your own risk!Assassins Creed 2 has got many new fancy features and starts a new aspect from a new protagonist but does not entirely leave the previously one Altar IbnLaAhad. Also a new storyline starts from 1459 at Florenz, Italy actualy 1467, where you begin to play one of my personal favourite key features. This game is satisfying long to play and comes in with new suprises. Also some history characters are playing some role here too. Good! I had my joy with this game.As for Desmond Miles his tale goes on...The BAD things of Assassins Creed 2 are UPlay! What the fakc? I dont need another useless program running on the background with my processor and slowing overall performance down! Because UPlay has problems with me, I had to bypass this by modifying certain UPlay files to get this to work. Sometimes AC2 appears to be crashing randomly on any action if i play for a long period of time about 1 hour Some necessary settings are resetting after EACH start of AC2. These are 2. Subtitles  OFF from ON and mouse sensetivity X  Y  5/10 from 9/10 Lucy Stillman has a much different and ugly skin. I dont see her as Lucy Stillman from the first AC!I do not recommend to pay for this game since the developers have gone on a moneyhunt and are releasing since AC3 nonassassin games with cheap tricks. AC 2 IMO is still a good game and is worth playing. I do not support the devs any further because their products have gone worse and I still have the inability to play it clean without UPlay.
