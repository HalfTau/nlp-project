Definitely a stepup from the previous game. Not a whole lot of repetitiveness this time around, especially because of the new character and new age.If youre playing backwards III  Revelations  Brotherhood youll probably feel gameplay gets progressively harder especially in the movement and fighting factors.  The introduction of chain killing in Brotherhood as well as the kick skill made that game fairly easy to complete.  Without it, AC2 can prove to be a challenge in its own right.
