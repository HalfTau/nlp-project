Much slicker and cleaner than the first. I have issues with the way camera control was handled in that it frequently switches from 3rdperson to platformer in midleap. Ezio is much more fleshed out as a character than Altair was, the missions are somewhat repetitive find your target and kill him, but Renassance Italy has been very well crafted and its just a lot of fun to run around in. A good variety of side missions and enough Da Vinci Code kind of stuff to satisfy the most diehard conspiracy buffs. One early mission is especiailly hinky in the Steam version, but once past that, its very smooth.
