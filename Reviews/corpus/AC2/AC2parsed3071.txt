This game is fantastic and I mean fantastic... for its story.  The gameplay is redundant, sticky, glitchy as a pre alpha.  I havent played the console version in awhile but from what I remember these glitches were mostly nonexistent.  Ubisoft seemed to accidently put the alpha on steam or something.  Not to mention to use a controler which you pretty much have to considering the controls are about as good as playing it with a potato are almost impossible to map out I had to download some sketchy .ini files of the internet just to get the game to work.  Ezio never seems to do what I tell him to do when I click buttons and the parkour never works Ive found walking gets me places easier.  Im a PC gamer and this is the only time Id say go buy the console version. Worst PC port of all time.  Do not buy on PC unplayable.
