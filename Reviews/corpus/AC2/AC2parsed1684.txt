This game is for everyone who enjoys stealth and assassingames with great stories.It is better than all its descendants, the last whole game with the unique puppeteer control and the ultimate AssassinsCreed feeling to it. Maybe with the exceptions of Assassins Creed Revelations and Brotherhood, but those are more like DLCs.I can only recommend it, especially to those people, who started with a later version of the series and are terribly disappointedYes, the franchise was ed, but it was awesome once!GIVE IT A CHANCE!
