The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenthcentury Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forl, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside.The Animus 2.0, a new version of the machine of the same name present in the previous game, provides ingame context for changes and additions to several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters and services that the player encounters.The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the character to recover only from minor injuries. More grievous injuries require visiting a streetside doctor or use of medicine which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies.The player can now swim in water which was not possible in the first game and Eagle Vision  the ability to identify specific people and landmarks  can now be used in thirdperson view and while moving.The player can row gondolas, as well as ride horses at any point in the game where they are readily available between towns and cities. The combat system is more complex than that of its predecessor, with the ability to disarm opponents using counterattacks while unarmed.Weapons like swords, cutlasses, maces, axes and daggers can all be purchased from vendors in each city.The player can also pick up any weapon on the ground or use improvised weapons, such as brooms or halves of a spear.In addition, players are able to purchase artwork for their villa, obtain new armor as the game progresses, and even dye the characters clothing with a number of different colors.

Doing this is supposed to train Desmond in the ways of the Assassins through the Bleeding Effect of the Animus.Ezios memories begin during the Renaissance in the 15th century, where his family is ensnared in a mysterious political plot.After his father and brothers are executed for supposed treason, Ezio follows his father Giovannis last advice, finds his fathers Assassin tools, and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Marios villa in the countryside.Mario assists Ezio in discovering the people behind the conspiracy, the search leading Ezio from Florence, to San Gimignano, Forl, Venice and eventually to Rome.As he identifies and assassinates more and more political figures, Ezio also gains several allies, including Niccol Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci  the latter of whom helps Ezio improve his equipment using schematics found in the old Codex pages of Altar.Ezios long journey for vengeance and answers shape him into an efficient killing machine and as he gets closer to the truth  and the people responsible for his brothers and fathers death  the great conspiracy only grows bigger and more confusing...My opinionsI first played this game on the Playstation 3, immediately after its release in November 2009.After finishing the first game almost a year earlier, the hype for this next installment of the series was very big.This was one of the rare occassions were such extreme hype and expectation especially for a Ubisoftgame was NOT met with disappointment.I was hooked with the game for days straight and loved almost everything about it.It felt much bigger, much more free and much more interesting than its predecessor  all of which were because it WAS bigger, more free and had a more interesting story.Except that the cities of Florence, Venice and Forl offerred more diversity than Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre, the story also felt more intriguing and made me want to continue  want to know how Ezios journey would end.Since this game  and possibly because of this game  I have bought every new Assassins Creedgame, which are released on an annual basis nowadays.I would mainly recommend this game for people who have played its predecessor.Although it is possible to start out with this game since some brief explenations are made in the beginning, I highly recommend playing the first game before starting this much better sequel.Assassins Creed remains my favourite franchise out of all video games to date and this is one of the series best installments.
