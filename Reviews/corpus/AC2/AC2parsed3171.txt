 considering how old the game is, the graphics is beyond awesome astonishing setting in precisemodelled, realisticlooking Italian cities, all free to explore tons of content sidequests, upgradable gear  mansion, hidden treasures, collectibles etc. variety of ways to move  fight educative value of the games encyclopaedia which is also full of funny details despite all the ire against Uplay, I was able to run the game smoothly and aside from inital setup Uplay gave me no trouble the background story is IMO quite dumb resembling The Da Vinci Code, but worse and the ending is particularly loony I liked the individual historical fragments of the narrative though Assassin Tombs full of absurd riddles and features eg. sliding timers on the walls inside St. Marco, Venezia disrupt the plausibility of the setting reminded me of Tomb Raider  which is not a compliment many unrealistic moments like your Assassin mentors never really helping you, cities are full of bards and you are their only target to annoy, or the guards who detect you a milisecond before you cut their throat when no one else is around while some missions have to be performed without being detected, although your target has nowhere to flee bad game economics by the end of the game I had like 300k florins with nothing to buy camera issues mainly in interiors and combat frequent instant failures and lacking reload checkpoint button quitting to menu and restarting isnt convenient
