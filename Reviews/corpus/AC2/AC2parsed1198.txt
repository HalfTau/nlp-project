Im actually VERY disappointed because of this pathetic service. I bought the deluxe CD key a long time ago on a slow desktop I used to have but its now broken and fried. I have a new laptop and it wont let me use the key on this computer EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE ACCOUNTS IT WAS USED ON AND PROOF OF PURCHASE. Highly unsatisfied and will NEVER buy another CD key from Uplay ever again. I want the game I purchased back NOW. I am warning everyone reading this, if you buy a game from Uplay, dont get a new computer. Just saying. Uplay is basically a scam/con. By the way, I bought this key along with a standard AC3 key on steam but its used for Uplay, I cant use either of them.
