This game continues the story of Desmond Miles, an individual who has been chosen for an experiment with genetic memory, where he relives the story of his ancestors. AC2 is the beginning of the story for Ezio Auditore, a young Italian guy who helps his father, a merchant, run the family business. Little did he know about the family business, and that he was about to become a key piece in the Assassins history. Without a doubt, one of the new generation classics.
