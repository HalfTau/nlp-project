What a great game, i have played the first title and didnt even finish it because it was immensely repetitive. This is by far better than the first one. Even if you didnt like the first assassins creed this game is a must play title with great additional features, better story, graphics, game play and lots other improvements. Best part that i like is the freedom of having a non repetitive game with lots of side missions and great missions with different tasks that will never get boring.All in all great game with large maps and great locations, definitely a must buy!
