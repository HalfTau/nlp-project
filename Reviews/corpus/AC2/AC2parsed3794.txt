Although AC2 is a great game, this game was a collassal pain in the  to install. You have to jump through all these Ubisoft Uplay hoops after you buy it. You will have to go to Uplay and download the Uplay installer, etc. And after that, if you are playing with an Xbox 360 controller like I am good luck with that! Another pain in the . The icons for the controller ingame dont make any sense. Instead of A,B,X,Y like they are on the controller, the icons are pictures of an ARM, LEG, HEAD, and something else. And you cant change them. Sounds like no big deal, but trust me, its very frustrating. Makes the game almost unplayable. For instance, Im trying to loot a body after killing the guy, but instead of LOOTING his body, Ezio will throw a punch. Or if you are in a fight and you wanna punch someone, you might end up taunting them or grabbing them. And the camera angle is terrible. Half the time you cant even reposition the camera, so you are being attacked offscreen by someone you cant even see. The controls are ing BS!!! Ubisoft developers ruined this game. They didnt have to make this so unplayable.My only consollation is that I just bought the one ASSASSINS CREED game. I was going to grab them all because they are on sale for 5 each right now. I am so glad I didnt buy the rest. I would have been superoff.Ill never buy another Ubisoft game again. If this is how they want to treat their customers.....  em!
