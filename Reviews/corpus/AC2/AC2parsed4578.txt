This is the first Assassins Creed that I have tried and I chose this one based on what seems to be popular opinion.  I was excited to try it for myself.  The game is terrific but getting the download to launch was inconvenient at best.This game requires Ubi Softs Uplay software to launch.  After downloading Assassins Creed II from Steam, the software will install itself and attempt to launch the game.  I dont know if this works for others, but it did not work for me.  I uninstalled the Uplay software that Steam installed and downloaded a current version directly from Ubisoft.  I registered an account on Uplay and then relaunched Assassins Creed II from the Steam client.  This worked and I was able to play.The content of the game itself is very good and the extra steps are worth it.  Popular opinion wins.
