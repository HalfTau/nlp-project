8.5/10  My Opinion, The second instalment in the AC series and the continued story ofIyou buy this game if you are in to RPGs and or 3rd person games this is why.Firstly the actual gameplayfrom the original game. There is nowas well asthat have been added to the game. Also in combat, you will find aas well as diffrent types from, to however, there are also variousthat you will come to learn if you buy the game for meAnother pointer I would like to add is that for some of the people playing the game, they found it hard to getting used to the controls although, for my experience, I didnt have a problem at all. If you are struggling with the controls you can add an Xbox 360 controller, steam controller or change the controls to your exact liking.Secondly,, Itsas the original, Containsandduring the duration of the campaign and continues the slow and steady spill of information about. My only negative thought about the game is the fact that, however, that is just a minuscule error compared to this otherwise.There has been so much added into this game and soo many features that your going to love to strive for. Overall I recommend this game highly and I hope to see you playing soon.
