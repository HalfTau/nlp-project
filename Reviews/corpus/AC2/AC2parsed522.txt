Great chapter in AC series. Vast open world, plenty of missions, beautiful graphics for the time, charismatic characted but also a little bit annoying to me, good story, a great expansion to AC1 in terms of overall gameplay. Also neatly optimised for older PCs. One of my favourite chapter in the series.Overall verdict 8/10
