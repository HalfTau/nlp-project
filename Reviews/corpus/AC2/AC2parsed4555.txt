The Assassins Creed series has thrived ever since the beginning of the game. In this title, you play as Ezio, who is in the search of the people who killed his family. Assassisn Creed II is an amazing game if you like stealth games, but this one is much less modern so you deal with knives, swords and guns that supposedly invented at this time period.You will love this game if you like to complete missions dealing with assassination, stealth and the storyline. This game as a rich storyline and will tempt you to buy the other titles like Brotherhood, Revelations and Black Flag.My only Problem?You have to download and run U play in order to play this game, which is the most annoying thing to deal with. U Play failed to save my work in this game 5 times in a row, which is why I have more playtime in this game than usual. However, look up some fixes for that as you can fix it yourself.8/10 9.5/10 without U Play
