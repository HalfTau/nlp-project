I can see why this game for so long was the most popular of the Assassins Creed franchise. The gameplay and the environment were definitely an improvement from the first game, and the story also very compelling. Part of it, I think, is that Ezios life is explored much more deeply than any other character in the franchise. I liked him a whole lot more than the stoic and rather dry character of Altair, or even Connor. I havent had a chance to play Black Flag, so I cant compare 2 and 4 as of yet.EDIT Ive finally finished the game and I have to say, one of the assassination missions near the end was waaaaaaaaaaaaay harder than the final boss. I spent about 1.5 hours trying to successfully assassinate a guy on a boat, but i kept getting seen and desynchronized. 11 guys defending a boat is overkill.Anyway, AC2 continues to be my favorite Assassins Creed game. The origin story of Ezio gives it incredible replay value, because most games I play are for the story.
