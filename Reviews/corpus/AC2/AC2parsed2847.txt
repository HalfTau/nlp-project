Assassins Creed 2 is infintely better than the original. The developers were able to take everything I hated about the first one  EXTREMELY repetitive gameplay, boring dialogue and characters, ugly color palette, etc.  and made vast improvements on it. If youre on the fence about getting this game because the first one left such an awful taste, give this one a try at least. You should not regret it.
