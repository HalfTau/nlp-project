i wish that i could give this game a real review  of the story, the visuals, etc. but i cannot, because  you guessed it  uplay! the stupid thing never got past its a ubisoft service cannot be reached blah blah blah t and i figured that it would just never happen and id never get to play this game.anyways, ive asked for a refund. dont buy from ubisoft. i know it sucks, i REALLY wanted to play this game, but i guess ubisoft doesnt care in the slightest for its customers except as walking dollar bill signs. so  you, ubisoft. you.
