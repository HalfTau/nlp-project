ProsGood storyline probably one of the best in AC.Graphics arent awfulAble to run well on most computersAmazing combat.ConsThe controls are a mess, in most games controls dont bother me I usually just use the default controls. But AC2s controls where that bad I had to customise them to make it a bit playable and comfortable.Overall AC2 is one of the best games Ive played, it is okay on PC but I would get it on console. However nothing will make me say that AC2 isnt a brilliant game... even when the controls are awful7/10
