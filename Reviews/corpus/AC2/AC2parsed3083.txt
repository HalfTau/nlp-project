Assassins Creed 2 requires Uplay.Not convinced yet? Then read on...Uplay sucks and wouldnt save ANY progress in AC2. I wasted several hours replaying the game from the beginning since it wouldnt save any progress. I found a reliable, but stupid fix for those of you who still want to play this game1. Go to2. Download the save file you want.3. Replace your old save file with the newly downloaded save file.4. Launch the game and load the downloaded save file.I finished Assassins Creed 2 and its actually a really good game. Its pretty much the same as Assassins Creed, but with some small improvements and a MUCH better story.
