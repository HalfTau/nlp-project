AC2 is so many Desmond Miles ahead puns! of the first game, it stands solidly alone as its own title. While the PC controls arent too shabby, its best with a controller, and the visual fidelity from being on a PC is very much appreciated. With intuitive climbing, combat, and general allaround gameplay, AC2 has it all. Interesting sidestories, great, varied missions, wonderful characters, amazing levels and tactics, weaponry, voice acting, art style... they did their research. Its everything AC1 was and better. From score to story, graphics to even just the way you can slightly change cutscenes, buy new weapons, armor, dye it, build up your villa, and collectibles that have actual, storybased rewards and not just an achievement... Assassins Creed 2 is a great, deep title. 10/10
