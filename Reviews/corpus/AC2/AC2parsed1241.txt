The one  only Assassins Creed game that has the best and touching story from start to end.By the way, I have this big dream to go on a tour to Italy But after playing Assassins Creed II, I almost know all the places now that going to Italy is not even an option.Beautifully designed Italy,Venice,Florence,Tuscany 310.0/10A great start to Ezios trilogy, Just WoW!Thumbs Up...
