ProsAmazing large world to play in. Excellent story unlike previous game player takes on main protagonist from the beginning of its assassins livelihood and purpose.The story has lots of humor to it, keeps thing fresh through the game.Better Combat system from previous gameVisually impressive for its timeGame runs smooth.Plenty to do, side missions are fun, big variety in assassination missions.ConsUbisoft DRMBad controls, game does not give any indication of hotkey during the game, have to go to menu to look them up, It assumes game runs with xbox controller, definitely bad port.Game map is lagging, no idea why.
