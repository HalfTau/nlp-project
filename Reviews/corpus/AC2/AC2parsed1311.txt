Do not buy this game if you intend to play it on a Mac Although honestly you should be trying to, you should be trying nto change to PC like I am because it hasnt worked on OS X since Snow Leopard roughly 6 years ago. I cant actually tell you anyhthing about the game because I havent been able to play it but I imagine you can take a guess based on the other reviews.
