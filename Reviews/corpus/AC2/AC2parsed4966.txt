MUCH better than the first game! Although it feels pretty clunky sometimes and is still a little repetative/tedious, I had a LOT of fun playing this through to the end. Travelling all across Italy, climbing across gorgeous churches and tombs, a much more satisfying final boss fight, but yet another confusing ending xD Im sure it will all be explained in the next games!8/10
