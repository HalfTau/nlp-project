The thought of leaving Altair behind to play with this new character sure looked like a bold and not so wise idea. The fact is, Ezio is by far the best Character Ive played in any AC I havent played Unity and Rouge.Note Ive beaten the game for Xbox 360, but Ive decided to buy it to collect the series now on Steam!
