The best Assassins Creed will ever be. 1 was a failed experiment, 2 perfects it, 3 is a confused mess, 4 would be better without the AC baggage, 5 is broken and generic, and the spinoffs never had the support they needed to live up to their potential. Theres a reason 2 is the only game in the series with its own sequels.
