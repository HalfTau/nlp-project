Way better than Assassins Creed, the missions are more interesting, different and complex. There is more humor and Ezio has more character than Altar. Playing this on PC was challenging at first because the button signs are head, armed hand, hand, legs etc. instead of numbers or other things. Tip get a PC controller, makes all the running WAY easier
