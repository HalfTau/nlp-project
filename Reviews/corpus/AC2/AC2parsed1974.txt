This game includes a good potential but apart from the essential unilaterally storyline is this game build with a less varied diversity mechanic after ours of tutorials and guides you have to do the same thing in cirten ways. Even for a older game asassasins creed 2 it doesnt fit into the claim for this year. But sereously this game can be a good thing even the way u climb buildings is originally and i like it tho.
