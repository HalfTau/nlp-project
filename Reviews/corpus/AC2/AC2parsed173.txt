An evolution on the first title. Contains a comparable amount of generated content. There is a noticeable uptick in volume of the handcrafted story. Quality of the story telling wavers at times, but overall provides a sufficient enough backdrop to push the proceedings. While the first titles graphics show nicely even in 2017, the sequel has an oily feel. Things are not helped by plentiful use of closeups, which accentuates the edges and dates the title considerably. The first title used much more sensible angles for story cinematics. The main protagonist is substantially more likeable and overall the story feels planned out and not just put in at the last moment as it was with the first one. Vistas are comparable to the first title. The main difference here are heterogenous layouts of maps within cities. Both small and sprawling cities are present. Combat is not stale yet, there is progress on the AI behavior, although the fights are seldom challenging. The music is mostly hit and miss with a too small number of appropriately selected environmental music. Parkour still feels great and the game is worth getting for only the excellent moment to moment gameplay.
