The best of the AC series imo. No other game had as great a story, and the nifty things you get to do with certain items and sequences make this game so much more fun than AC1. At this point the money earning system hasnt been completely inundated with tasks like you will see in ACs 3 and 4, but actually serves a purpose in helping game play and earning 100 in items and gear. Much love to this series, and to Ezio! ALso, no game has made me cry like this one, or squee as hard over wonderful mothers
