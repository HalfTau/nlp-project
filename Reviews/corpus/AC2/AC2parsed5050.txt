Unlike its predecessor, AC2 is strongly storydriven. There is no more stalking of your prey through sidequests and progress is handled solely through the story. Sidequests now simply have you do a specific task related to some of your skills.This can work out, as it allows you to rush through and get the most out of the story, while still allowing you to partake in any particular activity. Want an assassination mission? Go find a pigeon stand and off you go.Combatwise, AC2 is an overall improvement on everything. The dual blades work just as effective as you would imagine they have and you can buy your own weapons. Leaving you free choice over your main weapon, as well as your offhand.Because of how the story works, youll always feel a sense of lineairity in the story. But since we are revisiting memories, this is perfectly excusable. And your approach to a combat situation is often left open anyway. You are free, within boundaries.The landscapes and towns are a sight to behold, and the characters feel interesting too, albeit not enough explored by my taste. save for EzioIf you dont mind an AC game that is more storydriven, its worth buying to follow the story.
