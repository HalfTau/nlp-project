This is garbage. The standard gamepad controls dont work left and right trigger for look left and look right??? and when I try to remap the controls it doesnt recognize my triggers at all. On a game THIS old a gamepad mapping that makes sense should come standard. I shouldnt need to alter the game files in order to get a controller to work on a AAA title. Screw this game. Screw ubisoft.
