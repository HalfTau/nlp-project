While Assassins Creed II is a great game it also serves as a metaphor for the influences of history. There never has been groups like the Assassins or Templars as the game portrays. However the influences both groups claim to have over history is quite real. The Assassins and Templars serve as the personified symbols of higher human needs and social viability. No one man like Ezio can truely change hisotry, but their zeal and efforts to do so provide the motivation that encompasses certain generations. The two best examples in the game are Machiavelli and Sofonerola. Each was influenced in the game by direct and tangible objects, the Assassins and Apple respectively. But in actuality their actions were just as influeced by their circumstances. Machiavelli through his isolation and uncertainity of ruling arisitocratic families. And Sofonerola through a reactionary attitude to create and preserve a more viable lifestyle without the vanities of the Renaissance.
