When this game released I almost couldnt believe how amazing it was! I enjoyed the gameplay as much as the storyline. The soundtrack composed by Jasper Kyd is unbelievable, it places you in 15th century Italy, while still keeping a small piece of modern musical influence creating a masterpiece in my opinion!Eight years later its just as good as I remember!! !Love the history lessons tooLittle issue with the ubisoft launcher
