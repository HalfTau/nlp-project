Assassins Creed II picks up right where the original Assassins Creed left off so play the first game before this one. The dual storyline continues to be interesting. ACII improves on every single aspect of its predecessor. The story is more engaging, the gameplay has been refined to nearperfection within the scope of the game engine, and the characters have more interesting personalities. Ezio is a charasmatic and likable protagonist that clearly grows over the years that the game covers without sacrificing all the reasons why hes so likable.
