In my eyes the best AC game ever made. Ezios humor ist to die for, the gameplay is different in each level, you can do so many things liek buying art, new clothing, learning fight moves and you dont need to. You can. Florence looks the prettiest, the music lets you imagine dressing up like the dudes with dem money, and hell, the plot is all about family and that blood doesnt need to connect you.
