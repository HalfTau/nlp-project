Ubisoft did a bretty good job with graphics, and the design of each city.It felt like I was in italy during the reniassance period, but as far as it goes for the story then it gets boring at times.The problem with this is that it isnt addictive, I had to take a break every 5 hours of gameplay.As for the game mechanics, I liked them. Ubisoft did a good job with this one.
