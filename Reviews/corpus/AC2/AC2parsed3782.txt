Uplay has made this game broken. The launcher crashes every time. Buy this though. Still a great game even though Ubisoft sux. There is a way around it and it does suck to have to work to play a game you bought to play but oh well. This is the best AC ever and if you want to debate go ahead. Played it on console now on PC wish I could play it but hey thats life. Judge the game not the laucher right?Great Game 9/Doge
