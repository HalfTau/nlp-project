I did not finish the game, but I can tell you already this game is amazing!I love games that tells me what I have to do and not have to wonder. The graphics in a game are quite important to me, and AC II has beautiful ones. It is also my first Assassins Creed game. I am not disapointed from my purchase. I strongly recommend this game especially if you like Tomb Raider since I find it similar.
