Still one of the greatest games in terms of being original for its time, the characters grow on you and the storyline enthralls you. One thing that really bugs me though is the controls layout  highly recommend playing this with a controller or finding a way to do the layout differently. For anyone who isnt used to the series, this might be a red flag.
