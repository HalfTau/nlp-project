My favorite AC game to date.Has a great atmosphere and Renaissance Italy is a gorgeous setting.Despite it being an old game and having some flaws, it is still playable and enjoyable.The story was also very nice  amazing, combined with the rest of the trilogy as you see Ezios transition from a child with a quest for vengeance to a fully grown man trying to uncover the secrets of the Master Assassin Altar.A memorable game and a must have for fans of the franchise.
