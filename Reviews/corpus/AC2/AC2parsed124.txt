All in all there were two states of me while playing the game1. Damn this game has a good story2. Why am I supposed to do these long plotrelevant quests that bore the hell out of you?So yeah, the story is good music is good too btw , but the things inbetween are just tiresome Sadly Steam doest allow neither recomend nor not recommend cause I would do both.
