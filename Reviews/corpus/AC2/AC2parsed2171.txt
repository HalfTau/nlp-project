First of all, I havent played AC I or any other episode from the franchise.Not an AC fanI can safely say, that AC II was one of the most immersive, enjoyable, compelling and badass adventures I went through as a gamer. A must have in your collection, especially that it is super cheap now.Thanks for reading this!
