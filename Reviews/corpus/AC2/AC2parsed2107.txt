One of the best Ubisoft Montreal creations, and indeed the best adventure game of all time on pc in my opinion. Has decent variety of activities, good plot, amazing characters. An overall win, despite mediocre graphics.Its really sad for me to watch once marvellous series to become so expensive, but soulless games, that come out faster than cat gives birth. I wish one day Ubi will understand, that you dont need to produce games faster than light, to be succesful publisher and developer. Just look at the Rockstar North...
