Dungeon Siege II...what can I say but awesome indeed.  Gas Powered Games built on the success of the original game and released it in 2005 after some delays.  They listened to the community who said the original was too linear, so they made the quests a bit more tactical and also made combat  less automated in this continued storyline.  Later in 2006 they released the official expansion  Dungeon Siege II Broken World.
