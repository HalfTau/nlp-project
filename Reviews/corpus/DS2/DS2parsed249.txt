This was my second RPG back when it first released in 05 My first being DS1. Solid game with interesting storyline and great characters. Even though the graphics have dated a bit, they still hold up fairly well considering.Each class is useful and can be used on its own if you prefer to play solo, or can be accompanied by others with varied classes so you can build a team how you want.Each character also has their own side quest, something you can use to get to know them more and realise how well thought out each of them were.Not the best game in the world, but compared to what we get today, its a damn sight better than most. This and Dungeon Siege 1  1.5 were and still are my fav RPG games to play. Do youself a favor and play it too,
