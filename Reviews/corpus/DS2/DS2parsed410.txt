Its hard to express just how much fun I had with this game. Really refined from the first entry in the series, and adds a lot of depth to character development. Managing a party instead of just one character allows you to experiement with several builds at once, and youll unlock larger parties at higher difficulty levels. The structure of quests and sidequests often have you exploring areas you couldnt access earlier in the game, giving some good variety in where youll be going and why.Overall a very worthy dungeon crawler standing toetotoe with DIablo 2 or Titan Quest
