This is a great game. I like this game a lot as I played it when it first came out and I hadnt played it since then until the Steam version came out and I bought this game a while back. Yeah the graphics might be dated and other things but I love the pause feature in this game and ability to mod it.Even just playing the regular game without mods is very fun and I have spent quite a bit maxing out characters. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone who wants to hardcore game on it because this game is more like you grab the good items as you go along and rarely needs farming ever. I really love how it is not a grind and I can continue just going through the story and relaxing back while playing.I also see people complaining about no multiplayer. Do you really expect a game made over a decade ago to have multiplayer? That is a waste of money for the company to host servers on a game this old.Overall Id recommend this to anyone looking to relax and have fun time playing a game instead of being in a constant grind for items and levels.
