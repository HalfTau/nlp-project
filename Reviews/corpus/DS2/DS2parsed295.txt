This is just miserable.The first Dungeon Siege did a great job developing a dark, semifantastical setting with real strife and conflict. In comparison, Dungeon Siege II is absurd and whimsical. Its somehow just worse is most aspects. While the graphics are barely improved, they are busy and unfocused.Im having a hard time seeing how anyone could have made this as a sequel to Dungeon Siege.
