I definatly Reccomend this game.Story last you around 40 hours and always keep you interested. I was never able to beat the game because when i was younger my CPU broke but now I saw it was on Sale and I couldnt pass it up. I played the first 5 minutes and it all came back to me. ANYONE who likes RPGs this is a must buy.
