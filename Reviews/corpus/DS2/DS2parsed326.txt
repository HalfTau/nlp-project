Dear fellow steam users,Growing up in the 90s, games like these are my weakness and I find myself trying to go back to them to relive some old memories. If you are in this situation or you have never heard of this game and would like to try it please DO NOT put money in Steams pocket and read on....This game is neither optimised for computers Windows 98 nor recommended... After messing around with compatibility settings and other graphical settings for hours I came to the conclusion this game is completely unplayable. The cursor has a habit of disapearing on the game menu, you are unable to select any character customisation, skipping some cinematics causes the game to crash and of course frequent in game crashes if you get that far every couple of minutes. All the above have been noted and debated in LOTS of steam threads...After trying on different computers I settled on the fact this game cannot be played so I decided to take it up with Steam Support... I have had a ticket open for 2 weeks so far and the only reply I got was an automatic check your game files nonsense...Steam... your customer service is st and utter shambles... And this needs to be acknowledged...I realise I will never get back my 5 and I ask that if you are reading this you actually google and see for yourself the rubbish... I loved this game when I was younger and the fact Steam are putting it on their system, charging money for it and it not actually working in the basic sense is the same as going to Currys and buying a TV with a smashed screen with duct tape over it.Steam remove this game from your store.Fellow Steam users...avoid this game.Kind regards,One ticked off Steam User.
