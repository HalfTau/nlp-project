This is by far the funnest of the Dungeon Siege series! You dont have to play the first game to understand the story which is pretty decent by the way.The gameplay Its similar to that of the Diablo series, its point and click movement/combat, except that you can control a party of up to 6 characters its easier then it sounds. You can set each character to automatically perform a certain attack or spell. So the only character you have to actually worry about controlling is the one you choose to select as the leader. You gain skill points that you can spend on certain active and passive skills shield block, less mana consumption for casting spells, dual wield extra damage, etc. The active skills you earn are based on what passive skills you choose. Example by investing skill points into the passive skill increase cold spell damage you earn an active skill that blasts several shards of ice that do massive damage.Adding the skill point system really improved the oversimplicity of the first Dungeon Siege leveling and combat system dont get me wrong though, the first one was still fun too. Another addition, is that you can enchant items by finding or buying certain ingredients. You can make some really powerful armor/weapons. This feature definately adds more strategy and depth to the gameplay.Lastly, the environments are very dynamic and beautiful. There are lots of fun extra dungeons/caves to explore.I definately recommend this game!
