I wish i could bot recommend and not recommend.This unfortunatly does not come with broken world, like the first one doesnt come with LOA, so in all honesty calling it a collection you cannot, considering its not complete.I love DS 1 and 2, but its not complete what so ever.Happy i have them again used to have disks but very very unhappy that this supposed collection is not complete and nor the fact that LAN does not work.
