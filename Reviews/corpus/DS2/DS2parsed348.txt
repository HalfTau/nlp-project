why do I like this game so much?? The story is awful, half the setting is ripped straight off LOTR, more than half of the mechanics are ripped from Diablo, the textures are fugly, the voiceactings despicable, and the range of characters you can add to your party is way too limited.Its just really fun and plays so smoothly. The skills from the different classes compliment each other well and its persistently satisfying to run around as a selfsufficient MMO group forever free from idiots, incompetence, AFKers, bickering, leavers, jerks, etc. And DS2 really benefits from an easy pause mechanic where you can take a minute to look around at how your party is doing tank up front getting hit like a champ, mages and archers frozen casting fireballs and shooting bows, and healer behind everything. Behold my synergy.
