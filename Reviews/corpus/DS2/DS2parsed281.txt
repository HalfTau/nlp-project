Amazing game. Reminded me alot of Baldurs Gate when I first played it back in the day, with a splash of diablo. However, while the loot system is very satisfying, and the outof combat secrets and goodies are worthwhile, the skill trees, spells, and skills in general are a little too simple for my liking, and some are completley useless while some are incredibly overpowered. The end result is too little replay value for the kind of game it is. They do let you pick your race, and you arent locked into a class, but if you dont specialize in one of the four skill types, Melee, Ranged, Nature, uhhh... well the fourth one is damage magic. Cant remember the name. you will end up very underpowered as they punish you severely for trying to multiclass in this game, One very cool fact is while at the middleto end of the game most party members are leveled up so much there really is only one way you can build them, the few you get at the beginning you can basically mold into anything you want, to work with whatever role your character fills. I wont give away all the features of this gem, but with a tiered playthrough system similar to diablo, you can carry your experience, loot, and party members unlocking additional party slots when you reach the harder tiers through another playthrough, making up for the why bother rolling a new character. Pick this up if you like Diabloesque type games, its a fun one.
