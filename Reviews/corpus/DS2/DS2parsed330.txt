This game has a lot of appeal and flows nicely. But on modern computers and screen resolutions the display is horribly cramped and I find all the dialog text barely readable. Looks like I missed out on this game when it was at its prime. If you dont have any emotional attachment to this game as a reason to add it to your library, or cant be bothered to adjust display settings to be able to visually engage in it, I recommend against it.
