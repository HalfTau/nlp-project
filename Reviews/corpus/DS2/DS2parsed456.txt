Very different from DS1. In Dungeon Siege 2 as in Diablo 2. Hmm... there are character classes, and linear levelling. Humbug.Good story, good controls, fun characters. I seem to recall not worrying terribly about my equipment, but its been a while. I remember the game being very easy to play, and the levelling system being largely responsible. I also remember the bosses being terribly easy once you figure out each ones trick.Not a bad game, but not really anyithing special either.B
