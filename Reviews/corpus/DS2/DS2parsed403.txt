I like lots of things about DS2. I like that item shops are useful, that they tried to give your companions actual characters, and that the female models wear sensible armor. I liked the design of several boss fights, and the efforts they went to in some areas, anyway to disguise the basic linearity of the game.Unfortunately, DS2 is one of those games where you had to buy the DLC to get the actual ending  DLC that doesnt seem to be on Steam. So this game gets to the climax and goes HAHANOPE. Completely unsatisfying.
