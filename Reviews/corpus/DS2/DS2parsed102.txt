annoying and frustrating save systemRemoves party best equipment upon death and forces you to replay big porsions of levels, with the worse equipment instead, fighting the same enemies, they respawn again, that killed you in the first place, just to recover your equipment, but of course you die again because now you are worsed equiped than you were before at first death!Also minor problem but still found it frustrating, you cant move your character with AWSD only the camera, character movement is click based.Cant recomend because of the save system, no matter how cool the rest may be.
