I have always loved this game.  Years ago, a friend of mine got me hooked.  It was my first action RPG, and this game made me fall in love with the genre.  I measure all other games by this one.  In truth, I had never played RPGs before, and I recommend this if you are new to action RPGs, or even RPGs at all.For those of you who loved turnbased, and/or more micromanaging tactical, this may not be for you.  This is a game where I can just vegout.  Decisions do not matter, and you are guided on one path, but you do get to take party members with you and build each up with one of four different classes  Melee, Ranged, Combat Magic, or Nature Magic.  Sidenote  each party member has their own small and optional side quest.This game has great replay value, since you can customize your character and pick one of four classes listed above and one of four races.  Character customization is a MUST for me.  You can choose gender for Humans and Elves, but Dryads are only female, and Halfgiants are only male.Happy Gaming!
