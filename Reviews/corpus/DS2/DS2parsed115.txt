This used to be one of my favourite games. Saw it on sale 75 off and thought I had to get it I read the reviews, people complaining about graphics problems, how you cant play multiplayer anymore, how it doesnt even come with the expansion. I thought, id ignore them. Bad choice. Game loaded, of course no multiplayer or expansion so I started the campaign, changed the graphics settings to max and the game crashes, I restart, change it to default and yet again game crashes before anything even loads. Repeated several times, reinstalled, cant even load up the title screen it just crashes. The fact that steam sells the product in its current state is a joke. Do not buy it as it is until they change it.The game itself, having played it before is amazing probably 9.5/10, but there is no point in having a great game if you cant even load it.
