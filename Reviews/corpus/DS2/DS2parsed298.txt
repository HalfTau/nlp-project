Very good game. Graphics, story and music are improved from DS1, and the Baldurs Gate influence shines throughout.Unfortunately the game just isnt as challenging as DS1 thanks to features like twoway teleport to safety. There are also weird game balance issues will mean that you can spend 2 hours on a large sidequest only to get an apparently unique piece of equipment that a random monster dropped earlier in the game.
