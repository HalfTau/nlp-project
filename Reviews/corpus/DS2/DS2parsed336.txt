Truly representative of the party based RPG genre, Dungeon Siege allows you to build your party in a myriad of ways to represent the characters that you want. Want to be a spellslinging archer who can dodge out of the way of attacks in melee? You can do it. Want to be a master of all weapons? you can do it. Want to be a true mage, master of every discipline? You can do it. Want to be a warrior that augments his own prowess with buffs and summoned companions or even normal animal companions? You can do that too.Experience freedom alongside an interesting story and more threats than you know what to do with. Play the game again on a higher difficulty with the same party, and then do it all over again. Play online with your friends.The only thing I can complain about with this game is there is a tad too much combat, making finishing it a significant investment of time. Especially if you want to make cross discipline warriors so you need to find all the enemies and repeatedly train. My other issue is that it is remarkably...well, easy. Maybe it is just me.As for the story, it is pretty much a direct continuation of the first game after a great deal of time has passed. The world is not the same. It has undergone changes and entered a new Age entirely. The game explains this all in the early stages.Overall 7.5, Story 8/10, Gameplay 8/10, Graphics 6/10, Sound 7/10, Replayability 8/10
