The last Dungeon Siege game, 3 is not worth mentioning and is an abomination.Choose from 4 main play styles or mix them up to suit yourself.The Expansion on this game add 2 more sub classes giving even more option.Grind through enemies, collect sets of armour and weapons.There may not be another gem in this play style for year to come so ignore the dated graphics and enjoy the grind fest that is this game.
