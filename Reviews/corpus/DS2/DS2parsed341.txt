To start, DS was a decently cool game. Basically, it was 3D Diablo 2 with a party. The graphics were awesome and there were seamless transitions into the underground/dungeons, you only loaded initially and using teleports.However, this Steam release has two extremely dealbreaking drawbacks. The first is that the expansion pack is NOT INCLUDED. Unlike games like Age of Empires 2, where they incorporated the expansion into the vanilla game itself, this game does not even include the expansion, nor is it available for purchase as DLC. Thanks to the wonderful world of, its gone forever.The second issue is that MULTIPLAYER IS DISABLED. This is because the legacy DS2 servers were hosted by GameSpy, which no longer exists right? I thought the spyware would make them last forever!, and it seems that GasPowered did not believe this release would not generate enough money to justify a server of their own. What this means for you is that YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO EVEN CREATE LAN GAMES. It is conceivably possible to violate the Steam EULA to replace the .exe file with an old nocd replacement and modify your hosts to not try to check in with GameSpy, but you will still run intoAnd so far, no one has found any solution to this problem, so in all likelihood, you will be playing in single player. This is really disappointing because, at leastproblem, would have been a super easy fix on GPs part.That said, this does not make the game unplayable if you want to do single player again, or if youve never played it before, you can have the single player vanilla experience for only 6.99, which is not too bad for a game with this much content. But for me, personally, I feel its a disappointment and false advertising.
