A game straight from my childhood, absolutely love it!Such an old game, but done so well, even by todays standards the rpg elements are perfect, the fights are a bit mechanicaly simplistic compared to some newer games but they still take thought and preperation for the most part.It is basically an over the head click, party rpg game, you command a party of 4,5 or 6 units of 4 different classes and level them up accordingly.I have only 1 issue with this game, and this is, that it seems abit easy. I had 1 melee fighter who could stand there and happily tank every single boss in the game, including the final boss, which is abit ridiculous, but even so, its an amazing game and considering how cheap it is, definately worth a try.
