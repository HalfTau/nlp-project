Still fun, 10 years after my first playthrough... Surprisingly modern feeling for a 10 year old game. Can be played casually, but allows for more advanced things like kiting, orb walking, animation cancelling. Items are complex enough to add depth and a good level of spreadsheeting crunching numbers to identify the best gear combos etc..., and the skill systems are pleasant and rewarding.Some classes do outshine others archer seems to be the strongest in Vanilla by far but due to the game not being too difficult, you are not forced to play with the strongest  just play with whatever you want.Overall , still a great game even now. Would be nice to see a modern version  There are other dungeon crawlers out there at the moment Diablo 3 is great but not quite play like DSII. But for the price, I would not hesitate to recommend this.
