I am about ready to start smashing my computer because of this STUPID ING VERSION OF THE GAME. I used to have a cracked copy that ran on anything I put it on, but this version requires learning a whole mess of stupidjust to get it to run. There are guides written by nolife ing nerds that may as well be in ing yiddish. I wanted to pay money for a game instead of finding a cracked copy and now I get punished? This game is how old and noone thought to put up a working bloody version.  this stupid scam of a version.
