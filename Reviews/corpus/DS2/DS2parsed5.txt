Rather than rehash all the general feedback stated by other reviewers, Ill just mention the two things that ultimately killed my enjoyment of this game. First, restarting it always puts you back in a town regardless of how much time youve spent progressiing through the game world before reaching a checkpoint. This can easily result in a half hour of tedious backtracking each time you come back to the game. Second, the game sometimes didnt save my mission progress even when I manually saved multiple times during a session, resulting in more tedious repetition of conversations, buying and selling, inventory management, routine combat, etc. this also led to wasted time searching through forum posts for help with the problem.OK, Ill also mention that the camera and basic movement mechanics are badly implemented and frustrating. Very disappointing.
