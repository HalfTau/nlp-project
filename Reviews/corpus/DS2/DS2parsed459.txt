Previous review sucked soo. This game was a game I bought when I lost my key to Sacred and had to reformat my computer years ago. This game is an amazing party based dungeon crawler. You have four different skill paths to go down Combat magic, nature magic, melee, ranged. Within this paths are many different paths to help create a unique party. You should have one from each class and specialize in that class or you will end up being weak. The story on this game is amazing for the most part starting area sucks. If you want a Diablo 2 ish game with an amazing party system then play this. This one is five times better than Dungeon Siege 3!
