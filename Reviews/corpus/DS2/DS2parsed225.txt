Definitely worth a shot. 8/10This game is a classic ARPG that differs from a lot of thirdperson or OneMan ARPG, where you can control up to 6 characters in your party. This feature keeps the game interesting throughout as you spec up your main starter character and have the ability to improve your other party members and try out their skill sets. The voice acting is pretty decent, and the storyline is interesting. Theres a heap of side quests to do as well, and some are pretty challenging and have puzzles that you have to solve to move forward in the main quest or open a chest to find epic loot.My only concern was toward the endgame it gets a bit grindy to reach the final boss, and replayability is good but would be better with friends as you play through game again on a harder difficulty similar to Diablo IIs difficulty levels. Boss fights are at first challenging but once you get the jist of their mechanics they are pretty easy. With the resolution configure making it 1920x1080 with vsync, the game looks pretty decent for its age 2005 I believe.Overall its a classic Action RPG with interesting combat system, able to control up to 6 party members and fairly decent choices to focus your character on i.e. a Mage can focus on Fire, Lightning or Death Magic, or Summoning Skills.
