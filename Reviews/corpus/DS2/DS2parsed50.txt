OK, here I go.To be honest I really want to recommend this game.I know how amazing it is, BUT the steam version is a hot piece of garbage.It really is.Most of the user guides except for one are on how to solve problems with this game, make it actually playable and make it not look like utter trash.So if and when you buy this, know that you first have to do some things in order to get this working.people are also struggeling with getting multiplayer mode to work keep that in mind if thats important to you.Honestly the game is great, a good story nice characters and a lot of them, a way better character design screen than in the first dungeon siege, more spells, puzzles, variety in world design and environments, nice dungeons, a lot of pets, skilltrees that dont suck so its actually nice to play as a warior or archer, a small tutorial done right, passive magic that makes companions actually useable, a lot of ways to tackle character builds and team compostion, pretty nice graphics ....A lot of good things are in this game, butits a touble getting it working, I actually had to buy another steam program which cost me more than this game in order to get this game to work in fullscreen. I highly recommend checking the guidesThe AI is still but less likely to just kill itself than in the first game however more likely to just not engage at all.had to pay 3,99 for borderless gaming, which is just stupid and shouldnt be neccesary.all in all a way rougher experience than the first itteration, if you want a game thats playable from the getgo than go for dungeon siege 1.All in all I wouldnt really want to recommend it because it should just work in my opinion, but its a great game nonetheless.If you want to buy it just be aware of this versions downfalls, maybe get it onor something
