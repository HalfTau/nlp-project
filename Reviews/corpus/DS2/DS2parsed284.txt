I love this game. Graphics have dated a fair amount, but gameplay is still very good and the story is gripping. Plenty of sidequests for completionists on top of the extensive main quest. Rogue / Mage / Warrior set up is slightly altered by having magic split between Combat mages DPS and Nature mages DPS / Healer.Leveling up and character specialisation is extensive, with a lot of opportunities to specialise in different powers for each class, plus Warriors can choose shield and sword tanking, doublehanded swords DPSing or doublewielding Combat mages can choose between Death, Fire and Lightning magic which is important when different enemies have weaknesses to certain elements Nature Mages can choose between Ice magic, Earth magic and Healing magic as well as having a  wide variety of buffs to help the party Rangers can choose to use bows, crossbows or throwing knives.Definitely worth a try! Shame theres no expansion though.
