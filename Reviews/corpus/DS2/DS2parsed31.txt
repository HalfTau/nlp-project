I initially bought this game years ago off of Amazon and after beating it with my first couple of characters, I added the expansion.  I really liked this game and am super nostalgic for it.The mechanic for leveling that increases your characters skills in one of the four classes as you use it was interesting and unique.  Later on, this allows you to mix and match by dabbling in different areas, combining different kinds of magic to increase your characters overall effectiveness and thats just one example.However, the game as sold by Steam is unplayable.  Its not laggy and the game starts up really quickly, but after that, no cursor appears and partially due to the age of the game, multiplayer is completely disabled.This is no longer a game.  This is an application that defaults to fullsizing on your monitor in a low resolution and plays some music over a mostly static image you cannot interact with.  Thats not a game.  This used to be one, a pretty good one in fact, but it isnt, anymore.DONT BUY GAMES THAT DONT WORK!!!
