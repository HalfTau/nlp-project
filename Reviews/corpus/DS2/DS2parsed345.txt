The game begins pretty cool. You are part of an invasion force working for the bad guys. Now that is awesome! I thought the developers came up with an interesting story, where you are not saving the world like in EVERY other Rpg.But immidiately after the introduction you get captured by gay elves. And from then on you are working for the ing elves. Was a bit disappointed by that.It is still a good game, though I didnt like it as much as the first Dungeon Siege. Graphics and gameplay are almost the same in both titles. So if you have the choice of getting DS1 or DS2, better choose the first.
