Ive started playing Dunegon Siege II as a continuation to my adventure on the first one, and even if it has some points in which it does not remind its antecessor, its really nice to see how you get stronger by each chapter that passes.DS II may be a 10yearold game, but it easily surpasses in difficulty and gameplay some of the games nowadays do not expect much of the graphics since its from 2005I recommend this game to people looking for an RPG similar to Diablo and that look for a very good background storywith lots of sidequests.
