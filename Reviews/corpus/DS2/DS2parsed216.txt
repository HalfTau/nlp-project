Dungeon Siege 2 picks off where the previous one left off, but greatly improves on a nubmer of mechanics.  It is a longer, but still very enjoyable game, with some quality of life changes to streamline the story and gameplay.  Overall I enjoyed it, and would recommend to gamers who enjoy oldschool topdown RPGs.  Its very enjoyable in that regard.  The story was also improved, in my opinion.Personal ConsClick system change  The changes to the original click system felt weird to me, making it feel more like Diablo, but I eventually accepted it and enjoyed it.Talent System  The talent system was an interesting addition, and gave more depth, but it was rough because you couldnt ever change them.  Without playing you werent sure what would be benefical later, which led to some talent points being wasted.Party size reduced to 4.  Part of what made the original Dungeon Siege fun was the party size, but I understand why they wanted to make the change, especially for balance reasons.  Some of the itemization was strange to meBoss Fights Some of the boss fights, especially the last one, felt so clunky and obnoxious, which shows the games age.ProsLong, and decent story, was fun to explore.  It was a little annoying that it did not connect with DS1, but was very great. Great exploration feeling, lots of fun areas.  Some of the backtracking was annoying, but overall it was great.Buy it if its on sale, and you wanna kill 3040 hours on an RPG.
