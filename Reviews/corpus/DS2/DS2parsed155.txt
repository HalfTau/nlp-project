One of the best games Ive ever played. Although it can seems so old graphics of 800 x 600 it is still one of the exclusive rol games, due to the original concept of group  controlled games. This makes the game more fun each time you get a new member, earn levels and get items.Just need a demo, all of us there maybe needs a help to make this game more enjoyable.
