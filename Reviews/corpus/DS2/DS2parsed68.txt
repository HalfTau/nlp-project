I dont recommend this game due to the deal breaking stop your progress bugs, so I dont see any point in going into how the content is different/better/worse than original Dungeon Siege.I put about 80 hours into DS1 and totally enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much despite how hobbled and flacky the Steam version is I thought I should try Dungeon Siege II.After putting in about 70 hours in DS2, a game bug made it impossible for me to continue, missing the entire remaining third of the content.I suggest before you buy any game but especially old ones, that you check out the Steam community for the game and its forums. Both the DS games have many posts about bugs and various workarounds people have tried, but which dont seem to work for everyone.Both DS1 and DS2 share similar wonkyness with Windows 10, from the cursor being missing from the main menu to being stuck with playing at 800 by 600 unless you are handy mucking aroun with various mods and hacks and you mileage may vary.
