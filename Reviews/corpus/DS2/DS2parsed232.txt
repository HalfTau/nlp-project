Very good old single player hackandslash/magic RPG, but forget multiplayer would be great though. Its a good adventure and has great character development. The quest has high replayability and the combat is Diablo like. Overall, I would say DS2 is worth the time.Makes one wonder why Steam, a big as they are, dosent pick up the obsolete deadserver sevices. Many of our old games would be revived for multiplayer.
