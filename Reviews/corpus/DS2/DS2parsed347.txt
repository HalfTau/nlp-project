My first RPG after the MightMagic series and Diablo series. I loved this game the first time I played it and I still love this game. I have had this game since the year it first came out in stores and was ecstatic when it came out on steam!! I play many different ways with different characters. Experimenting with allies and pets and skills is what keep me pouring hours into the game. there is replayability with this game as the dialog of certain characters is worth building different parties. I think this is one of those games that will have me hooked to the day I die XD brilliant!! 10/10 Mate!
