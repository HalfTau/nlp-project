Despite warmest memories from my childhood concerning Dungeon Siege I was surprised how different DS 2 actually is from its precursor. Although the gameplay concept didnt change much, DS 2 presents itself more complicated and somehow contraintuitive about the controls, if you come from DS 1. I have a hard time getting started because of that and die a lot. On the other hand DS 2 presents some improvements like an arrow telling you where to go, respawning enemies and a portal system to speed up the journey and making revisits of old locations much easier. On the other hand, this assimilation to standards kind of takes away a piece of the uniqueness of the first part. If compared to other rpgs DS 2 sadly doesnt rise above mediocrity. I also have to admit that I found the graphics poorer than those of the first game. I had the impression that at least the first sceneries are grayer and somehow more practical than aesthetic. I especially disliked some of the character faces and their portraits, although they are not as important as what they have to say. Usually I am not into graphics that much and prefer the pure story, but it really stroke my eyes.I dont think that DS 2 is a total waste of time. Im sure, if you have the time and dedication you could have lots of fun with the game, but I personally do not want to spend so many of my resources on it and I do not recommend the game for most other players, who might be frustrated with it as well.
