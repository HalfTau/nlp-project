Do not buy this game on Steam. Yes it is a very good game and one of my eternal favorites in the rpg genre. Except for one problem, the Steam version has no multiplayer. Yes the servers are disabled and everyone expected that but the issue is that they disabled the entire multiplayer function including LAN.
