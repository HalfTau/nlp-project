Used to play this a lot years ago, really good game even for now. Probably best of dungeon siege 2 series, I highly recommend this game.The game has good storyline, its quite difficult so you cant just head rush the game it takes patience and strategy to take on some elements of the game.Sadly the AI is quite annoying at times in rampage mode but that is only negative thing about this game.
