owned thi sgame since day 1. Havnt played the steam version very much but definatly put 1000 hours into it when I got it. Miss games like these and wish that some developers would make them like this again. Character creation, dungeon crawling, and diablo style loot drops. All multiplayer online as well if you fix it up.
