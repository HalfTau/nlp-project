No bugs, nice texture and graphics, possibility to learn every skill if you train them, and lots of features making this game verry fun to play it take about 6080 hours to finish all quest in the low difficulty, then you can keep playing and growing your char in the other difficult New Game .This game remind me all the hours spend to clear some wet caves in Dungeon Siege I.Its verry similar and so it is a solid 9/10 yes, even if this game is 10 years old
