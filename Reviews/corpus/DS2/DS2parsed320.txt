I used to like this game so much that I had to get it once I saw it on Steam... I guess my ability to put up withdecreaed with the years.This is, to be blunt, the most frustrating game youll ever play.Your ranged characters will stroll right in the middle of the fight before attacking, your fighters will run up to where their target was a minute ago and attack the air, and youll be going up and down lifts a lot.Screwing up a character permanently is as easy as an accidental click on an icon, or forgetting to change a skill after you used it, or changed a mages weapon. Before you know it, your wizard knows martial arts. Especially later in the game, you cant let a thing slip without gaining several levels in an unwanted skill which will slow down progress in those you want, this is the most unforgiving interface Ive ever seen.Save yourselves some stress.
