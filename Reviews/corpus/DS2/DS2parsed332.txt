Please help. My party was all killed the first time we met the dragon. Now every time I go back there there is no dragon. The Captain keeps directing me to the top of the Castle but the Dragon never reapears. I had this game for years and when I bought it on Steam I threw away the CDs. Boy, that was stupid.
