One of my favourite RPGs From back in the days if you didnt like Diablo or wanted something little bit different you had DS12, and both are great.Love on how many side quests  you can stumble upon and then it takes more than one chapter to finish them, makes you explore and discover hidden paths to finish those.Story good vs evil, sword vs shield, what is there not to like, classic fantasy to enjoy Too bad they turned servers for multiplayer off And also if you are thinking to get DS3 after playing this one then just dont, its only a name slapped on some crap to milk the money.
