Was a wonderful game back in the day... I bought the Steam version out of pure nostalgia. I could only play for 5 minutes. It hasnt aged well. Its strongest point was the multiplayer, which this version doesnt feature. The game can be a little diffuclt for a single player. Unless you are a big Dungeon Siege fan, I would skip out on the game unless its going for around 2.49.
