First time i played a torrented version of the game on a potato computer and i was like Woaaah... And now, with a new and way more better pc i decided to buy it on Steam. It was a bad idea. First of all in the first two hours i was needed to deal with the exception errors, crashes, bugs etc. Yes, i solved the problems somehow and i started to play. Sometimes the game crashed but it was playable. But at a point the game it started to crash a lot and  i could not leave the city, cuz the program crashed and said that the program is not responding, every time. And i cant find a fin solution for the problem. Yeah, i know its a dead, 12 year old game but i think is a very cool rpg and i thought that i will play once more. But i couldnt, and i dont recommend buying the game cuz its buggy as sht and youd better get it from a torrent site cuz there is no advantage that you got on steam oh and the steam version does not have multiplayer button, you cant even play on lan.Hope i could help you, have a good day.EDIT Okay i fixed the crash error i downloaded the game on my laptop, that is much weaker and i can finally play the game. But i still wont recommend the game because it was an horror till i could play it.
