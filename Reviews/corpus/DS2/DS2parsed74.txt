Dungeon Siege II is a classic RPG that doesnt get enough love these days. The graphics, while subpar now, were impressive in their time and the story is huge and immersive. It features several unique characters that you can pick and choose which to have in your party, pets that you pretty much raise from birth, secrets that are incredibly easy to miss if you dont know what youre looking for, and character customization. Ive been playing this game since I was little Used to have a physical copy and its never lost its magic. Give it a chance! You wont regret it.The only downside is that the DLC is gone. There is no way to ever get the DLC on Steam.
