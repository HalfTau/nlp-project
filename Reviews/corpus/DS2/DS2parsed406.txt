A beautifully crafted RPG, which removes the only problem Dungeon Siege 1 had by adding in an ability system that added bonuses to the players characters as they kept going. At the same time, this means that its not as easy to automate, but it still provides a fun and immersive experience which I enjoyed to its fullest.
