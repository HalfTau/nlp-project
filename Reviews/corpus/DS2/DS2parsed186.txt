One word.....WOW!!! I have bought so many games where I have either returned them for a refund or played once and never bothered again. This is the 1st game since Football Manager that has the potential to cost me a divorce as football manager nearly did. Bye bye wife. Hello Dungeon Siege 2. The game is just brilliant. Yes the graphics are dated and yes there is aot to get your head around but it is so much fun. Unlike other games in the genre like Torchlight you dont just get given loads of loot. Yes there is still plenty but it feels so much more rewarding to get new weapons. For example I had a 2 handed hammer that I couldnt use until I hit melee lv 5 and unlocked a certain skill from the skill tree usinf skill points. Once I met this criteria it was so satisfying to equipt my new hammer and smash everything up with it. On other similar titles in this genre you just seem to get given weapons or there are too many weapons. This game puts them to shame. I love the story as well.On a final note as well this game is an excellent way of losing weight in the same way football manager was when it owned my life. Normally I just eat and eat and eat but I have played this for the last 7 hours solid and never thought of food once. Actually now that I come to mention it im absolutely starving here so im off to raid the fridge now.
