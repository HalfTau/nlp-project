One of my favorite RPGs growing up and definitely the best game in the DS franchise. The story is catchy and the team system allows you to play all the character classes at the same time and elaborate complex combat strategies. Of course, it is a bit dated so the graphics can turn you off, but if youre used to playing good old games youll love it.This game does not include the Broken World expansion pack, but trust me you dont need it as the extra campaign was boring and linear and the two new hybrid character classes were just irrelevant. The only sad thing is you dont get to craft unique and set items using recipes, but youll get over it just like I did.Have fun !
