Almost everything that Dungeon Siege did well, DS2 does better when it comes to single player. However, the fun I had with the first game was coop and non linear play. DS2 forced you upon a linear path which just seemed out of place for a Dungeon Siege game. I got halfway through the game and just got bored with it. In the steam version, there is no multiplayer at all.
