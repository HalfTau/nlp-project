As fun as the first Dungeon Seige and it introduced some new things to the game. Each character has a skill tree and you can build them as youd like as you level. Points in certain sets of skills would allow you to use certain spells. They also made a new game plus feature but they restricted the amount of people you can have in your party. On your first playthrough you are only allowed 4 members and every new game plus you can add one more member with a max of 6 members. Its a little dissapointing going from 8 in your party to only 4.
