I have no idea if the game is any good as it does not run on Win 10  the main menu appears, but theres no mouse pointer and as far as I can tell no way of interacting with anything. I had to let it sit on the menu for five minutes because Steam wont let you review a game until youve hit that threshold, so for games that just do an immediate CTD I have no idea what youre meant to do. Valve, sort it out.
