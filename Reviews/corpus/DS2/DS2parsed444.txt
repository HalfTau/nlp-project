This game is not your average RPG. This game is one of the best RPGs I have every played. It is about a 50 to 60 hour game. It may seem like a long game but it is worth it. I would Recommend this to more hardcore gamers than casual. I play video games alot and would consider my self a Hardcore gamer. But this game still challenges me to wear the game is not really easy but not to hard.
