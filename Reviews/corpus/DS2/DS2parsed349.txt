DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM! .exe is different from the original, because of this mods and the modding SDK will not work multiplayer is disabled there is no integration at all with steam 50 of the time it wont even start a game because of new graphics card the game has a 43 resolution which mean it wont work on modern monitors which are pretty much all widescreenBetter throw the 6 in a fire, will be a better use...
