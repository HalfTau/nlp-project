You get way more in game than what you pay for, its fun and very enjoyable. The story is really enticing you will find yourself actually konwing the areas and the name of the characters also there is a huge amount of lore involved in the game. There is a specific feature in the game which is that you have to type in your spells in a pedestal by using your keys and it will grant you the buffs, I found that pretty neat feature in the game there is also the characters that are involved in your trip eachone has a specific personality according to their race which is another great feature to have a game that this cheap not to mention the loot and the dungeon crawling is fun and rewarding mostly because there are tons of secrets and areas to explore.
