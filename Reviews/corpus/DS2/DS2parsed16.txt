as much as love this game I have to give this a negative review. Im not going to say dont buy this game because thats up to you but if you do make sure its on saleok so I had no mouse cursor in the gamethis may help  go to your steam library right click the game then click on properties in general go to set launch options and type fullscreenfalseit should work its been working for me, I found this on steam community when I was searching the web, hope it helps
