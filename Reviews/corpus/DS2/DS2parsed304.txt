Nice RPG  jsut like the first one. Needed to do some manual configuration to get 169 display. Due to a bug in the game I couldnt finish part of the main quest half way through the game ans had to start all over again  but really didnt bother me. Game is fun, has interesting quests and a good and long story. Definitifely a thumbs up.
