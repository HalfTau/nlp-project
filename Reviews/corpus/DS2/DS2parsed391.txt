What a beautiful game. Every now and then I run across a game that just nails its genre. The Age of Wonders series makes me feel that way for example, and more recently, Mark of the Ninja  a game thats just an absolute pleasure to play because the makers lavished attention on it to make it a joy, and the player wants it to never come to an end. Dungeon Siege II is one of those games.Everything that makes a fantasy action strategy game fun to play is in this game  gorgeous artwork, evocative soundtrack, userfriendly interface, fully customizeable characters, great gear, generous loot drops, secret rooms, interesting and complicated quests, and far more gold than you could possibly need. Dungeon Siege II is like Torchlights older brother, just as likeable but more grown up. Well, as grown up as a fantasy romp can be.
