Dungeon Siege II is an entirely competent game. There are okay graphics, okay sounds, okay music, okay worlds and enemies and leveling mechanics. Everything is so okay that I dont really want to play it, like, ever. That doesnt really matter, though, becauseTHE MULTIPLAYER IN THIS VERSION OF THE GAME IS ENTIRELY DISABLED AND CANNOT BE REENABLED IN ANY WAY. Again, even though the matchmaking service is not necessary for LAN play, it is TOTALLY DISABLED. So that sucks.
