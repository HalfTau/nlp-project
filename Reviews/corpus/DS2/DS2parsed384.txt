Where to start.... This game is amazing! Might be old, but its the game that sparked my love for RPGs. The replayability is amazing, with different classes and races to choose from. The gameplay is extremely good. Only downfall is the graphics, but what would you expect from a game this old. It is still one of the best RPG games ever!
