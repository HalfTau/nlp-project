Years ago I really liked this game, but the game seems to have so many more flaws now that I am replaying. Combat is not fluid enough, movements are a little awkward, I frequently click on something else when I try to move around, camera view is sometimes blocked by ceiling arches, storyline is very ordinary. Compared to Dungeon Siege 1, there are fewer spells and fewer gear varieties or classes. The loot system is absolutely sadI cant stand picking up 13 gold pieces any more, and the fact that it takes 3 characters to pick up 5 goldbad movement mechanics.I can still think of some prosgood visual effects of spells, large maps, decent music, interesting quests, the fact that it still runs well on Win10. But I feel that the game has low replay value.
