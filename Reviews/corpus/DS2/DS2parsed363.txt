One of the most memorable games from my younger years. Both DS1 and 2 were great games, and are still great to play today. The only reason Im giving this a negative review is the fact that multiplayer is just simply disabled. Im not sure if its because of a GameSpy thing, or because Steam just doesnt want to support multiplayer servers, regardless either way Im disappointed. While this game is definitely still enjoyable single player, it really shined in the multiplayer. The lack of DLC expansion that already exists for the game doesnt help either.If you dont mind playing single player then this game is still worth buying. Also Steam, good on you for not listing ANYWHERE on the store page that multiplayer is disabled sarcasm if you couldnt tell. I bought this with the full expectation that I would be able to play coop.
