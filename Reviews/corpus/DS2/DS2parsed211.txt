Just finished playing through the first of three difficulties. Despite being an older game it was very enjoyable and if I did not have Dungeon Siege III waiting for me, I would have played through a second time on the higher difficulties.I do have some critiques, however I am not going to state them because 1 they are minor, and 2 if you read them then youre more likely to notice it and I dont want to do that to you!Enjoy!
