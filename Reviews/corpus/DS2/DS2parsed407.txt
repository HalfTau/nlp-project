The strongest game in the Dungeon Seige series that can be played alone since the series is rather loosely connected. In my opinion the other games are not quite as good though they have individual strengths.DS2 has an evil Prince that steals a powerful artifact to become as per usual a God,  and your job, along with your party members is to geld the upstart! The game has a lot of gameplay substance even if it is by 2014 somewhat generic in nature. The story is rather shallow as well but what can be expected...this isnt even vaguely on the level of say...one of the Malazan Book of the Fallen novels Steve please encourage someone to do a Malazan game..Memories of Ice would be a great one to do!.I think for its price DS2 is pretty decent in its capacity to entertain and I would recommend it. Just dont expect too much though it is a good timekiller, generates a few laughs, and destresses as you mow down enemies galore!
