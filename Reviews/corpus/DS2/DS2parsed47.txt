A big negative of this is that of no expansion but other wise it is a good ARPG like Diablo 2 except with a party of characters that you can gear up individually.There is a fair bit more customising of character with the passives they now have access to which alter the way skills work.The passives will also open up special cooldown skills that are designed to turn the battle and can have more strategic use.Loot in this game while it has unqiues,sets and rares they are more bland than either Titan quest or Diablo 2 but as you have a party I dont think it is as much an issue.
