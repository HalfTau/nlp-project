I love this game. The first one was the most amazing game of my childlhood and when I heard that this one existed when I was about 8, I immidiately got my dad to get it. I have spent ages of my life on this game none of it wasted and when I saw it on steam I was absoloutely overjoyed. Whilst there is no multiplayer, given that the game is an absoloute gem, its still great for its value.
