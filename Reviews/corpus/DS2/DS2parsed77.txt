ING T PEICE OFbrThe only reason I bought this game from steam was because my dad,bestfriend and his mother wanted a PC multiplier game on steam.So my dad asks me if its on steam,I say yes then I buy myself the whole deal on special for myself and 3 other people only to learn two days later that the ING MULTIPLIER WAS PATCHED OUT!So there goes my fun,hope and love for this game.So in short bought a bundle copy containing all three games third one is a pile ofdue to new lore and reallly  controls only to find out that the ING MULTIPLIER DOESNT WORK, and its not like the coding for the connection has changed they just ing disabled the button, didnt even get rid of it, its just there darkend to indicate that its not avalible, tuanting you that you are forced to download a seperate file to play with friends
