Dungeon Siege was a childhood classic of mine, and picking it up for under 2 euros was a really great experience. Reliving all the morbid humour, the awesome loot caves and the small easter eggs. Compared to other titles the story may seem weak and inflexible while combat systems doesnt seem too inviting, and I may have to agree. This is a simple game, but one thing that I would really recommend trying out if you havent is a party system, which is what makes this game unique You can have up to 4 people, 5 or 6 when replaying on a higher difficulty, and that is what makes this game really shine. Being able to actually use all the loot you get instewad of being forced to sell that bow because you are a OneHanded Rogue  makes it really seem like a forgivable game.50 hours of hacking and slashing down the Haku for a price of around 2 bucks is worth it if you are into casual gaming, so buy it on sale but keep in mind it is a fairly old game.Oh and people complaining about not having DLC or multiplayer It doesnt matter the game is still awesome
