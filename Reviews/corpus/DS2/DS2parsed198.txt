The game is bloody great its got the dungeon crawling gear finding elements you love from games like Diablo anad torchlight, monsters are diverse and inmaginative, the environments are often explained through the lore or story like what enemies are in the environment, or structures.Character progression feels great, you level up and progress along a class tree if you choose and unlock and strengthen impactful abilitiesBut god damn it, this game is a bit broken, DS1 doesnt play at all, and this one crashes if you alttab on any kind of loading screens.
