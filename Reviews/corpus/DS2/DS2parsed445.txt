This was a great game back in the day but without the additional content and the Multiplayer features COMPLETELY disabled its a pale shadow of what it used to be, so if youve played the game before then stay away from the STEAM version, and if youre new to the title you might want to think about an alternative game unless its 75 off and youre feeling nostalgic for yester years graphics and gameplay.
