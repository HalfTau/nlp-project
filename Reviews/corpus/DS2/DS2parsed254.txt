FANTASTIC!  Epic game, amazing stuff, really great memories of playing this and Dungeon Seiege 1.  It takes a lot of what you loved about 1 and puts it into 2 while adding more stuff that just adds to the game as a whole.  Really great series. NOT going to talk about 3 as it has no place in this glorious game package.  I cant recommend Dungeon Siege 1 and 2, and each of their expansions minus 2, havent tried it yet but judging by the quality of 1 and 2,  I cant say it would be bad.Dont get 3, it seems pretty terrible but hey, if it comes with a package deal, ok then.
