Its 2016. This game is now 14 years old. Still one of the best RPGs Ive ever played and a complete reference to me in the field. Ive had it a long time before I even had Steam, and a few years ago a friend gave me a key.Since it was ported into the Steam platform it has lost the multiplayer capabilities, but uncle Google can tell you how to restore that 9/10 greatest topdown RPG ever.too bad the next installment of the series sucked so bad
