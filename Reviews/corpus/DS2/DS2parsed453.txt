Talent trees? Check. Efficient game design? Check. Fun weaponry and cool abilities from unlocked talents? Check. Certainly repetitive as any Dungeon Crawling game is, Dungeon Siege II at least has the decency to not try to pretend it isnt what it is, and it gives you full freedom to do whatever the  it is you want. Overall a step up from the first.9/10
