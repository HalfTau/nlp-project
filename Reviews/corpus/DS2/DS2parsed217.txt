I highly recommend this game, just not on Steam which is why it is getting a thumbs down. I have a Windows 10 machine and all I get to see of the game now is the dots in the bottom left corner when the game is first launched. Then it minimizes and is unplayable. I have checked all the forums and made all of the recommended changes. Nothing works and Steam has not provided any assistance at all.I have2 GTX 460s 1GB VRAM eachAMD 1100 6 core16GB installed 2800 Memory
