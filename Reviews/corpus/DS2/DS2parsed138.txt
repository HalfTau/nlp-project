A good classicstyle dungeon crawler RPG, this game has been a constant in my life. It has a good system of character creation, keeping the feel of the previous game and it allows for a handful of good different playstyles. The mecanics are simple enough that anyone can pick them up and the story is just intriguing enough for you to keep playing. With exciting loot and diverse characters this game is solid all round.
