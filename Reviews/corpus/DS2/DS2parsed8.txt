I tried this game many many years ago and i did not like it because the controls felt awkward. I still think the controls feel awkward but they feel a little more tolerable now. The controls are a cross between diablo and divinity original sin. The combat is real time like diablo. Click to move is good but the game does not let you hold the mouse button down to keep moving. WASD directional controls would have been more appropriate for this game.The spell, class and ability choices are not bad and they are fun use.The graphics for this game are dated but good for its time.I bought this game for under 2 on humble bundle store. It is deffinitly worth that and maybe a little more.
