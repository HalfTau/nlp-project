This should not be for sale on steam. This copy of the game is broken. Resolution settings wont do anything and the multiplayer is greyed out and services have been long shutdown. Multiplayer doesnt work period. GameRanger, Hamachi, Tunngle. Nothing gets the multiplayer working again. ing waste of money.
