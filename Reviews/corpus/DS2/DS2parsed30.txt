Dungeon Siege 2 is a really good rpg game with a strong story like as lord of the ring.But this game is only compatible with windows 10 update version 1607.if you have a higher update version can this give you a problem with the mouse curser that you cant see in the game.But the solution of this issue is easy to fix.if you have windows 10 1907 update version downgrade you windows 10 update version to 1607 and you mouse curser problem is fixed.
