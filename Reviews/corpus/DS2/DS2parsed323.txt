Id say the game predates better design, but thats not true, it just suffers from bad design.  There are two serious issues that cripple what honestly seems otherwise a reasonable game.  First is movement.  Point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, etc.  Come on, seriously?  No constant movement like Diablo of YEARS before?  No directional keys to move and attack at the same time of later games of this same era?  Thats pretty terrible.  Second is your attacks/ abilities.  You have immediate access to a rich array of spells and attacks, but you can only use one at a time.  No hotkeys for spells?  Youre kidding...  Nope, you have to go up to the corner to click on a little button to change to one of a select few that you have put in your ready tray, likely bumping the edge of the screen while at it which changes your camera view/rotation.  This is just a UI failure all around.  If I could hold the mouse button to move and hotkey 4 spells/attacks into the 14 keys to swap ablities in combat easily, Id be all into this instead of detailing why you shouldnt bother with it.  A third issue of note is that there is VERY strong discouragement in the tutorial that you should pick an attack and stick with it, meaning melee, ranged, or spell.  Great, except for the fact that spells use mana which runs out, the other two are infinite.  Yep, infinite arrows, finite mana.  So, you CANT stick with spells, you MUST swap out to something else, which again isnt easy by design and starts to impact your development apparently by the warnings.  Fundamentally obvious design flaws they could have easily fixed and made this a total win.
