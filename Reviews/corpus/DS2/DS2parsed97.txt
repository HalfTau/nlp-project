I played and beat the first dungeon siege way back in the day, so thought lanning this with a buddy would be fun. Turned out not so fun, were running windows 10 so game is broken out of the box, we fixed that, then had to install fixes to get multiplayer enabled, couldnt use the default exe to get the game functional hence the 7 minutes play time listed for me but we got it working thanks to community fixes and some tinkering.The game itself, just isnt very good. The party AI is so awful it makes the game a giant chore. Case in point, your healer just wants to make a bee line straight into a new pack of enemies and die. Without a healer you front line melee players go down in seconds vs an evenly leveled foe.The only party commands are positional, which is almost completely worthless, and manually controlling every character individually is impossible with the UI. You need to constantly adjust the camera, its such a pain the butt.To add salt to the wound, ressurecting in town makes you lose ALL of your gear. Saving and exiting automatically spawns you in town as well, and the sparse portal locations make traveling a giant chore. All in all I can see why this franchise ultimately failed, technical issues aside, poor game mechanics really make this game not fun to play.
