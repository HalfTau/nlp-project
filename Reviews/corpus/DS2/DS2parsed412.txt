Wow this game is awesome. Ive been playing games for 25 years and this is one of my favorites. The stats on weapon drops from the drops is fun to compare, the fights are fun, you can pause the game to switch party members and switch weapons/spells/etc. by pushing the space bar which is really fun for strategizing, the game doesnt feel linear because you can explore out a bit and there are side quests. The story is nice. The cities are cool. There is an elf city which has a lift to get up which is pretty cool as well really enjoying this one. Id give this 9/10. The graphics are still decent, but its the gameplay that makes this one shine.If your trying to pick one Dungeon Siege game Id go with 2, followed by the first one, and then the Dungeon Siege III.
