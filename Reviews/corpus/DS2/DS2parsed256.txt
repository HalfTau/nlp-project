Dungeon Siege II is definitely worth the cost and is the best of the three. It includes new features that the first did not have. Definitely better than Diablo II.ProsNew Specialtiespassives skill tree and PowersThree subclasses for each of the four classesAmazing dialogue from NPCsImproved graphicsInteresting StorylineMany SidequestsThree difficulties which are unlock for your character/party when you complete it Like Diablo II   Mercenary VeteranComplete Mercenary to unlock, and EliteComplete Veteran to unlockFun Party Management 4 party slots in Mercenary 5 in Veteran and 6 in EliteI keep coming back to this game cause it is amazing with great replay value.You can have pets instead of companions/friends or both in your party.Summoning creatures which do not take up space in your party.ConsControlling your party can be difficult when youre trying to dodge a projectile or avoid a melee attack on just one specific character reason why players would rather play solo or a small party. However you can just use rampage and pause to switch characters and move themSteam version does not have/include DS2 expansion Broken WorldOverall this game is great and i would highly suggest anyone to get this.9/10Add me if you have any questions about DS2
