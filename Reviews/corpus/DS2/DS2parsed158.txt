just beat this game and it was a really great little diablo/torchlight type game.you can really customize your characters skills and have up to 4 total party membersthat you can switch out with others as you find them.others will wait in the inn if you want them back. you can also add 1 additional character after beating the game and going into the next harder mode with that group only.Classes aremage  with fire, lightning, death magic.healer  with a few support spells.warrior  tank or 2 handed melee or dual handed.range type  with either bow or thrown blades.you can mix classes, i usually give my warriors a few points into healer so i can rez other party members after a tough fight. you have 400 mana, might as well use it you can play any way you want  4 mages or 1 archer and 3 warriors go ahead.you can also add pets scorpion wolf spider and more, all with diffrent roles.you can add armor, weapons and spells and have an inventory for each party member.you also get to add the skill points for each party member as they level.if you have played the first dungeon siege you know that one felt more like a crawler, were after every battle demanded a save, this one is more fluent less likely to die arcade type.consthe enchanting was not that great.you cant have more than 4 party members untill you beat the game and get to the next difficulty level.so you beat the game and want to create a new character and start on medium you cant do that.when you do play the medium level you have a chance to reinvite the party members from the first run thru with all the skill points reset, but its bugged so only a few you can release from the inn and it wont let you reinvite if you already have them.some of the uniqes and set items you find are way out of your level,im getting really nice lvl 13 items at level 45....if you send group members to the inn, they wont level and some will, 3 levels below your main.
