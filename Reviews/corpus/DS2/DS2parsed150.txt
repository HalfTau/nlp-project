Im havingto rewrite this review as i was totally WRONG in everything i said about this game i prob had PMT or something........anyhoo this game is a Masterpiece sadly steam being steam ie money grabbing garbage didnt manage to get the broken worlds expansion for this game which is depressing. At first this game is hard it took me a long time to realise that i litterally had to run away regularly to avoid having my party wiped running away doesnt come easy to me lol. However by the time you get to about lvl 18 youll have the basics understood. This game is deep some of the puzzels took me days to figure out but there is a mountain of fun to be had here. Oh lastly dont be put off by the horrible linear cheesy first hour or two of the game its not representative of the rest of the game.
