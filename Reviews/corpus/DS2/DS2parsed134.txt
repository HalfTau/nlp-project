As great today, as when it came out over a decade ago.An RPGlight, it takes what it needs from the oldschool topdown RPGs and leave the fluff out, focusing instead on a Diabloesque combat system, that is quick and responsive, and feels engaging. The stat systestem is perhaps a bit oversimplified, and considering that the levelcap is at 100, and one playthrough will easily take you to the high forties, there are not enough skills in the game.But its still a great game, an RPGLight, for those who feel that the classics like Baldurs Gate are too heavy, and want something more RPGy than Diablo.
