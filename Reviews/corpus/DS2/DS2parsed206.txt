Classic Duneon crawl hack  slash Rpg style game, Simple chracter development, great grp managment, inventory sharing, extra storage space located at all city teleporters. I played this game years ago, great story and even still find it some what additive. The difficulty is based on level ranges you choose at beginning of a campaing so you can scale everything to your chracters level. It also has and import and export feature so you can choose any character you create and start at that level you extported them at on a new campaing.Graphics will full you at menu, but they get normal.Dosent support HD resolutions and 32 bit max on graphics, but still gets good fps and for the time period this game is not that bad in graphics.Easy camera controls once you get use to hotkeys and keyboard and mouse gaming incase your rusty at em.Fan of classic Dungeon crawls, hack  slash you ight get a kick out of this game.This game is similiar to Dungeon siege 3 but game play ui, and combat are really different is some ways.Edit Steam really messed up the installation of this game and it fails to install the expansion properly.Trying to follow the fix, but it requires you to edit the PC registry which can really mess up your PC if you do not know what your doing. if you attempted to fix this on your own, Back up your registry before you beginSteam if your going to sell this product then you need to work with the developer or something to make sure it installs correctly.Edit I found a post on Steam that some one made the fix and includes all the stuff Steam fails to install correctly. its in a Zip folder i tested out the file first on my Virtual PC. Its safe no virues or hacks cause i dont trust anyone, but my parents.Still worth playing its just a real pain to get working 100
