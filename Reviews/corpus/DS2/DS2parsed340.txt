Just put it to rest after a lost weekend of it. I like it. I am a story person and as such I order my DSs 231. 1 didnt do it for me I never finished. 3 was good although in retrospect having played it before 2 I realize it was short and mildly less absorbing than 2.2positivesstory often engrossingraising my pet to adulthood by feeding it swords, armor and accessories was delightfulat least  50 of the banter was charming, voice acting was generally goodpretty landscapesplenty of play hours per dollarimportant villain dissolves into what looks like black feathers at his demise I approved.sometimes button mashing and the resultant monster dismemberment just hits the spot.negativesgrind, mountains of creatures to fight and fight and fight to excess. Sometimes I began to wonder if the story would ever resumewith so many enemies piled on each other in their eagerness to finish me off on the detailed background and smeared with the varied colors of lightning, fire, death and ice it often was difficult to see who was living and who was dead.
