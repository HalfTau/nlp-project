One of my favourite games of all time. The graphics are a bit outdated, but the amazing gameplay makes up for that. The story is a bit clich and the game gets repetitive at times. But its still my personal favourite RPG of the century. If you wish to try this game i would definitley recommend it.Warning no expansion and no multiplayer8.5/10 great game
