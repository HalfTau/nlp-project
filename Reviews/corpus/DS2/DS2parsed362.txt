Absolutely Love this old timer, but to my dissapointment I played for 12 hours yesterday saved my game 2 times I always do to be sure that way exited out of the game to the game start menu. woke up the next morning and hit the contue button only to have it put me 15 lvls lower and way back near the starting point.I still love the game but it seems after all the cleaning out files reloading backup saves and every other troubleshooting option that it will not let me save any further.........Oh how dissapointing!!!!!
