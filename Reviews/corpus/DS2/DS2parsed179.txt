Most of my PC gaming life was with the first Dungeon Siege and Legends of Aranna. The gameplay was easy to understand and honestly preferred it over Diabalo, graphics were pretty amazing. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game if you expect it to be similar to the first of the DS series.I dont know if its just my computer which runs games like Chivalry Medieval Warfare pretty well or its the game, but the textures arent as good as youd expect for the second game of the DS series, heck the first DS looks better and even more crisp.The second thing I dont like about this game is they seem to have thrown the party options like having the whole party target the weakest or strongest enemy, being able to highlight and select all party members to regroup.The next thing is more of a personal preference but Im not a big fan of having to continuously use the right click to attack. Im more used to the DS1 single click and let everyone do the dirty work.Next is the lack of game settings, there isnt a whole lot you can adjust.Lastly I think everything seems so cluttered, mostly the objects in the game like crates you cant destroy followed by other nitpicking like how fat the cursor is.Now obviously I havent spent much time ingame but to me DS2 was a disappointment in comparison to DS1 but its all the matter of personal preference. When I think of Dungeon Siege I think of an idle action packed game thats simply point and click while you manage your partys health, but this game is trying to be Diablo with some differences here and there. Diablo is a cool game, but just not my styleUnfortunately I cannot recommend the game if youve come from the DS1 world, Id consider it as a downgrade. Although, for 7 I guess its okay
