Have always had fun with this game.Played this game when I was a young one. Loved it then, and love it now. Would suggest this game to any one who enjoys a Diabloesque, partybased RPG. This game is quirky in all the right ways. It has a substandard story coupled with being a pretty short game. On the upside it has an easy to use and fluidfeeling combat system. Character traits, abilities, powers are simple, but intuitive. The game takes you on a very immersive journey and keeps you coming back.I recommend this game.PS This game has fullvoiceacting for all characters, forgot about this the second time around
