this game was my childhood, very well written if a bit on the generic side story, with genuine attempts and success in creating their own world and lore, an excellent game, its a shame that this version doesnt have MP support as DS2 DESERVES it, i would ask people to make mention of this in their reviews as this game is excellent, just they couldnt put the extra effort for the MP.overall one of the few games to have a real honest feel of your hero growing and you being able to read up on the lore they reated, its not much but its enough for you to know HOW those guys are here, WHERE theyre from and WHY they are here, along with any important info.game on release 15/10steam version 8/10 gib multi
