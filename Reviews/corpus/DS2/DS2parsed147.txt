I liked DS1s gameplay more, but this one was not so bad in the end. I was about to drop it competely after experiencing how intensely penalising dying is in this game, but I saw you can set invincibility mode on by chanting drlife. drlife removes it. At the very least I can go get my gear back.Also, Taar is absolutely amazing! I hope to encounter such a character again in another game.
