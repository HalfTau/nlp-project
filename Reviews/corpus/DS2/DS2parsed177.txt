I was looking for a basic dungeon game with a skill tree, treasure, and magic items to augment your character. I just wanted a game to dive into and kill some time. This game is the perfect fit. Ive only played it for a couple of hours, but I really like it. The world is pretty fluid, I love the click to move, treasure is realistic, and though Im playing easy mode, its not extremely easy. Kiting is realistic as the AI will follow you for a bit, then give up on you. What a steal it is at 6.99, thanks Steam.
