Really was surprised how much changed from DS1 to this. in the Single player version. Much more of a story and the graphics are just really well done. Wish it was a better port and the map as well as FOV were better can be fixed with MODs but not midgame without starting over .Still enjoyed the game. Side quests are well done and no real fetch quests to be found. Combat is fun if you pause often enough to issue orders. Overall good game and some nice puzzles as well.
