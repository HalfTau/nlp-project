FANTASIC works for me on steam, and is my favorite action RPG game ive ever played and the content is pretty overwhealming especailly since this game released around 2003! and ive played this game longer then it says because i usually play this game offline, i just recently started playing through Veteran, and even though its basically the same game with new weapons and armor the replay value is still there for the DOZENS of things you WILL miss, in fact i played an older game in the series legends of arana.. i think and I beat it about 7 or 8 times and I still had fun, AND i think this game is better. 7 is VERY little to me atleast. RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
