So this game is somewhat repetitive. But its still fun as long as breaks are taken occiasionally.Ive got a friend who says this is his favorite RPG ever. I cant see why. This is by no means a bad game but there are better ones. If youve played Torchlight a dozen times, crushed all the orcs in Lord of the Rings Online, and slain the ultimate boss in FATE then this game will give you something new.There is no 1 town you go to. No shopkeeps you keep going back to. No place you will call home for more than couple hours of gameplay. This game has you travel through countless areas as you progress down the storyline. From a dense jungle, to a barren desert, to misty mountain roads, to woodlands infested with all sorts of monsters.ProsDont stick in 1 place long enough to get bored with itLoads of varied inviromentsA party system. And a fairly good one at thatGood storyVariety in everything from weapons to monsters to shopkeeps and townsConsCan be repetitiveBoring to play for hours on endYou have to play through the game multiple times to get a full party. You start with 4 and can get up to 6 by completing the game twiceGraphics have aged horribly. Like really badly. All the characters and mobs are super chunky. As is the enviroment.
