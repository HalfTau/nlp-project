DONT buy this! There is NO Multiplayer!!! which is not declared in the description. Bought it alongside a friend for good old times sake. Still cant believe this crap. Great, great game, no doubt about it. We really loved it. But with no Coop..... worth not so much. DONT BUY IT!! Really cant imagine that adding in a lobby for hosting online games could have been much harder than just deactivating the entire Multiplayer. Selling this is blunt theft in my eyes.
