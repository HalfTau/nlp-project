As ive played this game on cd copy years back I purchased this and realised that the DLC for II isnt in the package, though its not detrimental to the game experience for an old player of the franchise kind of a let down. Though I have enjoyed this game so far for my return to playing it, I would recommend to anyone whos enjoyed diablo or any similar series! definately a 10/10 in my books, a few bugs here and there but id buy it if youre interested...
