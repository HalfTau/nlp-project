The advantage of getting these games on Steam was that they would work through Steam when they might not outside of them being older games on newer systems. That is no longer true. Lately, most of these older games, that I love so much, no longer work on Steam either. That being so, what good is Steam? This is the 4th of 5th game I have recently tried to play on Steam that didnt work. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling them to no avail. If these games are not going to work, then I no longer have any reason to bother with Steam. I even tried purchasing a couple of games because I still had money on my Steam account and they were on sale at a very good price, but they didnt work either. What good is Steam if these games just dont work on them.
