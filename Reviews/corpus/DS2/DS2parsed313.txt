So far this is one of the best RPG Ive ever played. First played back in 2006 or so, and decided to buy on Steam now, just to refresh memories. Already spent dozens of hours playing a patched steam version, see the links and explanation in game community, thats why in my profile you might see a low hours ingame  and more to come.Ideally you need to play on per quest basis, otherwise you may forget details and such.Highly recommend this game, well worth its money and even more.
