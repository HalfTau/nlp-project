This is the DS 2.  Not many people know about it because it wasnt very popular at the time.  It was quickly overshadowed by other, more wellknown handheld systems such as the Playstation Portable, the Atari Lynx, the Sega Dreamcast, a fluffy kitten, and the Nintoaster.  I recommend getting the physical DS 2 instead of the download one, because the screen on my download one keeps falling off, and I have to redownload new ones.
