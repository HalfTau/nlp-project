8.5 out of 10. With perfectly judged boss battles, great music and consistently good gameplay, DS 2 is probably one of the best actionRPGs to be released in the first decade of the 21st centuryI liked it for a variety of reasons and I think you will to. Play it today in 2010, that is and itll run smooth as silk on your new rig, yet another reason to play it. Just do it...
