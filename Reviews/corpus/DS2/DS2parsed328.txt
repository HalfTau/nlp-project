Great game that I replayed many times.DS1 was a great start to this series and DS2 expanded on it wonderful with still a great deal of freedom in character/group construction.DS3 destroyed the series compeltely when they removed all of the good points and added many horrible additions.DS2 tho? Great great game.The only reason I cant go play DS1 every once in a while for fun is because DS2 is just so much better/expanded off of it.Pause combat at its best if not a little old.
