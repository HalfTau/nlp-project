I would totally and utterly recommend this game. The game starts of nice and easy, but very quickly ramps up the difficulty and complexity. It is nice that once you complete the game, you dont have to start over, but rather you start the game as the same characters, but everything is scaled up to a new difficulty, breathing new life into the game. Playing from the start with all the abilities  powers that you have earned throughout the game.A few issues with compatability, but once you sort this out, game runs smoothly.
