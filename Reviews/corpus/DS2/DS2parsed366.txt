I now own 3 copies of this game1 The DS2 original edition2 The Broken World expansion  which comes with DS2 3 This on Steam.The game itself is very Diabloesque. You find mobs you kill mobs. You see elites you kill elites.However what set this apart was the eye candy  for its time  and powersThe game CAN get a little tedious near the end but then again all dungeon crawlers do. Thats where the  powers  aspect comes in to help break the monotony.Depend on the class you choose these powers can either significantly buff your party or let you deal insane amounts of destruction for a few seconds.I could get deeper into this but Il just say pick up the game. Its a blast and if I look at my older characters  which I Have saved and range from level 4 78  Ive put well over 1000 hours into this game and still picked it up on Steam regardless.
