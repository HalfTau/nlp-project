Pros somewhat good story challenging gameplay soundtrack.Cons somewhat plain story too challenging gameplay can slow progression to a crawl monsters are kinda too eww for my liking.In the end, I had my fun with both the basic and DLC parts of a game, but Ive used invincibility cheat to not waste tons of time of my life. If youre opposed to cheating for saving time and frustration  go ahead and do Elite w/o it. Some people did!
