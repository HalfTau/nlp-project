A classic. One of the greatest RPGs I have ever played. Its paced well and filled to the brim with secrets.Has plenty of replay value too.Voice actings a bit dodgy but the gameplay and story help you forget to even look for bad bits.I would recommend this game to everyone.PS For inexperienced gamers, there are a large array of cheats available ingame.
