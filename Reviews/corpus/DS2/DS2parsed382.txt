Dungeon Siege 2 keeps the same format as DS1, with a few improvements. Now there is a single player replayability target. In order to really complete the game, it is necessary to finish it at least 3 times using the same character, due to the XP level suggested for each difficulty level.Now it is possible to craft special items, instead of waiting for them to appear as loot, there are special powers that can be used sometimes during battles. The inventory part suffered some small changes, but keeps almost the same as the first game. The main change in character development is that now it is possible to improve some type of ability as you level up.For fans of the first game it is as good as that one. unfortunately, as DS1, DS2 steam version does not include the Broken World expansion, but even like this there will be many hours of play time.
