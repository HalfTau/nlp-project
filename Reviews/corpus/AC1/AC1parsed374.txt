I bought and beat this game on xbox. Loved it. Bought this again on pc with a bundle. Bundle was cheaper then buying the rest. So I am playing it again on pc. It has more stuff to do but not much. Check for a desync of your graphics which cause a glitch in leaps of faith. Otherwise. Good port. It is easy to fix with your graphics options.
