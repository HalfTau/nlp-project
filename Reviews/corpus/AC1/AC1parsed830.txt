I just got this game so that I would have the complete saga.To be honest, I didnt expect much of this game and kind of rightly so, comparing it to its successor ACII of course.What I like about this game the most is that it set in motion the series of games that Ive so enjoyed to play.Still funny that Altair is the only one in the game to not have an appropriate accent, glad they fixed that in Revelations.
