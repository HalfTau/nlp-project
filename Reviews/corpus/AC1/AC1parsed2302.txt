Played this through on the Xbox 360. When I have time I will play it through again on PC. Loved the experience and the depth of the world. Its a shame that the series has become such a transparent cash cow. This title however, though said to be the worse of the series for repetitive gameplay, is simple and effective, and doesnt have Ubisofts draconian DRM. Unfortunately, it does suffer from a lack of optimisation which, if you can handle the inconsistency, still shouldnt deter a purchase, at significant discount.
