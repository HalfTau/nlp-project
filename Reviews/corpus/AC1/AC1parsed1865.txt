Assassins creed is a wonderful adventure game. The enviroment in this game is very realistic and pretty. The game story is very intresting that you sometimes dont want to quit the game. I also like the gameplay itself that you can climp up buildings and jump from roof to roof. The combats are a bit difficult in the beginning but you will lern pretty quickly how to do. I hope when I buy AC 2 that it is even better than the first one.
