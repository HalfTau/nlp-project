This games an odd one, in a way, Im not sure I can describe it.Assassins Creed felt a bit unfinished game, more like a game mechanic test of some kind, but still, I think its the one I like the most in the whole series.It wasnt perfect, not even near, but it had that certain challenge, that just made me feel good for surviving. This has definitely the hardest combat, and its just SO GOOD. When the game was published, it was oneofakind and it kind of still is. Assassins Creed II changed so much, that it feels like a totally different game. Dont get me wrong, loved AC2 alsoIts sad, how many people, who play the games of this series have skipped the first part, though. They missed a lot.
