Many regard this as a beta to what AC would become. Its partly true, but dont believe this is unfinished in any way.AC1 is short and straight to the point. Its going to upset you a little sometimes due to the repetition and a little grind, but on average its a very entertaining experience, dark and gritty in a way that no other AC matched to this day.8 out of 10/ 4 out of 5. If you are a fan of the series, buy it already. If not, try it  the general taste should be enough to let you decide whether the rest is worth it,
