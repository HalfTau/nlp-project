Ahhh, assassins creed! No numbers after that, no other names like Syndicate or Unity! Just it Assassins creed. The good old times right?Assassins creed is not a masterpiece, but is pretty fun and enjoyable.Starting with the flaws The gameplay is repetitive Come to a city, hear a conversation, interrogate someone... repeat This is his major flaw. If you dont have the patience DONT play this game. It can be really frustrating. I was starting to be sick of the same missions on the middle of the game. However, if you have patience, it can be pretty fun. if not, start in ac2 Repetitive dialogues and characters people on the street. I swear that i killed the same guy at least 5 times. Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or more menu screens Limited incentive to explore and collect No replay valueDont let his flaws distract you from the good game that he can be Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous The environments are credible in their attempt to recreate an historical period. Voiceacting is excellent general sounddesign too and is strikingly original Good UI Quicktravel available Good ad enjoyable history Combat is good and cinematic Killing a target involves a series of different missions They are unvaried but adds for immersion.In general, Assassins creed is a decent game. Its not as good as the sequel, but you should play it.7.5/10
