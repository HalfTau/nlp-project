Because I did a review of Assasins Creed 2, I thought it only fair to review its predecessor. Assassins Creed if I say 2, it implies the sequel. Other wise, Im referring to the first game initially feels like a breath of fresh air amidst all wildly rampant action games at its time. And it was unique was being the key word. The graphics are stunning and it helped buff the slim pickings of the stealth genre. However, as the game dragged on, youll come to realize that all your quests are the same and at its core, youre simply repeating what youve been doing since the first hour of the game for about a dozen more hours. Only play this game if you care about the series plot. Otherwise, skip it.Grade C
