What happened to the PC port? I remember playing this game on Xbox when it came out. It was a great game. I loved being an assasin. But the bugs are so...Arrrgh! I would not recomend buying this game cause it just wont run on a computer. The console to my great disatisfaction is where this game belongs. If you are trying to understand the AC universe, I get it that you want to play the first game, but take it somewhere else. It wont run on your PC and there is nothing you can do about that. I wish you the best of luck.BUT! This is the game to play if you want to know where Altiar came from, just remember you have to climb the mountain every, single, time.
