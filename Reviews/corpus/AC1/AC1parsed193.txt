It was a good experience, I enjoyed the story layout memory blocks visualised as DNA strands, the amount of detail put into every location there are only 4 cities and some patches of open kingdom between them, but theyre big enough that the game isnt boring, the combat which starts off simple but gradually adds another modicum of complexity as you progress, whichmake fighting easier since attracting a mob is suicide in earlygame but mandatory in lategame, and the organised assassination notes to offer you a way to stealth assassinate targets without the city guards on your tail constantly  although you can brute force your way through as loudly as you want with the exact same overall outcome, if you can survive it.It is a little flawed thoughDefinitely worth a buy, and I get why its regarded as a modern classic. Sales are coming soon too, so you can pick it up then for like 2.
