Combing parkour and combat elements in a game never felt so good. At its release Assassins creed was praised for allowing players to run across rooftops and scale towers.While the title Assassin is associated with stealth, Assassins Creed doesnt really do the stealth aspect really well. Youre often fighting multiple enemies in a crowd or running through the city after a target. The only stealth aspects are following a target from a distance and eavesdropping on NPCs. Nonetheless the game still delivers an amazing experience. Rolling into Damascus on horse for the first time was breathtaking.Youll definitely get your moneys worth buying this game at full price.
