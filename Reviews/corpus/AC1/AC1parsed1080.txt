Where it all began...The more recent Assassins Creed titles may have better gameplay and graphics, but they lack storyline and completely disregard the original concept of the Assassins and their creed to be discrete in all things. How can you expect to be discreet when weilding tens of weapons including guns  explosives, having access to armies of assassins, and sailing pirate ships into combat... Almost feels like youre playing God of War.The first episode of the series may be more difficult and less grandiose compared to the recent titles, and the gameplay may have aged a bit. But the storyline, dialogue and general ambiance definitely make up for it. Still my favorite Assassins Creed.
