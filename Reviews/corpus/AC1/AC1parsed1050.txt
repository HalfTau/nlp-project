Assassins Creed is all about spending ages gathering information on your targets, using it to devise a plan to get in, make the kill and get out, then see it all go horribly wrong in a split second and end up winging it anyway. But that just makes it all the sweeter when you do execute a plan perfectly.Basically Metal Gear Solid with free running during the Crusades. It can drag a bit going through all of the information gathering challenges, but the assassinations just about make up for it.
