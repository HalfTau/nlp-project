I did play Assassins Creed III which I loved, but the story of Desmond seemed really intresting and Assassins Creed III was really fun.So I bought It.Gameplay could be a bit better but its not really a problem.Parkour could be better.Altair was an easy character to get use to and enjoy, but saddly you cant swim.There is nice spaceing in the game. So you can run around, climb, and hide.Story was great!
