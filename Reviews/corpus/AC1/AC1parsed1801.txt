I really like the game. It has an amazing story and the universe itself is very interesting. Its really worth playing through the game, and a good one if you are planning to start the series.However, one of the problems of this game are the controls. If you are thinking of playing this game, you should buy an X Box controller for your PC, as playing with the keyboard is a lot harder. Also, if you really want to play this game and complete it 100, make sure that you dont collect all the flags until near the end of the game, as it gets really annoying.
