My first impression wow, such a masterful piece of work! Graphics, mechanics, idea, story...Then, after an hour or so, the game started to construct a bit of a repetitive pattern, ultimately leading to a small frustration, doing same things over and over again. It made me drop the initial ambition to finish every little side mission and be over with the game as soon as possible, just to see the story, which is, by the way, really fantastic.Nevertheless, as the game progressed to the final chapters, it became increasingly tougher and more intense, and by the end of it, I really started to enjoy it once more. After finishing it, I could say yes, this game really IS great, despite the repetitiveness. Everything else is just fantastic the narrative, the graphics, movieworth fight scenes, cities, the story and the twists, soundtrack, the sense of epicness...I really recommend this game, and the whole series as such! Its one masterfully written and designed piece of art! Kudos, UBI!
