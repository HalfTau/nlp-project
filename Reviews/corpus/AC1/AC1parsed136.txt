Cant really say im impressed with the game.  I know its a bit old, but I dont care for Assassins creed.  This game isnt complete trash, it has a somewhat promising story, and okay gameplay.  If you want to play Assassins creed, just play Assassins creed 2.  The games are all the same after that, but that was really the only good one.
