When this game was releaced it did a lot of new things and it did them right. still it does those things better then some of its sequals. the controls are tighter and more responsive, the characters are well written and interesting, and you even get to spend as little time as possible in the hub world to keep the story flow going. a must play for anyone looking for something different from a different age in games.
