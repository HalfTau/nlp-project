I do not think I would recommend this game to anyone. If you want to get into the AC series and you have time to knock this game out quick, then sure, go ahead. But if you have a limited budget and limited time, you can skip it. The premise and setting of the game are interesting, but the game falls flat in its execution. I had to put this game down without finishing it because I became so frustrated with it.ProsCons
