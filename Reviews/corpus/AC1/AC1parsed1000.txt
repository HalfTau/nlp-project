Assassins Creed......Its really hard to say about the sheer size and brilliance of Assassins Creed into words. It is an epic game that you have to experience for yourself. The cities of the Holy Land have been nicely rendered. The people, the environment  landscape has been designed so briliantly that it gives an uncanny feeling which cannot be descibed with words. Although the gameplay  becomes repetative after a while, but it is truly an incredible experience.I will definitely recommend this game
