An awful, buggy, seemingly untested port of the XBOX360 original. The controls are awful, and this is with a controller. The physics are somehow off, and Altair will randomly fail to grab obvious ledges, move in strange directions, and sometimes die landing on a pile of hay when performing his leap of faith. Crashes to desktop are fairly frequent, which is excruciating with the save checkpoint system. Other bugs will often preclude you from continuing assassinations, forcing you to manually restart from checkpoint.A tedious, buggy mess. I deeply regret making this purchase. Get it for the XBOX360 instead if you can.
