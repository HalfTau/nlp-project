Its really too bad that there isnt an inbetween, otherwise my reccomendation would be eh, rather than yes or no.The game is VERY repetitive.Throughout the entire game, each mission is pretty much the same. Travel to a city, where one of your targets are Talk to Assassin at bureau Complete 3 side activities investigations before you can take out your target Report back to Assassin at bureau Take out your target Run away and escape from guards Return to Assassin at bureau one last time to report success Return home to report of your success to Master Repeat x9You have 9 targets total throughout the game, which means you do the SAME thing 9 times before the ending of the game.It got to a point where I wasnt really playing for fun anymore, I was playing just to beat the game.Nothing is really exciting about the game until the ending.There is a major lack of story and personality with all the characters. You establish connections with NO ONE, because of all the missions being the same and there being a lack of build up or story behind those you are targeting.No one is rememorable, except Warren, who I think had the MOST personality, and Altair of course, and even he lacks much of a personality, though he has more personality than anyone else in the game, except Warren.People complain about Assassins like Connor lacking any personailty while Altair has almost NONE at all!The little personality I got from Altair was determined, focused, arrogant, and confused.I suppose a better way of putting it was that he had lots of potential but what is given is performed horribly.In later games there is story behind everyone you take out.They wronged you, they serve a big role in the Templars, they have information, etc.In this game, you get no story at all about anyone really, until the ending.The combat isnt that good, with it being to just spam one button and hope whoever youre fighting doesnt reverse you randomly.In later games combat is a little more fleshed out, with there being certain ways to fight certain enemies that make it more diverse, but here its the same fighting style over and over again, which adds to the repetitiveness of this game.There isnt a diversity in enemies either, theyre all the same, unless you want to count archers and swordsmen as 2 different enemies, but they fight the same.Also I love sarcasm how when a sick guy pushes ME, it makes ME the criminal!This game is a buggy mess. Nothing that is exactly game breaking, but constantly the viewmodel would break sometimes after being knocked down by an enemy, sometimes while doing a leap of faith I would die on TOP of the hay stack, sometimes bodies would fall out of the map through the ground, some guards would remain idle while I am attacking other guards RIGHT NEXT to him, etc.Again, nothing game breaking, but broke immersion quite often.4/10Youd be better off just getting any of the other Assassins Creed games. This game feels like some sort of early Alpha compared to its sequel.If you passed this game up, you wouldnt miss much.Youd be better off starting your Assassins Creed experience with Assassins Creed 2, and just looking up what little you missed in Assassins Creed 1.
