What a beautiful work of art this game is. The platforming is fantastic, with a free running so you can jump, grab, climb, almost anywhere. Social stealth is valued, and strategi to use. Running across rooftops is incredibly fun. The storyline is immersive, compelling, and makes good sense, with alot of intruige and mystery mixed in. Learn the skills of an asassin, find your target, study the situation, learn information out on the streets, and let your blade find their throat. While you are mostly invincible if you play it right, you can end up needing to re synch with the genetic memories if you do anything too foolish. Be alert and observant, and dont forget your creed.
