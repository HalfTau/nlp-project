Assassins Creed is a great example of a development studio taking a risk and having it pay off. With its pioneering of the puppet control system for third person platformers and the use of freerunning which later in 2009 spurred Mirrors Edge.Assassins Creed has a basic flow. You get a mission in one of five regions, you arrive, you do all the prerequisite open world missions to prepare such as surveying the area from a perch and stealing valuable information that you can use to better approach the target, then you start the actual assassination.While others seemed to get annoyed with the preperation phase, I didnt mind it so much as it helped push the sense of how preparation was key for things like this, though some variety wouldnt have hurt.While Assassins Creed requires a dualcore procesessor, it does perform quite well on anything that meets the minimum requirements. Unlike most console ports, the frames are smooth and the details are much better.
