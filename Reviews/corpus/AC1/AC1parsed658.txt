Assassins Creed is one of those gems that, in my opinion, was a good departure from Prince of Persia. Having played all the Princes, the storyline of Assassins Creed hooked me immediately! It blended historical factfiction with some modern ideas, and because I am a sucker for conspiracy theories, the whole idea of a corporation exploiting individuals for some thing of power grabbed me completely. I was an Assassin, going from city to city, killing the evil doers and saving mankind.What did I like? The graphics for its time was superb, a testament to dedicated artists showing their trait. It still kind of stands up even today and even though we have become numb to 4K and HDR, the quality of the work that went into this game was tremendous. As I said, the story was brilliant and intriguing. The battle sequences made you feel mighty and in control.What didnt I like? I think the scope of the game was fantastic for its time, but the gameplay could get somewhat repetive. The locations were brilliantly done, but after a while all the alleys and soldiers started looking the same. The game tried to mix things up by giving you different ways to approach a kill, but in the end, you just needed to damage the boss enough to win. No assassation needed! This I didnt like so much.A true start to a great series.
