We must thank forever to this game for setting a franchise  8.0/10.0Highlights Exploration of the holy lands, with up to 3 major cities and the open world why we lost this in several following games?? The ANIMUS story is mindblowing Stealth Assassination is highly satisfactoryCriticism Game is a bit repetitive Fight controls are weird sometimes High difficulty makes you do sneaky kills very often
