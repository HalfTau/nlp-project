Assassins Creed is fun, engaging and entertaining.  The Characters and there voice actors are briliant and the enviroments are emersive.  The story pulls you right in and makes you want to know what happens next.  The only caveat I have is the camara angles and control response is a little rough sometimes.Overall however I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an open world adventure with a great story you wont be sorry you picked it up.
