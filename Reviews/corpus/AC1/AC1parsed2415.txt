Absolutely topnotch game. The visual presentation is leagues beyond its time, looks better than most games of 2011. Movement system is nearly flawless and effortlessly thrilling. The storyline is engaging and combat is extremely satisfying. One of the best games ever made and a musthave for anyone who enjoys good combat, rpg, or parkour movement.
