Just as good as the first time back in 08. Gameplay is repetitive with only 3 main cities Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem and your home base Masyaf, but the storys what drives the experience.The gameplay itself can be very glitchy at moments, especially when free running your weapon arsenal isnt as extensive as the other games, but it does the job wonderfully therere no negative drawbacks to not being stealthy, so be as crazy as you want. These things dont detract from the enjoyment of the game, but can be frustrating when you have to escape after assassinating your target. This is a series in its infancy, we all know where it goes from here with the numerous added enhancements and features.Graphicswise its held up quite well the environments still look gorgeous and the attention to detail for both the cities and history still fascinates me to this day. The audio, on the other hand, is alright for the main characters and targets, but is recycled for the NPC townsfolk and you can hear the compression in some of the dialog. This is a port, so its understandable.Despite the minor glitches and audio complaints, I still highly recommend this game to veterans of the series and those who have never played the series before. Experience the ongoing, generational struggle of the Assassins against the Templars. Become one with the Brotherhood. Live the Creed.
