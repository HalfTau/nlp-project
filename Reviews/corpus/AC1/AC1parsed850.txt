I have never head the word infidel before in a game.at least so many times...The game was pretty small, considering it is an Assassins Creed game.Combat is easy and can be dull after some time since you will be fighting 10 enemies at the same time.I believe that the gameplay can be considered obsoleted since it has been surpassed by other games in the franchise.I can only recommend this game if you have a lot of patience you will lose a lot of missions due to a stupid reason and you have to start over and you find this game on a sale.
