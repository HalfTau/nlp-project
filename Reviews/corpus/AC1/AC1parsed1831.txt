I never played this when it was originally released on ps3, but I LOVE this game. The sequels are better, but this is the one that started it all, and it is apparent why it caught on so well. It has many of the best things about so many other games, all coming together to accent each other in a beautiful environment. Thank you Ubisoft!!
