So I recently bought Black Flag off the Steam autumn sale, and it hit me. I havent actually touched the Assassins Creed series yet. I own 14 and Brotherhood/Revelations. It was always on my to do list and it kept getting pushed to the side. Well I finally got to playing the first one.If like me youve played any of the modern Prince of Persia games Ubisoft released a couple generations ago, then it wont take long for you to get into the gameplay. The game is built on the concept of parkour, scaling walls and running over the city rooftops and pieces of environment. Its basically a free running sandbox, with the goal of stealthily killing select targets in your missions.I have had people tell me that Assassins Creed 1 has got nothing on 2, but I decided to play through 1 anyway, and for a first in the series? Its pretty solid. It did feel like it was missing a key element or two in its formula, and thats what I assume 2 addresses. But for a new IP its definitely a strong start.Only real complaint is that you never pull off an assassination as cool as the opening FMV. At least, I couldnt figure out how to do something like that anyway. The game is still quite enjoyable besides. If you plan to play the entire series, getting the first game on sale is worthwhile.
