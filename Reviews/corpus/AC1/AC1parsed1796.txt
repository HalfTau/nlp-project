Overall pretty good.The story is a bit confusing with the future part of the game BTW there is a future part of the gamebecause in the end it leaves the player with a cliffhanger for Assasins creed 2The Graphics looks good and has a nice feel to it.However the gameplay is a bit clunky and the wallrunning and the abillity to escape the guards is a bit buggy.the ambiance/sound/soundtrack/what ever it is called is okay, not that much really rememerable.However even though the sound is okay, the voice acting is good.It is worth it
