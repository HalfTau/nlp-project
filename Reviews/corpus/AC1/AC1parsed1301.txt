Conversation after stabbing Jubair alHakim in Assassins Creed...Jubair Why? Why have you done this?Altair Men must be free to do what they believe. It is not our right to punish one for thinking what they do, no matter how much we disagree.Jubair Then what?Altair You of all people should know. Educate them, teach them right from wrong  it must be knowledge that frees them, not force.Jubair They do not learn, fixed in their ways as they are. It is an illness, for which there is but one cure.Altair You are wrong, and that is why you must be put to rest.Jubair Am I not unlike those precious books you seek to save a source of knowledge with which you disagree? Yet you are rather quick to steal my life.Altair A small sacrifice to save many. It is necessary.The sheer maturity in which this game has been built upon is just staggering! I love Ezio, but man, Altairs character just stirs up the soul! 3
