My wife wins by playing 30 minutes of this and then never turning it on again. I, on the other hand, am too stubborn for that, so I rode the whole roller coaster. The key to me completing it was that you didnt have to ride the horse to town after the first trip to each one. I think that would have broken me after three awful rides. Everything else is best described as the same stuff over and over and over again. The actual assassinations were somewhat cool with the dialog and set pieces, but theres no way it was worth doing the same investigations nine times to get to them. And then there was the last mission where it turned into an action game with bad combat, since you couldnt stealth at all anymore. Since I already made the potential mistake of dropping a whopping 14 on the deluxe edition of the sequel, Im sure Ill at least fire it up to see how much they fixed. The one very, very large positive is that without achievements singing the siren song, I made zero attempt to gather the flags. I cant even imagine how much I would have hated this game if I had to get those damn things on top of the rest of the monotony.
