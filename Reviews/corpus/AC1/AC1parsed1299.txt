First installment with very repetitive and boring quests. Controls are not fluid. Many times I got stuck in a street in a dead end. Hard to me to control main character. I miss a bow  arrow for stealh assassination. Small quests eavesdropping, pick pockets, etc are all the same. I heard the next installments are much better. Maibe I will try them.
