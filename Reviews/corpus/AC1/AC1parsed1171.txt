Summary   Recommended Interesting action title. Story / Action / Graphics / Killing  Casual playing, should completed around 30hrs of gameplay. Graphics is fine and smooth for me even the game is 5year old/  Combat mode is personal, but I would say the control flows smooth I use a controller Some repeat missions are frustrating to replay. Dead bodies may interrupt ongoing missions, which is extreamely annoying solution is to restart the gameNotes I have spent a budget on the Assasins Creed titles due to its positive repetation, in the Steam Summer Sale 2015 carefully selected only PC sequels, not implents from other consoles Price was around 3 really worth it, but resonable Steam reviews are fairly accurate to look into, in this series. Looking forward to the playing the 2nd title. Young man, you have done me a kindness. Be assured, I wont forget it The most annoying quote ever.
