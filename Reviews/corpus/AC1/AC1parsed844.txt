Assassins Creed, The successor to Ubisofts The Prince of Persia reboot series. Days have been better.Let me first start off with a few thoughts.Decent gameplay with a few issues here and there in regards to story pace and developement.The story for the first game in the series was interesting but now its very......its a ing a mess.And the  PC port, When I first played and beat this game, I was playing a on a rather  laptop but it got the job done. when I finally got me a nice desktop that I would later upgraded with a some decent costeffeint partsThe specs towered over the receommended specs and yet I cannot replay this game can max seetings without crashing almost everything goddamn time.I tried several things inlcuding the Direct X file trick but that didnt get me anywhereThe sad thing is that this is the only mainline game in the series that does not force Uplay on you and yet I still cannot receommend this game because the crappy port. If it wasnt for that I would recommend this game easily. With that I say sadly No. Note if anyone has very other receommnedations to help me with my crashes issues I would very much like to hear them please and thank you.
