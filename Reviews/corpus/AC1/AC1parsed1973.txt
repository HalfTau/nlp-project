I came to AC just as AC4 was being released, so I knew that the critics hated the first and liked/loved the 2nd and its derivatives. I also knew how well the original had sold and thought that it couldnt be too bad.1 hour in and I thought the game was awesome2 hours in and Id already hit the repetitiveness... I was thinking about dropping the game. However, since i wanted to play number 2 i persevered for the sake of the story and this changed the way I played. Usually id be slow and deliberate in games like this, making sure that I completed everything. Now that I didnt care I raced through the cities, attacking guards wantonly and suddenly I found i was having a really fun time.Fighting large groups really makes you feel powerful as the counter style combat is fluid and, while not overly forgiving, its not too press the button in this millisecond or die difficult either.Biggest downside is the central kingdom area where anything slower than a crawl puts the guards on you. Recommend holding gallop the whole way and just mowing everyone down.
