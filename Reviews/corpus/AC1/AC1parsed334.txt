On my deathbed Ill probably ask to play this game one last time.But in all seriousness, I played it more times than any other game physical copy mostly. It got me into gaming and is truly a classic. Its success was the reason why the other games happened, some people really forget that, including Ubisoft, unfortunately.The gameplay gets repetitive, yes, a lot of people often point that out. Besides that, the game has aged really well, has great visuals, great story and characters. Not to mention it is the base for the entire fanchise.10/10, fight me.
