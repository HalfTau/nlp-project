A wonderful game! It was really addicting as i beat it in 3 sittings. The story was great. The cities that you climb around are amazing. The characters are intriguing. The sounds are fun. The Ai can be stupid at times and jump off buildings when they are chasing you. The graphics are great! The gameplay is alot of fun. The sword fighting could be improved but it is still fun. It is a great adventure game that keeps you wanting more in the end. There is alot of things to do in the game. It is a great game if you can get your hands on it. If you ever see this in the price range that is great for you then dont hesitate to get it because you wont regret it. Its a great game!
