Simple and fun, but gets really repetive really quick. Im personally not a big fan of the combat.The parkour is really fun and probably the main reason I play this game. I have no idea whats going on in the story because I dont listen to it, but damn the parkour is fun.But anyways, it provides a few hours of good entertainment. Ive heard the other Assassins Creed games are better though. Still a nice game!
