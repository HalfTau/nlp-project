This game is pretty amazing. Even though its about 6 years old now, you would never think so from the graphics. You really feel like youre an assassin in every sense of the word. The missions can get difficult at times but they are few and far between. The story itself is interesting to a point as well. The cities are beautifully done and you can tell untold hours of historical research went into this game. The voice acting is very good. The random uses of real Arabic and German among others? was a welcomed surprise and made the game feel very authentic to the time and place.The only gripes I would have with the game are 2 things one more important than the other.1. The way to exit the game without using AltF4 takes forever and is really unneccesarily annoying More important one.2. Sometimes the camera can get really stuck at weird angles but with a little mouse and keyboard work, its very negligable.This game is definently worth every penny.
