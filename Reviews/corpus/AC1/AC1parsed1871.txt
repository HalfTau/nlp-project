Picked up Assassins Creed Directors Cut during a Steam sale as I never played any game of the franchise before. I had high expectations due to the popularity of the franchise. At the beginning you get blown away by the detailed graphics and the openness of the world. You started digging into the combat mechanics, enjoy your stealthy kills and exploring every hidden city corner. But after a few missions, the repetitiveness of it all becomes quite apparent always the same mini missions, always the same chain of events, the open world where you can do... nothing. Yet another few missions later and you are wondering why you are wasting your time on this... Boredom changes into irritation once you find out that you really dont need to be stealthy nor do you need to explore everything or finish every mini mission. And then I didnt even mention the excruciating game menu, the crappy ending, the poorly scripted conversations no, there is no escape button. Quickly I didnt feel any sympathy for the main character and the unfolding story. What a missed opportunity this game is... Even at sale, I would not recommend this game.Score 4/10Pro visuals open world climbing towers and enjoying great viewsContra empty world repetitive missions clumsy controls on pc painful game menu system irritating camera system
