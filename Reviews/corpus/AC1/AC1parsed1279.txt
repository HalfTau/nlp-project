Its a 3 hour tech demo stretched into a 13 hour borefest. Great and unique setting. Amazing freerunning system. Horrible story Stupid characters, nonsense plot, obvious and crappy plottwist. Unbelievable repetitive Do the same assassination quest like 45 times in different locations with different bosses at the end thats the whole game btw. Lazy and boring combat Just press the counter button whenever you get attacked, done. Lategame Nonstop waves of artificially stronger enemies. Then kill all the 4 bosses again without getting hit, game ends. Upgrade/reward system Start with every upgrade, lose every upgrade, regain the ability to grab ledges, seriously. Pointless, empty and annoying hub world.The story sucks, the twist is visible from start, the combat is oversimplified crap and later it becomes an infuriating mess, the game lasts for around 15 hours, most of which consists of massive padding and faffing around. Skip this one, read the story on the wiki and move on, nothing to play here, just sight seeing and parkour.Simolius  April 2015
