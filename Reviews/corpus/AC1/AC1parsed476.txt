Im sorry, I just plain cant play through this. The Assassins Creed series is an amazing Franchise barring Unity, but this product feels like an unfinished mess.I was told I should play through this one through my replay of the series to fill myself in on the extra details of the story, because apparently Revelations makes more sense when you do that. The thing is, the game is downright unbearable. At one poing during a pickpocket sequence in Damascus, the game bugged out and didnt register I had to pick pocket anyone. I held shift and I simply continued to brush people aside, constantly getting caught. With fundamental bugs like this, Ill watch a playthrough or look it up if I feel inclined to see the entirety of this games story.Please start with the second game if you want to delve into this series.
