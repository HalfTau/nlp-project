Great game, got it for 5 bucks. Unfortunately, after about 4 hours of gameplay dispersed over two days, Ive already encountered a bug that wont let me continue the story line. In one of the Bureaus, I am unable to leave after the cutscene is over. As you can imagine, this is very frustrating. Ive tried quitting and reopening the program, Ive tried leaving and reentering the Animus, Ive tried rebooting. Nothings working. Time to read a plot synopsis and move on to AC 2.
