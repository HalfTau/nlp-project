First Assassins creed.I liked running around and the stealth portions however I have to say that sitting down in some areas and having to listen in on conversations is not so fun. The main character has an out of place accent, and the portions in which you must play as a character beyond Altair get boring.Game has problems with pacing, but overall Id recommend this game. Its interesting and I enjoyed it.
