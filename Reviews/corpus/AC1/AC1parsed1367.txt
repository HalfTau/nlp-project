This was one of the first games I got on steam. Assassins Creed is a good game for its time with a great storyline. I did enjoy the time is spent on this game, but the missions do get very repetitive There was hardly any variation for a long time I liked the story, although I thought it was a bit of a letdown when I found out it was just a simulation in the game. I first thought that the game would be about you being the assassin  not in a simulation In the end, I found this game quite fun as one of my first ever stealth games. Recommended to people who are new to gaming or want to learn the origins of the Assassins Creed series.
