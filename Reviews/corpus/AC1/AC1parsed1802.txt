Very nice, only minor flaws found  some camera positioning can be annoying and sometimes fight can be tricky. Gameplay doesnt really change throughout the game, so it may and only may  not will be become boring after prolonged game session. And the ending of course  not a chance for me to understand it....Above that  nice graphics, even for today, good interaction with your sorroundings, very good and interesting plot  though at the end you actually can guess the ending, but still  very good plot.Definetly worth playing
