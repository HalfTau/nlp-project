Nice gameplay, its actually fun, but after a while you realize youre always doing the same things over and over the game is not perfectly optimized for pc. You lose the full screen mode if you switch to another app and come back the controller is not completely integrated. there are no subtitles the camera works often very bad, going behind walls or plants. there are no achievements like on Xbox or PS3, which means taking all the flags or killing all the templars is completely useless
