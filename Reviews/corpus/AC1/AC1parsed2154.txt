Eh, its tough to rank this one. 2 is better in almost every way but actually planning the assassinations is neat. Thats the only part that was better than 2. 2 did more of a push you along from mission to mission dealyo while this had more of an open ended feel. Still, Id probably give this a pass. Almost everything else is worse and, for the most part, the game isnt that much fun. Well, unless you didnt play 2 already. I could see this being a lot better if you hadnt experienced Asscreed 2.
