For me, still the best game in the whole franchise. Because it shows the real Assassins. on their own time. And its the only game who makes sense to wear a Assassin costume. My eyes hurt to see Ezio running all over Italy with a Assassin suit and nobody giving afor that. On AC I its normal, because the Assassins were an active order. And its the most difficult game, but just because has limited gameplay. Doesnt have parkour, wich is good, because as i know, parkour was not invented in ancient Egipt like AC Origins is showing to us. AC I is by far the most original game in the franchise.
