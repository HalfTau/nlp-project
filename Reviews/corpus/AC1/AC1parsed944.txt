While this game does have its moments, theyre buried behind some bland missions collect the flags! and WAY too much time spent running from guards. I would not hold your breath for a resolution of the presentday story anytime soon, and the Altair storyline is light. The core gameplay, running around, hiding, and climbing is a good idea, but is not refined until later games. By comparison, Assassins Creed II is far better.On sale, however, this game may be worth it.
