Never played AC and i bought all the games in the steam summer sale thinking now is the time to play them all in order before origins comes out.Assassins Creed seems to have aged well. Graphics still look nice.Gameplay is okay but the quests are very repetitive, same goes for the combat.All you seem to do is counter  break grab  repeat.Its still fun to play but after about 15hours it was getting a bit frustrating and i was starting to rush so i could move on to ACII
