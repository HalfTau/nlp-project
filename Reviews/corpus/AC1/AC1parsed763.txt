Have only heard others rave about this game and decided to get it during the steam sale.  It plays fine, the cities are a little redundent and the controls can be frustrating, but its an older game so its fine.The issue Ive been having is that it crashes every few hours, and after googling it this seems to be a common problem on newer PCs with win 8.  While normally Id be okay with a slightly buggy game, when it crashes the game tends to set me back to the beginning of the memory block.  This is very frustrating because after getting through half of memory block 4, it crashed and sent me back to the first city.  I dont know if I want to finish the game now, only because the crashing tends to wipe my save.So overall, a decent game, but it just doesnt work on my system very well.
