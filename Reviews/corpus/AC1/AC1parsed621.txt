8/10The Game is great.Took me 17 hours to complete.Not enugh gameplay.A great start for the Lore of Assassins Creed.I find it hard to mod.Overall a legendary game but... you can complete it doing the same 3 things over and over again1. beat up some guy for information2. Eavesdrop some guy for information3. Lock pick some guy to get some information
