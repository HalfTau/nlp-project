I really dont understand all the hype around Assassins Creed franchise. These first one seems like prototype with very many flaws. Only thing that I can really approve is graphics which are pretty good in respect to release date. Story is soso, its good idea poorly executed with bad pacing it gets better closer to the end. Sound/music is decent but nothing memorable. The biggest problems are emptiness of the world, lack of content and poor and overly simplistic combat. Also, this is a game about assassins and there is no stealth. And to mention it, controls and camera could use some improvements but they are good enough most of the time. Overall, I am disappointent with first Assassins Creed game.4,5/10
