Assassins Creed could easily have been one of the best games of 2007. It is, without question, impressive on several fronts. But developer Ubisoft Montreal took some missteps along the way and squandered the immense potential of its pseudostealth action title. A repetitive gameplay elements, and poor AI lead to the downfall of one of the more promising games. Assassins Creed could have been one of the greater games of that generation. Instead, it turned into just another action title. To finish this review I will say I recommend it, mostly cause its a good intro for much better and story richer parts where Ezio takes the main role. 3/5
