First installment of a great, great, awesome series. I personally prefer the Ezio II, brotherhood, revalations storyline. This game will get you started with an awesome series. It has great playability as a start out game, but less so after you did the newer ones, since you lose alot of functionality when you dont play yhe games in order.For an older game its pretty cool, If you dont care to much about 100 collect a load of flags, bit boring youll easily get 1520 hours out of it. Afterwards just move on to AC2
