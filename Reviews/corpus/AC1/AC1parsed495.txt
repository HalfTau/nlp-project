Assassins Creed Review11 hrs completion time5/10With a weak and predictable storyline mediocre graphics, repetetive side objectives and repetition of missions it was a bland experience that I struggled to get through. Coupled with the problems in the fighting system such as not being able to block properly as the game chooses when it wants to block plus free run mechanics randomly choosing also where to jump randomly I have jumped straight through buildings into a haystack instead of climbing.With no real variations in cities apart from cultures shifting from Arabic to European the objectives and citizens stayed all the same with only changes to clothing but voice work remained the same.
