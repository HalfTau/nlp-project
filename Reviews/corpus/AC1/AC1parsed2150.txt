A very laggy title of a thirdperson stealth action game.The pacing of Assassins Creed suffers tremendously from high input latency and generally influent animations. Gameplaywise a lot of aspects that seem essential for a good Assassins Creed title havent been implemented, such as air assassinations.Citizens and the environment have an uninteresting and generally unappealing design.Missions lack diversity, as do enemy voicelines that basically play on loop.It can get really anoying really fast.Combat system feels unforgiving and unrewarding.It is very sad that the first title of the glorious Assassins saga presents itself in such a contentpoor and unpollished way as bugs seem to be omnipresent and graphics are badly optimised.Id say dont even bother with this title. Its a bloody mess.If you are interested in picking up the assassins saga Id recommend you watching a playthrough of the first assassins game.
