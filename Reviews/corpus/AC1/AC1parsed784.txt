I came really really late to Assassins Creed. After hearing lots about it, I finally decided to give it a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised. It wasnt anything groundbreaking, due to its age I guess, but it was an enjoyable way to pass the time. The menu system annoyed me a bit though, too many steps to exit the game for example.6/10
