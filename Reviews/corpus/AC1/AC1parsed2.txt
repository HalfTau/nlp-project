I have a great gaming PC, but this is the one game I am unable to play. I am a big fan of Assassins creed and have many of them for the playstation, but after buying this game for the PC and not being able to even play the first scene is very dissapointing. I feel as tho I have wasted my money, because of this I will not be buying any more of these games.
