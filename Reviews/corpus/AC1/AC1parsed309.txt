Assassins Creed I is a great game and I really enjoyed playing it. The first time I picked this gem up was a few years ago and I was blown away. This is the second time Ive beaten the game and I cant wait to play other Assassins Creed games, thats how much I liked it.And dont let my game play time fool you, I played it in offline mode so 1.3 hours is not how much I played it.Tbh, I beat the game pretty quickly, a few hours a day in the past week or so, but it was still awesome.10/10 overall experience D
