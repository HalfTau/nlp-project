Good game hidden under a story that, if you think about it, negates the whole game.Aweful menu system that has you having to negotiate about 8 screens just to exit the game...including the need to exit to the spash screen and then load a game in order to exit. Madness!Game can get repetitive, but is so much fun...so who cares! Make me do the fun thing 100 more times.
