A truly revolutionay game. The locales are vast, exotic, and intriguing. The game does an excellent job of sticking to its goal assassinations, but on the side note it is rediculously fun to run around on rooftops and climb towers, churches, mosques, castles, EVERYTHING. Its almost more fun to climb around than actually assassinate the targets. On the negative side, the missions involving finding information about your target are rather redundant and there is no real reward besides a save point to spending time looking for all those flags. Also the game requires a powerful machine if played on PC due to its hardcore spec requirements. Otherwise, a masterful, enchanting, and mustplay game
