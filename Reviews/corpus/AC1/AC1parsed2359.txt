Freedom is the word. Freedom to go everywhere, to climb buildings, to run over roofs, to ride horses, to fight ...Surprisingly different. Characters animations are awesome.Controls have slow response time so, they can be a mess when surounding by a numerous group of skilled enemies but, 90 of time can be easily suported.Impresive scenarios, always ALIVE, very detailed and with a lot of NPG characters doing something around.Acrobacies in the line of Prince of Persia, variated and awesome movements.Storyboard is interesting but, sometimes you have to suffer an excesive dialog before action takes place.Secondary Missions in cities are a bit repeatitive. Their difficulty increases with your character skills.Faith Jump from Towers is really funny.Well, small flaws but, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, anyway and a bargain for its current price.
