Friend How is the studying to exam going? ?Me Im about to kill the leader of the assassins who are actually a Templar!Anyway, for those of you who are wondering if i failed the exam, no i did not. i saved my progress and hope to continue next year. This game is the first in the Assassins creed series and that shows with weird controls and repetetive gameplay and no proper cutscenes. However, that doesnt mean its bad. No, i actually enjoyed every second of it. the story is very slow at first and you have to play an hour or so to understand why you have gone back in time to play as your great great great x100 great grandfather Altar. who would much rather do a triple backflip on to a house thats 10 miles away and turn into a warewolf every third Thursday at full moon when Jupiter is right behind the suns core and listen to Kanye SouthWests new album than do leap of faith.this was my first time playing a assassins creed game and i absolutely fell in love with this series. the ai have funny dialogs and i can easily spend an hour listening to them. there are so many different people that do different things. it makes this world seem real like this is what people did in those times when your parents were young and did not have phones or PCsBUT!!! if i meet one of those women who wants money one more time, i swear i will..... ohhhh!!! yeah i ing hate them.The story, OMG. one of the main reasons i bought every single assassins creed game there is. the story makes it 10 times more fun to play. i played blackflag for 20 min before i played this game and i didnt know why i went back in time or what they said about templars and assassinsi would recommened this game to anyone whos new to assassins creed games, for those of you who have played the newer ones it might be hard to get used to the controls but i would still recommened it for the story.PS i know this review is a mess. first time trying to do a proper review, give me some mosquito spray please! !
