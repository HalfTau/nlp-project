Well what do I have to say t thi game?Pro nice graphics considering it came out 2007open world big mapsfreedom of doing things how to get from A to B , from the alleway or over the roofsstory outside the game Desmond is really interesting.Many key combinations many fight stylesparkour is so much funNeutralStory  Altair may not be really good, but I like it. Its a good introducton to the world of the assassins.gameplay may be dull or repetetive in the sense of story same citysNegativethose ing side quests D saving people from guards, I mean cmon...All in all one of the best games I ever played, looking forward to play the second one!
