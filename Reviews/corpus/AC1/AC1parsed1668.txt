Well... writing a review now instead of a looooooooong time ago seems needless, but maybe someone out there wants to replay this game, so DONT, NoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo, dont dld it again... save the boredom, save the unnecesary almost uncanny repetition of tasks just on slightly different maps and such, just youtube a walkthrough if you want to see everything, though story was is pretty weak Altair is awesome yeah, we all know but the story is kinda weak compared to Ezios, at any rate dont play it again though rereading it it kinda seems like a selfreminder lolPS do kill every crazy guy and drunkard that pushes you, its lotsa fun, matter of fact, the only fun in the game, oh yeah and the game is algo flawed like hell... reason why yo ucan prlly see Ive spent like 12 minutes on it when I spent quite a lot more.
