Assassins Creed Directors Cut EditionUbisoft MontrealUbisoftActionadventure, stealthYesNoOverall, this is a really great game! If you havent played any of the Assassins Creed games before, this is a great starting point. Youll really appreciate the newer mechanics in the later games. If youve already played some AC games and not this one, this is a great chance to see what you missed! It may not be the best Assassins Creed game ever but its definitely a great start to an amazing franchise.
