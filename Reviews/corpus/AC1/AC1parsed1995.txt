Honestly, not a fan. My biggest complaint is that the gameplay is repetitive, predictable, and just generally boring. Go to area, receive intel by doing generic activities, kill boss. Lather, rinse, repeat. The controls are fine... sometimes. Other times, usually during a chase when it matters the most, they are frustratingly bad. And overall, there are a lot of things that just dont make any sense. For example, every single city guard has no difficulty whatsoever when it comes to climbing walls and jumping from building to building. They can even keep up with you, the trained assassin. I understand why it was necessary, otherwise you would be essentially invincible on rooftops, but it feels out of place, especially when the rest of the game strives for realism and historical accuracy.This isnt to say that the whole franchise is terrible. Ive already started playing the second game, and it is better in basically every single aspect. I personally would recommend skipping this game and going straight on to Assassins Creed II if you are interested in playing the series.
