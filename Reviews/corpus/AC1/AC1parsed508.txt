First few hours it looks fine, but then it start to be extremly repetitive and boring, the controls are worst I have ever experienced. The AI will hit your nerves and mission only test your patience, means not fun at all.I wanted to get through the game just because of the story, but seems it is better to just watch custscenes on youtube.Im sorry to say that but this was very lazy work Ubisoft compare to Far Cry for example. Cannot recommend this game.
