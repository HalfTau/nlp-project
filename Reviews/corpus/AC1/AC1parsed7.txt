The series gets a lot of flack, both for the idiocy of its story, the dullness of its characters, and, with this game, the repetitiveness of the tasks. All of the above is true. The characters are probably the worst thing about it, hideously unlikeable, all spouting pseudoprofundities.Yet the world theyve created is fun to be in, for the most part, and whilst the humans look very iffy, the architecture has aged very well. I could easily rant about the things that made me mad, the beggars, the instadeath water, the pointless collectables, the occasionally iffy controls the honest truth is that I got about 20 hours of genuine pleasure flying around these streets, occasionally doing cool things.When I told people I was playing the first Assassins Creed, they all made a face, but when you can pick this up for 3 or less, its definitely worth both the cash and the time. If you have any interest in the Islamic world, particularly during the Crusades, its a joy to feel free in such a meticulous world.
