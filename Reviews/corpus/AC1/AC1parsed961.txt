So ambitious! Tries to do alot and is a little exhausting at times but its still an immense and beautiful game. The combat is more mechanical than the future games which I found actually enjoyable. You cannot slaughter a million men with ease, you really have to pick your fights and your kills.Set up an even greater game, Assassins Creed II, so check it out if you get the chance.
