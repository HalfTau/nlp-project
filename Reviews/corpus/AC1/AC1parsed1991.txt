Having finally played this, I have a love/minor hate relationship with this game. This is a good game, but it becomes borderline monotonous and repetetive.I loved the story and the settings the game takes place in, being able to ride horseback, the stealthy parts of the game. Practically everything. What I hated was, no ability to save your game it autosaves and you cant skip cutscenes so if you exit and start back to a point you already where...you have to wait, it becomes a real pain in theat times. The storyline missions become very repetetive and are basically almost the same until you get to the intended target. Go into city, find person, kill person, etc... It gets very tedious if you try and finish the game in one go. Thankfully you get fast travel which cut down on the repetetive nature slightly. I got so bored at one point, I started pretending I was Batman and killing guards cause they kept bragging about their parents. The timed missions were annoying some more than others, but I think you can ignore them for other quests to progress if you arent 100ing the game and one I felt was poorly designed the timed one where you break the stalls which puts guards on you in seconds which takes precious seconds away, the time is too short, people scatter and you cant exactly grab people and bring them there without automatically throwing them. They couldnt add an exit button to the main screen, so you gotta go back into your profile and exit. My favorite, the main character has Aquagenic urticaria. You touch water and bam dead which was fun when he kept missing simple friggen jumps.The repetetiveness and the lack of a proper save option were my two main gripes but the rest of the game makes up for it. If anything dont expect to binge play this to the end. I kept playing in blocks, If I played straight through, Id have been extremely bored. As always, your opinion may differ.Edited this Jan 22 2014 to clarify some things better
