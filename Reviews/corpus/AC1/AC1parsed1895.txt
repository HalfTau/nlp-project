Bad points first  The missions are almost identical, turn up, do minimum of three from a mostly boring selection of mini assassination missions, collecting flags, eavesdropping, pickpocketing etc, get the go ahead to assassinate the boss, see your leader for an upgrade, rinse and repeat. Some of the tasks werent worth including, eavesdropping for example is sitting on the nearest bench and pressing a button. The kingdon between cities was a wasted opportunity and may as well be skipped unless youre looking for flags and templars. The assassinations themselves can rarely be carried out in the delicate stealthy way you might imagine, more often than not you end up fighting half a dozen or more to get away to a rooftop. The mental people and beggars get annoying quickly with the same sound clips over and over again so I ended up spending most of the game on the rooftops to avoid them, missing out on a lot of the city and feel at ground level. The Desmond parts could have included more backstory and the two doctors got boring quickly.Good  Looks great, I bought it in a sale last year and for a game so old it looks superb. The free running is well executed and something I never got bored of, nothing like seeing two or three steps ahead when running away from guards across the rooftops.Because it can be had so cheaply in sales, and if you take the fastest route possible completed in a handful of hours I would recommend it as part of the AC saga.
