Story Excellent concept, but very poor dialogue script. The people are neither charismatic nor interesting except the ones you assassinate.Gameplay On the one hand plain horrible mission design, fighting  balancing/AI, annoying and repetitive side quests, but on the other hand great level design and jump and run mechanic! It makes so much fun to race the rooftops of ancient cities! Presentation Pretty impressive for its time I guess. Besides its character design or overall logic flaws like running around in full armor and wearing the brotherhoods emblem is ignored by the game world. ..And in case things get hot, all you have to do is clap your hand to disguise as a monk !, sit on a bench only seconds after being chased !! or jump off a hundrets of meter high building  land in a hey waggon !!!.
