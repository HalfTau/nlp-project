This game is unplayable. I spend most of my playtime looking in the graphical settings for full screen turns out you only play in windowed mode! its fking stupid isnt it? even the default conrols. And i couldnt move. When i pressed W instead of walking it walked for 1 sec than stopped moving. You need a console to play this game. I used to play this on a PS3 mate, even that was better than this. However i bought this on PC because i thought it will be good looking bad at a game i lost. You need to own a fking console! but lets say you got the game running well. The story is beautiful. It shows a story as a man named Desmond Miles a modern day assasin. He is a historical person that made ACs story good. The gameplay is still holding up today! however you need to remap the keyboard and stuff for a good control experience.prosA good story.Gameplay still feels good for a 2007 or something game.ConsBad default controls.No fullscreen mode.Altair is a bland character.I give this a final rating of 5/10. The game used and still is good to this day. However somethings put you off guardI am putting it for yes. Note that the game is ment for different kinds of players.
