Would take mor if id try to find all them flags, but aint noone got time fo that.ProsGreat graphics for that time.Decent voice acting.Good combat.U can be Altair, the most badass assasin ever.ConsGets boring after 10hours.Hellllllla hard to get all them flags, so dont even try, theres no reward iether last time i checkedThats all, i recommend this.Gazpacho
