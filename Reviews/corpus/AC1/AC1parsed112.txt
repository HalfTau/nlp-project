I came back to this game with thoughts of nostalgia and love of the series before it got turned into a series milking the consumers every year. But honestly this game is such a drag. You run around saving millions of civilians, doing the same 45 quests to learn about your targets and then go kill your target. Then rinse and repeat 9 times. The actual assassination missions are fun. But you only spend 1 of your time doing them. And dont get me started on the 500 collectables. Anyone who actually goes for all of them is insane.
