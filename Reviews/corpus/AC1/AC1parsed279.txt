The PC Port of this game is so horrible, magnifiying the mechanical issues that already exist, that any enjoyment there is to be had in the game is lost in the frustration of bad gameplay.A few examplesThere are no quick loading or quick saving options.  In fact, loading the game is a multistep process, and you start back at a save point, requiring you to retravel to your previous location.The game does not have a quit to desktop option.  In fact, while you can exit gameplay, I couldnt find a way to actually exit the game without killing the program through task manager or similar methods.  Worse, the process to exit play is a tedious, multistep ordeal that is unacceptably timeconsuming.The game does not offer any way to switch between full screen and windowed play, and your cursor does not stay within the game.  You can lose the ability to attack or act at critical moments because your cursor has freely moved to another screen, causing the game to receive no mouse input.Movement and camera issues abound, both being extremely clunky.   The exceptionally consoley design of the controls, which has had no real update for PC use, leads to a cumbersome control system.I cannot say much about the content, story or even combat.  The controls and mechanics were so bad I wasnt able to play that far.
