As of this review Ive been playing almost 11 hours and have yet to finish the game.Being a history buff it is interesting to go and explore the Middle East, especially during the the Third Crusade in the 12 century. Im one who enjoys exploring the world and the game rewards that in a way.Ive enjoyed the game so far but with a few minor complaints.The Good The gameplay is good and fairly solid. The setting is interesting to me. The story is interesting, if not a bit contrived.The Bad The game can and does become repetitive. Especially late game. The world is too small. Well, for an explorer like me anyway.All in all its a good game and I would recommend it.
