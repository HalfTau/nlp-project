This game is extremely repetitive and boring. I tried to play this game all the way through and I ended up quitting at the ending because it was too hard with the garbage combat in this game. The guards start chasing you if you walk by them and it takes 5 minutes to ditch them because when you try to turn somewhere or jump there is a stupid wall that the game makes you run into, a beggar, or a special needs guy that punches you. I do not reccomend playing this unless you really want to. AC2 is 10x more amazing.
