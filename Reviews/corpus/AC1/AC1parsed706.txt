Great game, wish it had captions but the rest of the AC games do so it doesnt matter, its just one game. Definitely start with this game before playing the other games. Its really hard to go back and play this game when youve started on any of the others. Its an older game, and the AC series has improved A LOT since this game. You simply cant compare it to the other games, because it is the first one. Dont skip out on Altairs story. I love the character and the story. Just because its an early game, theres not much to the open world. Theres the basic storyline and thats it. Compare it to AC II, that has a massive open world and side quests. The first AC has no side quests really. That being said, I still dont think people should skip this game. Its a good start to an awesome series.
