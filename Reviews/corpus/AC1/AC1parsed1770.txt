I wouldve never guessed this was the game that spawned a bigbudget annual series. Its just so boring. Even simple things like loading up the game are needlessly long and dull. Start game, pick load save, get sent to some lab in the present day, pick load game, and then youre finally in the portion of the game you want to play. What the hell. Its the same process for quitting the game, so youre better just manually shutting it down to save yourself the time.From the 90120 minutes I played, there was very little action and what there was was poorly executed, and Ive read its just more the same as the game continues. There was also a lot of boring cutscenes for the short amount I played the game. Didnt care for how it handled with either mouse/keyboard or with a controller. Action events like fighting, sneaking, moving around were blah as well.I disliked this game so much that it soured me on bothering with the series as a whole despite already having a free copy of Black Flag, which is supposedly a good game. I just cant get over how poor this was in everything outside the graphics department.
