What can I really say? This is the one that started it all. The revolutionary world navigation, social interaction, realism and history its all here.If this is your first AC game, you are in for an absolute delight. The gameplay is engaging and refreshing and everything just works.If this is not your first though I hesitate to ask why you arent playing them in order the controls and mechanics will take some time to get used to, but its still interesting to see how far the series has really come.Either way, its enjoyable and fun and a good way to waste a couple of hours.Highly recommended, 8/10.
