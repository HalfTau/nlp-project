I havent had this much fun causing mischief since Thief 2.Assassins Creed is, at its heart, a series of minigames. 1 Scale towers to get a look around 2 eavesdrop 3 fight city guards who are harrassing citizens 4 interrogate knowitalls 5 pick pockets and above all, 6 run like heck from city guards until you can ditch them in a cart full of hay, a rooftop gazebo, or blend in on a bench. But there is variety in these challenges, and all of this is stitched together with the most beautiful sandbox cities since GTA IV. You set your own pace in this gorgeous game.My complaints are few no indoor environments in cities, too much lategame swordplay, and dreadfully long mandatory cutscenes.Lastly, AC offers fluid swordplay, and a parkourlike experience scrambling over rooftops. Its just fun to play, and the right length.  Thumbs up.
