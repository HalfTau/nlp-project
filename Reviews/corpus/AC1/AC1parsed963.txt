Its really important that you get ALL the flags and kill ALL the templars in this or you wont get the extra cutscene or bonus weapon at the end. The four hours I spent getting everything was totally not a waste of time at all. Totally not a waste of time. Did I say that twice? I must be tired from all that extremely necessary time I spent getting the very important flags and templars and watching that awesome bonus cutscene.Overall 7.314159265/10  maybe not The work...of a mastarrrr as that guy in the combat arena loved saying many times, but was still a fun experience. Play for the story. AC2 is definitely better.Pros interesting and engaging story with a twist, still looks great for such an old game, some interesting voice actingCons repetitive sidemissions in gathering information about your targets, combat is a bit clunky and lacks depth. A master assassin also does not know how to swim and instantly drowns upon touching water.
