To be honest. The game is Controls suck balls You die if you swim Altair is an arab but speaks with an american accent The game is ridiculously repetetive Missions are boring OH GOD THE PICKPOCKET MISSIONS! KILL ME NOW The real world character is boring as  Climbing is slow Has an absurd amount of bugsBUT WAIT!!! Theres alot of good points too! The game is BEAUTIFUL, the game world is simply stunning and its graphics are top notch. The storyline is very intriguing and if you can see past all the  mechanics, its a good story. The multiple nonlinear story is good! The outside world storyline is also really good! not the desmond guy, hes boring asAND THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF ALL! It really gets you ready to play assassins creed II, the best in the series. It lets you torture yourself so you can appreciate how great the sequel is. And that, honestly, is why Its worth buying.
