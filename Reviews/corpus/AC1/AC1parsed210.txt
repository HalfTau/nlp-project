The graphics are bad but totally understandable since this is the year 2007 game. All you have to do is to kill a target and go back to Al Mualim over and over again and side missions dont bring much variation to the game as theyre being completed quickly. The scenery looks same everywhere and musics are monotonous. The only reason I recommend this game is that its the first game of Assassins Creed series and is important for the story of Desmond Miles.
