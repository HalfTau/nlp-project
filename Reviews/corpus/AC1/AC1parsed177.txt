Assassins Creed was a gamechanger back when it came out. The unique story, the fluidity of motion, the combat, all interwoven into one piece. The game still holds up today and was very fun. The graphics are surprisingly good for a game thats a decade old. I havnt tried using a keyboard and mouse with the game and never intend to, this is a game to play with a controller. Overall good game.
