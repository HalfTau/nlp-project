Basically, its a cool game.However two things are very annoying. 1 You need to climb a tower every 2 minutes to unlock quests, so to speak. Super annoying. 2 When you want to exit the game, you exit the ingame game, and then youre back in the game thats inside the game. Then exit that and you have to loud your profile and then exit out of that to finally exit the game.Other than that, good oldschool game.
