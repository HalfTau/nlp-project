This game was great at first, but then the side quests start to get monotonous. I recommend not doing all of the side quests, since they dont really offer any sort of accomplishment in the game. The story is slow, but interesting, and the graphics are decent. The controls can be aggrevating in certain situations. The gameplay is much better with a controller.Rating 7.5/10
