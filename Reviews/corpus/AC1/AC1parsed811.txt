Tried for several hours over many attempts to get into this game. The gameplay is just tedious and the story isnt rewarding yet. No reason for me to keep slugging through it. The concept of recreating historical ancient cities is amazing. Just poorly implimented here. Ive heard future games in the series make incrimental improvements, but i was never able to get excited about this franchise because this game was a bummer.
