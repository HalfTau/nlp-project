Great game. I really like the story, the graphics, the engine, everything is top notch. I would suppose the only problem would be that some of the game functions tend to get repetetive or extremely unrealistic. Like seriously, a hay stack under every tower?!I personally thought that the combat is really great, but there are no air assassinations...A great feature of this game is that it has so many collectibles and whatnot. A downside is that unlike the rest of its series, it does not have Uplay, so I cannot save my savefile into a cloud.
