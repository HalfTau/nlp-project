I must say very impressive. This game was a lot of fun. I judged it too quickly , I had it for a while, and decided after watching a playthrough of a few levels on youtube I decided maybe I was too hasty. I redownloaded the game and really had a great time. The game can be used with a keyboard... but you will either A. Kill your keyboard or B. Kill your hand. Whichever comes first.I was never good with gamepads but after my hand began to hurt with frustation, I pulled out my pad and really REALLY benefited from it. The Game makes it easy too, since the circles in the upper right mirror the layout of your controller, and change accordingly it allowed me to easily adapt and in doing so become a much better assassin haha. Anyhow highly recommend this game.
