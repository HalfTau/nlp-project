Well iv already played this before through the PS3 but i decided to do a full re run of the games, i enjoyed this gameplay aswell as the story line it makes you eager to find out what happens next to the assassins and desmond id reccomend this to anyone who likes a good story plot, assassins, and some stelth. Sometimes you have to figure out what to do next on some missions. espcially where to climb ect. iv noticed that on both the PS3 and PC the controlls are smooth but unlike the PS3 version none of the cut scenes lag out with horrible sync voice acting which is great.
