As this franchise enters 10 years of being beloved by many its easy to overlook where everything started with this installment back in 2007.  Are its controls clunky?  Yes.  Does it feel dated?  Yes.  But its still Assassins Creed, the game that started it all and this entry is absolutly a must play in the grand scheme of the franchise.  Its also the only true stealth game of the franchise in my opinion as combat can legitmately punish you in later portions of the game because at the end of the day youre playing an assassin, not a soldier that the likes of Ezio might make you think the protagonist is I still love AC2 just pointing out the difference.10/10 would leap to my death accidentally from that chruch in Acre again.
