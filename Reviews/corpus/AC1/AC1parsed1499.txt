Monotone, boring, downright awful piece of a game, thats how I would describe the first Assassins Creed entry. The missions are so unbelievably tedious it almost hurts. Fetch some flags here kill couple of random guards who spawn out of yourthere, climb a tower to unlock the map now rinse and repeat 50 more times. That pretty much sums up what the game is all about. The story is almost non existent, youre just on your way killing 9 random dudes because they are bad doing bad stuff there is absolutly no motivation whatsoever. The parkour part is partly broken. For some reason Altair keeps jumping in every direction except the one I want him to, he also gets constantly stuck looking at the damn edge of a building which is 10 cm above his head instead of climbing it up. Come on man, youre a goddamn assassin, thats ridiculous! At the end I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone, just start with the second entry which is by miles better and offers tons more of content than this piece of garbage.
