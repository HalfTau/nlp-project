Slightly hampered by a fussy camera and some rough edges around the graphics, this is still a great game. Towns and cities feel alive, the combat and freerunning is relatively fluid and mostly good fun, and Altair makes a decent character to play as.Its still worth playing as the story is welldeveloped and keeps you going, and the gameplay is rewarding when it all works. The second game may still be the best, but this is by no means a poor second place.
