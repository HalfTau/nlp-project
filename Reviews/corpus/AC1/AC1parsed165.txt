5/10  My OpinionThe start of the Assassins Creed series, not the best game but holds up pretty well for its era. Personally, I loved the game, however, from time to time the game would get repetitive with the same quest but with a different context and background One of the only reasons why I carried on playing the game was my interest in the story and for the easter eggs towards the end of the game.On the lighter side, Assassins Creed did a great job with starting a building block for the AC franchise with the Apple of Eden and the Animus what you will soon learn to know about if you play the game. In this game, you will go into the past and fight of your targets with Swords, Blades, Knives and Fists in 3rd person via altairDesmonds ancestor and you will come to learn about the Assassins Creed.
