The amount of research and effort put into this game is stunning. Each city is constructed as it used to be in the 12th century, all 9 assassination targets where actuall people who either died or disappeared in that time.The game itself is very atmospheric with an interesting and deeper than expected storyline. Controlls may take you a while to get used to but feel natural after that. The main plus of the game is the free roaming and climbing, the transitions while climbing feel natural and flawless.
