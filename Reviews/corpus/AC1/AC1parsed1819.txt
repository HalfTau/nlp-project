Assassins Creed is possibly one of the greatest games released in 2007. Its a sandbox nature game with remarkable visuals, sound effects and story, which is based on historical events and people. There are two overlaping stories in this game Desmond Miles and Altar IbnLaAhad, through machine called Animus. Within the Animus, Altars memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sabl from taking an artifact from a Solomons temple, but broke all three of the assassin brotherhoods tenets in the process. The brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Altar to the rank of novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status. As Altar assassinate them one by one he realises something is wrong about this assignment and that these people somehow are connected. Overall pretty good story,The gameplay consist out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim. To achieve this goal, you must travel from the Brotherhoods headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional recon missions before attempting the assassination. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.Overall its pretty good game, worth your attention but it does have downsides. The bad Its repetitive and does not provide much graphic options for high end pc, combat is clunky and sometimes feels awkward. The Good Fun parkour mechanics, great story, huge sandbox world that feels alive, great soundtrack, many little details. 7/10
