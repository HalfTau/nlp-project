Story SpoilersIm going to rate this game from a 2017 and beyond POV instead of one of someone wanting it back in 2008.Assassins Creed is an awesome series and I love it a lot! The first game I ever played in the series was Brotherhood and Ive been playing every game since. So I decided to go back in time and play the one that started it all. With that Assassins Creed is a great start to the series but has several flaws, game mechanic wise, story wise, and graphical. The story is very repetitive and seems to be only interesting at the beginning and ending even with an abrupt ending as well. However the game sets itself up completely for a sequel which is nice I guess but most importantly has very wonky and odd controls and several game mechanics are mind numbing and leaving you asking Why is that even in the game? ?Great beginning to the seriesAltair looks badassAssassins look coolAssassins have their own little castle separated from societyI love stalking and assassinating people in this gameCombat is OKDecent scenery moments that do look coolSeveral different targets that differ in many waysGame is set up for a sequelI love how clueless andoff Desmond isEagle vision is a cool abilityBeing able to climb up onto roof and buildings, etc. is so coolI like that you gain a new ability/rank after every assassinationHidden messages/computers at the end of the game are sweet!I like that you can train after getting each new piece of equipmentNo UplayStory is super repetitive, it basically goes like this prologue/introduction, assassinate 9 different targets the exact same way, endingThe way the game delivers the buttons are odd, I dont like that I have to press 2 buttons just to run or press 2 to enable countering and other optionsGraphics are pooSeveral glitching models and NPCsFelt that the lepers, drunks, and ill that just push you when you get close to them are super annoying and actually caused me to fail several questsNo side quests or anything just main storyline and collectiblesSaving citizens wasnt really worth it what so ever so I didnt like the overpopulated amount of events regarding themSeveral characters with beards for some reason have floating pieces of hair around their beardWish you could assassinate from a rooftop and or jumpI dont know why its even an option for Altair to just jump off of whatever hes climbing. I felt like this was a purposeful act the the devs made as its recurring in several AC games to where youre climbing a building and you press the jump to climb faster but instead you jump off completely.Sync points gave nothing to the map besides investigation areasI dont get why you can have the option of finding more evidence on your target when you only need 3 to continue and then assassinate him but you can appear to get more around 10 or so, yet it yields to be utterly useless to get more than 3 and doesnt help it allEvery assassination is the same, find 2 or 3 pieces of evidence, report back to the bureau, head into a restricted area, watch the target kill or talk to someone, then hunt them down and kill them, escape to the bureau, and finally report back to Al Mualim only to repeat that 9 times...Several stupid ledges or balconies that stick out making you unable to climb to the top of certain buildingsI liked the fact that Altair can blend in with the clerics but he looks so different compared to them and can easily be sought out, I mean what other cleric out of the bunch has several knives and swords on his body? I found this especially stupid during the assassination where the target was killing a cleric while you stood there and watched only inches away and yet he didnt notice you?I dont see why you arent killed on sight by all TemplarsEven the time spent in the present were repetitive as well, just wake out of the animus, go to sleep, and wake up just to go back in with little of importance of dialogueFelt that it was lame that the Assassins came for you in the present only for nothing to occur but the Templars basicly winning in the end of the gameDesmond just looking at the blood at the wall and cut to credits was such a bad endingI dont get how only Desmond can see the blood on the wall through eagle vision... like how do you hide the massive blood on the walls?I didnt like how Robert and Al Mualim had different fighting patterns than any other enemy that the game did not prepare you for and basicly you had to assassinate them with your hidden blade when they were on the ground, which yet again the game does not tell youAltairs personality seemed very robotic and pretty much had no opinion in any matter just was a living and breathing Assassin and thats all he cared about which is surprising when Assassins like Connor who is torn apart for being boring and monotone yet he actually had a personality and actual backgroundDidnt like that eagle vision required you to be standing still and also didnt find it useful it all in this gameThrowing knives were pretty useless when you could only use them in combatReally hated how there were basically no cutscenes and every cinematic moment you could walk in and ruin by looking like a fool as well as the glitches to change the perspectives happened to often and would rather the game do itselfAnnoying how you have to stay hidden in hay bales and other hiding spots for a good 5 to 10 seconds to lose your wanted levelMini map sorta uselessNo Steam achievementsFlags were a huge waste of time and served literally no pointCombat system isnt fun so I found the constant fights before Robert and in Masyaf at the end of the game really lameAltair is very less balanced than many of the other Assassins in the other games and I found him falling off more buildings and unable to make certain jumps that would never happen in other gamesI dont understand why before the Robert fight you had to kill like 5 knights before facing Robert?? What does that have anything to do with anything I felt like it was suppose to be a 1v1 duelThe fight against the fake Robert was super annoying with the constant arrow rain that you couldnt avoidWhy do citizens live in solitude with the Assassins? Are the streets of the nearby cities that bad that they need that much kind of protection? I felt it more stupid as I can assume many got slaughtered when the Templars attacked and felt that it only put them in more trouble as they literally live IN FRONT OF the giant Assassins castleAfter you beat the game you are unable to replay through anything and have to start a new save file if you want to play the game againI love the AC series and I felt that this game did have a good location and characters. However getting the story across just was to repetitive and almost made it like a Hitman game as majority of the game had you just killing specific targets. With the fact that the ending is very abrupt and leads to far up for a sequel then to give an actual ending to the story. The time in the present was useless and added very little story and the game mechanics were annoying as a lot of times they would do the opposite or require you to press 2 buttons at once just to do one thing. Several bugs and glitches and overall bad graphics with the super repetitive and bleak storyline. Id say you can definitely skip this AC even though its the first its clearly missing a lot, because of that and even found myself at the beginning of the game struggling to continue as it just seemed so boring.
