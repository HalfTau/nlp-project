The first entry in an annual franchise from Ubisoft and the most unique. Unlike the sequels this game is far from the open world collectathon that the Assassins Creed series has become. The majority of the game is fairly linear and consists entirely of assasssinating specific characters. Completing the assassinations progresses the plot and unlocks new abilities for you, this game is far more similar to something like Hitman than what the modern Assassins Creed games are. Unfortunately there are plenty of faults in this one too. The side activities are almost non existent and by adding fast travel between cities eliminates the majority of the open world exploration in this game. This game is also very guilty of not explaining a lot of the mechanics to the player and providing very poor tutorials. However I still think its a very unique and interesting game despite all of its flaws. One of the things I really enjoy about it is the fact that you can play through the entire game with all of the on screen HUD disabled only relying on ingrame visual and audio queues.Definitely worth the going price now.
