Assassins Creed feels repetitive and unrefined compared to its successors, but this is an unfair criticism considering that the game came out right at the start of the last console generation and did so many things right. The PC version has gorgeous textures and DX11 effects that still hold up today the game actually looks better than Assassins Creed 2, and the MiddleEastern setting is fun to explore.
