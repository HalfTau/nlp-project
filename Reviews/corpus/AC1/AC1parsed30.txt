Assassins Creed I was very good storywise and it gives you proper knowledge which is needed to connect all things together in later AC games what concerns the story Ubisoft wants to tell you. If you are kind of player as I am, which means that you began playing AC from Brotherhood or simply not with the first part, I strongly recommend you to buy and play this game. If you are the person who does not want the story but pure gameplay experience, you do not need to touch this game./ PROS overall quality at the release date the story idea/ CONS monotony gameplay too much repetition or similarity of missions and actions you take throughout the game movement is not as good as you may expect but we need to consider the fact that it was released in 2008
