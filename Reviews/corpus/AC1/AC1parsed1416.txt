Picked this up on sale and cant say I am disappointed. Graphics not bad for a 5 year old game and worked with my controller. Great story and enjoy exploring the world.conscontrols can be Clunky/touchy at times but the game is forgivingengaging in battle can be fun taking out as many with one shot as possible, but once your in combat with sword it can be a little lacklustercan be a bit repetitive, especially if you do all the side quests.
