Ive heard so much about the assassins creed games over the years that I decided I finally should jump in.  I didnt make it.  I drowned.But seriously,  I think unless you are a big fan of the series you may as well skip to the newer games.  Even though the graphics arent too dated I found the controls to be awkward and the story to be slow and uninteresting.  Games have come a long way in the last 10 years and it shows with this title.
