tldr 7/10Not bad at all. Graphics still hold up ok in 2015. Fighting is fun, but there isnt much of a reason to not just counter all the time. Movement is pretty good. Disappointed in the stealth. I thought this would be like a medieval silent assassin, but its more like a medieval shooter.The voice acting and writing are pretty bad. Most of the story is just you doing the same thing 9 times in different scenarios.
