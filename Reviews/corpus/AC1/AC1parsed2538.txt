Forwarning It gets betters once you figure out how the AC Engine works. Very beautiful game when its not acting up, but with all the gripes I have with it, the story is very interesting and the assassination missions are so satisfiying to acomplish. Walking away like a boss after a high profile target kill makes it worth the annoyances.
