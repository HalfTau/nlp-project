This game is fun for the first few hours, but...later it gets boring and more boring and more repetitive.if you play from Steam then sooner or later the game will crashplaying through the game for 100 is a tough and difficult thing since the game is glitchy as hellno subtitlesimpossible to skip the cutscenesvery annoying NPCs beg for money, and they attack you for no reason, and you cant give money.A disappointing 5/10 I guess.
