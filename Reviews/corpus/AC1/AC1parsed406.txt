I actually love the story behind Assassins Creed series. It is historically deep, sometimes accurate and mostly cryptic. It is based on the templars, the new world order etc. I love conspiracy theories.VERY repetitive. Combat, quests... There is almost no variety. It all feels like a repeating sequence.No subtitles.I was expecting more stealth gameplay. But instead, game wants you to hackandslash an army all by yourself. Combat is very easy and it doesnt fit to an assassin.There is no proper progression system in this game. It felt very unrewarding.Bad camera and clunky controls.NPCs repeating same dialogs over and over, which becomes very annoying after some time.Game crashed few times and i experienced fps drops in certain places.Traveling long distances between towns were very boring, unnecessary and frustrating for me.I wanted to start the series from the beginning and understand the story better. But it didnt worth the time i spent. In my honest opinion, you can just learn the story of AC1 from wiki and start the series from ACII.
