Assassins Creed, the first in the many games within the Creed series which turned out to be one of the most repetitive games I have ever played. Well, that is probably untrue. This game does not have much story to it as it involves the player to go to somewhere, murder someone, return then your master sends you onto another brutal rampage. Although it is a somewhat decent game, it can be extremely repetitive and not great for people who came for the storyline.
