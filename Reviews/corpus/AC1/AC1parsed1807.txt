Want a game that has cool sword fighting and amazing stealth then look no further. Assassins Creed 1 was and still is an amazing game to play. Basically the entire game is done in your mind by unlocking memories from your DNA. Now after a certain point the game is the same where all it is is making sure you hit the button at the right time to counter and such. But still a must play game.
