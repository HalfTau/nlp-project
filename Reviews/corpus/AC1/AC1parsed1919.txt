I had played this game a few years back, but now decided to give it another shot. It can certainly still compete with todays games, especially from a graphics standpoint, which is, in itself, quite remarkable.If you have never played this game, I would call it a merger between Splinter Cell, Batman and Hitman. You have to blend into your environment and hide at times, you have to navigate rooftops, you can be a vigilante, and you have your mission to complete and have a certain freedom on how to do so. While this game is certainly not as refined as its successors in the series, it was, much like the first Splinter Cell, the first Batman Arkham series, and the first Hitman, a diamond in the rough, with exceptional gameplay, graphics and design. At least for their respective times. While the subsequent titles had a lot of refinement and improvement, this first Assassins Creed still stands its ground in the sands of time. Add to that the soundtrack, and you have great entertainment.The only downside  to me  is the obvious console breeding ground, and the somewhat shady save point situation, but I guess thats the way it is. Im getting used to the whole checkpoint idea these days, albeit with a heavy heart. I do miss my quick save option.Either way, give this game a try, especially if you can snap it up in a deal! You wont regret it if you like the other games mentioned above. Also, its not as repetitive as people say while the handling is, true, the way you approach diverse challenges isnt.
