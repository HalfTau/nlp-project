It is the first game of the awesome series. The game itself has more flaws than pros, need to remember that it is over 10 years old, so we cant expect so much. But it has awesome story and character, I think third crusade is the best setting for the first game you know the templar stuff in rela life etc. and the Holy land is perfect place to roam around. I think it should have more sidecontent because it gets little bit boring, especially cause the main missions are little bit repetitive. If you have read the book from Oliver Bowden named The Secret Crusade it tells more about the game and open a new window about Altar, I think hes the best character in the whole franchise, The Legendary Assassin.
