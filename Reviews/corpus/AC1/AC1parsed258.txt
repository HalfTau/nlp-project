The game which started the great AC series. But because it was the first game it didnt have the things that makes you feel that this game is great, its just a decent AC game. I say that because it laks from things that other AC games have and also every mission in this game is the same, which makes it boring after a few memory blocks. Still its a decent game that started it all. You should play it if you want to know the entire story of the series.
