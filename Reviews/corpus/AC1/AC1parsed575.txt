This game runs pretty well, its noticeably dated to me with things popping in and such but Im sure we can all make allowances for that with the age of the game.If you, like me really want to be playing with keyboard and mouse, and not resorting to a controller, I urge to you take caution over the titles after this one as the camera will drive you mad. They all seem to share some sort of mouse acceleration issue that will make moving the camera with the mouse unplesant and annoying at best.This one does not share those issues, has a fantastic story and the only flaw is the gameplay can be a bit repetitive  certainly a classic regardless of this though!
