The game is one of the musthave classics obviously. With so far over 10 hours playing, no big flaws were detected but Only one thing. I sometimes land on a Rocklike piece of hay and die when haydiving from the towersightseeings. Then I have to climb all the way down... And special thanks to the autosaves that I dont have to climb up again.
