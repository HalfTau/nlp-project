Assassins Creed is a good game. If you enjoy sneaking/assassinating and story based games then this one is probably for you. Story was interesting and the end made me want to know more  which means second game, here I come. I did get kind of bored time to time when I was searching for glues  to progress in the game. It has pretty nice parkouring possibilities tho and great combat system. There are plenty ways to attack an enemy which made the fighting enjoyable for me. I really liked those finishing moves.Only thing I didnt really understand and like was why collect all the flags that are placed all over the game and those saving people. Seemed really pointless and waste of time. It didnt seem to affact the game at all so I just skiped that part.xTzharkz Eric.
