I havent played such a repetitive game in a long time. After a while it gets really boring. I would normally skip this game and go straight to sequel, but then I would miss storyline, which is basically the only drive why even play this game. Im still surprised how I managed to finish this game. Also about gameplay, I really hate that I didnt feel like assassin at all. Stealth is unnecessary, since you can fight off unlimited amount of soldiers and its way quicker.
