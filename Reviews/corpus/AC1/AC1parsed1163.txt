First I want to start off with no Uplay!The first Assassins Creed game is personally one of my more favorite of the AC titles next to 2, but this game isnt the second and im not going to compare them, im just going to say my honest opinion on this version.To start i really like the whole concept of this taking place in the middle ages, the idea of fighting knights in armour with awesome kill cinematics back in the day for me was sweet! Sprinting over roof tops tossing throwing knives at anyone standing in my way was very entertaining. Personally I really like the whole AC story line even though it confuses theout of me at times.On the downside i found the controls when trying to traverse over water areas to be a little touchy and spent a solid half hour drowning, as you progress further into the game the guards are more and more likely to attack you for no reason which albiet is understandable at that point but the running mechanics well they tend to fail you, considering you got like 10 some odd guards chasing you, but even so thats not too bad heyre easy to kill.Lastly the thing i hated the most and always will is those ing beggars! holyi killed soooo many of them i dont care theyre anoying asand constantly block you at the worst times.  i know your homeless but I dont want this sword going up myTo surmize this is a really good game and personally if your going to play the series i recommend this one first just for the story if not anything else.9.1/10 would stab beggars again.
