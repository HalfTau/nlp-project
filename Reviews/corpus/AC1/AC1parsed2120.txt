This game is so boring, it brings tears to my eyes, two hours in and nothing is happening and you cant do anything. Games should be games, not movies which require me to push buttons to unpause it. Also the subplot about the adventure being a genetic memory is boring and stupid. Want a game about sneaking and killing, this is not the game for you.
