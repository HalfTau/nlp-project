I believe that this game is one of the timeless classics. Its the beginning of one of the most popular game series of all time, and it shows why this game spawned such a cash cow. Its still very playable to this day, and although it doesnt have near as much content compared to modern games, it still really is just a good game despite that. I probably wouldnt pay full price for it, but I would definitely grab it at a reduced price.
