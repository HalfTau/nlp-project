This game tho.......This game defines what it is to fck up an AC game! Its the first one, but still! Have played pretty much every AC game there is, then I bought this on sale just to try it out, and man I regret using my poor money on this shtload of fck! The game is so repetitive, and the enemies can sometimes be so hard to kill, that you are probably better off trying to eat your own sht, then sht that sht out of your ss, only to suck the sht up your ss again and puke the sht on to your monitor probably how they made this game. I promiz man, if you only like the plot, then I guess this is an OK game for you if you like to farm for 7 hours. The only reason I managed to beat this game was by using Cheat Engine Promotion. I gave myself infinite health so that I never died. Still took ing forever to kill the fckers in the game. All in all this game is Big Rigs quality, the gameplay is sht! The story is sht!Spoilers Dont trust people that looks like they work for the fcking Al Quaida, obviously the old fcker betrays your ss and you have to kill him. I knew that sht all along as I played the game! Its more obvious than 11 after going to school for 11 years!Also I KNOW that this review will get lots of hate. Therefore my message to you Go fck yourself, eat sht, and jump in the river like Altair, just without respawning!
