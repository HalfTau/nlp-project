This is the first one of the AC series, its a milestone though it has many drawbacks. Main flaw is that the storyline is too boring, you need to kill 8 people, namely 8 missions. However, each mission is almost the same, u need to pickpocket, you need to interrogation, bla bla. But this is forgivable given that this is the first one and launched long time ago. I bought this coz this is a starter of a new era.
