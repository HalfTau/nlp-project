Firstly, I want to make this clear Assassins Creed 2,3 and over, are all great games! but Assassins Creed 1 is a big ball of mess, its repetitive and the missions are boring and tedious and 99 of them are damn near impossible due to the inconsistency of the A.I. of the guards and man, they DONT let up they are more persistent than Jared fogle wanting a small child on average youll spend over 80 minutes shaking them off and a good 90 of the time in the game trying to get away from them, dont let the no Uplay account required fool you its the only Assassins Creed game on Steam that doesnt have it and man, I will be blunt this game sucks I thought this would be a good game and I could forgive its faults but 99 of the problems in this game come from the guards and the other 10 come from the repetitiveness
