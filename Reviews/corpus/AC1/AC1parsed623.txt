This assassins creed is the classic. It might not be the best. Graphics look pretty much outdated, controls are a bit clunky as they got redesigned in the newer games. Story wise is fairly short and not very eventful. It almost feels like a prequel of the Desmonds story first 5 AC games till ACIII.Though, it has that unique feel how this title really should be. You play as a real asssassin not a pirate, not a thief, not a mobster. Youre just pure ancient assassin in this game. Obey the sacred creed its Hashashin assassins vs Crusader templars in 1191, recieve order from your master, ride a horse the another city your targets located no fast travel at all, go to assassin hidout and get more information/plan, eliminate the target, escape and go back to the headquater the inform the result.
