This game was like a dream come true for me. A lot of people complain about it being repetitive, shallow, boring, etc. and I can understand how they can say that. However I really enjoyed the freedom of movement and beautiful scenery. Its like youre a Middle Ages Batman! With time travel! I wouldve picked up the sequel on launch day if it wasnt for the overbearing DRM.
