frankly, the first title does not live upto the sequel which is very rare in any media franchise.Ubisoft wasted their great resources yet again.The concept is unique and very impressive in many aspects, but the execution is poorly done.Though, Im glad they actually revived it in the sequel, but I wanted to warn others if they thought the first title has a value of the sequel.In a short term, the experience is very repetitive and the traveling is very time consuming.Battle mechanic is difficult to handle, and the objectives are pretty much the same from other maps.Not much of variation in design.Unskippable cut scenes are one of the agony to endure.In other locations, they set up the same camera perspectives while listening to yadiyadiyada.Story itself begins with great impression and ends with disappointment.I really wish the title should have kept in the past time line not the present.
