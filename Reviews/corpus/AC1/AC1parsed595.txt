Being an assassin sounded cool, but in practice I thought this game was drab and dull. Almost nothing about the story made any sense at all, and was an incoherent mess. You can only climb to the top of a building and jump off into a pile of hay so many times before you begin to lose interest. For me, that took about 8.7 hours.
