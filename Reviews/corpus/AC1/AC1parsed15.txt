First and easily the worst Assassins Creed game. As much as Ive played the franchise, up until probably 4 or Origins havent played Unity or Syndicate yet the series has been built on a series of  design decisions. The only probable reason Id say buy this game is because of the story, if you wanna catch up on it. The reason for my short playtime is because I couldnt stomach any more mediocrity. Its just boring. Like really boring. Unskippable cutscenes, glorified qte combat, and a dull story makes this game the pinnacle of boredom. This game was made is 2007 and should stay in 2007 2008 for PC, or better yet all of us should just count the second game as the first and say this was a failed abortion. Also on a side note, as this wasnt the first AC game Ive played, why does every Assassin ride Altairs Like I get he was a major turning point for the organization and had some nice gear but he was so weak and boring and lame and emotionless and god I hate this game.
