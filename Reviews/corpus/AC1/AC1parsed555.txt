BEWARE PEOPLE! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I bought AC 1, 2 and Brotherhood during the Winter sales in 2016. I loved AC so much back in the day. This port is horrible, not the game. My xbox 360 controller did not end up working at first and I had to tweak around to get it to work, the tutorial kept freezing constantly and I could not get anywhere and it is so damn glitchy. Its honestly a glitch fest! I am refunding it!Altair was spinning in circles like a glitchy ball during the tutorial and I do not want to risk anything. Its 6.79 on sale but this should be 23 since its been out for almost 10 years! I rather save my money and get something optimized!
