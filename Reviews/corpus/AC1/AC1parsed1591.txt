Assassins Creed is the first entry of the franchise and an unforgettable one.  Set during the third crusade, you play as Altair, an arrogant master assassin whose pride almost ruins his order.  He gets another chance to redeem himself and thats where you come in.  Here are the pros and consPositives Interesting Sandbox assassin game. Excellent setting during the third crusade. Inventive gameplay and different approaches to take down the targets. Lively cities. Badprotagonist.Negatives Extremely repetitive process go to bureau, climb buildings to get sight of event points, solve events, get information, go to bureau, take down the target, run away, go back to the Mualim. Desmonds story line is completely boring. That ending...Verdict A
