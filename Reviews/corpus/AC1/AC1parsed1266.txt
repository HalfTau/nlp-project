Its good, really, but...Its fun to start off with, but it gets unbelievably repetitive way before the end. The mission types repeat and repeat and repeat, and one eavesdropping doesnt even involve gameplay. Climbing viewpoints gets tedious most quickly, and there are by my count 91 of them in the game. Some arent that high, but some are these ridiculous towers it takes probably well over a minute to climb, sync and dive from.The free running feels good, except when you randomly stop climbing or you randomly fail to jump to or grab something or it just doesnt respond properly in the heat of the moment.The combat is alright, but it doesnt really make sense that when youre surrounded by enemies, only one attacks you at any given time.The graphics are still decent, but even with the highest settings theres heavy LODpopping going on as you roam around, especially in the kingdom, the area in between the key cities. And the shadow resolution drops, jarringly, for anything further than a few metres from you. People even popped into existence before my eyes once or twice. You do get to ride a horse through the kingdom though, which is strangely satisfying.The story is alright but the most interesting part is the present day stuff, which really doesnt tell a proper story, more like the first couple of chapters.Oh and you know whats the most annoying? The drunks, beggars and deranged who annoy the absolute shitzu out of you any time youre on street level.So... I strongly suggest watching the cutscenes on YouTube and skipping right to the second game, unless youre the neurotic type who feels compelled to play through all of them like me. But if thats the case, play in short bursts and definitely dont waste your time trying to collect the hundreds of flags scattered through the game. Theres no fun to be had doing that, and not even any pointless achievements.Also, the game has no subtitles whatsoever.
