Gave it a chance, but it just didnt work out. The story seems interesting, but the controls are just painful! I wouldnt be surprised if this was ported from console.Pros Story seems interesting Good graphics for its timeCons Absolutely horrible controls Walking simulator 2.0, it takes half of real life to go to the next town Clunky camera, probably console port legacy Map is garbage
