This game might be a fairly good game in terms of gameplay and design but in terms of control/fluidy of controls and the inability to alttab, it makes the experience sour along with the fact the controls are very clunky and this ruins the users experience. I do not feel like finishing this game using a keyboardmouse. I may change my mind if I use a PS3 controller but using traditional computers peripherals, it just doesnt work.
