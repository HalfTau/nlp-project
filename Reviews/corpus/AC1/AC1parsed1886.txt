The original Assassins Creed has set new boundaries for the adventure genre. The parkour and the overall gameplay are simply impressive for a 2008 game.Ive only played this game in 2014 because I wanted to get into the AC series and figured AC1 was the first step I should take. Although it is EXTREMELY repetitive, its a game Im willing to finish 100 if I ever have the time. If not, Ill just complete the Story.Its worth adding that, although I have not reached the games ending, Ive already found a plethora of collectibles. Be it small flags or side missions, this game has a lot of that kind of extras.All in all, AC1, despite lacking in variety, has redefined the adventure/action genre in a way that is yet to be seen in any other game outside of the AC series. Or so I think.
