Beautifully crafted open world set in a time period of the Third Crusade, the first part of one of the most amazing storylines ever seen in videogames.The series ability to appeal to an extremely wide audience due to its fun gameplay elements earned it unprecedented success as well as became its own curse, as many players overlooked the story behind it, forming false impressions about the game.Assassins Creeds storytelling is slowpaced, subtle at times. It doesnt impose the most important parts on the player, it awaits to be explored, discovered, deciphered and understood, rewarding those who try. It provides enough entertainment for everyone else, so no ones left unsatisfied.The games only downsides are its repetitiveness and lack of challenge, but they disappear as things start escalating closer to the end, and as the ending credits start rolling you will find yourself begging for more.Do not miss this wonderful game.
