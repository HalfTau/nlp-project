Good game but the side quest gets really repetative and it get much crowded later on in the game, enough to say OMG GTFOut of my WAY!!!  I got easilyoff at it when I was hunted down by guards and i just sits on the bench till the status is green.  Status turns green, got up,...  Guards LOOK THERE HE IS!!!   FFFFUUUUUUUU  runs and tons of drunk  keeps pushing me and also the beggers are very annoying enough to stab them and walk away without status turning red in front of the guards.  Ive seen better climbing/platforming game than this like Uncharted series on top of my head.   Story line is intresting too.Well... it left me off with a cliffhanger now gonna play AC2.  Hope its not as annoying as the first one.
