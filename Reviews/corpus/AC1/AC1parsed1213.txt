The game that started a very popular and succesful series. What I liked the most was the never seen before freedom of vertical movement. Climbing was probably the most satisfying element of this game. Story was very intriguing, although missions are very repetitive throughout the game. Game is split into several memories. You do a few side quests gathering information about local person of interest and then you proceed to asssassinate him. You repeat this formula until the very end boss battle. What broke the monotomy is returning to reality, to present, and learning more about the templars and Assassins in our time. Ending was very mysterious and opened infinite posibilities for future Assassins Creed games which Ubisoft, as we all know, used very agressively. Not a year passes and we see another AC game. But about those later.All in all, this game was something unique for its time and was a very solid game. It features increadibly lifelike cities and it is one of the best parkour games with very unique setting. Worst thing about it though, was trying to exit the game, which required something like 5 loading screens. But that was finally fixed. Main story gave me about 2024 hours of gameplay, but theres tons of side things to do and explore which can prolong the game to over 30 hours.Gameplay 7/10Story 8/10Sound 8/10Graphics 7/10Polish 8/10Overall 7.5/10 very good game
