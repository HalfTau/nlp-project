This is my favorite of the series I think because of the time it takes place. And its in an area of the world I have always wanted to visit. This game as are the sequels, very detailed and gorgeous graphically. The Story is something that other developers could take a few lessons from in its consistency and scope while maintaining a huge level of open ended game play. Take the time to sit back and become a master swordsman as you travel from city to city. You will become so good that you will never be touched by a sword again regardless of the number of  foes timing is everything. Buy this game at any price but it is a steal when on sale.
