After being 8 hours into my fourth playthrough of Assassins Creed 1, I finally got bored of this game. This game is amazing and is worth multiple play throughs if anyone got the time for it , I played it 4 times over, first time on Xbox360, one with PS3 disc, once I lost that, bought it through PSN and then these screenshots from my PC version. I love this game and this franchise D
