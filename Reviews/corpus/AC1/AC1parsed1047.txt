Assassins Creed 1 was the first Assassins Creed game I played, and I left this game on between the end of 2014 and the start of 2015.. Random fact for the review.The game after 8 or so years, still feels so fresh, simple and clean except for that blood stain from that templar...Alot of games these days dont feel the same.. And thats a shame.11/10 Altair is underrated
