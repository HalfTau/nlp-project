The first in the great series of Blockbuster Assassins Creed games. This first game isnt really great when it comes to Gameplay. You need to assasinate 9 people, but before you can do those missions, you need to interrogate, steal items or rescue someone that has information about your target. What it boils down to, is that you do the same thing 9 times. Combine this with a lacking combat system and you would say this is a piece of sht. But, what makes this game great are two things Atmosphere and Story. Especially the dual story you constantly want to know whats happening on the other side of the Animus, no matter which story youre in. Its powerful, mysterious and I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to start playing Assassins Creed games. Its one of the least enjoyable Assassins Creed games, but it is still interesting and a great starting point for the blockbuster franchise.
