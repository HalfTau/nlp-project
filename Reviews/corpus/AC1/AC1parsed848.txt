The one that started all this Assassin Creed madness. Bad things first side quests get repetitive and boring very soon, there is no variability there and it might actually make you think that s all there is to it? But the overall story is decent, especially missions with killing your 9 targets are always different in interesting new places to look for assassination techniques. Plus the 3 big cities, Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre are nice fresh air to New York in which 90 games are situated. Historical period of crusades is really something that is not seen so often.
