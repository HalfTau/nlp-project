Okay, so after roughly 26 hours I finally finished the game in 100.Pros Fantastic story Very immersive world Good gameplay Lots of extra stuff to do read the cons Pretty fun challengesCons Very repetitive, almost all extra stuff was to either save a citizen, find flags, kill a templar or complete a certain challenge Minor bugs while doing parkour around the city climbing wrong walls, jumping in a wrong direction, which was especially annoying above water Often music and background noise was too loud, which made dialogues hard to understand Madmen constantly pushing you for no reason, which often leads to exposure. There are far too many of them and you cant really do anything about them. If they block your way, they constantly push you and you cant push them back because guards will instantly expose you.Overall, Id recommend this game for everyone starting the journey with Assasins Creed genre as this is the beginning of the story and a golden classic, which led to creation of so many good games afterwards.
