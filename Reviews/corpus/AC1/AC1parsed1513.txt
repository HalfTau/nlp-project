From the Animus to the streets of Jerusalem, Assassins Creed shines with graphics, storytelling and great action.  Climbing buildings has never looked easier than with Assassins Creed.  My only gripe about this game is the repetition, eventually, all the action sequences seem repeated but in different places in the city.  Nonetheless, you owe it to yourself to try this game, just for the sheer fun of jumping from rooftop to rooftop.
