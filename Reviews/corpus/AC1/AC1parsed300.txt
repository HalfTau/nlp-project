Score 8/10As the first game in the series, its content clearly wasnt as developed as in its sequels. I still enjoyed the streamlined story, as they do a great job of building to the climax. Some of the approaches to the target assassinations were also very creative and enjoyable. If you have a decent PC set up, this game can look pretty great for its age.
