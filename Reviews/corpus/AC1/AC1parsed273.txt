The best initiative by Ubisoft after prince of persia franchise.In the beginning back in 2007 when this game was released and played I heard may of my friends praising this game more than any other game. They kept saying to me, dude you should play assassins creed. When I asked why? A strange yet stupid reply stating that its similar to prince of persia and you can make the character climb any building. Whats the big deal That message was stuck in my head until I tried with first time on my PC pirated version  because games costed huge amount after trying it for few missions I Fell In LOVE with this game. I uninstalled the pirated and deleted my gamesaves. Sold my pc and bought a new high end gaming machine costing 1.28 Lakhs 2000 Approx then I purchased first 3 instalments of Assassins Creed except 3 ubisoft gave AC 3 for free on their 30th anniversaryStarted a new game in ultra settings and damn It was worth of my money. The story, the cutscenes, the idea itself was unique. Loved the gameplay and completed in no time. But still there are few thing yet to collect. This game has major musical auro for the ears. For once i really felt that i am living in 11th century. Love everything about this game.
