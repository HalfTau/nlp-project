This remains the only Assassins Creed game that I ever enjoyed, also the only Almost historically correct one too.When the assassin ancestors turns into arrogant italians, and other random nationalities in the new games, instead of the cold blooded silent killer Altar from the Middle east, I simply vomit.The Franchise became so popular, that it ruined the continued series.This Assassins creed though, is not any of that. It remains a pearl in the evolution of games in everyway.
