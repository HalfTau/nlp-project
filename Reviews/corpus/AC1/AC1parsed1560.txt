This is where the universe of Assassins Creed began. Assassins Creed is an enthralling, original game about old historical events, with a twist. In this game, you play as Desmond, an assassin in a clan of assassins, and your goal is to go into the past and discover who you are by observing your ancestors through the Animus as they participated in key historical events. The ancestor whose life you venture though in this game is Altair.What I really like about this game is all the history you can learn from it. This game has an entirely fictional story with an accurate, nonfictional, historical environment. Many of the locations you visit in this game are similar obviously not exact to their real life counter parts during the time period the game takes place in. There are also real buildings and people that were recreated in this game, and when you encounter them the game tells you some of the history behind them. Also, the parkour in this game is unique and more complex than that of any other game that came before it. It provides very fun gameplay and plays a major role in the games story.What I dislike about this game is the side missions. They are all more like challenges and have practically no side story to them that was probably intentional, but I still felt like they should have had some sort of side story. I think with something interesting to do in this game other than the main story missions, the game could have been a little better. That doesnt include the games underlying story with Desmond, which I actually also found entertaining.If you love parkour, stealth, and/or a 1100 A.D. theme, this is the game for you. I recommend this game to anyone, and it gets an 8/10 from me.
