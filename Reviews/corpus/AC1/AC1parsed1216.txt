The story is gripping, however, the gameplay involves an awful lot of horseback riding, and the blend mechanic is a bit wierd it drastically improves in all the later games.Overall, the story is fantastic, and the thrill of the chase once you have ridden to a city is great, and I would recommend this game, despite its minor flaws.
