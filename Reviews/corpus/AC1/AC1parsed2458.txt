Visually stunning game that suffers from crude story and repetitive gameplay. The game basically consists of killing nine victims in three beautifully designed cities. To find their whereabouts you climb up all the city towers to reveal informers. Those ask for one of four quest types time challenges, pick pocket, eavesdropping or interrogation to be completed to share information with you. You can also help various citizen harrassed by guards by slaying the guards. Doing all that takes about 90 minutes until you finally get to the victim which means you can easily beat the game at a weekend. Combat is mainly clicking at the right moment to initiate a combo or counter attack and looks pretty cool, like really all character movement in the game. The game could have been much more though if it had a more compelling story and more mission variation. Still, entertaining.
