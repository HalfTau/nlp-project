First part of Assassins Creed the most contradictory. On the one hand it is a game I presented us a series, with another it is one of the most uniform AAA projects in the game industry on my memory. Yes in 2008 a game turned the market an action of games from 3 persons. The graphics even in 2018 looks acceptable that generally is very strange, it turns out that to Assassins Creed 3 graphics there was that the same level. A gameplay if to discard all additional content it is, but it is given it is so uniform that it would not be better than it. If towers and rescue of citizens increase DNA synchronization, then flags and Templars are the just not necessary element of a gameplay, for it in the PC version do not give points smart. One of the best in a series. It is necessary to study thoroughly the victim, as in HITMAN. The present very sad and permanently pulls out from the game world therefore in the subsequent parts it became much less. Frankly speaking, that Assassins Creed of 2007  the best game of a series along with Unity if to consider the most important game element  tchatelno the planned murder of Templars.PS. Response of citizens to murders just tremendous, all shout as autists and run round
