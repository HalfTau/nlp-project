A great game by Ubisoft! It gives the feel of playing an Assassin and you mission is to change history to bring a better world. The graphics of this game is amazing although its quite an old game now for the franchise. I like how they did the story as well. If you love stealh games, this is something I would recommend. Although some of the side missions may be slightly repetitive, but every person you assassinate will provide a unique play for each level/memory.7.8/10.
