The first of one of the best known series from this era. The tale of the Third Crusade and the Assassins brotherhood is rich in details, historical facts and characters, and both the science fiction and history are well balanced. The graphics are impressive, especially in the environment design and art each building, street and structure is rich in details. The gameplay is intuitive and the sensation of freedom running over the roofs or climbing to a tall tower and looking at the whole city below is just impressive. The game is full of bugs, giving the sensation that it was released before it should, but I didnt find any that really affected gameplay. Assassins Creed do have a Achilles heel, and it is the level design you just do the same kind of submission over and over until you have enough to kill your target, the really interesting part of the game. Asides this only major flow, is a great game that everyone should try.
