Worst game in the seriesThe controlls are godawful, the guards have insane difficulty spikes one minute theyre laughably easy and the next theyre unkillable. Altairs voice acting sounds like some unpaid intern just woke up from a deep sleep, and Altair has the personality of a rocking chair with a frownie face drawn on it. The present day story is Much, much more boring compared to the other games. The only reason I bring these up is that people said this was better than the games that came after this. Who could make that conclusion? The guards attack on sight if they see you climbing buildings, gameplay is VERY MONOTONOUS AND BORING. No currency. Beggars are all up in your personal bubble asking for money, and the only way to shut them up is to punch them in the face which upsets guards. Toward the end of the game, it takes a MASSIVE difficulty dive. The investigations are almost uncompletable, since they rely mostly on not being detected. I suppose the best part of the game was that the beginning was kind of good. The story in this ones present day may have sucked, but it started up a great franchise. Off to a bad start, but the rest of the games are really good. Once you swallow the bitter pill that is this game, the payoff, which is the rest of the series, is da bomb diggity, yo.Even with that last part, I just cant recommend this, because you could probably read a synopsis and get what you need to start with AC2.
