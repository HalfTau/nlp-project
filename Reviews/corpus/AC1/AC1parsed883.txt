Requires manually setting Disable display scaling on high DPI settings at the compatibility settings, and requires launching the game .EXE manually. Monochromatic. The entire game looks dull. Grayish and blueish. And dark, difficult to see sometimes. Unskippable, long, boring cutscenes. No Exit game in the ingame menus. Yes, requires AltF4. Quantity over quality. Very repetitive. Very repetitive. Long stretches of just walking from A to B, artificially increasing the game length.Overall looks dull, the gameplay is repetitive, and is boring to play.
