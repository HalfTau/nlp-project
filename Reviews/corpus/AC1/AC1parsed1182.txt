There are three words that can describe this game perfectly.Mindnumbing tedium.Everything gets absurdly repetitive after the tutorial  climb towers, interrogate/pickpocket, run from guards, kill a guy, run some more. The world and its characters are bland and uninspired, the combat is a chore, the controls are annoying and collecting clues is about as exciting as playing PacMan... without monsters.To top it off, there are no subtitles, and considering that the characters talk like bumbling idiots more often than not, good luck understanding whats going on.Just... dont.
