If you want a game that succeeds very well at being mediocre, play any other in this series.If you want a game thats an interesting failure, willing to serve its own vision before pandering to the widest playerbase, play this one.Is it tedious at times? Yes, certainly. Will you feel confusion, even dismay, at some of the choices the designers made? Probably.Better, though, to have flaws in something interesting, than a perfectly crafted empty spectacle.
