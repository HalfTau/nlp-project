I actually love most of this game. The jumping mechanic and help arent really there, so you need to be slow and careful if you dont want to mess up and die lots from falling to your death. Controls are good overall, and I enjoy the story. For me, the facial expressions during cutscenes could have used a little more love, just due to the fact its one facial expression and lips moving with it. But, considering the small role it plays theres more gameplay then story, so its not too bad. I would suggest this game to anyone who just enjoys having fun and assassinating people. The game is based on true events, which is cool if you like games with some history in them. Would reccomend
