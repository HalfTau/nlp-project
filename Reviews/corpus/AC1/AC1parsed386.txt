I first completed AC on PS3 back in 07 and this is my 7th time playing it, thats how good this game is. The storyline is amazing and you really connect with Altair as you follow his journey to becoming a ranked master Assassin.AC takes place in Masyaf and several other holy lands Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus, Altairs objective aim was to capture the Apple of Eden as he fails to do so his master and Brotherhood leader Al Mualim demotes him to rank novice and tasks him with assasinating 9 templars.The combat in this game is good and up to standard but because it is set in a very old time most weapons were not invented such as a pistol rifle and the hidden gun etc... which are playable in the rest of the AC franchise so you only have a hidden blade and sword. The graphics are standard though I dont find it important as the storyline of this game just overshadows the rest of the qualities.PROS Amazing storyline Great combat Teaches you history while you play Has a great twist towards the ending Graphics are goodCONS Were introduced to Altair as a master assassin already, it would be good to know his background and life before that In the game Altair has an american accent which is kind of cheesy, really hes suppose to have a middle east accent but I guess the reason for that is probably because of the glitch in the Animus.Overall rating  8/10
