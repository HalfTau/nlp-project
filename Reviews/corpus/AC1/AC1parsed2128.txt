Game production and graphics are good, but thats about it.The gameplay is repetitive, tasks, combat and locations repeat themselves and get boring very quickly.Biggest downside of the game is the story. The pace, in which it is told, is so slow that you forget why you have to assassinate people and in what way this all impacts on the person in the lab.And when you finally reach the end of the game, to get the story conclusion you will be left alone with a cliffhanger to buy part two of the series.Utterly disappointing and a chore to play through the whole game.
