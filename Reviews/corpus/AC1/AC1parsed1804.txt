Fun Game, a bit repetitive and Simple but I like it.The Missions dont give you Money, like in the sequels, but the people thank you, and give you hints about your next big target, I dont know why, but I find that more rewarding than money.It has an interesting story, not the best one but, an interesting one. The controls are a bit weird if youve played the sequels before, but for beginners it shouldnt be a problem except if youre not playing with controllerBut it also has its downsides, you cant fasttravel, cant explore the open world after the end of the story and are bound to 1 arsenal of weapons the whole game.Id recommend this game definetly for all Assassins Creed Fans and those, who want to become one.But if youre just looking for a Game, that you want to play for a long time, you should better take a look at the sequels.
