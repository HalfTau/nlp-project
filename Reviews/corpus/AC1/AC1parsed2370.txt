This game isnt really all that amazing, although supposedly its sequels are better.The storyline is cheesy and quite transparent, and Altair is a SERIOUS tool which makes him kind of hard to like, and there arent really other characters in the game. Game mechanicswise, the parkous is mostly serviceable, with a few issues of directionality and getting caught on unscalable objects. Combat is forgettable and made thankfully less tedious as the game progresses. Side missions are only rarely annoying and almost universally involve killing something. Level design and atmosphere is actually quite nice at times.Graphicswise the game ran fine on max settings with a Phenom II X6 / HD6850 / 8gb RAM / Win7 x64 system. Even with vsync on you can get some heavy screentearing during 360 camera pans, and if I Alt  TABd the game I couldnt get it fo fullscreen again.This game is old enough that you can expect good sale prices prolly 50 off the current 20.
