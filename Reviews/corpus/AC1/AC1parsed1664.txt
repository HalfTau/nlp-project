Being a long time AC fan, and having mastered AC 1 by having played through the story almost half a dozen times, once when it first came out, and the other times prior to each new AC release, I must say it still does not get old.For players new to the AC franchise, it is a fantastic first experience to the world of AC, a parkour, medieval combat, and stealth game all in one, perfect for history geeks, consipiracy fans, and behind the curtain enthusiaists. This game not only lets you relive history in a slightly alternative way, but it brings it into modern times by tying in ancient secret world orders that have survived for centuries and now run the world behind the scenes. Manipulating history and giving its own explanation of how we came to be. It might offend some of you who are died hard stubborn religious people, but if you can just get past that it is a game, you will definitely enhoy it. I myself am religious and still hold AC as my favorite game franchise of all time.As for the AC fans who havent played AC 1 yet, all I can say is that, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT, this is where it all began after all. Altair, the Grandmaster of the Assassin Order and most badass of all assassins. Die hard Altair fanboy.Apart from the previous, I will admit the game is pretty old and has its flaws, it is buggy and VERY repetitive, but if you can just push through, you find it is a great introduction ,or reintroduction, into the Assassin world.11/10 would play and play and play again.
