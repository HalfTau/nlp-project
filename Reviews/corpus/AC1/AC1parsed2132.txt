What can I say about this game. Lets start with title it doesnt just screamin your face once, but TWICE. No but really, lets talk the gameplay? well I like the graphics espically for a game that came out in 2007, it is easy to say that they worked hard on impressing us... it was SHINY. The controls are so ing annoying, you are slow and when you try to sprint you jump intoyou dont want to, and when you want to jump you ing run off a building. The story is great, probably the best part about it. I would give it a good 8/10 just because of how classic it is and how it started a whole series that wont end. Good work Ubisoft, you did it with Prince of Persia now you did it with the Assassins creed. Should you buy it? Well if you wait on sale you can probably catch it for 4.99, but you could also use that money to buy a couple of cheese burgers. I dont know you should do what you want with your money, dont let me tell you what to do. Id go for the game pirated and the cheese burgers. Well it depends what kind of cheese burgers, if its from burger king no way. And also mcdonalds kind of sucks too, and who the  wants Jack in the Box. Wow Hamburgers suck, get this game instead.
