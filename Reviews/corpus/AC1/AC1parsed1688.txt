As an ACfan you should definitely get the initial game, even though the graphics are worse than in the recent games.Why would that be a problem, if you can run around in a huge, oriental Open World andTemplars?There is alot to be done and a lot of fun to be had with this game.The only thing I can fault this game for, is the Stealth system..Either every guard and soldier is equipped with eyes on their back and a sense of hearing similar to that of a lynx, or I straightout am the worst player ever.Well and the usual cons of every game in the series You are a Master Assassin but unable to sneak. The only way to stealth really is to pretend not be    an assassin. And you are a Master Assassin, with perfect gear and had years of schooling. Still, no matter how minor their training was and how crappy their skills should be,is able to climb buildings and leap about on rooftops, just as agile as you, regardless how heavy their armor is.I know it would probably make the game too easy if they could not do that, but it would make more sense.Still I love the whole franchise and the first game is definitely worth mentioning.I am also having some troubles with the Fullscreenmode, but that is probably because of my own incompetence.9/10
