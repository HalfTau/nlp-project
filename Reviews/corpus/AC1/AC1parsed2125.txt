Basically the game that introduced me to the next gen. Played it on a PC, that DX10 engine made miracles.When I saw the trailer for this game I concluded that it was simply the best game ever. Sure, I was nave, but when finally managed to get hold of it I was thrilled to see that my expectations werent unfounded. It was repetitive, but even nowadays I fire it up for a nostalgia trip. The game that defined this gen for me, plain and simple. StoryGameplayWIN.
