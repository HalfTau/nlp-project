8.6/10  Older but still amazing for todays standards.A wellmade game and a riveting plot. The controls and ability to scale walls is my favorite. This is unlike any other game where movement is concerned. You can free run the buildings or chance it in the streets. Missions are challenging but achievable.Worth 20
