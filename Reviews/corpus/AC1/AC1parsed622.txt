I played it when it came out ages ago, so im biased i thinkBut id say it held up pretty well over the yearsfun gameplay, gotta love all that parkour!deep story, really makes you think and see things from different perspectives culturally and socially...my only complaintsno AA support ingameunintuitive controls and instructions wth is button0 and button1? its called LMB and RMBintro and menu nightmare, takes forever to get to actual gameplay or to quit the game following the menufield of view feels really odd, i always feel like im zoomed in way too much and everything is too close
