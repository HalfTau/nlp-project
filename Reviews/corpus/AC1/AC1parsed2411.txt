Very good. With an astonishing presentation and the excelent ambientation in the middle east,  during the crusades, the fight system and the parkour mobility that brings us back to  Prince of Persia Sands of Time, but much improved, this game is really above the averange. The story is great, though its not worth to complete all the sidequests, since it gets very repetitive quickly, that, aswell, beeing a significant problem in the game as a whole. Even then, its worth playing.
