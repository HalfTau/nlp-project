As the first game of the Assassins Creed franchise, this game does an amazing job setting a strong foundation for anybody interested in the franchise. Full of hilarious and sometimes frustrating glitches  most easily fixed with a few adjustments to settings  Assassins Creed appears to be a mediocre port of a great game.Playing at a casual rate, making minimal mistakes, while also meddling around in presentday affairs, this game will offer you 14 hours of true game time. For those completionists that enjoy spending time collecting hidden objects, the game may offer up to 20 hours.I would say the game is worth the 20, but Im biased towards this part of the series. For most, I defintely recommend waiting until the game goes on sale just be sure to pick it up if you havent played it yet!Pros Great story Improved fasttravel Multiple options for most missions No Uplay Required Controller supportCons Repetitive Easy Water is lava Low replay value No real reward for 100 completion
