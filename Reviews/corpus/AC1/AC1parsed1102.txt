Assassins creed is a great starter for the AC series, set during The Third Crusade you play as Altar Ibn LaAhad translates to The Bird, Son of Noone a master assassin of the brotherhood who breaks all three tenants of the assassins creed and is dishonored. Loosing all your weapons and ranks you assassinate targets to have Ubisoft spoon feed you counter attacks and new weapons. Great storyline, the cutscenes could use some work as the player can walk around during the cutscenes which kind of breaks some of them. The parkour is great with one exception, sometimes when leaping off of buildings or cliffs the player hits an invisible wall and slides down it to the ground, the parkour is also notably slower than in other Assassins Creed games. The controls are built for the console meaining that it does have speep learning curve, example holding down right click to toggle high profile shift to drop and right click plus w plus space to freerun. the game features great graphics given that it is from 2008 although some of the textures glitch every once and a while.Overall I would give this game a 8/10
