The ancient and medieval settings and storylines of the world of Assassins Creed have a really spellbinding effect that will likely keep you holding on for the next installment of which there are many by now. If ancient conspiracies regardless of their validity and the like peak your interest, then youll certainly enjoy the bizarre storyline evident in this series.The freerunning gameplay in pretty enjoyable, though it evolves and becomes better as the series runs along. All the ancient cities are well designed for bounding across rooftops and clambering over walls while you avoid the city guard and Templars.I hadnt played a game with combat set up like this before I gave it a try, and its a very rewarding feeling to get the timing just right to dodge, parry, and deliver a killing blow to any number of attackers. Obviously the system of Everyone attack, just one at a time is realistically silly, but it makes the game simple enough that you arent ever overburdened, as long as your timing is up to par, even when facing more than ten attackers.The missions are enjoyable at first, but they tend to get repetitive after a while, as there are only a handful of different types of mission.And oh god, the flags, they do nothing. Dont waste your time, unless youre just a 100 kinda guy.
