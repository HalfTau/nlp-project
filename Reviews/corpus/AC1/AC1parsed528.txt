Assassins Creed. A decent first entry to a great franchise. This game is a solid 6/10 for meProsGreat story.Good characters.Good graphics for its timeGreat combat and parkourConsThe gameplay gets VERY repetetive after a few missions. Basically doing the same stuff over and over again with minor changes.There is little to no replay value due to its repetetivity and the fact that there are FAR superior entries to this franchiseNo subtitlesOVERALLThis game isnt a musthave, not even for fans of the franchise, but its cheap, so its worth it
