This game has a great story and beautiful graphics for its time..BUT the gameplay is so repetitive.. Every assassination mission is basicly the same, the only differences are the cutscenes. Id started to play the game a dozen times, but every time i got so bored, i couldnt take it anymore.When i finally found the courage to finish the game, it was a torturous experience.
