Games like this make me whis there was a neutral recommendation.The game is good, make no mistake. But it is sooo repetative, you do the same thing over and over and over again.However, I dont recommend skipping it. Bear with it and finish for the story.Then jump to the masterpiece that is Assassins Creed 2.
