Great game. Honestly though, I wouldnt recommend buying it at full price. Wait until its on sale. It does connect with AC2 but if you skip this game and go straight to 2, youre honestly not missing much. You might be a little confused with the story but as you progress youll get the gist. If you like to feel immersed in the story as I do, I recommend buying it but buy it on sale. If youre just looking to purchase an Assassins Creed game, Id say go with AC2 or Black Flag.The character does not move fluidly. Youll find yourself jumping to the wrong thing, trying to run up a wall where you shouldve grabbed the ledge, not climbing onto the roof where you should be able to, getting out of a hiding spot only to find yourself climbing onto the edge of the hiding spot, sometimes youll refuse to climb onto a viewpoint. The missions are repetitive. You do the same thing in every city in every chapter while the cities mostly look the same. The main characters voice is absolutely terrible. Comming from the Holy Land, you would think a dude named Altar IbnLaAhad would have a middle eastern accent as ezio has an italian accent. NOPE, youre a white dude.If you dont care about feeling immersed, read the wiki on ac then skip to ac2 and go from there.
