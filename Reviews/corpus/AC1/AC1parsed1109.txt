I really love the AC series,but this one is horrible. Boring,monotonous,ripetitive and incomplete. I would recommend it only to people who want to play the entire AC series since it shows important matters like whos Desmond,how he ends up in Abstergo etc. matters that Desmond will summarize in the introduction of Assassins Creed II anyway.The graphics is not bad and so the setting,even if the only places in which you can wander are the cities,some lands that are all the same,the fortress of Masyaf and the assassins refuges I dont like Altar,this AC doesnt allow us to understand how and who really is this assassin,he doesnt give me any emotions. Hes just dull. However,I really like the story and it will be better illustrated in the following AC theyre much better than this!.
