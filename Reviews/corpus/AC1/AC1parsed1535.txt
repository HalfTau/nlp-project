Dull, boring, repetitive and clumsy. But very pretty. I really cant recommend this game unless you are completionist and want to know the storyline before moving onto some of the later, better, games. The control system is clumsy, hamstrung by being developed for a limited input system. Each area is repetitive and essentially boils down to climb all the towers, save all the civilians, do a few races, beat some people up then assassinate the target. Repeat 9 times. The collection side quest is infuriating, overly long and utterly pointless. How this game spawed such a winning franchise I do not know but having played II I am glad it did. The good part I can highlight is it very pretty for when it was released and the free running is great fun when things dont glitch...
