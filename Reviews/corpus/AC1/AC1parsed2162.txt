Assassins Creed is filled with good ideas that sound great in theory but ultimately fall flat in execution. The first few hours are definitely fun, but everything afterward becomes a mess. Clunky controls, repetitive combat, and one of the worst plotlines in video game history certainly dont help it either. 5.7/10.
