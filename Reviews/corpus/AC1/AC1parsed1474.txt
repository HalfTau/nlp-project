If youre searching for an assassin game, this is not the game you search for, better check out Dishonored or Hitman or even Shadow of Mordor.Assassins Creed is a onemanarmy action game with bad voice acting, strange controls, horrible camera movement, repetitive character and world design, boring missions, hundreds of useless collectibles and a nice setting where youre facing 20 enemies at once and still win.Some other features like fixed aspect ratio black borders on top and bottom if you dont have a 169 monitor, no subtitles, no regular saves or the need to press 10 buttons just to quit the game round this terrible package.I have no idea how this franchise could become so popular.Dont buy it.
