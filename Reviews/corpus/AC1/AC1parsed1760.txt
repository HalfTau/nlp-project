Assassins Creed Directors Cut Edition is a great game to play in my opinion. This is the game that brought the series to life. Those to think it may not be a buy because of what the requirements are, dont hesitate. I run Windows 7, and the game somehow said I was running Windows Vista. Either way, its playable. Playing it on PC is going to be my third time through this game, all I can say is, I cant wait to play the others in the series.
