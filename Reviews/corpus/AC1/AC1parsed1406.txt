For its time the game was really good. Playing it now it feels a little dated. If you want to get into the franchise I would say to read up on the first game and skip playing it just to start with the second one since it fixes a lot of the problems me and other people had with this one. Also the lack of subtitles makes it kind of hard to make out some things people are saying expecially when trying to hear though the vents. All and all it is a good game I would just say if you dont like it to skip it and move on.
