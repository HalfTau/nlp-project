Writing this after Ive played the sequel. The game was fun and almost open world but not quite. You travel from city to city as you do missions and while the side missons get repetative and boring toward the end the main mission keeps you playing. If you found yourself liking but not loving the game, the sequel makes up for many if not all of the mistakes.
