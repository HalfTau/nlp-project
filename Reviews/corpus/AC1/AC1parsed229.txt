You dare steal in my presence? That will cost you your life!This game is only worth it for the story that leads into Assassins Creed 2. The gameplay is extremely repetitive compared to the sequels and it is noticeably a 10 year old game, though it certainly isnt a bad one at that. Buy it when its on sale OR read a plot summary and then skip ahead to Assassins Creed 2.
