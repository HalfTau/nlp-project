Finally gave Assassins Creed another try many years after its release, and I actually enjoyed it for the most part. Graphics and gameplay are barely outdated for its age, the story is fairly good and the controls are managable. Only real problem I had was no way to buy/sell seapons and I felt the game was linear and repeditive. I hope as I make my way through the series Ill be giving higher reviews.
