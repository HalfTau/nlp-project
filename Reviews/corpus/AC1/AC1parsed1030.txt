Personally I couldnt stand the weird premise of genetic memories. It felt too contrived relative to the overall tone of the story the developers seemed to be striving for. Could have worked if they hadnt taken it so seriously as a plot device. I also found the UI quite clunky, with controls unintuitive and plain difficult to control the player character with great precision. Did look good in ultrawidescreen, but couldnt get completely immersed to get worthy enjoyment from it. Its also annoying to need a chain of game launchers installed in order to launch the game. Looking at you, UPlay.
