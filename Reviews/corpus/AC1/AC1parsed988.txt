While more combat oriented than the other games in the franchise, the original Assassins Creed is still a fine gaming experience. Albeit more repetitve than future sequels. With solid graphics and a large world to explore, this semilinear experience is well worth the money if the action/adventure genre appeals to you.Just be warned that the Assassins Creed franchise contains numerous jump puzzles that may give problems to certain gamers. Particularly those using a keyboard and mouse.7.5/10
