I bought this for Xbox back when it first came out in 2007, it was brilliant fun and i couldnt put it down until i finished the game. Since then i have played through the entire franchise on console.Recently i decided to buy the franchise on Steam to play through them again, Assassins Creed is still just as much fun now as it was when it was first released.
