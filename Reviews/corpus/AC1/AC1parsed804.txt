When I bought a new laptop with some power after some years, I thought I would catch up with some goodies from the past I couldnt play and went straight to this game.At first it seemed fun but then turned out to be a series of boring, repetitive chores. Especially the travels between cities, similar missions to pickpocket some characters or going eagles eye are not interesting after a while and definitely not fun.Get it if you have a lot of time to spend doing same actions and watching some good cutscenes in between though.
