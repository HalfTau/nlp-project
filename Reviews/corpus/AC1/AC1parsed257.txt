I am a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise and Ive been waiting for quite a while to get my hands on this game.I couldnt play it for long however because my pc overheated and its dead now.But for as long as I did play it I had a complete sense of satisfaction whle playing as Ezio.I definitely recommend this game for all gamers looking for beautiful scenery,jumping of buildings and all round killing.
