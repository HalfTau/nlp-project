I caught this game on sale finally, so far I feel like I have been taking a tour through the middle east. Great graphics and sound for its time, but controls are left to be desired. Also a lot of the objectives are repetitive but I am still enjoying killing everyone in sight, and at times using stealth. I would recommend this game and use a Logitech F710 or better instead of keyboard and mouse.
