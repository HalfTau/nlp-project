9.6/10 This game is a masterpiece.This story is very fun even with the robotic emotions of Altair. But for an 2008 game it is fantastic and still holds as one of the better games out even in 2014. The graphics are amazing, the combat is fun and skillful, but the kill then run then hide gets very repetive and tiring. The reason this didnt get 10/10 is because of the repetiveness and because how quickly Altair changed. He became a badass, listen to no one guy to an Enlightened, I understand why my actions are wrong kind of guy in almost a blink of an eye.
