If you love spending hours upon hours of doing nothing but the same thing over and over again, then I highly recommend this game. If you value your time more than an unemployedbychoice middle aged man living at home with his parents, then look elsewhere for entertainment.This game consists of extremely bad AI, a rather dull, very slow and predictable moving story line I would have enjoyed a novel based on this. But a game was not needed. Its just one of those games where the concept is good, but the execution leaves much to be desired.
