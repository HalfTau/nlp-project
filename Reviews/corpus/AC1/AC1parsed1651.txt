This is a relatively old game now and has been overshadowed by the newer AC games, but for a first game of a series its not bad at all. The background story in the present time with Desmond Miles is a great setup for later games, but unfortunately the story of Altair in the crusades isnt anything special. This is more than made up by the fact that the world is one giant parkour playground and that it actually feels like a real living, breathing world with all the people and their reactions especially when guards randomly fall from rooftops. Combat needs some work, basically you learn the timing of the counterattack and you can kill anything easily. Altair also failed swimming lessons and dies instantly in the water.Easily recommended, although with how old this game is I would say to wait until its on sale to pick it up, and preferably as part of a bundle with other AC games.
