A revolution in 3rd person gaming. Truly extraordinary for its time. Obviously high quality as it led to a series of sequels that has since turned into one of the most successful franchises in gaming history.That aside there are several components of AC1 that have not aged well. The missions are woefully repetative. Go to a new city, find all the viewpoints, gather information by doing the exacty same side quests over and over again, etc etc. After the first 4 hours the latter 16 hours are pretty much the same thing on repeat until you get to the end. And to describe the ending, all that can be said is Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!.Then you wake up as Desmond feeling really satisfied and the game ends in the middle of more stuff happening that you dont get to explore.Overall 8/10 for its time. Today? 6.5 out of 10. TLDR Just start the series off with AC 2
