Im 33 years old, im a hardcore gamer since i was 10 around 1994. That said i never played the AC series, to my shame. Then AC Origins came out and i waited fro black friday and bought all the saga including Origins. This is the 1st one of my AC marathon and took me 22h to complete the main campaign including most of all the side missions such as finding flags and saving citizens. So, although not a long game its actually a very good and interesting game with awsome rendering for 2008 standards. Even more, theres a lot of 2017 titles that dont render textures like this game i was very suprised. A few glitches here and there but nothing much. It was a fun ride. Im off to AC II now, wish me luck.
