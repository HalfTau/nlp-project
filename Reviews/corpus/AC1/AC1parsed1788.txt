Well, Ive been warned that this is the most dull entry in the saga.Theres repetition in the quests youll have to undertake  but most of them are optional and may be avoided. You may not want to avoid them in the beginning, because youll benefit from them.But the world! Its a fantastic place and the cities are a sight to behold.Also, even I, clumsy as I am, had a blast jumping, climbing and stalking through these scenes  this games makes you feel much more competent than you are, which adds a lot to the fun.The story has an interesting spin youll see right at the beginning.All in all very recommended. Im looking forward to the other entries in this series.Here are some play tips very mild spoilersDont try to collect all flags. This is seriously madness and not needed, unless you are unhealthily obsessed You can skip save the citizens sidequests BUT every 15 finished sidequests informer quests, view points scaled, citizens saved your hit point increase by one and you may even gain extra abilities, which helps a lot. You max out at 20 two bars, so plan accordingly.Id always scale all view points. These discover side quests and reveal the map, which is helpful when fleeing or planing to strike.You dont need to do all informer quests 3 out of 6. The info gained is not that helpful either. But  see above.
