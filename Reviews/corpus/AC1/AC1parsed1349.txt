I was told that assassins creed was fun, scenic, and had great gameplay mechanics. It was none of these things assassins creed has boring cutscenes, repetitive gameplay, and suuuuuppeeeeerrrrr sloooooooowwwww mooooveeeeemmeeeent. Gameplay goes something like this, 1. get a quest 2. try to run to that quest 3. accidently bump in to a guard 4. run OFF COURSE for 5 minutes while guards chase you screaming DIE, INFIDEL! repeat from step 2.maybe Ill try brotherhood, Ive been told that IT is actually good...
