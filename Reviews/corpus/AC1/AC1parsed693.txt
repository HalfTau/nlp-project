This is where everything with assassins creed began. Is definielty my favorit one. Comparing to others assassins creed you have less different stuff you can do but the place where it is played is well done. Especially masyaf, I was climbing to the highest point and looking around the mountains. Its stunning and wouldnt have move for awhile just enjoying the view but the game progress wont do itself.
