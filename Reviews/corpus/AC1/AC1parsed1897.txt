I didnt enjoy this game. I know enough of the story from watching lets plays before I started playing that over all the franchise is pretty good but this game is just really dull to play. Once the novelty of running around wears off the game is ultimately just a grind fest of similar challanges. If there where acheivements then maybe I would of enjoyed it more but I had no reason to pick up those last few flags or complete all the challanges. I recommend you pick up this game at some point, like I said its a good series and the story is worth a look but gameplay wise its fairly dull and a chore.
