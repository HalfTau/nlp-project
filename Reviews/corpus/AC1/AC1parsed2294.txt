Im not just recommending Assassins Creed. Im recommending the entire series. I would be doing this on Assassins Creed 2, since it is the BEST of all of them, but I dont own it on Steam so... Anyway, lets get to the points.Assassins Creed A historical/science fiction game where you play as Altair, a legendary assassin from Isreal, working for Almualim to kill templars and obtain the Apple of Eden. Made in 2008, the graphics are great for its time and, with a rich storyline and cliffhanger ending, makes you want to play more.Assassins Creed 2 This time, you play as Ezio, a nobleman from Italy in the 15th century. Ezios father and two brothers were wrongfully framed for something they didnt do. Enraged, Ezio escapes the city with his sister and mother and seeks revenge against the people who killed his relatives. Made in 2010, this game has amazing graphics and, again, makes you want to play more. I havent finished any of the AC2 games, but you should still get them.
