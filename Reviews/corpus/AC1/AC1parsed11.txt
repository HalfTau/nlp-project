While not without its shortcomings, the first Assassins Creed game holds some dear memories for me.Surely, it seems a bit repetitive at times, the journeys between the cities are sufficiently long even with a horse to bore a modern gamer...But this game also has some things I love and miss in the later AC games my favourite protagonist of all the series, a story that is actually quite good, and a stealth that is more realistic Im not a fan of the notoriety system Ubisoft introduced beginning with AC2.
