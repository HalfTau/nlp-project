Here we go!30 hours in the game and all I can say is that it is an amazing game with some problems.StoryI expected a more captivating story. For a game with that hype factor I expected a stroy that would consume me and keep me wanting more after each and every mission. Instead we got a main protagonist, his boss and a couple of minor characters doing the Groundhog day type of repetition. You see your boss, he gives you a piece of equipment and sends you off to kill a guy but before you can do that you have to save citizens, jump off of tall buildings and here and there you have to help your assassin friends in order to gather information on your target. You have some pickpocketing missions and interrogation stuff but that is just about it. And for every single target is the same.GameplayThis is the part where the game redeems itself. Gameplay is fantastic and this is the main atribute of the game. Controlls take some time to get used to but it is not much of a problem. Very detailed open world gives you the possibility to do anything and go everywhere. The world is detailed, very nicely done. Fighting is very beutifull to watch if you do it right but if you make a single mistake it is a pretty frustrating thing to go through. You have to time your moves right and really be engaged in the fight. You can not just randomly press buttons and see enemy fighters drop like flyes. Charecter movements are really nicely done but Altairs walking is the only thing that makes me cringe. He looks like he is a male model on the cat walk.The story maybe is not top notch but voice acting is. Motion capture and animation really are good and voice actors really made the effort of projecting character personalities to us.The game itself functions properly. No chrashes, only here and there I have expirienced minor audio glitches but that was about it.All in all the game is highly recommended.
