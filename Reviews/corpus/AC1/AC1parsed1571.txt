This game takes place in the same era as the Third Crusades as well as partally in modern day. You play as Desmond as you enter the Animus to relive your past as Altiar. There is so much to do in this game as well as so little. You can spend countless hours freeroaming and completing every objective to become an honorable assassin, or you can go right through the campaign and have the thrill of assassinating your enemies over and over. The gameplay is fantastic as you not only just bullrush in and attack your enemies, but you also must escape and be stealthy like a true assassin. There are a few glitches in the gameplay as I kept running up the wall when I was trying to run up the ladder or maybe thats just my own incompitance in inability to be a true assasin. The fact that you cannot swim was frustrating, especially in the last level. The fact that the guards targeted me as an assassin whenever I ran past them was a little frustrating as well. All in all, I give this game a 9/10
