Assassins Creed plays more like a proof of concept or demo than a full game the missions have no variety and theres very little to do outside of them. However, what it does, it does well, and fleeing from the scene of your assassination is a part of gameplay that is sorely missing from later entries in the series. The environments are repetitve being all variations on Middle Eastern city, with Acre being the most memorable. The story following Altair is enjoyable, the Desmond sections feel like ana fterthought.
