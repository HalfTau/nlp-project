Still holds up remarkably well.Innovative in its time.A fun setting. With some interesting moral ambiguity.Combat is superficial but fun.The story is quite interesting and has some fun though not persay unexpected twists and turns.The main character turned out more likeable than I expected. Far more likeable.The only 2 true downsides to the game are1 Repetitive sidequest. More varied sidequests would have been great. And especially some subplots linked to them.2 Meaningful sidequests. Linked to point 1. True rewards and unlocks linked to the sidequests.All in all though...Pretty awesome and cool.A recommended game!
