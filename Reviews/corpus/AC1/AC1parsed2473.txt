In the first Assassins Creed game youre the boring dude Desmond whos been kidnapped and is forced to lie the hell down and run around in a virtual reality as his assassin ancestor Altair, because the modern day moesuckra Templars want information from your tiny baby brain memory.This game is as good as the second game but in its own way. I feel a bit more like an assassin in this one though he still looks a bit out of place, the combat is more of a challenge and assassinating people is generally harder. There isnt as much side stuff to do just the flag collecting thing, and those other 3 optional missions you can do when youre finding information for each assassination memory.You cant change your clothes and armour and you are given weapons when the game says so. You also have alot less weapons than Ezio and you dont get as much help. Overall its just more challenging but it feels like a bigger achievement when you kill them dudes good.
