Dont look at the time on record, I only got this game on Steam just in case the disc dies after Ive played the heck out of it and it remains one of my all time favourites but Ill still try to be as objective as possible.The principal strengths of this game are its story and atmosphere, and the way all of that is portrayed the ordinary people, the beggars, the drunks, the various military factions, the sounds, the languages, the architecture, the events unfolding around you, the events underneath those events...Writing in 2016. the gameplay is not revolutionary, but its still satisfying and the same can be said about the graphics due to the superb visual design and the fact that it was a very good looking game for its time. More importantly, the thrill of succesfully completing a big mission that youve been preparing through several side quests is something that never changes.The main criticism of this game has always been that it can get slightly repetitive after a while. Personally, Ive completed it at least 34 times, so thats what I think about that. DSeriously, while I can see where that comes from, the game keeps showing you new things, including an amazing series of around a dozen great side characters that you get to meet and mostly assassinate and that plus the not one! two main stories that you slowly piece together as you progress should keep you stuck to the game until the dramatic end when it all converges. Without exaggeration, the story is at least as good as The Da Vinci Code and to whomever I retold it nongamers included, they were interested to play or, at the very least, discuss the various ideas that occur in the game.Thoroughly recommended!
