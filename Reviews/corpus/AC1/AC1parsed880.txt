An absolute MUST for assassins creed fans.ProsMaxing it out gives better graphics than xbox one and ps4 will ever give you I mean like, wtf, its a very old game but maxing it out beats the consoles of this generation? its a plus for me.Good gameplaysometimes a bit choppy in the fighting partOverall a pretty good story.ConsHalfway through completion you understand how repetitive it is.Voice acting is kinda cheap... Every person I save from any town says the same crap. They cheaped out on it, just like pc builders and their Power Supplies.If you play anything else first, the combat will disappoint you in this one. No air assassinations etcWhat the  IS WRONG WITH THE ENDING?!Worth it, if youre a fan and you got time to kill!
