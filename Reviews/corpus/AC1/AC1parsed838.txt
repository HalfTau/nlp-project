Fun game, with a good story, set in a historical time period  and it seems like they put in legitimate effort to make it authentic. Definitely worth a playthrough. Warning though it is repititve along the lines of games like Shadow of Morder You basically do the same side quests again and again in 3 different cities and then go after your target which advances you to the next part of the story.Was probably ahead of its time considering this game is like 8 years old. The graphics are still very good even by todays standards.Would use overpowered haystacks again I mean really who would think to look in one?
