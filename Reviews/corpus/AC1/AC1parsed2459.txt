This is one of the worst games Ive ever played.The movement and combat are frustrating due to inconsistant response. Not to mention the  fixedangle camera that you are forced into using at key events and missions. This retard camera, combined with a lock on all movement during story events, has caused me to get stuck onlike walls and headstones, making it impossible to move, and forcing a restart of the mission since I cant move to the next trigger zone because Im stuck on a wall. This is pretty ing , but cannot beat the aggravating, now Im yelling and everyone in the house thinks I have a problem, targeting system, that, I cant quite tell if it locks or not, but will switch targets, and when you are attacked, will lock on, prevent you from fleeing if health is low. Of course this might all be bearable if the story didnt the depth of Dan Browns 3rd grade picture book written in retardese. 20/100
