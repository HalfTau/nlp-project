Only played around 9 hours so far but is a really awesome game, it feels a little too simplistic and sometimes too easy with instant respawns and if you screw up you can just killl everything with a sword instead of assassin like play so is way too forgiving of mistakes, it feels like a console to PC port game where it has been dumbed down.It can also be a little repetitive.Still a really awesome game and especially for how old it is, is worth the cheap price and one play through atleast.
