The story and concept is wonderful. New and exciting.Unfortunately, that is where it ends. if you manage to slog your way through the extremely long and boring introduction, that is plagued by extremely confusing control schemes that are constantly changing, a headache inducing visual affect to tryin and give the impression of being in a computer, that just drags. its not even a couple minutes. Prepare to spend 15 minutes on the tutorial unskippable before even starting the introduction, which slags on nor another hour or so of more tutorials.Even if you manage to get past this part, you quickly realize that the game is going to be excessively long as you are forced to repeat the same gameplay over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over again.Heres a tip dont buy this game. Go read the story online. the story is great. the game is not. Ive been told at least that Assasins Creed 2 is much better game and is actually amazingly fun...after about 6 hours of gameplay, Im stopping playing this one and will jump forward in the series in hope for redeption. This game has not aged well, despite being only 5ish years old
