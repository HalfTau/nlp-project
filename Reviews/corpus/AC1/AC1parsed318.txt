 Amazing scope, absolutely massive gameworld Incredibly wellcrafted story with excellent voiceacting Climb absolutely anything and jump off from the highest points into a stack of hay. Awesome! AI and city life less dynamic than it should have been Gameplay can become a bit repetitive Some miner tech issues in the face of such a magnificient game engineAll in all Assassins Creed is a good game and worth a buy.
