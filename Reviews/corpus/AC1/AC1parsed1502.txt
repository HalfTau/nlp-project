Years ago when Assassins Creed first came out, I wasnt impressed. I played a few hours of it, only to walk away annoyed and disappointed. Recently however, when the majority of the Assassins Creed franchise was on sale for less than 5 a game, I decided to give it another try. That was one of the best decisions Ive made in gaming and Ive been hooked ever since.The true historical applications of the game, albeit slighty modified, is intriguing, educational, and very welldone. I felt as though I really was fighting an oppressive force during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191. This game takes advantage of historical events, locations, and terminology in the same way the Metal Gear series does. The ancestoral concept throughout the game was like nothing Ive ever seen in a game and brought a uniqueness to it. The protagonist, Altar IbnLaAhad, is a competent fighter and agile acrobat. The growth of character witnessed during the course of the game was satisfying and gave you a clearer understanding of what the creed means.On the other hand, the tasks were a little repetitive and stealth wasnt very prevalant. You had very few ways to sneak up on someone and would rather kill someone then have to run away each time. Regardless, the game was immensely satisfying and paved way for numerous sequels that I loved as well.This is a must buy.
