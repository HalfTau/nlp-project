The first entry in the Assassins Creed series, and a solid game in its own right but ultimately feeling more like a proof of concept when compared to later entries in the series.The game uses the excuse of genetic memory to send your character on a romp through the historical Crusades, as your character moves his way through assassinating corrupt leaders in order to assist the goals of the characters cult. It features an open world with a small variety of optional missions, but ultimately the game  while showing solid promise  hinges on a few repetitive patterns and collection quests. Its fun, but other entries in the series are better. Expect Good, not Great.
