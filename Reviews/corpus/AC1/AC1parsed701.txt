I started off by playing Assassins Creed 2, staring Ezio Auditore. Safe to say when I went back to play the original Assassins Creed, while I was impressed with the story line I was anything but with the actual game play. Objectives werent clear, game controls were signifcantly different to the subsequent AC games, and certain aspects of the game simply didnt make sense like why the guards were constantly on high alert even though they have no idea what you look like and so have to shift around the game slowly while in the prescence of guards.Something which also annoyed me was that our little protagonist can drown.... A soon to be Master Assassin can drown. Kind of takes away the magic.I found myself getting bored within 3 hours of game play and I have no drive to complete this game whatsoever. I regret buying this on the summer sale 2016, and I instead wish I had purchased Assassins Creed Revelations so I could at least finish Ezios story.Just avoid it.
