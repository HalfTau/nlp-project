So its a great game but just inplay able. There isnt a windowed mode which might not sound too bad, however you constantly exit the game, and even on acations halfway though a mision close it. The game says it surports xbox 360 game pads, but when you are costomizing the settings you cant use all the buttons so I have to use RB instead of RT to go into high profile.
