While the game is nowhere near as good as the games that come after it, Assassins Creed was the game that kicked off the craze. Yes, the missions get extremely repetitive and the story in this game is utter trash 95 of the time, but its still a unique and enjoyable game that is a good way to ease yourself into the sprawling franchise. This is the only game in the series that is actually tough at times, but if you can get past it... I guess its a bit selfrewarding...
