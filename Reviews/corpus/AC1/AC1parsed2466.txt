Great game. Great way to open up a completely new series. The game looks good for its time, free running plays fluidly, and the story is very good. One complaint that most people seem to share, although this wasnt an issue for me, was that the missions became too repetitive. I can see how people found that to be the case but if you stick to doing the bare minimum required to move on, you literally cut the busy work in half and shorten the games lifespan to the perfect length. The combat is very easy and its almost impossible to die from combat once you learn how to counter attack but that doesnt take away from the games experience because you still end up running and sneaking from guards for the sake of saving time. The long horse rides from city to city can be a bit of a pain and the games ending is a TERRIBLE cliffhanger that leaves much to be desired but by the time youre reading this, AC2 is already out anyways so what does it matter? This game is a great buy and its a MUST play.
