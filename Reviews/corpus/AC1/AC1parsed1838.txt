First of the Assassins Creeds this is where the overarching story starts. Some of the environments look very nice, and there are some spectacular animations. Unfortunately, that doesnt make up for soso controls, extremely repetitive gameplay, and an unlikeable protagonist.Play only if youre a completionist, or if you just want to sightsee in the medieval Levant. Otherwise just skip to II or IV.
