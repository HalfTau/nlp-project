Great game.  If you havent played it, you should.ProsStoryline, gameplay, visuals, and overall enjoyment for its time 10/10.ConsWidely considered to be overly repetitive in some of its missions I did not find this to be an issueThis is a port so you may occasionally run into bugs, although nothing that makes the game unplayable.  If you have a NVidia graphics card I found that enabling VSync in the NVidia control panel fixed all my issues.
