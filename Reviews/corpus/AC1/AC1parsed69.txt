This game had wonderfully fresh ideas when released despite leaning too heavily on those ideas by repetition. its unlikely the game has aged well and only stalwart fans of the series will continue to enjoy this game now. If youve impressively remained ignorant about this games overall plot and some of its major twists, then it could be worth playing for the story. I personally enjoyed the characters and their relationships, though these elements arent interactive as the medium perhaps should facilitate. it bears mentioning that the boss encounters, or mor accurately the planning phases leading up to the boss fights, are more more sophisticated and offer greater scope for subterfuge that later entries in the series. The games artistic direction is impressive, though, i would argue. Theres something about AC1 that invites me back, but more about it that suggests that i should stay away. 2007 score 8.25/10. 2018 score 6/10.
