If you played Assassins Creed IV Black Flag before trying this game, you are going to be dissatisfied with the controller layout and overall feel of the game. But storylinewise, PLAY IT.If you are like me and love playing console originals that have been ported to PC with a controller, then I would not suggest sitting too far away from the screen with this game. When it says partial controller support, it means it. The first time you run the game you are gonna be required to use the keyboard and mouse to skip the long intro cutscene you are gonna want to do this every time you run it actually and to actually get to the main menu. After that, you gonna need to remap ALL of the controls. The triggers dont register, so use the bumpers instead. Not to mention, if you are indeed coming from some of the later ACs, the combat and parkour system will feel VERY sluggish/nonresponsive. But this is the first game of course it will be that way.Beyond that, the game is awesome so far. The storyline, I will agree, is VERY repetitive, but pay attention to the meetings with the leader. This is definitely where they introduce the Templars and WHY the Assassins hate them. Not to mention, you start to see the changes in both Altar and Desmond with every meeting / Animus break.Okay, time for my little goingson about the graphics.While not as intensive as Black Flag, the graphics for AC1 are both crisp and pretty detailed given when the game was published.Overall, 9/10 because of repetitiveness. Granted, basically having the job of Hitman would be pretty repetitive  Go here. Kill this guy. Come back unseen.
