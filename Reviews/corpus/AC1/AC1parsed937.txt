Im not sure how I like this game to be honest.The story itself is awesome and a good preparation for the 2nd game which is my fav. ac game by farBut the game play is just a variety of different mission which basically are the same  only the assassination target differs  every time you need to prepare for the assassasination by finding out information about the target and then kill your him. Thats the whole game, sadly.But like I said earlier  the story is great and you really need to play this game in order to play the others thats why I give it a thumbs up!
