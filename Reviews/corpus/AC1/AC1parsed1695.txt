Boring, repetetive and clunky.Though the first hour of the game is promising, it all goes downhill as it progresses. The whole game is repetition of the same kind of missions, and with its clunky gameplay and unusual AI, it quickly gets boring.The story is interesting but the long and arduous grind you have to go through is not worth it. The game started feeling like a chore and led me to losing all interest.
