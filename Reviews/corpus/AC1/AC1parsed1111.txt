I dont know how to put it into the right words, but im utterly disappointed.Id normaly not write a evaluation of a game i played only for such a short time, but i have never encountered such a strong difference between general opinion and my experiences.After playing it for a couple of hours, i had to put it aside because i was so annoyed by this game.Controls are 100 console, which means with mousekeyboard you are in danger to create a knot of your fingers, lol.This games system of control may work superb on a console but its almost unplayable on PC imo.For example, changes between stealth and not stealth mode are barely noticeable UI which can result in a chaotic brawl with several guards.I could get used to this without problem but the constant changes between present and medieval times completely kill the immersion for me and the futuristic UI doesnt help getting immersed into the medieval ages. Nor do the continuing jumps in the storyline help creating a feel for the game world.I have no idea if it changes later in the game, but i dont have the desire to find that out.
