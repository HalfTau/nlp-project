Assassins creed 1 is the great start to a great franchise and I personally enjoyed this game. If you play this game like I did and that would be taking its time doing all of the side missions as well as all of the explorations the game will take about 20 hours to complete and that 20 hours is well spent. However keeping in mind that this game was made in 2008 expect a few bugs and funky controls now and then. I would recommend this game if you never played any of the Assassins creed games as this game is a great start. Also I advise to play this first so that no story is spoiled in the later games of Assassins creed.
