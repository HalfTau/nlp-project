Dont buy this. Unless youre a some sort of crusadesnut, dont bother with this game. Jumping straight to AC 2 is going to give a lot better experience about the series, and from there you can either continue or not depending if you like it or not. Sure AC2 isnt as good as AC Brotherhood, but if youre going to follow the plot, might as well start there. What happens in this game is not important at all, and can be skipped with youtubevideos or checking a short recap from a wikipage.This game isnt exactly horrible, but it has nothing compared to following installements. The plot is boring, gameplay is seriously lacking and theres just nothing to do after first few hours. From there its repeating the same places and missions all over again. Some design flaws make the game sometimes feel a horrible experience, although its because the game just drags on and on. Luckily there are only few bugs and technically the game is a solid piece of work. Still the game is not enjoyable after the beginning as it lacks substance. I thought I would like this more than the second one because of the theme, and some ill parts in the second, yet I found that the last few hours of the game made me almost hate this one.Should you buy it? No.But I want it, its only few bucks/euros. Still no, your time is more valuable than the money youre going to spend to this. And no point supporting this kind of work.
