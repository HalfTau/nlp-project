/! WARNING  THIS IS MORE OF A MEH RATING RATHER THAN A FULL APPROVAL /!At the time, I found Assassins Creed to be a somehow cool game. At first I felt immersed in the games world, and I liked the parkourtype of gameplay.But the issue is that the game gets very repetitive, very fast find a tower, climb it, explore the city, do some unvaried missions, kill your target, repeat.Overall, I found the game to be more boring than entertaining, and Im not afraid to say I played it mostly for the story rather than the gameplay itself.Rating 5.5/10  A good idea with an interesting scenario, but not varied enough to be played again. The sequel is better in every way and form.
