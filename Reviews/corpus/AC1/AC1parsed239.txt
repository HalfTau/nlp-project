This game isnt terrible, but I do have several points of criticism. First of all, the controls feel really awkward on a keyboard even with some customization. Second, the colors are kind of drab and the graphics somewhat dated even for 2007. Third, its hard for me not to think about the Uncharted games and how Id rather be playing them every time I hear Nolan Norths voice. Fourth, I did a little research into the overarching plot of the entire series, and I think it would have been better if it had stayed more grounded in realism two secret societies fighting for control throughout history is interesting enough, but mixing it with weird scififantasy stuff just takes it over the top for me. Fifth, I didnt want to become invested in a series that doesnt seem like it will ever end.
