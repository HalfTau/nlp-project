Assassins Creed is a game that got so much right, it paved a golden path for its awesome sequels but its one big flaw marred it enough that it falls short of gaming perfection and many have chided it for this.  That flaw was repetition for such a vast and beautiful recreation of the Holy Land and for the total awesomeness it is to be an Assassin, the variety of things to do available is meager in comparison.Overall, I highly recommend this game but more for the story than for the gameplay.  Finish the story all the way and then go play Assassins Creed II for both the story and the far superior gameplay and variety.  The production value on these games is so high, its worth it.
