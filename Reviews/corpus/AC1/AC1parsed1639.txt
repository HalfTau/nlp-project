Assassins Creed is one of my favorite game series  really nice gameplay, and something very rare in video games  a strong story with multiple levels of understanding. As it was the first episode, its not the best one gameplay is not perfect, but if you want to understand the whole story, you have to start here and be patient until the second episode to meet a really amazing game.
