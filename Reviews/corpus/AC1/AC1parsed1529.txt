I recommend this game, if you havent played any other games from the series on PC. At least I found the game quite frustrating, and it was a relief, when you see that future AC games just keep upgrading. Its a short game, but to understand the story in future games, you should really play it! So its recommended if youre new to the series, so when playing later games you can see how the game progresses!
