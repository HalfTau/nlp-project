As much as this game had potential to be good, it falls short in way too many areas for me to think its any more than a 6/10. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but theres nothing about this game that goes beyond good. For starters, the controls are unnecessarily complicated. The fact that it takes 2 buttons and WASD to sprint really proves that. The whole high profile low profile aspect of the controls really make the entire thing feel really clunky. This also leaks over into the combat, which I love in concept, but in execution eventually becomes hold down RMB and then spam LMB after theyre done attacking, at least until you get countering. After that, the combat becomes even more of a joke. Parkour doesnt feel satisfying in the slightest, really all you have to do is press W and RMB and press space when you plateau. All of this gets really repetitive fast with a storyline that reflects 2 boring AAA movies forced together , a main character that almost borders on shadow the hedgehog levels of edge and scifi elements that are completely uncalled for. I really wanted to likecrud, but if I want to play a good open world stealth game, id just play Sly Cooper 2 or 3 which does everything this game does better.6/10
