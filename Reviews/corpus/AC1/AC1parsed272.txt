I like this game so much. The starting point of a fantastic franchise. The gameplay is superb and the story, one you manage to decipher it, is pretty interesting. The whole world building gets better with every new chapter. Everything began with this tittle. Altair is an amazing character and the Assassins Brotherhood a concept to behold. The story arc is exciting, while the missions let you know and enjoy every city. The recreation of history is convincing. The enviroments are unique. Masterpiece 10/10
