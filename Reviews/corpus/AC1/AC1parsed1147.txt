The environments are beautiful. The music is pretty cool. I liked the story, although it was a bit slow and some of the lab scenes felt rather pointless in the end. I liked the main character quite a bit. It was a bit repetitive in some parts, and the final battle was not fun for me, but overall I enjoyed it very much.
