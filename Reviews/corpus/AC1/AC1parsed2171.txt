Found this game really enjoyable, although slightly repetitive at times. I enjoyed the story of Altar, and how he evolves as a person over the course of the game. I liked the adventure elements as well as the RPGish feel. My favourite thing was the free running on roof tops. A good place to start the Assassins Creed series.
