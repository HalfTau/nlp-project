The first in the series is also one of the roughest in the series, due to the amount of backtracking and lack of adequate fast travel. That said, Altair is one of the more interesting and mysterious characters in the series and its worth seeing his roots if you really enjoy the overall story.The present day story with Desmond is also essential to the following games, and the cryptic clues presented in the first title are some of the best in the series, IMO.If you want a solid foundation for the series or are just looking to pad out your collection to have all the games, the original Assassins Creed is still worth picking up.
