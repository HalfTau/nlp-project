Although I always wanted to play the Assassins Creed games, I didnt get a chance until recently. Totally glad I did. Im having a lot of fun. Sure, some of the graphics are a little dated now, but were state of the art when the game was originally released. Also, a controller is a must have, the keyboard/mouse combo is so difficult it makes the game nearly impossible. Cant wait to finish this game and start the next.
