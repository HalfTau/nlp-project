The first Assassins Creed game is a good start to a huge franchise and for the year of its release a remarkably well programmed game.Like every game it has got its Ups and Downs , but it is worth noting that it gave video games a totally new meaning. It also allows people with a less beefy computer e.g me to play a part of this franchise.
