I would rate this game 7.5/10, because the storyline is very fun overall, but there are some issues. The campaign can be boring or slow at times, as it gets repetitive, but its never a huge issue. My main problem with this game is that the PC port is terrible! I havent had any issues with crashes but there are constant glitches through the game, such as death during the leap of faith jumps, or enemies flying all over the place/off the screen when hit. My character has also experienced these glitches, flying all over the place when knocked down or othewise hit. Ive had to play through the final boss battle 3 times because of these issues. Also, the controls are a bit stupid, and dont always work as they should, with the wrong moves being carried out, enemy blocks missed, etc. Overall its a fun game but be prepared for some stupidity.
