This game is the first in the large and longed out series of AC games, in retrospect this game is lacking next to the sequels in terms of voice acting, gameplay, graphics, interface, visually, storyline although the storyline carries through the franchise.Ignoring this, the game on its own is rather fun, but nothing too special. Its freerunning mixed with its stealth and assassinations make it different to most other games and fun to play, especially as controlling these actions is rather fluid though a bit dodgy at times.There are a few problems with this game that mainly include its horribly boring cutscene style dialogs that go on for what feels like an eternity, and the games horrible colouring, it may have been an artistic decision to make it so grey and dark and gloomy but it makes it feel depressing and look grim.9/15  Salright. Sequels are better.
