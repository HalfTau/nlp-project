Running across rooftops shanking people is only so fun before the poor technical integrity, repetitive and formulaic levels, game dynamics that completely contradict the idea of stealth action, and surprisingly dull story become too much to endure and you quit halfway through.My advice Bypass this game and get Dishonored instead. Its everything Assassins Creed should have been, with none of the flaws.
