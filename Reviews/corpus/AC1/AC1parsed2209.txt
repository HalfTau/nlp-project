This game was alot of fun. I was warned that it was very repetitive, but after playing countless mmos I found it wasnt that bad. There are 10ish stages. In each stage you need to scope out the vantage points and rescue some villagers from guards harassing them. After that you have to help fellow assassins complete missions. This ends up being the real content of each stage. Kill, pickpocket, interogate, and travel around across each area sometimes with a timer.I had to cheat at the VERY end. Tricky having you use your assassin abilities while your not playing the assassin. Why you no run Desmond?If its on sale pick it up.
