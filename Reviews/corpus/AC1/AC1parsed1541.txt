The story was pretty interesting, but i was too frustrated with the game to actually enjoy it, the game was fun the first 2 hours, but when almost the entire game consists of doing the same thing over and over again, it gets pretty boring, and in preparation for the last mission, i was being so frustrated, that i almost punched my screen, i used well over an hour, running away from guards, that would start chasing me even though they had their backs turned when i tried to kill them, before i could even get started with the last missionMy conclusion i would have stopped playing if it wasnt for the story
