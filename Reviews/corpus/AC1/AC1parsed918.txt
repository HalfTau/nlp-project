Im sure everyone else has explained in detail what you can and cannot do so Ill just give my two cents. Assassins Creed 1 has a good basis with a good idea and graphics isnt bad either. Personally Im a sucker for assassination games like this and Hitman. I dont like that the game played through a 3rd party and feel that it should have had an official Steam release so you can get rewards and what not. The game has a rather bad ending but that obviously to keep one in suspense for Assassins Creed 2. I dont like that the things you collect in the game, namely the flags, is utterly useless with no rewards so for me a complete waste of time. Even though my review sounds all negative Im giving it a thumbs up. I like the story line, the gameplay is well thought out and the root of the game is nicely done I think. I usually dont blindly buy a game and knew what I was getting before I bought it. Id recommend it if people are going to play the series as its the point of origin, the start and the beginning. After this game you have an idea of whats to come.
