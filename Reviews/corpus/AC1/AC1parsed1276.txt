The start of the now longrunning Assassins Creed franchise, you are placed in the shoes of Altaiir, an assassin during the Crusades. This game possesses a very historicallycentric plot and the parkour gameplay foundation that the franchise, and many others, now use.First off, the gameplay has aged somewhat badly, particularly if youve played any other parkour movement games released since. The movement in this game is noticeably slower than its sequels, especially when climbing up the sides of towers and buildings. The combat, however, is both better and worse than that in the sequels. It is much simpler, not allowing nearly as many options in combat and can be very slow when fighting multiple opponents. On the plus side, it is more difficult than the newer Assassins Creed games, actually providing somewhat of a challenge in combat.Now, the real highlight of this game is the plot. While it may be told in a very weak way, with you doing the same things over and over in different locations and being rewarded with a monologue, it is a very thematically/morally strong plot. It addresses the nature of good and bad on a very deep level and if you enjoy philosophy or analyzing morality, you will love it. Its truly a shame that they dropped this plot strength in the later iterations of the game.Overall, Id recommend the game, as I feel it is still great fun, and the message is simply unforgettable.
