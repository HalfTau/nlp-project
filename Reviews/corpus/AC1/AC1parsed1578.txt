After completed it for the first time after years the first one was at release, heres my reviewAC is overall a great game, considering the time it was released.There are 2 main characters, in 2 different timeframes. Desmond Miles present day is captured by Abstergo Company and forced to relive the memories of his ancestor Altair Ibn LaAhad, through the Animus. Altair was a member of an Assassin Group in the Middle Ages. The game narrates Altairs life during the 3rd crusadeApprox. 20 hours, maybe moreCool sound effects that will satisfy everyone. Plus, pretty good soundtrack, hard to notice while playing, however.Great graphics/shaders/models, considering the fact that the game was released in 07Simple combat system, but still, the animations are awesomeAs a fan of history, a concept i enjoyed.Graphics not that great, with some potentional glitches.No replayabiliy. Few are the people who finished it more than once, most likely. It gets boring to do so.Concluding, totally worth buying. If you have no A.C. experience yet, start off here. Dont go straight on to the sequels, bypassing this. However, since you are probably not gonna complete it more than once, grab it on sale.8.0 / 10.01. Dont touch it even if its on the house 03 / 10.2. If you are bored of every other game 35 / 10.4. Must Have 910 / 10
