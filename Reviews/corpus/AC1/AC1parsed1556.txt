It took me a few tries before I actually played through Assassins Creed. I think my fourth attempt, I actually stuck with it.It does not have the most intuitive control scheme, which makes it difficult to approach. However, if you stick with it, you can become familiar, and start moving around the world more fluidly. It may be frustrating at first, and require a conscious effort to put in the time to learn to play this game, but it is ultimately worth it.For gameplay, it is most satisfying if you can remove targets without causing a commotion. Learning how to do this can be difficult, but is very rewarding once youve mastered this art. Sometimes the boss fights just turn into large brawls, which is unfortunate. The final stretch seemed to involve very little stealth, and was just a bunch of large sword fights.The gameplay can become reparative, but the developers threw in sidequests to break things up.The overarching story exists, but mostly youll be here for the momenttomoment gameplay.
