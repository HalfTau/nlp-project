TLDR Great story and medieval atmosphere, best style of graphics, missions are repeating and boring.Here it beggan. Very first instalment in famous series. But question is can it be still interesting after those years and the hoard of newer brothers. Sumprisingly it can.2 stories are combined  each depicting battle between templars and assassins. Of course, only very little is said about present future story of Desmond and his story is more developed in other games. Main is Altair story  full of autentic medieval atmosphere. That is for me main reason playing this game. Even graphics are somhow rough better then ACII fairy tale graphics, making it somehow realistic. Biggest downfall of this game is of course stereotype ... missions are except killer contracts really same and you will lost interest whyile doing third time that same thing again. Chasing, climbing, running, protecting, ... It will get boring.To summarize AC is great game for all medieval lovers and people who are interested in all aspects of AC story. But expect to be given often stereotype and boring missions.
