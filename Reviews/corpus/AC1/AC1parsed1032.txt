I like this game a lot! Always have. Good story, a few bugs with camera and movement, but over all a good game. The first time I played it was on playstation so I had to get used to the controls, but now I like to play it on PC. My opinion is if you like the other games and like the story, you need this part of the story too! !I just love Assassins Creed!
