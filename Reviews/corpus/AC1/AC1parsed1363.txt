Its a good game. Graphiks are still okay, the climbing part can be a bit frustrating from time to time  espacially the part were water is involved, because waterimidiate death and the fights are long and anoying after a time but the core gameplay is nice and solid. You can feel were all the good stuff, which made Assassins Creed 2 and so on to bestsellers, came from. Also in this game, there are less bugs than in AC Unity.Recommendet!
