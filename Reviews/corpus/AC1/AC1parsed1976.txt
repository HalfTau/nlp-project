This a good game. However it does get extremely repetitive. There are about 3 different gameplay elements that help you progress through the story, but this got very tedious and annoying. At times felt like I was forcing myself to play. But I did enjoy the story and thats what kept me going. If you have played the others, theres not need to play this, but only for the story. It should also be noted that I didnt play on PC but on PS3.
