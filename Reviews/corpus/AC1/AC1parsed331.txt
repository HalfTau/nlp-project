Ah, the ship that launched a hundred sequals, and the highly trained superassassin who cant swim. A great game for its time that opened up the modern openworld genre. Well worth a play and a must if you want to have all the details of the story. As will all Ubi games, it has major pc optimization issues, especially if you run a system with more than 4 cores. Before you even try to play it, set your compatibility mode and limit core affinity to 2 cores. Also, never got the dx10 version to work, always had missing world elements ie. objects were there, but no walls, floors, roofs, ect. Great game, poor pc port.
