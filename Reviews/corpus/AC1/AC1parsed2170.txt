Overall a fun, engaging game. Good graphics some nice, cinematic qualities during cutscenes and fight sequences, great sound and decent voice acting nice to see in a game and of course, good solid gameplay. You will need a gamepad to play you seriously cant do it without one, and the fighting is probably one of the best and most satisfying systems in a game. I wont lie this game made me rage hardcore at some points especially at the end, so do expect it toyou off. Otherwise, great!
