The game that started the AC franchise OO.Awesome game, and it will always have a legendary place in all of the AC gamers out there, it is however not without flaws, and though i probably gave this a 9 when i first played it ages ago, it simply is not a 9 when i replayed not that long ago on my AC maraton.So i guess its a 8.5 if that exists.It is however a MUST own and must play for those that are even slightly into Assassins Creed.
