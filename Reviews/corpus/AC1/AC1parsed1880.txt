Comparing this game to the other Assassins Creed games would not be fair but I am still gonna do it.The game starts good but the first thing I notice is that the voice acting seems a bit off.After awhile I got used to it but it was a bit annoying at first.The dialogue in the game is clever and interesting.I was more entertained by the dialogue than the actual gameplay.I was getting bored hacking and slashing through dozens of enemies and I was motivated to do so only because I wanted to hear the next part of the storyline.The gameplay itself is decent even compared to the other ACseven if the game is kinda old but it gets boring fast.Each time you get a new target you do the same thing over and over again9 times to be exact.My point is that they could have put more effort into diversification instead of doing the same exact thing for every new assassination.The sidequests are not fun and you will probably end up ignoring them after 23 hours of ingame play.Another thing that annoyed me was the lack of oneliners for the citiziens and guards.After some time you will start hearing the same exact thing from the citiziens and guards in all of the cities.I heard the following line  When he falls,Im not gonna help him like 200 times and it really got on my nerves.In the end I would like to say that the game has a good storyline and some dialogue that is definitely worth listening to.
