I bought assassins creed as part of a bundle 1,2,3, revelations, and brotherhood upon hearing good things about it from friends. I couldnt help but feel a little disappointed with the first one. Story was kind of dull, and many of the main missions felt repetitive and unfufilling. Setting changes from present to past through the Animus is a cool concept in theory, but I feel like the way they did it affected immersion. Side missions also feel like busywork, and after a while i stopped bothering. And dont even get me started on those flag collectibles. Skip this one and go straight to 2. 2 isnt devoid of its problems, but I feel its a better starting point for someone who wants to get into the series.
