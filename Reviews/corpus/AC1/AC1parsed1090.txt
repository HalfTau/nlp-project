I originally played this game in 2007 when my dad bought it for me and my sister on a whim for our Xbox 360. I remember being infinitely furious at this game at many points, and certainly having to take a good amount of breaks for how difficult certain parts of the game can get. However, I immediately bought this 8 years later upon seeing it on the Steam market, and heres whyThe furiousness built up in this game made it such a huge relief to actually complete that mission or find that flag/templar.Even though the whole game is summed up at the start of AC2, this game really teaches you a lot about Desmond, the Templars, and adds a depth to the whole series that you really cant get by skipping this game.Altair is a fing badass.The missions are repetitive which you already know if youve read ANY review of this game but the storyline makes all the extra time doing the same mission ten times in different cities worth it.There is a lot of bonus stuff and lore you can find in the modern day portions, which I think made the game much more enjoyable. I HATED not being able to leave the Animus in AC2 except for the specified sequences for, respectable, halfway through and the end.All in all, I give this game a solid 8/10. I would and probably will definitely play through this game at least two more times.
