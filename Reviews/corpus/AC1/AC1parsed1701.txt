You play a character who is playing a character in a virtual reality matrix like mind game which seems to have real world repercussions. Your player characters, player character exceeds expectations in killing and has a really boring side hobby for collecting flags, that do little to enhance the experience. Well I player through the entire game and still dont see the reason for getting these things. Your Player character themselves, exceeds in being able to sleep knowing they will soon be killed A difficult skill and they have a vision mode like the light csi use.You mainly play the player characters, player character which is an Assassin. The first 6 hours of the game repeats itself two more times. Sadly about halfway through you stop getting cool stuff to make this grind feel less like a grind. Would it have been too much to ask for a sword that was strong enough to occassionally snap enemies swords in half...The promise of being an assassin is not delivered as it is in games such as Hitman. If you instead think of yourself as a Knight/Ranger or at best Rogue things make a little more sense. Dont expect to be doing any of the following assassin tricks. Dripping poison into the mouth a deep sleeping target Poison capsules in the wine. Someone does poison wine, but it is not you Accidental or false flag death situations Wearing a disguise Hiding bodies Being able to sneak passed the guards of those you are seeking to assassinate without having to take them all head on.. Kind of like a Knight or a Ranger/RogueBall and all an interesting, but drawn out experience, that is drawn out even more by unskippable wordy monologues.You may feel uneasy about the content and religious context if you are impacted by such things, but dont worry, everyone on the team were from different backgrounds, and I believe the game is saying that if they put up with it... So should you.
