It has some pretty major flaws, but I do still like it in spite of them. The freerunning system was fantastic for its time, but the combat can get pretty monotonous as you wait for an enemy to attack. So much of the game involves doing random tasks for tiny bits of information about your target, so I would recommend doing the bare minimum required to unlock the assassination rather than repeating the tasks which youll be doing anyway even more times.Unfortunately the game especially doesnt hold up next to its sequels, so if youre put off by the sound of this, Id still recommend picking up AC2. Its a lot smoother and with less repetition.
