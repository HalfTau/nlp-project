Being the first of this awesome series, its totally worth playing.The game itself has some things that displeases me, such as the fact it is really repetitious and has some unnecessary cutscenes after half of the game, checking Eagle Points and listening to the rescued citizens become very annoying.But besides these bad things IMO, the plot, the scenario and everything related to the story itself are more than satisfactory. Not only Ezios story, but also Mr. Miles, since there are some extra actions that can be done outside the Animus.The fights, limited at the beggining of the game, become more challenging near its end, with some boss fights that are kinda enjoyable.Good game, great saga, highly recommended.
