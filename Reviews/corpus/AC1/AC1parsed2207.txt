I remember back in 1789... I walked the streets of paris and as I looked to my left, stutter, stuttering everywhere, the french people couldnt speak out, cowards. I jumped from roof to roof with hearing crashes below me. Horses screaming, peasants and the rich burning, but what I will never forget was the face of horror that I saw that day. Floating eyes and a mouth missing, yet the thing could talk and it spoke british all of a sudden. I was unprepared, but the worst thing I had to face before the revolution came to an end, was that I only had 1 core in my groin to run and I was out on DrawCalls. I noticed I began to stutter and felt like there was no ground underneath me, One step further I noticed, I flew off the roof, landed inside a haywagon. All fine? I crashed afterall. No, I never woke up again. Blackscreen. Death. Everybody in agony. It had to stop. I had to stop....Oops wrong game.
