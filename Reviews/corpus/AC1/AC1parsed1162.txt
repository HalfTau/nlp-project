Assassin creed PC at first glance is beautiful and the main character one of the coolest looking. Assassin creed is fun with its unique fighting style, art work, mechanics. BUT it has its flaws from not properly saving to clunky jumping, lack of weapons, attack animations, and terrible repetitive gameplay forcing you to find and do boring things like climbing tall towers, pick pocketing that seems so bland and useless, than you realize everything is copy and pasted. The story feels awkward, with no immersion everything you do in the game you do in the first coupe of hours.The game sometimes forgets weather you want to jump down or go up and bugs out  on some of the simplest climbing movements. Some games didnt save properly, and some broken missions caused me to restart several times.Also 4 a Assassin game, no stealth is ever needed for the main missions whats up with that?The dialogue beside the main assassinations are all repeats just like the buildings, gets old pretty quick.I can see why people like this creed, I do not.I like the concept of the game, like most it failed horribly at keeping me entertained.
