I just finished my second playthrough of this game, my first being shortly after it came out. I stand by my opinion that this is a great game that is well worth playing.First, the games flaw and there is only one major flaw the missions are unashamedly repetitive. If dont mind that, or mitigate it by performing only one or two assassinations per evening, then the game should be very enjoyable. If this is likely to be a huge issue for you, perhaps skip ahead to ACII instead, which has almost all the great elements of this game but with much more varied missions. AC has no gamebreaking bugs for me, but minor bugs include bodies occasionally flipping through the air.Now for the reasons to playThe voice acting varies in quality, but it is generally high with the notable exception of Altair, unfortunately.Some people dislike the way you can fall of ledges when jumping to them while this can be an issue in the early part of the game, once you relearn how to grab onto ledges it becomes simply an additional skill the game requires, making free running a little more challenging if you want to avoid falling to the ground.Overall, I strongly recommend this game as highly enjoyable stealth action game with a great story.
