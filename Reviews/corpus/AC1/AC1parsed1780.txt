Horrible story, good graphics, boring repetitive gameplay. Nope.Seriously, I got about half way through the game and realized, this is awful. This story is just some done to death templar nonsense. The gameplay is just a bunch of QTEs. The voice acting is totally removes you from any ambiance the game is trying to create.I Really, REALLY wish i hadnt spent money on this game.
