good for its day. The work around to make it playable in windows 7 is gone thnaks to the quality roll ups.  Microsoft yet again kills a good game and leaves you in customer service infinite loop of EA blaming them and them blaming EA.  I posted a fix awhile back in the forums but it can no longer be done in WIndows 7.  Get VMWare player and emulate Windows XP to get it to work, Good luck,
