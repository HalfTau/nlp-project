If you take your time with this one, it can definitely be enjoying. This game has one of the better stories in the franchise and the graphics hold up better than AC2. Sadly, the common complaint about repetitive gameplay is true. This is why I recommend taking a break after eacht target, or limit them to one per day. This way the repetition doesnt get to you as much. It is a real shame that a lot of people get drustrated with AC1, because the assassinsation missions are the best in the franchise. This is the only game where you have absolute freedom in those missions and it is up to you to formulate a plan using the intel you gathered. It is not until Unity where they go back to a similar style, and even then they guide you through it if you want to.Also you probably want to play this one first anyway because every other game improves on this one and going back might be way more painful than playing this one first knowing it gets better.
