This game is unplayable for the most part due to crashes Win 7. Ive tried all the fixes, and all the usual nonsense, and Im lucky to get 30 minutes of continuous gameplay before it crashes. Given that its a typical PC port, getting in and out of this game and bypassing cut scenes makes the scenario of it crashing unbearable.Fixes/nonsense tried DX10 Vista compatibility mode   Didnt fix crashing. Normal DX9/DX10  Didnt fix crashing. acii360wireless driver fix   This did fix the controller mapping, imagine it will for AC II as well. All fixes tried with disabling multiple displays   Didnt fix crashing.If you really want to play this game, Id suggest snagging it on console if you have that luxury. Steam should refund anyone who has experienced the level of crashing/nonsense associated with this game.
