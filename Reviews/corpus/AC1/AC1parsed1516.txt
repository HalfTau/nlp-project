Assassins Creed is a cool game, no doubt.Its just that it might delete your saves! That happened to me two times! After the second time I didnt want to do it all again. After the first time I thought Id give the game another try but it disappointed me.I really would have liked to complete the game however its not possible without starting again and again.Moreover, its quite frustrating to have to start again and so I dont recommend buying this game.It is fun, it is cool but its not possible to complete the game without becoming frustrated.
