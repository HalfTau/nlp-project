No wonder the series is such a commercial success without experience yet of its sequels, the abilities, modes and challenges are encapturing and stunning even at the beninning of the seires. In playing the game you are given the task of fighting the enemy from the ground and rooftops, evading the city guard and for the sake of it roaming and purging anyone you see fit. What a game for its money alongside a level system ideal for its sandbox agenda, its a oneofakind starter that distunguishes itself from any genre of actionadventure stealth games that fall between the boarders of Hitman and Crysis not surprising, therefore, that the Assassins Creed empire has spread so easily.
