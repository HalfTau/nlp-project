A very old game with fun gameplay and very difficult controls. The missions and the environment are interesting, i found myself staring at cities and landscapes quite often. The two interchanging stories Desmund and Altiar add to the game and gives a bit of the complex lore too.The combat is challenging, taking some practise and control tinkering to get used to, the two stances make things difficul wich later games dont configure wich means you have to get used to it.One bad thing, once you complete a memory block, you cannot continue playing then choose to go to the next, it forces you to so you cant complete secondary objectives if you missed any wich i found quite annoying when i realised it.
