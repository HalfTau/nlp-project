One of the most overrated games Ive ever played.Parkour is constantly bumbling about. Controls are a mess and unresponsive. Takes Altair like 3 seconds to animate the run motion.So youre a master assasin right? You cant counter until after your first mission. And you dont learn how to DODGE until like 1/2 through the game. ridiculous. Ok so the bureau wants you to be a proper asssassin. So teach me by forcing mini tutorials instead of unlocking ESSENTIAL moves halfway through the game.If Im an assassin, I expect to be stealthy. Dont be fooled. You CANNOT stealth assassinate any of the targets so far. Im about half through the game at this point.No ledge kills. No whiste attract. No throwingto distract. WTF. This is NOT a stealth game.The game barely qualifies as entertainemnt. Its just a parkout simulator with some terrible combat thrown in. Im literally going to do the minimum from now. This extra intel just isnt compelling and helps very little with the targets.Shadow of Mordor is a FAR better game.After writing this review, I just got more SoIm uninstalling.
