I played this on my 360, just to refresh my memory i played it again. Only this time i did not care for the flags in it or the templars. Graphically the game looks amazing. At the time the game was revolutionary. Story wise was also compelling. The one down fall of the game was the gameplay. Its very repititve. You do the same type of investigating etc etc over and over and over. It might be for a different person you are going to kill but its the same.. Once you need to assassinate your target ALMOST nothing you do different will cause you to fail unlike 2. Which is basically sandbox style which basically i kind of like because you can go in guns blazing or try and do it stealth. Now i only played 1 again to get the story of it. Definitely was worth what i paid which was about 5 or less.
