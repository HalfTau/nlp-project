Its a Little late for a review of this awesome classic. in short ITS A MUST HAVE, be sure to grab it on a flash sale, not because it is expensive but because it is part of special discounts very often.As for the game, this is the directors cut edition which includes more variety on the sidemissions, thankfully that breaks the monotony of the original release.Be warned that the combat system its fun but frustating, recommend to keep gaming sessions short or you will break a controller out of frustation.To answer some common questions1. There is NO steam cloud, you can find your saved games in CUsersUSERNAMEAppDataRoamingUbisoft2. There are NO achievements or trading cards3. There is no benefit on finding all the collectibles, just bragging rights4. There is no hidden ending5. You can use your 360 controller without any additional config6. The runs fine on Win 7 X64 cant say for the other OSHappy gaming!
