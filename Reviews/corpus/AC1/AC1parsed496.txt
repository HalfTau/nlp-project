I believe this game is fun overall, there are buts thow. The free running and combat can be slow and becoming very boring and annoying. The sideactivities become slightly repetive but enjoyable all the same. The main story is excellent, being able to play as an assassin during the crusades is awesome and also a bit educational. This game may have its ups and downs but i highly recommend you play or at least give it a try.
