Assassins Creed is something of a classic, the beginning of one of the biggest series of all time. While the original AC had was a very fun game, it definitely had some flaws. It was a transitional game, trying to move the parkour of Prince of Persia into a world of stealth like Tenchu or Splinter Cell, and was definitely still growing through its awkward phase. The game feels very slow at times and pickpocketing missions are tedious to say the least. Some missions feel forced or dont make sense, and some of the stealth/alert mechanics really didnt work.  The combat is shockingly easy counter kills all around!Its definitely worth playing for its gripping story and the combination of stealth and parkour action. Its a masterpiece in spite of its shortcomings. While the sequels have been getting progressively better, this is where it all started and is definitely worth a play through for fans of the series.
