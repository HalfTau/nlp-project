Played it and finish it heres my thoughtsGoodVisuals, looks pretty good, environments are quite expansive and quite immersiveOKGameplay, its not bad but can be extremely frustrating.  Im thinking this made to be played with a gamepad rather than mouse and keyboard.  Can get stuck with character doing everything other than what you want him to, but is also at times quite intuitive and its not really a controller skills game like Tomb raider used to be.The missions tend to be quite repetitive, each target has a set of optional submissions to do first, well all those submissions are the same.As the player its your job to complete the mission in between the stories, its not a RPGStory is ok, No spoilers some of the key elements I thought were quite apparent right from the start,Not goodNot being able to skip scenes,Lots of slow bits,Saving is weird, not sure how it worked but you cant save where you want as far as i know and considering you cant skip scenes it makes it all a bit painful.Id give game  3/5, just a bit slow, character development a bit week but nice scenery  pretty cool jumping the roof tops of old Jerusalem
