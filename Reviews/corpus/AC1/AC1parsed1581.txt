Hey! Im gonna write a short review about this, okey game...So, you start off by meeting Desmond, that has been captured by the templars. He goes into a machine called the animus to relive his ancestors memories. This is when you start the game for real. You directly jump into a very interesting character called Altair. Hes an assassins during the 11th century. Hes in the middle of a war between the templars and the assassins. So, your mission starts directly, and you get it from his master Al Mualim. Your task is to setoff to the biggest cities around Isreal example of a city is Jerusalem and murder 9 different templars. This is where the most boring missions you will ever come across. You need to go on to a viewpoint to find investigations from where you get the info about your target and then assassinate the target. This is going to be for all the 9 templar masters. But, the story do get very interesting, and you need to play this game to understand the sequels. Please dont understand me wrong, its a fun game, but do gets repetitive quickly...This is a game you should only buy on sale, where the price can drop to 2.49 euros.My score is 7/10
