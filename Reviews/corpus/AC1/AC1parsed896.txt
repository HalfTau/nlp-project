I only recommend this game if you have an interest in playing all the games through, because on its own this is a pretty terrible game. The quests are repetitive, glitches are numerous, combat is worse than Arkham Asylums, and the story has some cool twists but is altogether predictable. The voice acting is also horrendous, something that doesnt seem to improve for a few Assassins Creed games, and nothing takes you out of a game faster than bad voice actors.But being a decentlyoriginal game idea when it was released and probably the best of its time, its hard to argue that playing it isnt worth it especially if youre interested in the series. The graphics also hold up pretty well to today, and in some instances I believe the graphics are better than in Assassins Creed II, but besides that its a 18 hour journey or shorter if it doesnt keep crashing thats worth it for Assassins Creed fans.
