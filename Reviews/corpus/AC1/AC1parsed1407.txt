The biggest problem here is that it gets repetitive. Repetitive quests, traversal, combat. Thankfully combat changes with new abilities, with experience of the player, with difficulty of enemies. Moving through the world doesnt, and has some problems, but otherwise is a lot of fun. That leaves the story progress which sadly isnt very interesting. The story is cool, the method to get to it is not. And I can not imagine collecting all those flags. Pure insanity D. So this one is a bit grindy. Not exactly how I like action adventure games.As for the look of the game, its all very pretty .And why does quitting the game need to take so many screens and button presses? PAnyway, the first Assassins Creed is a fine game. Certainly makes me want to continue the saga. Its my first AC so cant compare to the others. Good enough start this is.
