Assassins Creed is a rather enjoyable game. It has a pretty cool concept, the story is quite alright and freerunning from rooftop to rooftop is extremely fun. You really feel like a skilled assassin when you are playing the game, at least for the most part. It gets harder and harder towards the end to dodge enemies and to make sure youre not discovered, but thats to be expected. You need to plan accordingly at times. The story takes place in an interesting era and is quite intriguing but sadly a bit forgettable.The combat apart from the assassinations is somewhat clunky and you can tell that its a console port. You can play the game with keyboard and mouse but I recommend that you play with a controller if you have one since its obvious it is meant to be played with one. I had a lot of fun with the game when it wasnt feeling repetitive. Climbing up to the view points was really fun and a few of them was a little bit challenging, too. I found myself enjoying climbing and exploring more than the combat itself.The visuals are stunning. The game is rather bright and takes place during daytime which is a bit odd for a stealth assassin game. The way Altar moves is also done extremely well, his movements are very smooth. As a nice treat Nolan North is the voice of Desmond Miles  and you cant go wrong with that!A few negative things Apart from being a console port with somewhat clunky combat, the game can get rather repetitive, especially towards the end. It also lacks subtitles which is crucial for many. Sometimes I had trouble hearing what was said in the game due to the background sounds. This is something to consider if youre like me and prefer to have subtitles. But all in all its a nice game despite its flaws. Its a good game to start off a franchise with.
