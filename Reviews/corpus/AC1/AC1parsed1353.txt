While not as refined as latest games in the franchise, Assassins Creed manages very well to deliver a good amount of action and stealthiness Unfortunately, something that is getting behind in latest AC games, our hero is Altar, an assassin, loyal to the order and master assassin at a young age, who carries out the assassinations ordered by his mentor. 1191 is the time, the Third Crusade is devastating the land and we have 9 targets to terminate, as well as to find a rare artifact capable of magical powers.During the game we will have to learn all sort of abilities that will help us fight the enemy and avoid danger by using stealth skills, though, this is one of the games main characteristics, sometimes it feels painful to learn or they just dont feel satisfying. The game tends to suffer from a serious case of, but in the end, once you manage to learn all the skills and keys that do x movement, you will be ok. On AC, its the first time we face tail missions, something that feels really good here, but that due to its repetitiveness felt annoying on the next AC games. Even the stealthy missions were cool and delivered a good result in the end.Also, a positive point of the game is its locations and historical events occurring while we carry out our assassinations. All cities and the Holy Land are depicted in good manner and you feel the tension between the two important religions there, another point in favor are the historical characters involved in the conspiracies and actions we see and hear of during our missions.Maybe something I already feel sick of  are the collectibles. There are hundreds of them all over the places we visit, the good thing is we are not forced to collect them, but still manages to distract me, this is because they appear in every AC game! I hope they get rid of them once and for all.Updated While replaying AC once again, I started paying attention to the camera angles and movements, firstly, the camera is really jerky and awkward preventing me from continuing my journey after liberating civilians or helping people in distress, this happened everytime I acted this way making the fluidity of the game a terrible experience at times.On a side note, kudos for an almost bug free game, I barely met any glitches around, something I am grateful for!I totally recommend this game for people that feel hesitant whether they should pick this game or that want to try the franchise, it is a fun, kind of a repetitive game, but that delivers an interesting concept about history, religion and characters and of course an appealing fictional storyline.
