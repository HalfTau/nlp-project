Alright...its time I reviewed.Let me just right off the bat say that truly the only reason to buy any videogame is to help support the artist who struggled to make it and, well, to get some entertainment in the form of a nonalcoholic beverage. And thats exactly what Assassins Creed does...for like two hours.So heres my issue its way too freaking repetitive. You meet up with Al Mualim hope I spelled that right, your boss, get berated, get a mission, complete one of many repetitive tasks such as jumping off buildings and saving insanely helpless citizens in order to even be able to DO the mission, then you do the mission and head back to Al Mualim to start the process all over again. Seriously. You do it so many times you easily accumulate over ten hours even if you speedrush.Yahweh, Allah, and God Im just as unfocused and ADHD as the next guy so how the hell was this game so popular? !Well, Ive come to a few conclusions which I will highlight as the positives of this game1. Its historically accurate2. Graphics are great. Still hold up after more than a decade3. Has an interesting premise which is hard to get to because there are so many mundane and repetitive objectives that get in the way4. Very diverse. Represents many cultures5. Offers two sides of an argument thats been going on for thousands of years6. You get to be a motherloving assassin or at least I hope Altair loves his motherIts for these reasons that I believe the Assassins Creed franchise has prospered, and I hope to see improvements in the next game that I play, which will most likely be the second one...I just hope I can be bothered.
