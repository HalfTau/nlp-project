Assassins Creed 1 is the starting game for the franchise Assassins Creed. You play from 2 view points, The modern world where you control Desmond Miles. And in 1191 In the Holy Land where you play as Altair ibn la ahad. The gameplay, and story is very addicting and fun. The fact that you get to murder people where ever you go, and you have side missions, or objectives you get to do throughout the game is awesome. The controls feel very good, and the graphics were good for its time back when it was first released, For any begginers that want to play this game, you may have to sit down for a little and get really comfterable with the controls and becoming aware of your surroundings. Any veterans that have played other Assassins Creed except this one, you may become frustrated with what they give you in this game, but otherwise you might really enjoy this game. Except for a few thing which is the repetitive gameplay that is in this game. I dont mind it, but after a while you really wished there was more things to do. Oh and the informer challenege can  right off. I would recommend this game to begginers wanting to get into the assassins creed franchise and want to start from the beggining, but for some veteran assassin creed players, it may seem boring because of its repetitive investigation.8.5/10  Fun as  but some boring repetitive gameplay
