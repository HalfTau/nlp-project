After 14.1 hours of this game I must say it gets really repetative so keep that in mind before buying this product.Assassins Creed was a really fun game, if youve played any of the other games you know the basics, run around, climb, assassinate the templars, etc. This game started what is now a great series, and one that will remain in my mind forever, and if not that a very long time. The games story is in my opinion deep, and at times relatable. The free run system could use some work it has gotten work in later games and the climbing was somewhat stable however you could not climb ledges that you would be able to in later games. Overall I recommend this game to fans of the series, but if youre new to it, I would start with Assassins Creed II Italy or III Boston You dont have to play them in order
