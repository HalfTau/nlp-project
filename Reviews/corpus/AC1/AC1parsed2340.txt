The game that launched the massive franchise.While many will say that this title is skippable for new players due to its reptative gameplay I would say that you should consider picking it up to give you a basis for the world of Assassins Creed and understanding the story of Altar.Keep in mind the game is quite a few years old now and that is something that impacts the gameplay and amount of loading screens but it is my personal opinion that it is a damn good game and a proper introduction to the franchise. If you plan to go all the way though the Assassins Creed games and you should since AC 2 and Botherhood are absolute gems you should gather what lore you can because in the end youll need it to make heads or tails of this games universe.
