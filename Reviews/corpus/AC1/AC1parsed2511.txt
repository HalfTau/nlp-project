Excellent game. Dont let the usual reviews talking about how the game is repetitive and boring dissuade you from buying the game  its absolutely fantastic. Gorgeous visuals Wide open spaces, massive detailed cities, lots of NPCs in one city at the same time, ..., excellent gameplay, and an intuitive and extremely interesting set of control schemes.
