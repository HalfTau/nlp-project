Hello guys Ive just finished the game and would like to give a quick review! So lets start!Story The story is a bit linear but the dialogs are sometimes very good!Gameplay One thing which completly made me crazy was the climbing/freerun in this game because sometimes its just completly buggy But its an older game so I guess we have to accept itGraphics Are very good for its time!Atmosphere The cities are very crouded but there are not lot of options to interact with the people!Fighting The fightingsystem is very good and sometimes also a bit challenging!So to sum it up I would just recommend this for people who are real assasinscreedfans and people who would like to now how the whole series starts but for that I think it would be enough to watch a 5min video on youtube!
