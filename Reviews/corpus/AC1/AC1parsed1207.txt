A pretty crumby console port, to be honest. Even if you can set aside the genetic timetravel nonsense, I found the controls and freerunning to be much too buggy and inconsistent for me, plus the clunky combat and avoidance mechanics were a pain. I say skip this one and instead pickup Shadows of Mordor, the Batman Arkham games, or even some of the better AC offerings.
