This game marked the start of an excellent new intellectual property in a era when originality in the entertainment industry is sorely lacking. These days it seems two out of three movies coming out are either sequels or remakes. Id avoided spoilers before playing it so I was completely unprepared for the entire Desmond half of the story. The gameplay fulfilled my expectations but the story was so much more than what I had expected. From the trailers Id seen I thought this would be a game in which I played an assassin taking out some Templar knights organization. But the whole Apple of Eden and the Animus? Didnt see any of that coming.My biggest gripe is that 100 completion synchronization doesnt unlock any extras of any kind, and Im not talking about an Achievement. I had hoped some kind of movie, or maybe some answered would unlock but really you dont get anything at all.My second gripe is that this game is really simple/easy. The gameplay is basically a vehicle for the story. Theres really nothing wrong with that, per se, but each chapter/target of the game plays out identical to the last so it can get repetitive. And as for easyness? There was one time, just one time, in the entire game where I got stuck. It was when i was trying to get the flag on the tallest building in the game, I dont remember which city. As I made the climb I got stuck midway, I couldnt spot a suitable handhold. Just before I started to backtrack I literally thought to myself, This game is really easy. Theres no way Id come this far up and have to backtrack for any reason. I hit the keys to make a jump across a gap onto a wall that didnt look like it had any handholds and, lo!, Altair made the jump and grabbed the wall.
