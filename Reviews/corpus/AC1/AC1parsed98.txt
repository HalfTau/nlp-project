You jump around, kill a lot of people and the visuals are beautiful. It gets kind of repetitive but is a great experience, conveyed through a strong storytelling. 10/10, one of my favourite games, Altair is quite a dull character, but is the original assassin, so I let it slid. This gem is 10 years old and still fantastic, definitely recommend it. Im gonna play all the other games, including Unity now, it is so much fun. Gets you started to what is to come in the franchise, a must play overall
