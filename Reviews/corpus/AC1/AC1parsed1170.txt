Interesting title. Altairs story in the past is quite interesting, but the Desmonds story in the present works more like a backstory than anything else, works fine with other titles in the franchise, but is meaningless by itself. Altair as a character is... strange a little, but he turns from an unlikeable dummy to quite likeable merciless killer! Yeah, I did just say that, likeable merciless killer, thats jut how it is. The game has its key standing in the franchise and goes really well especially with Ezios trilogy, which is, by the way, following right after this, neat!.Assassins Creed is recommended by just 1 out of 10 templars, but dont worry, that guy was a traitor and the others.. well, they didnt make it, the hidden blade is damn sharp.
