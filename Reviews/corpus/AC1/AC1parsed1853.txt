I would recommend this game. Greeat original storyline that is well developed and leaves a wide opening for the sequels. My only issue with the game is that it is VERY linear, for example travel to city, find information on a guy, fight a lot of bad guys, kill the leader, and repeat. Im looking forward to playing the sequels and hope that they can provide extra tangents to this open story and have some mor fun and interesting tasks to accomplish in more diverse locations.
