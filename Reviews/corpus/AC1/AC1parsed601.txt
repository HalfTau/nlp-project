An absolutely fantastic, one of a kind, unique game... if you play it with HUD turned off. I explain it in detail hereBut the short gist of it, AC1 was clearly designed to be played without a HUD except some of the missions that were added in the PC version, they didnt take HUDless design into account, and it provides a whole different experience. As an example, youre not going to an eavesdrop icon to listen to a minute of conversation and thats it, mission done. Youre going to the Jewish Quarter because thats where the Rafiq told you there might be information, and you find the Jewish Quarter by seeing in the distance the Star of David on a gateway, while youre on the rooftop, and then you explore and use your Eagle Vision to see who knows something.As soon as the HUD is introduced, a lot of this is lost, and the cyclic nature of the game is seen which is why a lot of people call the game repetitive, because HUD makes the cyclic nature obvious, but without it you NEED it to learn patterns and to investigate whats out of the pattern.Even if youve played and like the game already, but have never played it with HUD fully off... do it. It wont be a perfect HUDless experience on PC mainly because, as I mentioned, new PC missions dont take HUDless design into account, but you can ignore those because not every mission is required for game completion, but it will still be great and unique.
