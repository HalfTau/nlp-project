This game is great no matter how many times you revisit it. The copious amounts of collectables didnt really hold any value to me nor my gameplay but its a little nice minigame I suppose, however Im not going to go out of my way to really collect a ton of flags for no real value in return.Aside from that the atmosphere each city gives you as you enter gives a very real experience of a living breathing city its just fantastic. I do love the whole secrecy of the assassin brotherhood and templar factions where you dig through each memory dechiphering whats really going on behind the scenes through each leaders motives, its excellent and gives you that sence of abundance of knowledge where you want to strive for more.Still one of my favourite Assassins Creed games by far, you were such an important role to the brotherhood only to be stripped and having to work your way back up again learning so much in the process.The game has aged well for its time and so has the controls, the climbing mechanics are timeless and still work well even with the occasional bug here and there eg. leap of faith into hay when the hay turns hard and kills you lmao.Soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is amazing, love the Access the Animus track especially in those fight scenes.I may have 11 hours but it comes from experience from playing it on 360.The only real big problem with playing this on Steam is the controllers arent compatible at all with this game, you need to search the Steam Community guides to apply a fix manually in the folders of your game which isnt hard to do but its just still a small hassle to go out and actively do it when it shouldnt need to be.9/10 game.
