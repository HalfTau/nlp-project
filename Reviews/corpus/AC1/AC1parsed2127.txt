The first Assassins Creed is by far THE BEST in the series, followed shortly by Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, which brought a lot of replayability and multiplayer community fun to the table.In this game, hear hear, you ACTUALLY ASSASSINATE PEOPLE.You literally go from town to town, get information on your victim, get a permission from the assassins to go on your assassinations, like ASSASSINS DO I KNOW RIGHT SO SHOCKING, and then you KILL THE GUY. AND HE TELLS YOU STUFF WHILE ON THE GROUND, BEFORE DYING, LIKE PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY GET ASSASSINATED.And youre actually HOLDING him on the ground, whispering the discussion, not walking around screaming while hes on the ground bleeding COUGH COUGH  COUGH COUGHWOW SUCH SHOCK.And the story is an actual story that makes sense, has depth to it and makes you try and understand whats going on, question your morals, make you learn lessons that are valuably taught by Al Mualim your master in game and overall leave you with a Woooooahhhhh every 3 seconds. An amazing experience.But Galex, you might say, I WANNA BUY A BANK LOLWELL MY FRIEND, GO BUY A FREAKING BANK SIMULATOR, THIS IS      ASSASSINS         CREED. EMPHASIS ON ASSASSINS.TL DR The only game in the series where youre actually assassinating people while on a mission from an assassin organization, no BUYING BANKS, no RANDOM SIDE MISSIONS ABOUT WHATEVER, an AMAZING story and an amazing concept that got finally one upd only by AC IV. A must play.
