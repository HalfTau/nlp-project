The game that started the whole series. The gameplay itself needed a huge improvement but the storyline and soundtrack make up for it.Its a great game. The only problem I had was that it got boring with the same senarios and actions over and over again.I bought it for the story because Im a huge storyrich game fan.But for the year it was released, its a pretty decent game.I recommend this.
