pretty good game, its got good combatat least when you get later on in the game and actually get more ways to kill, good stealth the stealth really isnt a big precept so fighting is really the main way to get assassinations doneprops if you did get any of the main assassinations on stealth kills though, and finally it has a great storythere are some hidden campaign facets and such and though this game starts slow i guarentee you willbe addicted by about the 5th assassination.
