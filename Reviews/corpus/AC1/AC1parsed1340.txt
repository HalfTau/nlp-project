To be perfectly honest, I enjoyed half of this game.Then I dropped it.Then tried again. And dropped it again.Then I played Assassins Creed 2, fell in love and got back to this one. Finished it, but it still was a pain in the Its repetative as hell, and the plot is there somewhere, but it often gets lost in the midst of the stuff that you do over and over again.If only youre not the kind of person that would try to do every single sidequest and collect all possible collectables  its nice. If you however are such a person like me you either need to give up on it, or prepare for pain, boredom and frustration.Still overall Parkourlike movement system although unrealistic, all hail the leap of faith You are a friggin assassin, how much cooler can it get? Great story once you get to play second part and it all starts to make sense Great design of cities, based on actual historical data Intro to a great series that only gets better in time Repetitive as hell Plot sometimes gets lost, as its hard to catch what is important and what you have heard 20 times already. Fights can get boring as 90 of them you can win with two buttons, no matter how many enemies there are.To sum up I did it. Wouldnt do it again, but I do not regret it either
