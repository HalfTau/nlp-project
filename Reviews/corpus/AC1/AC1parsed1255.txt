First Assassins Creed game I played and... Im glad I did.I read the book first so I knew the story before playing it, damn. I love Altair. ihugege 3I wont talk about the story, you can read the game description.Graphics Good Id say for a game that already has 7 years if Im not mistaken, I loved the animations during the synchronizations, well done. You can judge it yourself with playthroughs or trailers if you dont want any spoil.OST Didnt enjoy all of them, but it probably just suits the game as it should, the best one for me was Acre, the others are still good tho.Gameplay Ruuuunnn, climmmmbb, juuuuummp, that part was so much fun. Sometimes I was just wandering from place to place without any reasons because I enjoyed doing so. As for combat, you have 4 differents weapons depending on how you like to play. I loved sneaking in and using the hidden blade. You also get to learn new techniques like counter hehe so it helps you to fight faster and easier.Overall I loved it and that end !!! Altair is the best assassin for sure, he evolves so much through the game.This is my opinion, now play and GET YOUR OWN, you probably wont regret it anyway.
