Great game! You run around a BIG world killing people, some of who seem deserve it, but stabbing, slicing or throwing knives at them. As you play you skill list increases until you reach a virtual god level of invicability.Even though its a little old now it still looks pretty damn good. I woudl say, after a whiel it does feel a little rinse and repeat, but pretty much all open world games do. There are also minor bugs that can bee kind of annoying I talking about that stupid climb a pebble when you need to running fool, but nothing that is really detrimental.It has a really fun parkour thing going on that makes you feel like you are being pretty damn awesome when infact you are really just pressing one button. Plus, when you get the counter skills you really can get a lot of fun out this game. This was infact the 3rd time Ive played it and still enjoyed.
