This is the first time I play this game. Ive never been into to the whole Assassins Creed hype.While the missions are silly and repetitive, even after 5 years, the game looks beautiful and the game mechanics are solid, the controls are tight. Combats engaging and never gets old.A fine game, one that made me a fan of the franchise.  5 years after its release...
