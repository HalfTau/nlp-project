Where it all began. Honestly its a very good, genredefining game, if a bit repetitive. The gameplay can get quite tiresome towards the middle stages of the game but its not THAT monotonous as some make it out to be. The storyline is, in my opinion, among the most interesting from any AC game and it served as the basis for many of the games that were to come. I would not say its a mandatory title in the franchise, but a strongly recommended one. After all these years, its aged more than well.
