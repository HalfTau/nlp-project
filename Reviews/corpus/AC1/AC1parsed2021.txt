Brilliant game in general. You will need 15 to 20 hours to finish the stroy, but more than 25 if you wish to complete all the tasks. The story is well directed, which is no doubt, and combined history with fantasy. AC also presents the remarkable remake of three legendary cities in human history, Damascus, Acre, and Jerusalem. Combat system is not that impressive, maybe among the middle of all action games. Also the missions you receive are just like repeating themselves, which make the game a little bit linear. Dont get too serious with the way you fight in the game. After all fighting is not the heart of AC. Story, legend, and medieval world, these are the elements make AC a classic. These are sensational.
