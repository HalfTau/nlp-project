Assassins Creed is a decent game. The game brings a good story and interesting mechanics/concepts along with it. The game has a good story that in itself is reason enough to play. The game falls short in its variation and some elements of the gameplay.The story is interesting and builds up to a semiexpected conclusion. This does not ruin the game though because there is still plenty left unexplained as to the future of where the series will take you and what your actions really mean for the world going forward. The story kept me engaged and interested throughout.The actual gameplay is where this game does not shine. Yes, there are some interesting and fun mechanics. The combat system works well, although counters  godmode. The game becomes too easy. You can easily fight a mob of 20 guards and never lose any health.  The game falls flat in terms of its variation. The bulk of the game is made up of the same combination of elements. 1. Go to this city. 2. Gather information. 3. Assassinate. Granted the system works it gets boring quickly. There are no real side missions to speak of and the flag collection system gives you nothing and is not worth the effort.Overall, I still recommend playing the game because of the story. It is worth trduging through the repetitive gameplay to build on the lore of a series that gets better and better as it progresses.
