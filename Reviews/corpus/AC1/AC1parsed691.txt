Ive about finished the game, the story that is, and i enjoyed the main story even though it did get a bit repetative but anyway this is what I thought of itPros  Good Main story line Gameplay was fun enough to ignore the graphics which were a bit outdated but not unplayable The characters were more interesting than other assassins creed games Good endingCons  The side quests can be a bit laborious It can get repetitive towards the end because your basically doing the same thing 9 times The options are a bit lackluster as there isnt even a fullscreen setting you have to press ALTENTER to go back into fullscreen after tabbing outAll in all I think its a good game and is worth buying just put aside the the small problems.8.2/10
