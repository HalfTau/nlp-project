For all its flaws its a masterpiece. While it was repetitive, the story was captivating. The side quests were virtually useless, however the flags.... There was no real customization, but it was cool to explore regardless. While a lot of players did not finish the game due to its repitition, I encourage everyone to play it for the story alone.
