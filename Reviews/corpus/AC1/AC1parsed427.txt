Its hard to recommend the first assassins creed. The controls are very clunky and the story is very basic and simple. If you want to start with the franchise I would recommend one of the ezio games or black flag. The gameplay seems very repetitive now and hasnt aged well compared to the other titles. I would say skip this one and watch a walkthrough on youtube if you are really interested.
