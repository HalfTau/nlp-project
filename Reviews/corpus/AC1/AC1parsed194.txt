After multiple tries I finally managed to get into the AC series and god damn was it worth it.Ill make it shortPros good story great map IMO great setting 3rd Crusade acceptable graphics for 2017, obviously probably good in its dayCons repetetive basically the same mission over and over clunky controls far better in AC2 no drive to actually get all the collectables also far better in AC2Overall I had a good time playing AC1 and since its only about 20hrs anyways unless you actually want to collect everything, in which case.. have fun, i guess? the repetition didnt get too bad. If you want to get into the series as a whole Id advise you to play AC1 first, even though it may not be up to par with newer titles. It gives you a great entrance into the story and while the end may not have been satisfying back in the day it surely is now, now that you can play AC2 right after!
