Entertaining for hours on end with fun stealth and combat based gameplay. Id recommend skipping this game and going straight ot Assassins Creed II only because the stealth mechanic in this is not nearly as good and the controls are worse. Still, Ill recommend this game if you want to play from the beginning.
