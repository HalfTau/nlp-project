The landscape is breathtaking.  Even when Ive scaled the same building countless times, I still marvel at its detail and texture.  The main missions feel repetitive after a while and the sword fighting is archaic.  However, the actions associated with the hidden blade are thrilling.  The story keeps you interested all the way to the end and will make you a lifelong franchise devotee after the credits.  A must buy for any gamer who enjoys historical detail.
