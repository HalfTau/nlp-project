Assassins Creed is not as good compared to its sequels, but on its own, the game proves to be pretty awesome. Full of action, excitement, and thrills, youre guaranteed to have plenty of fun.The controls are fairly simple, but arent the best. They take a bit to get used to, and for those who have played the recent games, they are nothing alike. The story is somewhat hard to follow. You are a bartender who is kidnapped by a company called Abstergo to dig through your mind by using the Animus, a device in which plays memories of your ancestor, memories you cannot access on your own. The reason of your capture is because of your family your family are members of the Assassins Brotherhood, dating all the way back to the Third Crusade, in which the story takes place, putting you in the shoes of Altair, an assassin whose reckless action cause a friend to die, but is pardoned. Instead he must start training again to prove his worth, assassinating nine targets assigned by the Brotherhood leader, Al Mualim. As the story progresses, you learn more about why Al Mualim wants these nine dead, and the bigger picture in the adventure. The ending is pretty confusing, and leaves you wondering what the heck is going on.The gameplay is smooth, with the emphasis on stealth. You can take out your sword and slash your way through, but it is much more difficult. The sequels improve on the mechanic, but, again, on its own the combat is much fun.For a 2007 game it still looks great. I even saw some screenshots of the game today and thought, Man that looks good for an older game! I was genuinely suprised.Assassins Creed is incredibly enjoyable and I guarentee that you will have a blast.Score 8/10  Great
