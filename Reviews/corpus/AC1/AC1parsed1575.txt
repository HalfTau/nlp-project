I will praise this game for its mysterious story of Templars vs Assassins but this game can get awfully repetative and the combat is just essentially counter killing everyone At least thats what I did. Unfortunately this game doesnt have the achievemnts from the xbox so collecting the flags here IS THE MOST WORTHLESS THING TO DO IN THE WHOLE GAME. But as a completest I strived to collect everysingle one and comeplete every single memory which would come down to around 20 hours if you were to 100 this game. But the one thing this game excels at is the story and I have was so drawn to everything. Not perfect but a solid first effort for the Assassons Creed franchise.8/10
