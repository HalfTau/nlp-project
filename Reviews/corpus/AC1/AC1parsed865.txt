To start this review off, let me say that I am a huge fan of the Assassins Creed franchise. Even considering some missteps, concerning the latest direction the games have taken, I will still look at AC games through rosecoloured glasses. Except the first game of the franchise, that is.It is the game that introduces us to the overarching plot of Templars versus Assassins. This is all very interesting and Desmond seems kind of cool. The way of how this story is told is also innovative and cool. Altar IbnLaAhad, however, who is the real protagonist of the game, is bland to say the least. The way he is written, does not allow the player to easily identify with him and thus makes him a bit annoying.Gameplaywise the game suffers from some very annoying problems as well. The jumping and climbing, which has become a trademark for the AC franchise, is not that polished in the first game. Very often jumps do not work out as planned and the stealth can sometimes be hindered by exactly those quirks. Furthermore, the missions are extremely repetetive and the travelsystem in this game is godawful.For anyone, who wants to get into the AC series Do yourself a favour and skip this one. There are tons of videos that give you a summary of the story, so that you can get into the second game, without having missed anything from Desmonds story. Keep your hands off this one, jump into the next one and fall in love.
