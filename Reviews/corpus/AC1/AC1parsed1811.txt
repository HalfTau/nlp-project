Assassins Creed has a great plot coupled with an excellent and unexpected ending. The graphics are great compared to most of the PC games in that point of time. But the main issue of this game is the gameplay  its repetitive. After assassinating the first leader, everything that follows will be nearly the same. The guards may be stronger, and it may take longer to assassinate your target but nothing else vary. This game is worth playing for the plot but if you just want to play the game for gameplay, I wouldnt recommend playing it after assassinating the first leader. You can just look up YouTube to catch up on the plot.
