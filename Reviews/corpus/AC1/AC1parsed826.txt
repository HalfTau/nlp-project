Same goes for AC2 See note 2 BelowNo AC games have difficulty settings see note 1 belowUnskippable cutscenes you must watch every time to reenter the open world after beating gameNote 1 Id first like to say being the AC lorefanboy I am, the game being a recollection of past events a difficultysetting wouldnt be very lorefriendly.  But fear not! You can still make the game much more difficult for yourself messing with the HUD.  Yes, thats right, the HUD.  One of the great things is that all elements of the HUD, Health, Minimap, CounterIndicator, etc can all be toggled individually so you may tailor the challenge to your liking.  Want to disable the minimap and keep the map closed and have to actully climb buildings to get note of your surroundings? You can do that.  Want to not have an indicator saying when you are in eyesight of a guard and have to look for one yourself? You can do that.  You get the point.Note 2 If you decide to use a controller for this game, you will needSimply unpack it with winrar or 7zip, then drag the two files into Steams AC1 folder, and your good to go! It says it is for wireless controllers, but it fixes it for just about any xbox 360 controllers.  The same files also fix AC2 just the same.  However, Brotherhood and on work fine on their own.CONCLUSIONOverall the game deserves a remastery in my opinion, Altair needs more love Even if he is an arrogant prick in the beginning.  If all you care about is the story, I would reccommend you read the book instead.  But if you truly want to live the life of a murderousparkourist in the 3rd crusade this is the game for you.
