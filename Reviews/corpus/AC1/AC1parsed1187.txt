This game is just amazing!History, parkour, action, graphics, blood, combat,and it do acctually have an interesting story!This is my second time I have brought this game. For some people it can seem old, but for me it brings back happy and epic memories DI can remember the first time I climbed these enormous towers, killed my first templar!This game brings so many memories and the Assassins creed series is just fantastic!... their is No Uplay!10/10     Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
