Ya know....  there are just better Assassins Creed games out there now.  This one is notorious for being EXTREMLY repetitive.Its got some appealing features to it but in the end, its kinda boring, reduntant, hollow.  Id just read the story synopsis somewhere and skip it.  Oh and theres the small minor issue of the game freezing on you every 5 minutes.
