Im completely new to the Assassins Creed franchise. Quite how Ive managed to steer clear of it for quite so long, I dont really know and now that I have finally played it, it would seem its been a happy accident. Ive obviously been aware of each release and the hype and disappointment that has surrounded each one but never took the initiative and bought one. Now with the Steam sales and being ten years late to the party, I thought Id pick it up where it all began for less than 2 and see what all the fuss is about.The atmosphere and free running mechanics are great and show great attention to detail which I love but thats about as far as the positivity goes. The storyline has so much potential but is ultimately crap and the ending is just shocking. And the journey you go through to get there is just so damn repetetive! Finally, it plays more of a brawler than actual stealthy assassin work. Overall a big disappointment and with much the same criticisms hanging around the franchise as a whole, I think this will be my first and last foray into the world of Assassins Creed.
