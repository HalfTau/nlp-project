Can sit on a perch like Medieval Batman. Can stab guards and peasants alike. Can jump into haystacks. Can learn lots about the Crusades. Cant run well on my Steam Link so Im forced to actually play it on my PC. Cant be frustrated enough with a clunky menu system and camera during some scenes. Nevertheless its well worth the money.
