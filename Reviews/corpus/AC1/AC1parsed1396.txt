To Windows 8.1 usersThe game randomly crashes which are caused after completing certain events. Example, completing the quest or collecting flags for achievements. So buy it if your willing to bear with it or wait until someone fixes the game.The game is still good after 7 years. Its like wine. Let it age and it will taste even better in the future.
