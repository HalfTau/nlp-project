Playing through the series in order, so forgive the review of such an oldie.Controls are a bit weird, making the game childishly easy at some points, and infuriatingly difficult at others.Storyline is immersive and very well written, although obvious plot twist is obvious.Dat ending tho. Way to leave it hanging for the sequels. Wandered around for half an hour or so before consulting various forums, only to find out I was finished.
