This is the first installment of the series Ive played and its a good introduction so far. The game is wellmade for PC and runs very well. The controls are a bit meh, only because they made it with consoles in mind first. It still plays well, its just that theyre consoley. Hopefully the issues with Unity are resolved, as I plan on buying the rest of the games and playing them in order.
