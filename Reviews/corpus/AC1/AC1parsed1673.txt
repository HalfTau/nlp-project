This game at the time of its release was a brilliant game, and I loved playing through it the first time I got it. Now days though, you start to feel the repetition of its missions, and some of the awe that was had for it is lost. Still, the story is decent and in my opinion the game play was ok. All in all, it is still worth getting, even if only for the backround to the later games.
