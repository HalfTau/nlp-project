This is where it all started.  The first game in the amazing series that we now know would have its ups and downs.  This game plays very differently than the other games.  At first it appears that you are just a grunt in the faction of Assassins.  We would later find out in a future game that you are not just a regular person in this game.  You are perhaps the most important assassin present.  The gameplay still holds up as the core mechanics of the game havent really changed much.  If youre looking to play through the series and you want to know if you should skip this game, you should not.  Its a great game that will make you want to play more.
