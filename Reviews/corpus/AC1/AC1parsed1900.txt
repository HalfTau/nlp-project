I have no idea how a potentially great game could be made so annoying and frustrating.It all started with traveling to the cities for the first time. Since youve never been there you dont have fast travel. It was really boring riding there especially when guards came by and I had to walk slowly, taking a lot of time for nothing.At the cities as I got deeper into the game was when I realized how flawed and annoying this game could be.Most of the time Altair never jumps where I want him to, even if I point my controller at the exact position. This can be really annoying when accidentally falling down or trying to escape guards.Another very annoying thing is the distracting citizens. The beggers, the drunk fist fighters, the people who just push you for no reason. I fail to understand why this content got into the game for any other reason but to annoy the player. You cant really make a stratigical move to avoid them since they are at random places and/or follow you around.The gameplay becomes very repetitive once you got your first assassination, its just climbing towers to find minimissions, completing them and going for the big kill, which would be the only fun part of the game if all the careful planning, taking care of rooftop archers and finding a good escape route would not be ruined by a drunk guy randomly pushing me into my target or a guard.Probably the most annoying thing is the people of the cities speaking the same things over and over again. The high score for me was a guard harassing a guy saying You dare steal in my presence? That will cost you your life! six times over and over again.Without all the annoying content the repetitive gameplay would not be so bad since the story seems great so far and the great but currently buggy engine of the game would compensate for the boring submissions.tldr one of the most annoying games Ive ever played and all it would take to fix it is a patch
