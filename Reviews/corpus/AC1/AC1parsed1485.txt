Everyone seems to hate the first Assassins Creed, but I loved it. It might be my favorite. It is a little repetative, but its not annoyingly so. I didnt really even notice until I looked back on it after playing. The other Assassins Creeds seemed to drag on forever, but this one felt shorter. Great game!
