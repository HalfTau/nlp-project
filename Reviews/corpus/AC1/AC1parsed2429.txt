Interesting concept, astonishing graphic design, hardly acceptable plot and really, really  monotonous gameplay. That game could be a killer if it was a two, three times shorter. Worth to play anyway.P.S. For some reason Steam says I have only 0.7 hours played. Well, it should be 0.7 months or something. Its too long.
