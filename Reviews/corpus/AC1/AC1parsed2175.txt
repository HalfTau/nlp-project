Many gamers like to loathe the first Assassins Creed game for a very specific reason its a repetitive title. The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some sidequests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplaywise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.Id say too its something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassins Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels1The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the targets town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassins Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics very interesting, I wont deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity2 Assassins Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as antivillains and well intentioned extremists. Their final speeches are the main highlight of the games plot, in my opinionSuffice to say, I really think Assassins Creed the first is the only worthy game of the series this far, with Assassins Creed III coming very close to give me the same feelings
