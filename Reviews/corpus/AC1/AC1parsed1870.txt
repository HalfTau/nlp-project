This game spawned the series that we know and love.Started a generation of gamers who have a penchant for white hoodies.I have this on my console and when i saw it on sale, i grabbed it as fast as i could.The story here was where it all began for the AC series.Man, i could keep typing about it but id rather play it. After i take a nap. Hell yeah Altair!There are of course issues like the CTDs every now and then Not sure what causes thatIt didnt register my game time correctly Played it for 3 hours and it only clocked 50 minsBut that is more of a porting issue than anything.Play it. If you dont want to or do not like the games, you are a Templar.lol.
