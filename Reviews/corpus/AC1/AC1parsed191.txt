This game was published in 2007 which is rather visible even though the graphics still hold up in my opinion and the plot is certainly wellwritten. However, the way they get to this plot is rather bad. The gameplay is repetitive and very clunky as the controls are simply not well chosen, if using a keyboard and mouse, since I didnt get around to get my Dualschock 4 to work.Only buy this game if you are truly interested in the lore or if you want to relive the vibes of the early 07s.
