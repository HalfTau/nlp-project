The game could be much better if there would be no combat and less towers. Gameplay becomes repetative after two cities  climb the tower, find the objective, RUN FROM THE GUARDS, kill the target, go to the bureau and move onto the next target. Freerun is pretty cool, climbing animations are smooth. However the climbing process is so simplified that it becomes boring pretty soon. Guards everywhere disrupt the running pretty often and sometimes it is VERY ANNOYING. By some reason regular people not guards may throw rocks at you while you are climbing  a person who gave them that ability must be fired. It seems that it was forbidden to drive the horse fast back in these days  the police will chase you if you break the speed limit stealing horses is still fine. A wast amount of collectibles 420 flags and 60 tampliers is useless  there is no reward for collecting them.Combat is horrible  there is no lockon so you will change your target every time you move the mouse. You can avoid fighting till memory block 6 when youll be forced to kill a small army and this is not how the True Assassins do. Seriously, it is frustrating to fight more than two persons.Sound is good, graphics are fine, story exists. The game is playable, but is far from perfect assassin simulator. Get it on sale, play till the sixth block and then uninstall.
