Only recommended for people who are replaying the entire franchise and have not played the first game beforeOn its own the game feels antiquated, mechanics are outdated and the gameplay is repetitive. The story takes way too long to get you hooked but is worth it in the end and really gives you a whole new perspective on the franchise.TLDR Dont buy unless youre replaying the entire franchise, it hasnt aged well
