Feels like half a product. Running, climbing, and jumping through the towns are very fun and feel good. But they forgot to build a game on top of that mechanic. All of the rest feels kind of half done. Whoops. Graphics still hold up well years later, but aside from this and the running mechanic, there isnt much there. If youre easily amused despite dullness and repetition, theres definitely something here. Lots of physical territory to cover and the large amount of city geography is interesting until you realize how similar every location looks. Most of you should probably move along.
