When I started playing Assassins Creed I was amazed at the detail of the world and people that Ubisoft had put into the game and at first i had a blast sneaking about the rooftops and taking out targets from up high. But as the game ran on it started to get very repetitive with the set up missions and side missions being all the same with no difference in how they were played the only enjoyment to be had being the assasinations themselves. If you are starting the assassins creed series the story will be the only reason you will need to play this.
