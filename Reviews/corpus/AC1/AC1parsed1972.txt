Assassins creed is a great game. This game may be repetitive, but the story is great. I enjoyed running around the rooftops and trying to make sure my assinations were silent, even though that did not always work out. I recomend getting this game if you like stealth, games and or action games.Rating 7.5/10Good StoryGood free running sysytemRepetitive
