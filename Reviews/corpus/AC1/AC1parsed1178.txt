Fell in love with Assassins Creed fro mthis game, however since its an older game it has alot of buggs such as game freeze, Character stuck on floor or walls xD biggest issue i ran into was it crashed my entire PC, but looking away from this its an absolutly beautyfull game with a grate story, it does get repetative from some of the missions.
