Where to begin... first hour I spent serching the solution on forums because game crashed constantly   I had a problem to reach the tutorial, sic! this is my first game on Steam with such problems ... when I finally found it game crashes only from time to time...  go figure unpolished, full of bugs controls system is really awful keyboardmouse camera goes crazy sometimes assassination sequences are too long this is an action game and... it is too slow paced, too much jabbering cant skip chat/cutscenes no subs option dull and repetitive one button fighting system if you like to be treated serious by the developer avoid this titleI wanted to give this game a try because Ive heard a lot about the series, but my time is precious and really dont want to waste it on such unsatisfactory gameplay and annoying crashes.If you are a mature gamer, demanding something more from production, just dont bother, it is boring and repetitive as hell.I just cant understand how Ubisoft from such good idea for game made THIS instead...My personal rating 3/10P.S. Think twice when want to buy something from Ubisoft...
