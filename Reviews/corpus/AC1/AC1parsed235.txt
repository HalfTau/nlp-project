The great start of one of the greatest franchises of our time. I think everybody should play it. Why?The biggest reason why I like this game is the story telling and the story with all of its big and extensive backgrounds. I really love games with a story I can literally sink in and where I want to find out everything about every character.Especially when theres a big plot twist or several of them, hehe.This mysterynever true thing is absolutely great.Altair is and will always be one of the best protagonists Assassins Creed have. Hes such a cryptic character. Thats why I think its so intense to play with him.Of course the graphics and animations arent good anymore but you dont play Assassins Creed for the appearance. Although the landscapes and citys are not ugly.The only thing I have to criticize is the way you go through the story. You do 9 times the same thing, just with other persons or things.Another great thing about the game is the parkourthing. Its just a great feeling to know that you can nearly climb everywhere and the view is always a surprise.All in all the game is great despite small quirks.9/10
