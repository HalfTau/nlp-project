The climbing mechanics are cool, the counters during combat are cool, and the story is pretty interesting. However, its very boring. Same missions each area, and they are all done the same way. The assassination missions are worth it, but everything else is lame filler. Id recommend going through the main missions only. Pretty short game, worth it if its on sale.
