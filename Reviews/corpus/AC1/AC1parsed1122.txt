Very well done game, the storyline was outstanding.  The graphics are top notch and the animations are very well done.Didnt finish the flag challanges, 100 flags spread out on a map is more tedious than fun.  If it had been 20 or 30 I would have done it... but 100?  No thanks.Also some of the camera angles are a bit annoying.  Especially when you save someone the camera focuses on that person and than then vigalantes who show up making a fast get away kind of a pain in theGreat animations though and the atmosphere is well worth the price.
