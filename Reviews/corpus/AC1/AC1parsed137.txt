Bought the physical copy of this game several years ago decided to buy it again so that Id have it in my library forever.Its been ten years but I still have the goosebump whenever I watch the cutscene before the title menu.Gameplay wise, this one may be a little bit difficult to come back to, seeing how far the series has evolved.But story and character wise, I personally think the lastest titles cannot top the charms of Altar, Ezio, and Edward.Here, you get to truly be the Assassin, utilising the element of stealth, eavesdropping, and blending to get to your targets.And the modern story here isnt so bad as well.
