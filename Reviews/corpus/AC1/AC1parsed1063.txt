I had fun.  I try to be stealthy but always end up killing everyone in sight as a result of my inability to remain sneaky.  Guess I dont have the patience for learning all they guards movements to get missions done unseen.Can get a bit boring doing all the grinding/finding all the flags and templars to kill.  Id give it an 8/10.
