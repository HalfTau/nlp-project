You play as you playing a video game called assassins Creed then play as guy called desmond who plays a character inside a computer called altair to find out this there is apple of Eden thingamagig which controls other people living in computers.The whole things got more plot twist than an episode of LOST so you might as well just run around punching lepers in the face like I did. And looking the ending on Wikipedia.
