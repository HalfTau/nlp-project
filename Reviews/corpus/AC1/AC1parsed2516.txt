It looks like Assassins Creed is becoming one of the best games Ive played, at least, in a long time. A clich filled epic that blends history and real locations with a fictional, yet suspenseful storyline. Immersion is the key, and Assassins Creed provides, even without spoiling too much in two realms.Graphics wise I didnt expect as much as I got. Even with Antialiasing disabled the game looks vibrant and alive you can force it on through a text file, default with higher resolutions is 0.As for the controls, Im guessing its smoother when played with a pad. Although the pc configuration works, at times it can feel a little sticky.The game has also some informational value I for one had no idea how huge the city of Jerusalem really was, before I rode to the walls myself.I would suggest this game to anyone who likes open world/action/sneaking games or just medieval themes in general.
