So 9 years after release, I finally played my first Assassins Creed game ever.I never knew what was it all about, except that there is an assassin that kills stuff. I was very pleasently surprised by the story and plot  something new for me that I didnt expect.One thing that I didnt like from start was how the character is controlled I dont think it is very suitable for keyboard, ofc I can imagine this game was primarily made for consoles, but I got used to it after some time and had no further problem.Style of gameplay was something completely new for me as well, I loved the roof action and how the cities were designed  there had to be a ton of work in just designing the environment. After some time I think I became pretty good at moving on the roofs and it was very enjoyable. Even interaction with crowd was very well done except 2 things that keptme off for the whole game1 the annoying begging women who at one point completely blocked you from moving and you had to push them  which caused me many many troubles considering there were alerted soldiers all around and these little es just kept ruining my missions.2 the drunken dudes that were attacking and pushing you everytime you came close  one in time would be ok, but there were just too many of them.Some reviews criticize the monotony of game and that they got bored very fast  that was not my case. I was playing it continuously in the evenings for 12h/day max and I never got  bored. I enjoyed the continously increasing difficulty of combats, but to be honest I wasnt enjoying increasing difficulty of investigation missions  some of them were just ridiculous at the end.Overall I liked the game, the story and the gameplay mechanics and I will definitely continue with playing successors, but its not the type of game I would play twice. Also I have met some bugs, but nothing game breaking.
