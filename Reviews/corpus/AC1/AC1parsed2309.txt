A lot of people tend to comment on the repititive nature of this game. I agree, it was all very much the same. But I found myself totally in love with the scifi story that came with this gem, and the voice acting was fantastic all around. I loved how pretty it was, how mysterious Altair was, and the soundtrack was befitting of the game and not obnoxious. If you like stories that stir your curiousity, and involve a stealthy maincharacter to play with, try this out.
