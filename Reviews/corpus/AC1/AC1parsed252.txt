Four out of five stars. Its easy to see why this game got such a following and evolved into an industry defining franchise. The mechanics havent aged flawlessly but theyre so satisfying to use! The graphics, while clearly old and rudementary, know their limits and have a look thats still easy on the eyes. The story isnt mind blowing but it is certainly fun and interesting. Is it vain and preachy? Painfully so. Nonetheless its fun to follow. The only reason this isnt five stars is because the mechanics do have their issues. Its not a masterpiece. Its just fun. Plain and simple.
