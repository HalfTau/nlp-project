The gameplay is very cool though somewhat repetitive. The combat is simple the brutal assasination cut scenes grabs your attention. The graphics breathtaking. This is the game that got me to buy several series of the game that I have yet to finish because of the sheer tasks and objectives that I want to get and accomplish. But like I said, this game started it all. The first installment of an amazing game series. All of the AC games, nothing beats the original and no Uplay by Ubisoft before you start the game.
