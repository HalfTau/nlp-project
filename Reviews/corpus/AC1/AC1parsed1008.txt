Boy, I bet this was really something when it was first released. I played this after AC2 and its clear that AC2 improves upon absolutely everything introduced here. But there was a lot this game brought to the table originally and I still found myself having fun playing it. Id recommend this game if you thirst for more backstory to the Assassins Creed series or if you can get it cheap because its barely worth half of what AC2 costs.
