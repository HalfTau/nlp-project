This is the story about some guy who is kidnapped by someone else and forced to use the mumble to mumble mumble the memories of mumblemurf for some reason or other. The game doesnt have subtitles. An unfortunate design choice for two reasons.The first reason Many of the actors? havent quite figured out how to open their mouth while talking.The second reason talking is pretty much everything that happens in this game.Dont believe the lie about openworld gameplay, parkour moves and total freedom. All I seemed to do in this game was to hold forwards from one dialogueridden cutscene to the next. Sure, I had the option of parkouring about the place, but it didnt bring forth feelings of open world movement and pulsepounding action. Freerunning simply felt like a carrot being dangled over my nose on the other side of a window, designed solely to frustrate me while I wait through another cutscene.Wait seems to be the keyword in this game. The intro in particular is an irritating wait. Intros are to be skipped. We see them the first time, and then we skip past them because weve already seen them. But no. The developers dont care about me wanting to play a game, theyve got religious nutters to placate, leaving me to tap the escapebutton with no real hope of being let into the game any time soon.Still, if youve got good hearing, a high tolerance for tricky control schemes, and a genuine interest in Mumblemurfs backstory, Im sure the game is good.
