Finally got around to play Assassins Creed! Even though its from 2008 the graphics still hold up quite well, however the side quests can make the game a little bit monotonous. I didnt really cared about them Im not a completionist so I just played the main missions, with the narrative keeping me wanting to play the game so I guess it didnt suck that bad?Better to play in short periods of time 1h2h so you dont get tired of it and give up.Final Rating 7/10
