This was rough. It wasnt hard, but the controls make this type of game more difficult than it needs to be. Terrible combat makes any fight something to run from, but when the last hour and a half is made up of mob battles, I just wanted it to end. The free running is fun at first, but its to grabby to be great. Also, there are no skippable cutscenes. So even if you cared about the story I did not, if you fail a mission, be prepared to rewatch it over and over again.This games got so annoying in the end, Im not sure if Ill ever pick up the second titles, even though I hear its a better game. Better than Assassins Creed? Not hard and maybe not for me.
