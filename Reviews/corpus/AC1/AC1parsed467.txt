A great start to the franchise. You play Altair, a young assassin full of himself and over confident with his abilities as an assassin. The gameplay is full of repetition, as you move on from one target to the next trying to complete your mission of eliminating the Templar threat in four large cities. The free running is slow and clunky compared to its successors. Even through the mess of problems, this game is a must play if you intend to play any of the other installments.
