Being first and inherently flawed entry in the series Assassins Creed still succeeds at being an above decent game with a story that takes some time to really kick off, all the while youre drudging through poor game design and repeatable activities, but once it does kick off you become more and more invested. Also, tedium curve ramps up towards the end when game decides to throw wave after wave of enemies at you and dispenses with any semblance of already nonexistent stealth elements. Vistas and meticulously recreated cities are amazing, even if somewhat marred by graphics that have long since entered their middleage crisis.
