Assassins Creed has a special place in my heart for being a core experience with no extra fluff. The story is much more focused than the proceeding games, which continue to tack on history lessons. The gameplay, while being more limited, is also more focused, as each one of your weapons has their own individual direction on the dpad instead of a wheel menu which pauses the game and takes you out of the experience. There is only one sword, which means youll have to get better at the game instead of grinding for upgrades. There are also a lot less canned animations, which while being less pretty, is more satisfying in my eyes. I could go on, but the point is Assassins Creed is a game that champions gameplay and we need more games like that.
