Arcade and repetitive, but this game also has nice open world cities, smooth choreography and the best horses in a game yet.  Graphics were good for their time. Like most ports, this is nearly ruined by consolitis narrow FOV, too easy, nonpersistent world, annoying AI respawns, and one of the worst menu systems ever. The save system is bad and there are no subtitles. I had occasional CTDs. A pity, because without all those flaws, this would be a great game. In the end its an OK game. The sequels are also OK in my opinion. Get it in a sale.
