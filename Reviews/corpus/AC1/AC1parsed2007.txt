I will sum this game up by describing the most irritating thing about it.To quit the game you must first turn off the animus, then open the animus then go to the menu, then go to the main menu.It takes a good 15 minutes depending on your harddrive setup.Simply put, really, really annoying.Story itself is good but that one thing really just killed playing it for me enough to not even try playing Assassins Creed II. for now..
