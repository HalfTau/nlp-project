I have mixed feelings about this game, at first it was quite fun and interesting, but halfway through it got repetitive and bit boring imo.The story is fine, though not very complex, even the world is rather interesting old middle eastern cities but the missions are always the same, only the difficulty rises.I tried to complete everything, maybe some quicker run through would leave a better impression
