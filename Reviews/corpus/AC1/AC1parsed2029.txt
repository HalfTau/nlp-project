A good start for the Franchise. Set in the 3rd Crusade,well, one of them , you are playing as a guy playing as Al  Tahrir, the protagionist, who is trying to recover his name thourgh death. If you played and liked the other Assassins Games, you will probably like it as well, however, there are some key differences.1 As many people have mentioned, thier is no economic system or money in the game at all. Instead, unlike all the other games, rewards are received for performing missions, whether it is save the citizen, where you deal with a certain number of soilders to save someone, or  completing the mission cord, you will advance and go further from there.2 There is no notriety gauge Later in the franchise, there is a notriety bar, which shows how close, or how easily, guards recognize you. Instead, ,they have something more like a noticability bar. The main differnce is no matter how bad you were somewhere else, say, a few blocks away, and you kill a bunch of guards and civilians, it will not seem to affect your noticability, as they seem to notice you if you are in an area they dont want to be in seems like a good time to mention there are no restricted zones or are doing socially unacceptable actions running, pushing, knocking over crates, stabbing the guards buddy. There is also no way to remove this bar, as, unlike later games, you cannot no longer be recognized becuase a poster on a third floor flowerbed is removed.Those are some of the main noticable differences in my opinion, of course there are more, but not as important. You do have to do many repetitive and very similar missions to obtain the assassination ability, by that, I mean your ability to play the assassination mission, which is in each sequence, bringing you closer to the main goal.
