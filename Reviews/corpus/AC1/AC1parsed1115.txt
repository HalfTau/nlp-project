Its the first Assassins Creed and it was very innovative for its time, but unlike all following parts its lacking a lot of variety its repetitive and the story feels boring and bland. Out of all major ACgames, this is the only one I wouldnt recommend because its not as fun as the rest of the series.If you want to play it for the sake of beating all parts or because you want to experience the story yourself go ahead!I cant recommend it however due to it being a really boring game that I didnt enjoy playing.
