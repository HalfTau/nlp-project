I finally decided to sit down, buy Assassins Creed and actually play and beat the game. And I can say, I really enjoyed it! I have never been a fan of the series but never actually played any of them through the whole story. After completing the game I can definatly say I will be getting the next one! The game is a little repetitive, but I still enjoyed doing the same things over and over again. The parkour elements are pretty awesome but havent been ported to PC very well not sure what its like on console. The cutscenes and also some of the fighting are a bit glitchy too, which can be anoying but other than that its really good! Not to difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse if thats a worry and can see some replay value in the game. Overall I would give it a 7 or 8/10.
