From the old days, when Ubisoft isnt EA. Comes a game inspired from The Prince of Persia, that spawn a way better franchise than Prince of Persia. Assassins Creed.You probably already played the sequels, so now play the game that start it all. Where you will get totally dissapointed and bored if you already play the rest of the franchise. Play as Desmond Miles, a bartender whos actually have the most awesome family tree ever. Who was kidnapped by an evil company, like Ubisoft now, where hes forced to use a machine to play a game about his great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather, Altair, a Syrian assassin that spoke like hes from The United States. So with the Animus, you will journey to 1191 Syrian, where you ride along in Altairs quest to kill a few templars. How? By doing the same old side mission like, Listening to people talking, Pickpocketing, Collecting Flags, and Being hired as a bodyguard. When youre finished, you can kill those templars with your limited set of weapons like swords, hidden blades, throwing knives, and nothing else.So, if you think Assassins Creed Unity was bad, Black Flag is boring, AC3 is dull, and The Ezio Trilogy is awesome, this game is well pretty much worse than the others.Starring Syrian Desmond, Assassin Saruman, Lex Luthor, One handed Bass, The 7 deadly templars, and nothing else.Assassins Creed 1
