Refreshing Game as i am new to the AC series. I wanted to play the entire series from start to finish and what a way to start. It is almost a complete game for me, I am familiar with other reviews this game has received and some negativity. But you hardly notice any fault as you play this game. Its a lot of fun, and it is what i look for in games such as this. A lot of climbing and jumping, the fighting mechanics is awesome compared to other games. I can go on for hours with the good.A few bad points1. Running into people, may loose control of player.2. Cut away scenes get annoying after a while.3. Player jumps onto walls repeatedly gets annoying as it makes no progress climbing.Get this game if you like to have fun. Something they forgot about in AC Unity
