The first AC is a pretty bad game.The theme is extremely cool and the parkour is fun but the game is too repetitive and gets boring quickly the sidequests dont help at all.The scifi sections are dumb and the history parts are always the same go here, kill him, beat up him, steal from him, sit on a bench and listen to him... awwwwThe game gets interesting towards the end though and there are some great philosophical thoughts in AC but the gameplay is just too repetitive which makes the game feel like a chore.
