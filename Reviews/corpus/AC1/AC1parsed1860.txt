Though this game feels old, by todays standards, its the beginings to a series which took the world by storm. Say what you will about this game, but I enjoy this game  even today. The menues feel as though there should just be something MORE, but once in the game and once you start understanding how to interact with the world, you embark on an interesting quest. The truly unique thing about this game that seperates itself from its sequels is that IT IS the Assassins Creed. Thats the story. The Creed that the Assassins follow. It introduces a philosophy that is not only true in so far as the word Truth is... really... ony just a metaphysical nonephysical idea... but compelling.Come. Learn how nothing is True, and everything is permitted, and how this doesnt give you creedance to do whatever you please.
