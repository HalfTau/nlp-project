People often forget, when talking about the Assassins Creed series, the ambitious story and theme that the first game attempted to sell to a new fan base. This first instalment in the series is often criticised for its repetitive missions and clunky fighting mechanics, fair criticism as well, but what people have missed is that as the series has improved in terms of game play and setting, the intellectual discussion on power and choice has taken a back seat. Gone are the multifaceted antagonists and questionable ethics of the first game. If you want to play a game that asks you whether might makes right and whether murdering somebody is ever a good deed, that questions your moral assumptions, I think you should play this game to the end.
