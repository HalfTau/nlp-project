Starter of the franchise and as such navigation and side quests lack behind the second part. Positive though, that it isnt divided into a million sublevels like with AC2 . Also, it is historically closest to reality and thus in this sense the most interesting part.Weapons are quite basic, compared to the other ACs, but the graphics are still enjoyable besides its age, though cannot compete with the latest sequels.Of course, forget about the Animus gibberish and the 21st Century story nobody needed it anyway which acts as a mere distraction and bear in mind that this game is far more repetitive than the followup ones. As well, I found some earlier missions harder due to the lack of equipment than later ones.I still give it a plus and recommend the series in generell, if you liked the Batman franchise or just love medivian costumes.
