I have waited a very long time to get Assassins Creed. When I saw it was on sale, of course I couldnt pass up the chance to buy it. I had never played an Assassins Creed game before I only watched videos and it was worth the cost. Great graphics, interesting storyline it has everything I love in a game. The one problem I see is the difficult time I have with the controls. They are slightly confusing and it is very hard to turn your character when sprinting. When I am climbing up a wall to get away from soldiers and they manage to make me fall down, I try to run away, only to constantly try running up the wall again since it takes so long for the game to understand that I want to turn away. I am usually almost dead by then so a ragequit follows. With the only complaint I have about the game, Assassins Creed is a fun and interesting play. I definitely recommend it for those who are unsure.
