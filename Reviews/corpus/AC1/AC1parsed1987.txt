Have to say after playing this game again to refresh myself on the story it has aged remarkably well. Their are annoying moments when Altair decides to jump in some direction you never even considered or when he decides to suddenly have trouble climbing something he just did a minute before but over all the game plays smooth and rarely has any bugs or glitchs. I would recomend this to anyone who wants a little action and a little platforming.
