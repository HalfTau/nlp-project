AC has an excellent story which tackles subjects and presents ideas rarely seen in games these days. It is delivered in a wonderful package that emulates the platforming/exploration puzzle solving pioneered by the likes of Tomb Raider.Yet it does not share the problem that title has, jarring boss fights which require one to forget all the mechanics one has learned before, where the exploration is left behind and youre boxed in narrow confines, forced to surpass this poor minigame to continue with what the game excels at, exploration. No, ACs set pieces meld wonderfully with its core game mechanics so that they are looked forward to and a joy to play.However, no game is perfect and ACs repetitive nature for the investigation process does bog down the middle of the game. Overall, though, a great start to a series. Looking forward to the next 4 installments Thanks Steam Summer Sale!.
