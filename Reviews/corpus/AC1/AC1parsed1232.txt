Very hard to rate this game properly...From one side almost open world, good vision part animation, graphics, levels design, exciting story, a lot of fan from jumping on/trough/from the roofs.But from another side open world is empty  nothing to do there, gameplay a little bit monotonous  especially investigations, fightings and jumpings are too easy  just press one or two button and thats all, fightings becomes boring more closely to the ending  too many the same opponents...So, my conclusion I would like to recommend the game for people, who will start from the 1st AC and go on further for others, who wanna enjoy from gaming  think twice before buying.
