Lemme explain in one word REDUNDANT.Good Unique Game mechanics, awesome graphics, good atmosphere. Nice stealthy gameplay.Bad Game flow follows a very straight patern Go in a town, go in bureau, get information/do challenge ,go back to bureau, watch a scene, assassinate your target, watch a scene, go back to bureau, watch a scene, move for about 15 seconds, watch another scene, get a new move/weapon. Repeat 7 more time and congrats you beat the game. Im not even exagerating. You REALLY do that, EXACTLY like mentionned. There is some pointless sidestuff like rescuing citizens or picking up flags. Who cares. OH, the cities. theres 3 cities4 with yours and all 3 look exactly the same beside a slight color change. Fighting is kinda button mashing, controls are a little bit akward when running. Npcs keeps saying the same stuff. Ending is bad.The gameplay is a mix between Arkham asylum and Ninja Gaiden. In my opinion, avoid this game even if its actually good.Overall 7/10
