I recommend playing this game but only if you are a big fan of the AC series as it is repetative you kill 9 people and have to do the same stuff every time but the end is pretty cool. The game will probably crash for you but you apparently I could never be bothered to do it can change the compatability mode to Windows Vista to fix it there is a guide on the Assassins Creed community hub.
