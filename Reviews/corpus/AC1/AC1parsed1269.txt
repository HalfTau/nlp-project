I thought popularity meant something. I thought Hey, a lot of people talk about this, it must be worth buying the first 3 games!It was an absolute waste of money. This is the most dull, repetative, obnoxious game Ive ever bought on Steam. Its advertised as an awesome stealthy assassination game, but it doesnt come even close to delivery. NPCs do nothing and the AI is probably the worst excuse of an obsticle Ive ever seen. Gaurds mean absolutely NOTHING, remaining in stealth is useless, and the story is just rehashable garbage. You could literally just run past every single gaurd in a bline to the objective while you play the same mission with different chars every time.But hey, you want to just try it though, right? 80 positive reviews means this guy is probably just havin a bad day.Go watch a playthrough. Check it out on Youtube or something first before you pay for ANY one of these recycled games.
