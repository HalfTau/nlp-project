Game is divided in cities, each city has 3 zones, each zone has the same missions as the zone before. So yes, too repetitive. I mean, 20 hours of always doing the same thing climb the towers to unlock missions boring, save peasants by killing badmen, pickpoket, kill some, hit some and kill a boss for each zone. Too repetitive. The best part is the very end, which leaves a intriguing plot for the sequels. The outofanimus gameplay is very, very, let me stress that word once more VERY boring.Difficulty comes in numbers. Though there are different leveled warriors, the battlesystem is too simple. Always defend and when an opponent attacks, counterattack them, youll always win. Ive died few times, most of them because I fell to the water. Apparently, Altair knows the killing but not the swimming. Nice assassin.So, if you have money on Steam sales and time to waste, buy it. But I still dont understand all the fame/hype the game has. I hope the sequels are better.
