Perhaps this game was good when first released on consoles, but it hasnt aged well. Its pretty much the epitome of terrible console port  starting with the menu and exit game mechanism that makes it literally take several minutes to quit unless you press ALTF4. Seriously Ubisoft  6 menus to quit the game?Beyond that, as the game is called Assassins Creed you would be forgiven for thinking it will be about stealth assassination. Generally, its not  very few of the true assassinations in the main plot allow different angles of approach or stealth mechanics. You would assume an assassin would prefer to avoid doing their work in public, or would prefer to use a handy bow from a nearby roof  you would be wrong, though. Rather, you are expected to get in close, which inevitably means getting into combat. Thats also a strike  the combat is bloody terrible. Again, the console portness appears, as the combat is typical of other console ports Im looking at you, Prince of Persia Sands of Time and is not at all intuitive for PC players. Much of it relies on timing moves, which dont appear to register well, and are better suited to a controller. In fact, the majority of the game is best suited for a controller  or to be watched in a LP rather than played.TLDR  For a game that was published well after the Thief series, Deus Ex, and a myriad of others that contain aspects of stealth assassination, they all do it much better than Assassins Creed. I bought this for 7 and I drastically overpaid.NOT recommended.
