Assassins Creed aka AC1 was the first game of this franchise obvious duh.In the game, a company named Abstergo, run by Templars, developed a machine that is capable is reading data they call genetic memory from peoples DNA. With this data they are able to explore the memories of these people ancertors.They are using this machine to read the genetic memory from a man who is descedant of an old Assassin who fought against the Templars during the Crusades.Their main goal with it is to locate ancient artifacts known as Pieces of Eden, these are powerful relics from the ancient civilization that lived on earth before humans.This is mostly what happens on all AC games. Templars trying to locate Pieces of Eden to use their powers to control manknd while Assassins are trying to locate it first to prevent Templars from doing it.Now a few pros and cons from AC1Pros Very interesting storyline Game is based on real life location and several reallife characters are present Relatively long with lots of stuff to do other than main story mostly collect stuffCons Repetitive gameplay Lack of any kind of subtitles it was an issue for me since I can read english, but I cant understand spoken english 100 Repetitive combat mechanics.Assassins Creed started what become a great franchise, but this game is easly the worse of all of them yes, worse than Unity, yet, its worth playing it so you can understand how everything works in AC universe, also, youll need this one to understand the very best of the Franchise, Assassins Creed II.
