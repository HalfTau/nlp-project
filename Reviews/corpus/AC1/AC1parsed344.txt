Do I recommend this game? As you can see from my rating, no.Do I think you should still play it though? I suppose so. I, for one, do not like to play a sequel without having a chance at the original title that came before it.This game is very well done overall for its time. The gameplay was unique and the features were different. The combat mechanics were different than anything I had ever seen before but lead to a very slow moving game in the long run. It is the moving mechanics that frustrates me the most. It is difficult, at least with a keyboard, to navigate the narrow alleyways while running at top speed. The character occasionally bumps into a wall and tries to climb it. When you are being chased by enemies this can be extremely infuriating.The beauty of this game though is the story that it brings. While it isnt particularly the best story I have seen, it is very unique and leads directly into the sequel which is why I think you should still play this one in order to understand the sequel or at least watch a gameplay walkthrough so you can understand what is going on.I played this on Windows 10 and found it to be very buggy and crashed on occasion. This game is DX10 I believe which was one of the worst APIs Microsoft ever built. Coincidentally making its debut on Vista, one of the worst OSs they built. I tried running this game in Vista compatibility mode but the crashes never went away. I had to play through the ending 3 times just to defeat the final boss and watch the final cutscenes without crashing.I am glad I forced my way through it so I could experience the story and move on to the sequel but I didnt enjoy it overall and was more relieved when I finished it just because I didnt have to play it ever again.
