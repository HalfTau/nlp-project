Heres what I think about th game Good story Like other assassins creed gamesFine fighting mechanics Fine because I cannot counter enemies attacks sometimes for whatever reasonSure theres no ships to ride like assassins creed 3, 4, rogue, syndicate and no shops to buy equipment but the cool thing is that you get equipments, upgrades, and abilities such as dodge, break defense, counter attacks as the story progresses on.Well, the only con I could think about is that you cant skip cutscenes but the cutcenes are kind of interesting to see. probably for the people who loves history anywayWell to the conclusion of playing this game for almost 14 hours now, the thing that I can conclude is that this game is good and its worth it.
