A great beginning to the game series that brought social normalcy to evesdropping on people.  The game itself has a very interesting story which leaves you wanting to know more as you complete each chapter.This does however trade off with the gameplay, which at times is monotonous and frustrating.  The game does do a fantastic job of pumping up the adrenaline when youre being chased by guards by tuning in some intense music to your parkour endevors. But, this is sometimes hindered due to the guards seemingly omnipresence in the cities, making escapes often quite difficult.  The side missions feel like a copious set of chores in preparation to the quality main missions, but the story is worth it.  Regardless of its flaws,  the game is a quality time to enjoy, and I reccommend it to anyone interested in the series.
