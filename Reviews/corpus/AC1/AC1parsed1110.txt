Take Hitman and Prince of Persia with a hint of Deus Ex conspirancy and a touch of Dan Browns historical revisionnism and you get this series pilot. If the premisse of this antiGTA is absolute genius, the gameplay is more casual and can get repetitive and somewhat contrived through the 9 hits you perform around Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre and etc... during the crusades. Still, this has bestseller written all over its DNA and its no wonder the series is one of the biggest videogame franchises of all time. This is where it all started with epic graphics way in advance for 2007 this feels more like a 2012 release and you will need a powerful pc to run it well and get all the eye candy and a strong storyline that opens the mysteries and sets the tone of the episodes to come.
