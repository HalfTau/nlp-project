This game is great, if you have played the other AC games, this one is much more different.The game has 9 or 10 levels if I can remember correctly and side missions.Also the game is open world, which may seem bad, or good for some people..Here are some reasons what I think are good and bad about this gameProsGood StoryGood fun in my opinionAn assassins creed game that involves crowds unlike all the other AC games, am I right?Easy to playYou can ride horsesConsQuite afew glitchesClimbing seems harderNot as smooth parkour or assassinations as AC 3 and upNot much freedom at the end of the gameAnyway, these are some reasons why I find this game good, I would really suggest buying it, its worth it, in my opinion.
