Never having experienced the historical adventures of Assassins Creed, and desperate to fill my Prince of Persia void, I plunged into Assassins Creed Black Flag a few years ago, and was instantly enamoured. Even the first title in the series, while not as streamlined graphically, still gives such a great feeling of freedom and action, and goes one step further with its detailed exploration of various organisations like the Templar. Great game. Captures the spirit of actionadventure perfectly.
