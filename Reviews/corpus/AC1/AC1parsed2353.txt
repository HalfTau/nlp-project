Games pretty good however, it is extremely repetitive in a lot of ways. The story is repetitive the investigations are repetitive the objectives within the investigations are repetitive, and the combat is extremely repetitive. If you dont like doing the same thing over and over, this game will make you want to shoot yourself. If I were to give it a score on a 10 point scale, Id give it a 6.5. The visuals were actually pretty good, and its setting was fascinating. I found the backstory there are two stories  one in which you are in an Animus, reliving your ancestors assassin memories, and the other where you are a random dude being tested on in this lab by a sketchy scientist more interesting than the main one. Is the game extremely overhyped? Yes. Was it worth the 5.00 I paid for it? Yeah, Id say so. Overall, decent game. Dont buy it if its more than 10.00.
