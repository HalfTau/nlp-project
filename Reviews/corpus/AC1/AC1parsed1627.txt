Some guy sent me to stealth assassinate 3 others guys. I failed. City guards attacked me. I killed them. Retried the mission. The 3 targets saw all the corpses and were suspicious. They saw me and realised I did the killing. I retried the mission until the street was filled with about 75 corpses. But I succeeded, so I went to see the first guy and first thing he said was You are lucky
