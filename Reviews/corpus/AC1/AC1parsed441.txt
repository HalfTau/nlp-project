A very difficult recommendation because the game is falling apart at its seams on newer hardware, but its still a recommendation none the less. Its a very fun game, it has a decent story, Altiar seems very bland from his monotoned voice and you dont really see his face much under the hood, but he has extremely good dialogue and character development. It hasnt aged well, it was extremely innovative for its time, however, weve seen these innovations recycled ever since and done better making the games world just feel extremely dated. Also, while the futuristic parts of the game can be quite interesting, theyre kinda shoehorned in the game worst than any other entry in the series, or at least before ACIV, especially with the ending.
