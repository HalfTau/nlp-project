A good game to play that gave birth to a series of great games.Its a good starting point if you want to get in the series, but if you want a game to fall in love with, skip this one. As much as I love this game, it is indeed repetitive and slow.For those who want to experience Assassins Creed completely. If you couldnt care less about story or completion, start with AC2
