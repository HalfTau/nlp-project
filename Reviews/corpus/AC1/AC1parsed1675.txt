I cannot believe I did not play the original Assassins Creed until 2014.  I have to say that the hype is worth it.  The game is slightly repetitive but makes up for its minor shortcoming with a pleasing artstyle, engaging stealth gameplay, intuitive and smooth combat, and a sense of movement and animation that is still lacking in many games today.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Assassins Creed even years after its original release.  Play the game with an Xbox Controller to get the most out of it.
