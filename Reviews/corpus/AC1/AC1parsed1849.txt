I hadnt played this game since its release on Xbox 360 and had doubts that it would be any fun what so ever due to its controls but playing it on the PC has brought its true colors out for me to be amazed.This is simply one of my favorite games now.The story is amazing and the gameplay is astounding.Being able to assassinate at will is pleasing.10/10 Fantastic!
