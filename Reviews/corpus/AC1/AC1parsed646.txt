This, right here, is an example of a bad port. It plays great on the X360, even if the controls take a little getting used to. But on the PC? Its just plain unintuitive. Half the time I played it with a remote, I had to use my mouse and controller anyway because the program decided Not today.Also, I got Shadow of Mordor after playing thisAssassins Creed 4 Black Flag. Shadow of Mordor is a far superior game to both in my mind. The combat feels better, the atmosphere is more clear in where it wants to be, and the story feels like more of an assassin game. Assassins Creed feels more like Prides Blunder Climb Back Up the RanksUpdate Does not work with XB1 remotes.
