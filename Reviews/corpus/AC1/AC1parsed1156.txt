Decent enough fun, despite it being Ubisoft. Found all the items, and spots, and extras. Spent quite a bit of time in it and thought the premise to be a bit odd, but different enough to not be sameolesameole.... and then steam then wouldnt let me write a review because it only thought I spent 4 minutes in the game. ahem
