I love the premise of the game. I liked the setting and the story. I got to Damascus before I gave up. Not because it was hard, but because the port for this game is so hilariously bad that its ruining the whole experience. No crashes, nothing like that for me. But for the tutorial the problems started as soon as the game was supposed to tell me how to sprint. Press button 1. Wth is button 1?! Tried every button I could come up with, nothing worked, went in to control settings and set sprint to shift. Next up was button 0. Same procedure. And the mouse isnt even included in the game?! You cant set any of the controls to mouse buttons. So now Im fighting with Ctrl. What the actual ? Oh, and you cant exit the game without force quitting it. When you click Exit game you end up with a classic console starting screen with Press any button written over it. When I press any button I get to select profile. So the only way to quit the game is to TabAlt to desktop and then force quit it. Lovely.
