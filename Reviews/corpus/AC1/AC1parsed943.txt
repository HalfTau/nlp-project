Being the first in the AC series, this definetly set a new bar, broke some conventions, delivered solid gameplay and all the while setting the foundation for what we know what will be a good story.The graphics are mindblowing, considering its age. The gameplay is a bit slow, stepping back from the Prince of Persia series crazy acrobatics that seemed to have inspired much, and does everything with a more realistic pakourlike approach, it can at times be irritatingly slow, considering the sheer scale of environs one has to cover, but that is then addressed in the the newer releases.The setting itself Third Crusade, is one of the things that make this game particularly interesting. Not only do you interact with a wellportrayed medieval society at war, but you also encounter all the different cultures that were present in the mixing pot that was the Holy Land at that time. Having Crusaders yell in German, French and old English, with Saracens doing the same in Arabic and Hebrew? I cant tell adds another level of immersion.I would reccomend everyone play this at least once  but bring a controller along for the ride. The AC games do not lend themselves well to keyboard controls, this one does so better than the later installments, but one might as well set a trend and get used to the persistent scheme.
