Simply one of the best new IPs ever created this is the game that started it all and, going back to play it again, one can see why. The series may have become bogged down by tired yearlyprojects in recent days, but there was a sweet spot for this series in its early days namely the first through Brotherhood that absolutely cannot be denied. There werent any games like this when it came out, and there still arent today. The delicate wire of written and unwritten history which it balances is masterful to say the least, and is a game that, since I played it when it was first released, has a certain feeling which permeates it, of which I, to this day, have never been able to shake. Although the ending has been much maligned, I personally loved it, and felt it truly serves as the final brush stroke that brings home the entire game, and imprints it on our memory forever, if you will only invest the time and allow it to.
