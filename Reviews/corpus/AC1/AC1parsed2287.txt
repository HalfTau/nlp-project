Slightly boring and repetitive after a while, but still good...only one bad thing to say ubisoft. Play offline switch the modem off otherwise youll freeze the game for 34 secondos every time you killBecause Ubisofts babys trying to call home, but their servers arent up n running anymore, so it lags. Sucks!
