Ive owned this game since 2008 on Xbox 360 but never got a chance to actually play it till today! 2/4/2014The story is awesome! I really didnt know what to expect beyond some story about an Assassin but man I was pretty surprised. For the first few minutes I had to remap the keybindings for my controller which were really off.. but once I got into the game I was really taken for a ride. Ive only played this game for a little over 5 hours but one of the best things I like about this game is the exploration and freerunning. Climbing towers and exploring ancient cities. There are many sidequests and the element of danger was definitely there. Crowds of people walking all over the place. Rub shoulders with the wrong guy and youre in for a fight buddy!The combat feels pretty good at this stage of only playing 5 hours into the game. After completing a few missions I unlocked some abilities like Counter Attack that made combat more in my favor.. or thats what I thought until I ran into a Knight that totally kicked my rear end. But you know whats cool? I grabbed that Knights attention, climbed a tower, he followed up after me planning on destroying my face, but the moment he stepped off that ladder... I threw him off that tower to his death! Splat my good Sir! Sweet revenge after dying a few times to his brutal power.Again Ive only played a few hours into the game earlier today, but Ive had a blast so far. Its definitely a great Action/Adventure type of game, Ill be talking about this older game to some of my friends next week for sure! Haha
