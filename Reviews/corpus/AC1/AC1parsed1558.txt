we all should knwo this game by nowcomparied tot he newer oes it is quiet limited and lacking in a lot of areas yes but at the time it came out it was one of the best gamesOverall its still a great game to kill time on and enjoy an older game that changed how some games where my game time is how long it took to complete the game at 100 soo can be done in less then 12hoursbit off the game and more on the specs. this is far as i can tell the only one that doesnt need uplay to play and even when ran on pcs the dont meat the requirments it doesnt run to bad and runs quiet smooth
