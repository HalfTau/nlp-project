This game is great. Im the type of person to try to 100 open world games, and this game scratches that itch very well. I played it off steam, so my hours dont reflect how much time Ive actually spent playing it. Combat is a little weird, though. I struggled a bit until I learned that you can just jump over a guy, stab him, jump over another guy, stab him, too, etc., and take very little damage. The parkour bits are also very fluid and intuitive, which I wasnt expecting at all.Im sure plenty other people have already mentioned how the reality portions of the game are tedious, and I totally agree. Theyre usually pretty short, though, and can be overlooked. Aside from that, theres a lot of fun to be had, here.
