I bought this game for my partner but they got bored about half way through the game. So I then played the latter half of the game. Even despite not playing the whole game it felt rather repetitive. The core of this game is you need to assassinate 9 people but before you can do that you have to go to one of the three cities in the game and do similar side quests over and over again before you can complete the next assassination mission. The side missions are in themselves fun but after the umpteenth time you cant help but get a bit bored.The free running mechanics are okay but not as fluid as I was expecting. Sometimes you smoothly flow across the roof tops like in Mirrors Edge but then suddenly your character will jump off in the wrong direction or cling onto a door frame or flounder up a wall next to a ladder.To get between the cities you have to ride through the countryside which just felt like unnecessary padding. The game almost recognises this as it allows you skip these sections later in the game. There are also some extensive collection side quests which are utterly pointless, there is no benefit to doing them, not even an achievement.So overall this game was enjoyable and I am going to play the sequel but I found it a little disappointing.
