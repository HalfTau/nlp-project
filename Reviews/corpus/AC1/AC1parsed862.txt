Allahu Akbar, this game is great xD xD kind of tedious though and uhhhh a bit lacking in the variety department but uh yee it sets the stage for the series well which is good, however the cliffhanger at the ending was like dafuq? you couldve made the cliffhanger like a billion times better but yknow 2007 and what not so uh yee.
