I cant tell the difference between AC standard edition and Directors Cut Edition. The graphics and gameplays are pretty much the same, but some folks on the forum wrote that there are several side missions that you cant find on console version. Gotta check it out.Nonetheless, it sill a great game even 7 years after the first release. MUST PLAY if you want to follow the storys of the assassin from the first.
