First assassins creed game , which you are the templar hunter Altair , from Syria Damascus .the game has some bugs and glitches not that i can say that much , cuz its the first version , although the graphics are really good, combat is awsome as always . the storyline is ok though , but you have to fight your way into templar territory  from the crusades eraRecommend ? Ofcourse
