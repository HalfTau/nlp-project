Really bad game, combat is boring and repetitive, running and jumping on rooftops is fun for 10 minutes, but its limited by engine and becomes annoying.As a higly trained athlete and assasin you should have advantage over guards, but they are climbing buildings like monkeys, and fight like only computer can.There is no freedom in fights, only few patterns that you have to follow to win.And the most anoying thing is not even in the gameplay, its quiting the game with 10 more clicks and three loading screens just to exittrying to rage quit means you will get a stroke.I have been told that its all corected in sequels, but that doesnt help this game.
