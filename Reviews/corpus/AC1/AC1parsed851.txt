This is a recommendation with a caveat.Assassins creed gave the feeling of Kings Quest, Prince of Persia, and Thief mixed in with an interesting storyline and compelling gameplay.The caveat is that the game has three parts that are essentially straight up repeats of the previous, just with more story progression. Each city is the same round of tasks after the first.That said, the story is decently written and gameplay fun enough that playing through the game is worthwhile.Its also a great start for the even better sequel.
