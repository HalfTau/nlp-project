The Assassins creed that started it all. This game was a masterpiece of its own time but playing it years later it can sometimes be irritating due to the irresponsive controls and boring because of how repetitive the tasks can be. It has its strength though which is the story. I would recommend this game if you just want to know the story but if what you want is a fun gameplay then look for another installment of the assassins creed series.
