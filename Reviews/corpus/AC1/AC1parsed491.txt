Best way to play this game, and all AC games for that matter is to pause and read about the historical background they are based on. Makes the the world more alive and the immersion more intense.As far as the game is concerned the gameplay and is a little clunky but its a 2008 game. Graphics are holding out decently even to this day.Great way to learn more and get interested in the 3rd Crusade.
