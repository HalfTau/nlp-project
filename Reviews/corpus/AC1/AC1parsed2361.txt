My intrest in the series started when the 3ed game was told to take place in the Revolutionary war. Before buying this game everyone told me that AC1 was slow, but I thought that it was a nicely paced game. my main gripe at first was the some what clunky PC controles. you can tell this game was designed for consoles.All in all though, a nice start to the series, cant wait to catch up compleatly.
