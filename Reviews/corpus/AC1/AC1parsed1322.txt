I picked this up almost 3 years ago its approaching 6 years old now, wow and just finally got around to finishing it today.Although the graphics are dated, the story and gameplay are still highly enjoyable.The free running and combat are pretty fluid but there are definitely some buggy moments and hangups.Buy the game for cheap on sale and enjoy a solid days worth of game time.Good stuff.
