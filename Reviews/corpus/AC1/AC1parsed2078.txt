Assassins Creed was am amazing game when it was released. The gameplay was novel with fluid movement unlike any video game before, and the plot was intriguing and compelling. The plot is still just as good, but the gameplay has not aged well at all. The game requires a massive amount of grind through the midgame and most of the endgame, and many games since have surpassed AC1s freerunning and combat most notably, AC2.I recommened that players attempt AC1 as the intro point to the series. If the grinding becomes too much to bear, watch the remaining cutscenes and story missions on YouTube and move on to AC2.
