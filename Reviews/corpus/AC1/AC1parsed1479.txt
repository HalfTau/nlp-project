The Crusades, parkour, stealth, and assassinations all sound great and Assassins Creed promised all of those things and that sounded great but after playing the game it fell a little short.You play Desmond Miles, a man from 2012 AD, who is kidnapped and forced to entered a machine called the Animus that searches a persons DNA and extract memories from the users ancestors. Well one of Desmonds ancestors turns out to be a member of the Assassins Order during the Third Crusade named Altar.Altar is tasked to help stop the Crusade by killing 9 leaders on both sides of the war. As he continues to kill the men, Altar finds out why he was sent to kill them and also why Desmond was kidnapped.In order to assassinate the leaders, Altar must gather information by pickpocketing, beating a confession, eavesdropping, or helping a Order informer on the target that is in a sector and then get approval from the Order leader in the city with the information.Also he can do a couple side missions by saving citizens that go can help getting into a place with scholars or having vigilantes that while hold on to guards as Altar gets away.All of this is the real problem with the game as getting the information is all the same in every level of the game and gets really boring fast.Visually the game looks great even on a standard def TV and I bet looks better on a HDTV.Controls are tight most of the time and only feel loose when fighting but not so loose to be killed too many times.But another fault is that story is weak as its pretty confusing and a bit convoluted.Overall the game is a good game and worth borrowing to play but its seems like the game needed a little more work in some areas that could have make it a great game.7/10This review is based on the PS3 version when is was originally released so does not reflect on the PC port
