2 out of 10.  Not worth it, even on sale.One of the few games Ive actually given up on, and should be the textbook example of why PC gamers hate console ports.  The controls are some of the worst Ive ever fought with, the gameplay is terrible and repetitive, and the fact that you have toto exit in order to avoid the 5minute nightmare youd normally have to go through really tops things off and makes the game more like a bad joke than anything.  It had decent enough graphics, but thats really the only good thing I can say about it.
