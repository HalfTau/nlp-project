Okay, I would like to start by saying that this game was nicely done considering its age and the captivating series it later became is just a plus. Even thought i do recommend it, I wanna talk about some issues i experienced on my own and state my own opinions. If you are interested in reading my issues, please read further on as i encourage it, however, if you do not care please only read the next 2 sentences. I recommend this game only to longtime fans of the Assassins Creed Game Series, if you have played the newest ones and expect this one to be just like it, youre wrong. You can easily skip this game and be caught up storywise in the 2nd game theres no specific reason to play this game unless youre a huge fan because it isnt necessary.My Issues1 I experienced no lagging frames issue despite hearing so much about it on the YouTube.2 I found the keyboard controls to be a bit too demanding to memorize and quite frankly uncomfortable on my hands, so i used a Gamepad. I had to set the commands and actions myself, so that was a bit of a chore.3 Now to the games story istelf. It was a little too boring for my taste i remember predicting the ending minutes after starting the game.4 I had another issue about how fast travel was not introduced until later on in the game, making it a chore to go from city to city on horseback and just punishing on foot.5 My biggest issue no matter what you do or how inconspicous you are, the guards are always suspicious of you! Okay, i understand that you are dressed in Assassin robes, but come on, you literally get busted for no reason!6 Side missions should be completed before you assassinate the target in the city for full memory synchronization.7 100 completion is not worth the hassle.Thanks for reading, hope i helped you make up your mind!
