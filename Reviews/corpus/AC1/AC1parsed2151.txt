This is the one that started it all. Graphics are clearly advanced for 2007, I mean, stunning really, and it still looks great today. And the gameplay is great. Storywise? Could have used some work in developing the plot beyond collecting information and assassinating Templars only to lead up to a big finale that will make you say, what?Also, Altair is still my favorite Assassin. That outfit, oh man.8.5/10
