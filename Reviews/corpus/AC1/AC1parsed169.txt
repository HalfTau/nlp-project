was revolutionary when it was first released over a decade ago. To date very few games can hold their own as well, with a solid plot and graphics to rival many modern titles.Having decided to play through the series again, I found myself enjoying Assassins Creed much more this time around and spent considerable amount of time roaming about, exploring the cities and honing my battle skills on swarms of chasing guards! The storyline itself should provide 1015 hrs of intrigue and fun.In short Assassins Creed has A brilliant storyline into the protagonists ancestors past Very detailed environment to explore within cities Complex combos leading to satisfying combat results Spectacular and very fluid movement across rooftops Diverse sounds and voiceovers mix of English, French, Turkish etc Each assassination assignment is unique When Ubisoft was still decent no external login hassles Horrendous and overly complicated controls scheme Unfriendly and lackluster UI no subtitles either Extremely tedious finding all the collectibles A handful of repeatable minigames/races across rooftops boring after a single try Final boss no spoilers was as easy as a well timed grabpush assassination The ending can accurately be described with the emoji meh! No steam achievements or tradecardsTLDR Assassins Creed still holds its own quite well todate, even though later iterations have improved the game considerably. With an intriguing and original storyline, fluid combat, exciting rooftop chases influenced by the Prince of Persia classics and a lot of assassinations, it is a gem worthy of a place in everyones library. Highly recommended!
