Great story. Not as good as the later games but you gotta play it to go on to the later ones. A lot of people are saying that it sucks because it gets repetitive, but part of being an assassin is patience. Is there a basic recap of this game at the start of ACII? Yes but if you skip this game you miss out on a very personal connection to the characters found within. Desmond will seem more relateable, Lucy will be much more human, and Revelations will make a helluva lot more sense if you can just sit down and have some fun with this. People are making it sound like this terribly boring and repetitve piece of crap when if you just sit back and be a little patient, the story will more than make up for sometime buggy game mechanics and slighly repetitive missions.
