Not too impressed with this one, the controls are a little wobbly, the AI isnt too good, graphics are alright I guess, quests are a little repetative, and there are barely any idle AI audio lines gets annoying after a while. I would only recommend getting this game if you want the full effect of the entire assassins creed like me.
