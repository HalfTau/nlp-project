For being the foundation of a wildlysuccessful series of games, the originalisnt really allgood. While the gameplay was novel, the series was still finding its feet here, and made a few missteps. Controls can be a bit aggravating, and the menu structure is frustrating. Also, the game shows prettymuch all its cards in the first third, leaving the remainder of the game to feel repetitive. The various forms of progress, like collecting hidden flags, are rewarded only by the sense of completion, and Altairs progress through the game is rewarded only with a few new weapons nothing gamechanging. The originalis still enjoyable, just a bit underwhelming, given how successful the subsequent series was.If you want to play the entire series, then you should start here, where it all began, and just keep in mind, if the game becomes a little tiresome, that this is one of the weaker entries and the later sequels are better. If you dont plan to play through the entire saga, however, youre better off giving this one a miss and jumping straight to AC2 or AC4 those two represent the series at its best.
