Overrated piece ofbrThis game first of all does not play at all like the other AC game, which is fine considering its the foundation. But just the foundation means  design. This game is not a stealth parkour like the others. 14 hours in and i have finally given up on it. Repetition is this game as in the game is full of the same challenges like time trials that you need to complete. I have seen many arguements against this issue about how a good story and gameplay/ game mechanics can carry you through it. This the first AC game with little to none AC game mechanics that show assassin. 90 of this game is challenges providing you useless info and veeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrry slow climbing. The game also punishes you for progressing by adding more and more annoying mechanics like random guys that push you, beggers that wont shut the  up and stop blocking you. The number of these NPCs only increase greatly as the game drones on. The story is the best one in the series which is the only thing good about this game. I recommend just reading it online rather than enduring this.This game is basically a beat em upThis should be considered not part of the AC francise considering how this one was clearly made by Activison.I only hope AC brotherhood is better
