Great 20067 action game,although not a RPG,it really has many features that make it look like it is.Story is very interesting although its a bit linear but it gives the player the chance to take his time to find out details about his/her missions.Graphics very good,there are vast environments with huge cities and castles.Also the game includes a very good illustration of how Jerusalem looked like.On some interviews developers stated that they tried their best to create the maps to look exactly like how it was back then.No special effects of explotions or casting magic,its more the realistic kind of gaming.Music fine,although they could have done something more epic than they did.Gameplay simple fight system,gets boring after realizing you are repeating yourself over and over and over again.However there is a super awesome feature,buildingclimbing and freerunning.This will keep up your interest and help you enjoy yourself through the game for sure!
