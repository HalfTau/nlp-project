Classic frustration, that seems to be the best way I can describe this game. Seriously I wanted to assassinate everyone at Ubisoft going through this game, it WILL make you curse, it WILL make you scream, it WILL make you drown in a puddle of water even though youre a godlike assassin who can jump from insane nosebleed heights, no really it will do that.The thing is I kinda like being frustrated, I kinda like sitting there yelling and cursing at my screen, if Im not then the game is boring and not worth my time. Ive started and stopped playing this game so many times... but I always come back.If youre going to play any of the other Assassins Creed games, and I recomend that you do, you have to play them from the start. Its a story, one that progresses through the series, and not a bad one. One that is suppose to be made into a movie soon too, a whitewashed version of the story and please feel free to protest that fact to the company.
