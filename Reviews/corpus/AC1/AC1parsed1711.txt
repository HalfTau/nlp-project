While I cant deny that this game is a groundbreaking one, I cant help but feel this one is very lackluster when compared to its sequels. While that is to be expected in any game series or at least most game series, I just could not find replay value in this one after I beat it once. But like I stated previously, I cannot deny the fact that without this game its sequels never would have been produced so I cannot help but have total respect for this game. All in all, it has a good story although static camera angles for long periods of time makes it difficult to commit to it, but unrefined gameplay. If you want to get into Assassins Creed, definately start with this one because it is a good steppingstone to the future games and also provides a good deal of story that is used throughout the series, but if you are looking back from Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and wondering if this one is worth replaying, just be wary and know that gameplaywise, this game is far less refined.
