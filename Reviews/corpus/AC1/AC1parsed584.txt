Well, lets face it, its an old game. By this I dont mean the graphics, theyr fine, but the game mechanics are lacking and even though there are plenty of extra to do, there really arent any point or use for doing them. Other than that, its the first Assassins Creed game, played it for the story and got what I wanted.
