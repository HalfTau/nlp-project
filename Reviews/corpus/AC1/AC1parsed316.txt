Im amazed that this game got such positive reviews upon release. While I applaude the mix of made up story with actual historical characters and events its intervened by some very drab gameplay elements which become awfully reptitive very quickly Evesdrop on people, pickpocket stuff, get permission for the kill on a high value target, make the kill, explore the city by climbing eagle towers, rinse and repeat over and over again.Also, there is a suprisingly small amount of actual stealth/sneaking for a game revolving around assassins. Most missions eventually will end up you being dragged in some fights involving very poor swordfighting mechanics multiple guys will stand around you and each in turn allow themselves to be butchered.I played about halfway through the game and gave up due to the sheer repetition of it all. As far as Im concerned Ubisoft gets a 10 for the ideas but a mere 5 for the actual execution of the ideas that made it into the final game.
