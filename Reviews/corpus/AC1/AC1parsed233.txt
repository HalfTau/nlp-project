The original Assassins Creed had many flaws. It was repetitive,  all nine main missions played very similar, there was a ridiculous amount of collectible flags with little purpose and there were only four weapons. Yet, all the same, Assassins Creed started one of the largfest franchises which are currently held by Ubisoft and all for the right reasons. Never before was it possible to parkour through such large areas and never before was there a game around assassinations done as cinematic as within this series.The first game does pale a lot im comparison to the Ezio saga which followed, but I did have fun once more playing through this so many years later. Its not without its flaws, as stated earlier, but it does contain all the soul it needs to be considered a great game if not a milestone of gaming history.If you never played it, itll be great. If you played all the other Assassins Creed games except the first one, you might want to skip it, but youll most likely like it too.
