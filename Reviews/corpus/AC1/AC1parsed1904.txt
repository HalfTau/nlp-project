I decided to come back to this game after few years, and i must say it stil looks awesome from graphic point of view and especially if you look at the story whitch is very immersive. It also have its bugs and gliches, repetitivnes of quests is kinda annoying but the main storyline is quite good if you disregard constant misions save the citzen or some other thet you do over and over again.But you must not forget that this is the first game in the AC franchise and so it is a bit unpolished and its sequels ar better in one more aspects, but again not all agree on this question. I give it 8/10 and say you have to at leaste try it to judge it.
