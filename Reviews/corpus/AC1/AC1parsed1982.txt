When it comes to Assassins Creed I always think, THIS was the game that I remember I was excited to see. Being able to free roam in a form of feeling like you could use everything in your enviroment was a HUGE step in games when this was released. The story is semigreat but after awhile the gameplay can become a bore. Going through and killing targets 1 after one, each location is the same. The enviroment itself and first time players will feel the excitement after the first few battles, then it slowly will become to a halt after it becomes a long story line of reputation. All in all, this is the staple for the series and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know where the series started from.
