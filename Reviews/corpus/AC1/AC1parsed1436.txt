One of the most boring repetitive games I have ever played... as a big fan of the Hitman series I was really looking forward to a good assassin game however this is more of a invincible swordsman simulator than a assassin game, you can literly take on a whole legion by yourself and win, every single assassination is the same as the other and every single side mission is the same as the other... even on sale Im sorry I got this game /
