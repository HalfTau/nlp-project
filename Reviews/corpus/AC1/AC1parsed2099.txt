There is no doubt that the first of the AC games is an unpolished gem. The repetitive sidemissions, journeying around, and overalert guards are pretty annoying, but the story the Assassin stuff in the Holy Land, not the futuristic pseudoscience t is pretty good and the actual assassinations are rather fun. Its just everything else is kinda... bleh. I started the series with AC2 and that was alright, though this being the start of the story makes it a natural place to start playing these games. The  sequels vastly improve the gameplay though, so keep that in mind if you plan to check out the entire series, start with this, and get irritated at all the little stuff that gets in the way of making this a great game. Overall, this gets a recommendation from me... barely. And only because it is a stepping stone to the much better sequels.
