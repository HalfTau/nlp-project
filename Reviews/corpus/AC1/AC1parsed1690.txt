The Beggining of probably my 2nd favorite series ever.Assassins creed is an Open World Stealth, Action, Adventure game. Set in the Holy Land in 1191 A.D.  You are Altair Ibn La Ahad  A member of the Assassin Hashashin order. You are a Master Assassin and are the Masters best man. You are an arrogant man and break the three tenants of the Assassins Creed and are stripped of your rank and forced to go out and kill 9 Targets and will discover a dark and deadly secret as you do this. You can Free Run up buildings, fight with your sword, assassinate with your hidden blade and fight with your fists among several other fun features. During the present day you are Desmond Miles a former Assassin brought to a top secret facility of Abstergo industries. Thats all i can really tell without Major spoilers for things that will affect our experience dfrasticaly and make it much less fun for you the first time. For 10 this game is amazing value and you can spend dozens of hours in the story, exploring the cities, and doing just random stuff. Sadly there is no Multiplayer in this title but there is later in the series. The reason I have 4 hours playtime is because I just brought this on steam but i had it on Playstation 3. So I highly reccomend this game. 9/10
