An interesting but very flawed start to this series. The Desmond modern day story is the star here with the only two highlights of Altiars story being the moment he meets the female Templar whose name slips my mind and the final battle. The core gameplay is solid but the things your tasked with doing are the definition of repetitive which foreshadows what this franchise would become.
