Overall, the game was really good and realy drew you in. I got it when it first came out and it was awesome!ProsOpen world and one that is truly vast and very highly detailed.Gameplay/Mechanics were simple, intuitive and easy to master.Good music and wonderful voice acting. Dunno its just me or not, but no voice acting oftentimes ruins a game for me save a efw rare exceptions Star Ocean The Secord Story, Legend of Legaia, etc.Adoring the parkour and running method, along with all the architecture built in to incorporate that.Being able to stalk your prey, gut em, then walk away as people start to freak was fun.Theres plenty of content to make for plenty of game time.There are several small things I wont list, as well, that make interactivity fun and interesting, at the very least. Especially during the cut scenes.ConsAs for being open world, keep in mind that there is a reason you cannot actually explore everywnere at once, but get sections of the full map. Id say way, but itd be a spoiler and you learn very early into the game as to what this is about.Sometimes, especially at the start, you may begin getting lost, minimap or no.Puzzles can be difficult, but not impossible.
