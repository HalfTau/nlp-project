Excellent game. If you want to use a controller you will likely need to remap the settings but that is the only real complaint about the PC version. For an game nearly 8 years old the graphics really hold up.The game is constantly on sale for 4.99 and I would highly recommend picking it up. Sadly there are no steam achievements but lets be honest  steam achievements would mean picking up collectibles and that is a HUGE timedump in AC1.
