Assassins Creed is a bit of a mixed bag. Its very well presented and entertaining, albeit repetitive and mundane at moments. My favorite aspects of the game are the story and general ambiance.The plot follows Desmond, a bartender whos kidnapped by a corporation due to his lineage to assassins. After hes forced into a simulation that recreates the past by using the users DNA, the player assumes control of Altair, a Crusadesera Middle Eastern assassin. After failing to follow a tenet of his organization, hes ordered to assassinate a set of targets in order to redeem himself. As he investigates his targets, he and Desmond begin to unearth a series of conspiracies. Its an interesting, wellwritten, and believable story. While it isnt remarkable, it manages to entertain.In terms of atmosphere, the game has a simply sublime aesthetic due to its blend of a Crusadesera Middle Ages and a modernday subtle cyberpunk setting. The art direction is also great, and as a result its visuals are arguably better than some later iterations in the series.However, gameplaywise, it fails to live up. The story segments are enjoyable, however, in order to reach these segments, Altair has to investigate his targets. This consists of repeatedly racing across the map, beating up a target for information, and so forth. The game is also infamous for its collectibles, which are arduous to collect and fail to provide a proper reward.Overall, Assassins Creed is worth playing if ones interested in it. Its a game that was simply too ambitious for the time, and was rushed out in order to sell to the new console generation.
