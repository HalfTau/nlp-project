When it first came out, way back in 2007 I was in awe of Assassins Creed. The crisp graphics, landscapes that almost feel like you are there, the intrigue of the TemplarAssassin conflict and the mystery surrounding what Vidic and Abstergo are after. I spent many hours free running across the rooftops of Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre and the diving off into bales of hay. And laughing as I sprinted across roof tops and leaping into the air before slamming my hidden blade into the back of an unsuspecting guards neck.However, even with the hours of fun this game gave me It alway felt that it wasnt quite the finished article. Each memory was a little too similar to the previous one and the lack of side quests added to the feeling that you were playing a game that ubisoft had rushed to launch. Fortunatley ACII solved all of those issues, but as an introduction to the series Assassins Creed is fine. Definitley worth purchasing if youre a fan of freeroam games and if you can get it on sale all the better.6.5/10
