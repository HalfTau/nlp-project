I recommend it as an Assassins Creed fan I played through all of them on console Xbox 360 The story from the games I played was good as I just rebought all of them Exept Rogue I thought I would start of with where it all began BUT as Im a windows 7 user I keep crashing on cutscenes which as you can understandme of but toying with the compatibility might help you outRegardless 9/10
