This game is the most repetitive piece ofI have ever played. There is nothing like doing the same things over and over again in 3 different cities. The game consists of Go to Acre/Jerusalem/Damascus, get the scoop on who you are supposed to kill, get all the viewpoints in the district you are exploring, do 3 of the 6 missions associated with gaining info on your target, grab a feather from your feather friend, kill the target, bathe the feather in the blood of your target, give the bloody feather to your feather friend, return to home base and get an earful from your  boss. You do this over and over and over, until the very end when you actually do something else for once. Every now and then you go back to present day as Desmond Miles, the person in the animus controlling the main character Altair, but nothing really ever happens.Also all of the characters are pretty trash, Altair apparently starts an  and becomes a good person at the end but I honestly couldnt tell because I did not care. The present day timeline with Desmond is also basically irrelevant since all it is is finding out that Templars still exist.All in all, the only reason you should buy this game is because you want the very little back story it holds before you play Assassins Creed II, or you have already played most if not all of the series and want to go back to its roots. Its a 3/10 from me.
