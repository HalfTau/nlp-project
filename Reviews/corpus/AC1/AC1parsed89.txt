Disclaimer for anyone thinking about buying this game it looks tempting, but looks arent everything. Im not a huge fan of the Assassins creed series I just never got into it, but I figured Id give it a try by starting with the first game. It looked like an amazing game before I bought it, and it was amazing for the first couple of hours. The story was by no means interesting in my opinion and really felt kinda bland especially when you were forced to leave the animus for no reason. Also, I think assassins creed would be a much more interesting game if they just completely ditched the sifi aspects of it and just made a game set in a historical time period. I honestly do not understand why they added that extra layer to the game when all it does is take away from the mildly interesting parts of the game. Finally, like many other reviews say the gameplay is repetitive, and as such, gets very boring, very quickly. I can understand people who like this game because they enjoyed the other assassins creed games, they probably didnt play this one as their first AC game though. Taken by itself, this game is just boring. Maybe assassins creed is a good franchise overall... maybe not. Either way, playing this AC game first was a mistake because it only makes me wary about buying any of the others.
