The remaster is excellent so the graphics are gorgeous. However, the controls are extremely complicated, often requiring three controls simultaneously to do something and its a very long list of actions, so the first couple of hours are painful, I had to write down the controls until I got used to them. Once you do it is a great game, if a little repetitive, and very enjoyable.
