Bought the game for 5 when it was on sale with the intentions of getting into the AC series but I found the game kind of boring and repetitive, seems like its 50 gameplay and 50 dialogue that is not skippable. The gameplay mechanics were pretty good and interesting though, just wish there was more action and less repetitiveness. The game reminds me of the film Wanted 2008, even the plot is pretty similar. Overall good game that could have been better, I might get into the series, Ill give AC2 a chance and see if Im better satisfied compared to AC1.
