Controls are broken at best, very long drawn out sneaking methods, and the story line progresses way to slowly. Way too much of the same enemy/friendly environment over and over. If you like climbing a tower over and over again and slowly traveling anywhere then this is for you. If you like action and substance then this is not. Shame... I heard this series was so good yet it seems so empty.
