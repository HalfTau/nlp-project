1 No running or you will be killed on sight.2 No galloping or you will be killed on sight.3 No walking on the roof or you will be killed on sight.4 Dirty thief! Ill have your hand for that!5 No loitering in the guards treasured personal space for more than two seconds or guess what?You will be killed on sight.6 No swimming or...never mind, youll die anyway.7 No bumping into people or you will be killed on sight.8 No climbing buildings or you will be killed on sight.9 If you dont slouch and leave one hand hanging while trotting at a snails pace on your horse, you will be killed on sight.10 They say it is a crusade! But a crusade for what? Ignorance? Violence? Infidel! Ill have your hand for that!Silliness aside, take these with a sackful of salt, as they are very subjective7.0/10Interesting, but doesnt tug too hard on those heartstrings.8.5/10If youre a history buff, you are in for a ride. The Holy Land! The Third Crusade! Islam and Christianity butting heads! Ancient conspiracies! Illuminati! well, not exactly, but close enough Violence! Madness! Infidel! Ill have your hand for that!8.0/10Nothing much to shout about, but if I walked through Syria eight hundred years ago, I think this would be pretty accurate.6.5/10If you are not a patient person, dont buy this game. Many a time I have pounded the table because something was tedious or inscrutably difficult. However, it wasnt so bad as to keep me from completing the game. Bringing some grey matter with you while playing is highly recommended.7.5/10Its not a bad game, but its not overwhelmingly awesome either. My main sticking point is in the gameplay. However, if you can tolerate that, I think you might like this classic.
