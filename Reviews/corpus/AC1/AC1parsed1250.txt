Love/Hate this game.Ive played through this game to roughly the 5075 mark because its a beautiful engaging game. At the time of release, the game was very original, set in an era that more games should explore. The controls work really well,and it looks great, but there are points in the game where I sit watching nothing, and listening to dialog that doesnt at all help me, or add to my enjoyment of the game.There are times where the game feels action packed and other times where tasks feel tedious. Thats what usually causes me to lose interest. Leaving me with a game that I like, but cant bare to finish.
