You can definitely tell that this is the original, but dont let that stop you from buying it. The controls at first seem very unwieldly, but after an hour of play, they become second nature and allow one to do numerous actions at once which you couldnt do otherwise. The storylines nice and it keeps you asking why. I will forewarn you that they do screw with Christianity and religion in general, but as the Assassins Creed is Nothing is true. Everything is permitted, it calls for wisdom in discerning between what is and what isnt. Assassins Creed asks us to question what really happened and to defend our answer, while still taking on the guise as a game. Also, assassinating people that have no idea their life is going to end is just kind of fun, in a sort of morbid way.
