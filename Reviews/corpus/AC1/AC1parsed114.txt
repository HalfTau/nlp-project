The start of the Assassins Creed games.Im gonna recommend this game if you really want to replay the AC Serie.The start of the game is really good and you willl have an amazing time with all sort of missions.After that you will go to other cities and go help people there.After a while I gotta say this becomes really repetitive. You get a mission, you go kill him, go back and you will have a 5 minute talk with your master. Do this 10 times and you have 1 big final mission. Thats the game in a nutshell but I still would recommend this !! !
