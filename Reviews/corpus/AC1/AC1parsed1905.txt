I played Assassins Creed II, III, and Black Flag before playing this and to some extent, I shouldnt have. Assassins Creed is, I think, a worthy predecessor to the series, but there are some flaws. Combat and movement feels very clumsy at first, after playing for a bit it still is, but you kinda get used to it. The story is also very repetitive. After completing the first three assassinations, you get the idea of what to do. It just gets too repetitive. The visuals, however, are amazing. It really is a feast for the eyes. For a game released in 2007 I think, the graphics are stunning. A bit low compared to modern games, but still impressive. If you can put up with a repetitive storyline and clunky controls, youll probably enjoy this game. Despite these cons, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this game.
