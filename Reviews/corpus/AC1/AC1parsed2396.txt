This is one of my alltime favorite series. Thats due more to Assassins Creed 2 than this game, but if youre going to play it, you should start with this one. From the creators of Prince of Persia, the animations are topnotch. Climbing, swordfighting, and horse riding never gets old, and it has a great story as well.I played the first game on PC. AC2 had some issues with their online DRM, so I avoided that and played AC2 on my PS3. I found that I preferred to play this series in the living room, so I got Brotherhood and Revelations on PS3 as well. But the game plays just fine on PC and I believe Ubisoft removed the online DRM, so thats no longer an issue.Sword fighting is graphic and bloody, and it only gets moreso later in the series, so probably not for the kiddies. The game contains some religious themes and tells a story that conflicts with the bible, so if that kind of stuff bothers you, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, its an excellent conspiracy theory.
