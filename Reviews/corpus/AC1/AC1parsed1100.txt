I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if youre a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if youre new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. Youre pretty much doing the same thing for 70 of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didnt catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if youre interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.
