I cannot in good confidence recommend this game. Even though the gameplay is solid and fun, the story telling is decent etc Ive played it on Playstation, so dont let the gametime fool you this game is... glitchy as . This makes Unity look literally flawless. The Unity launch was more stable than thisIve died from simple game mechanics on more than one occasion. My favourite one, jumping into a haybale. Sounds like no issue, right? Well, apparently haybales are solid ing blocks of instadeath in this game. On the very first view tower, I jumped down Did it more than once, mind you and died. After my corpse fell over, it launched off into the sky.Oh, and the fysics in this are the worst I have ever seen in my entire life. I can jump, suddenly stop mid air, then drop slooowly. If its too high, I am still gonna die though. Most awkward  game ever and I really honestly want my 10 back...
