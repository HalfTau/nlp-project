NOT A BAD GAME AT ALL, BUT I CANNOT RECOMMEND ITGraphics in 2008  10/10 we all got hooked because of the graphicsGraphics NOW  9/10 still great, with powerful 20102014 computers this game WILL SHINE on max settingsStory  3/10 boring, cheesy and confusing, the beginning of the Apples of Eden/Abstergo/Desmond Miles B.S. story, lolGameplay  6/10 decent stealth though not perfect by a long shot  block and parry combat no bugs, though repetitive youll also have problems trying to switch arms during combat, since you must first unlock the target yeah, it sounds confusing because it isSave system  0/10, just the typical autosave checkpoint SHIT that will AUTOERASE itself if you quit the game before finishing a mission youll get mad if your pc freezes while on a mission, youll have to start it since the beginningReplay value  4/10 the final save file will allow you to randomly replay ANY mission, so no point in playing the whole thing again since the beginning as Ive said, the story is lameconclusion the first AC was kind of barebones and unpolished despite the gorgeous graphics Id recommend it only for those interested in the Crusades, since its AWESOME to roam across the 12th Century JerusalemDamascusAcre and to kick some original templar but this game offers nothing more for people interested mainly in the gameplay, I say jump directly to AC II
