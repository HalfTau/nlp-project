i think its a must, and worth a buy with a discount,this is the first assassins creed game, i enjoyed playing it.the graphics are good.the story is great.the game system is a bit hard to get used to, and the tutorial is bad, but after a while it gets fine.full of mini delivery quests so some parts of the game get a bit boring.
