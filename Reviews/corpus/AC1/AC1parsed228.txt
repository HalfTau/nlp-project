I played the sequels first, and then this game just recently. I can see why it would have been so good during its time, but when you stack it up against the sequels it is easily the weakest entry in the entire series imo.That being said, this game is still pretty good, it just suffers from a number of annoyances. The controls are pretty odd feeling, and it takes moving through about 6 menus just to exit the game normally Exit simulation, exit animus, quit game, press start, enter profile, exit game... its ridiculous. You cant swim in this game, so falling in water kills you instantly. So if youre leaping around the docks and Altiar decides to leap in a random direction you didnt intend on, sucks for you cause youre gonna die. The last thing that annoys me the most are just the drunk guys that fumble around the streets. They are just such a fcking nuisance. They constantly go out of their way to stop you in your tracks or push you directly into a guard, getting you into a fight. And fights are tedious in this game because the combat is pretty bad Wait for someone to attack, counter, wait again, counter, rinse and repeat. I know the early sequels followed the same sorta combat system but at least they improved it with some more variation.So yeah, I just said a lot of sht about this game, but I guess I only said the bad because the game really speaks for itself in good aspects. Let me list a few A beautiful setting with some nice scenery, some good story telling/dialogue segments, and almost 20 hours of gameplay if you dont include collectables collectables arent all that important in the PC version. If youre not sure whether you want to buy the game with all its negatives, still play it just for the story and experience of where it all started. AC is a great series, and we all have this game to thank for it, the bad parts and all.
