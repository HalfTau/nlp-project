Disappointing storywise, but who cares. You have never felt so much more like a badass than when you have a group of twenty people surrounding you ready to tear you to peices, only for you to claw your way out using every assasination device on your body. Stealth kills are crazy awesome too, and I cannot forget to mention all the parkour and crazy awesome stunts youll be doing.Worth it, so I recommend it.
