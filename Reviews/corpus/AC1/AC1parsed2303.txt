This game starts off with a tutorial full of people that lack faces.I had nightmares for a few weeks, but then continued playing it.You play as some  with a deadend job whos ancestors were successful assassins and actually did things with their lives.While playing as an assassin, you can run up to innocent people, jump on their faces, and stab them in plain sight.Dont worry about being publicly shunned or being prosecuted, because the guards wont be able to find you as long as you sit in a garden or jump into a pile of hay. And everyone has 30second memory, so nobody will remember you.Your first mission is to betray your brotherhood and get a member killed.Very exciting game.Buy it onand use coupon code teddybear for a 5 discount.
