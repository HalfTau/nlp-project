This is where it all began.The game has definitley aged a lot, and you can see that. The graphics are subpar for this day and age. The quests are very repetitive. The mechanics are very clunky. But, when this game was released, it was cutting edge. It helped define RPG games that came after it.If you can look past that this is an old game, I highly recommend it. Or, if you havent played an Assassins Creed game before, you need to play this one. This is where the series started.
