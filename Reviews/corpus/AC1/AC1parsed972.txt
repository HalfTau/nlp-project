Overall Rating 7.5/10. Really excellent game storywise and a necessity if you plan to play through the Assassins Creed franchise so you understand everything and a pretty damn amazing looking game for 2008, looks way better then most games from that era. Gameplay is fun for like 35 hours then this game is just too damn reptitive.In my opinion this game is still definitely worth getting just know going in that its very repetitive but also short so its not too bad, enjoy!
