So I finally managed to finish it on my 3rd attempt, first two attempts took place back in the day when the game was released and both ended at 3hrs of gameplay max due to lack of mood. Maybe the game was better about a decade ago, but now its at best decent, a mediocre game which can feel both fun and frustrating at the same time. In comparison with some newer ACs this one being the most limited in structure comes with the advantage of not having so many bugs imo, I mean, no crashes, no FPS drops, one trouble being the full screen mode which bugs 100 upon alttabbing.Other PROS Good graphics the title has fine music and atmosphere, and the story can be catcy/interesting I also liked cultural diversityCONSThe mechanics suck now and then, parkour can get really frustrating at times, so clunky...Very repetitive absolutely everthing!!! basically repetion is what ruins what was a very nice concept for a next gen of its time. So, repetitive gameplay progression, repetitive combat, repetitive faces, even repetitive NPC audio lines, you name it...and the map is so full all the time making gameplay and combat so messy, especially closer to the end of the game when all hell breaks loose, and consisting obviously of the same repetitive NPCS, guards, more guards, brutes that you can steal throwing knives from, beggars, citizens carrying jars and crates, oh yeah, and almost forgot, junkies that push you simply for walking towards them..and Ill leave it at that.In conclusion, Id say better watch it on youtube if you want the story, otherwise its not really worth it anymore to lose 1520 hrs after so much time since release.
