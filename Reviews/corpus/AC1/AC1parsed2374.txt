Classic game. If youre new to the series then this game is very fun. However that fun dies out after a while as you just repeat the same missions over and over again. The best part of the game is freerunning and the actual assassinations. The setting in the Crusades is pretty cool and the world is wellrendered. Other than that, the game is quite mediocre. The story is okay. It definitely has its cool moments though so buy it if its on sale. Assassins Creed II makes references to this game so Id recommend playing this before the 2nd one, but its not necessary if you just want to enjoy the gameplay.
