Truthfully, this game is a step up from what it was on console. That being said, along with it being the first in a series that has been around for a decade and still creating games, its not all that necessary to play if youve already experienced some of the games that came later in the series. The present day missions didnt reveal much, and the gameplay as Altair can get a bit repetitive, but it does what a series starter should do best set up a story. And this game does just that. If youre looking to buy it, try to get it on sale if youve already played some of the other games because this one can feel subpar in comparison to the others. If its the first game youre buying in the Assassins Creed series, buy it as soon as possible. The series doesnt disappoint.
