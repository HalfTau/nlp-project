I finished this game on the xbox. Yes the missions were the same, but i really enjoyed my time playing the game. For me personally, i have a hard time playing this game on the PC. I wonder how the master race as you call yourself, are doing this. With a controller it is so much easier.I would recommend playing this on a console.
