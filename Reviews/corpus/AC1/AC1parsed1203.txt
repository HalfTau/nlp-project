This game was released on November 13, 2007. I am fairly new to the Assassins Creed series and just recently began playing the second game on PS3. I highly recommend this game to anyone who plays any of the Assassins Creed games. I wanted to play this one first because the storyline does connect to the other games and I didnt want to miss out. This game includes basic gameplay. No achievements, upgrades, money system, etc. Basic weapons and missions. The maps are very diverse and if you like challenges, you will enjoy flag hunting. There are a lot of flags to find throughout the game and several missions to complete.The PC version of Assassins Creed is the only one to have the Directors Cut Edition which includes 4 bonus missions. The following mission types are as follows Archer Assassination, Rooftop Race Challenge, Merchant Stand Destruction Challenge, and Escort Challenge. You will be able to play these in each kingdom you travel through. Though these bonus missions are very basic compared to the latest Assassins Creed games, they were unavailable on the console versions for the first game.Also, Jesper Kyd composed the music for the game. He is known for several video game scores including the Hitman series, a few Assassins Creed games, and Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, to name a few.I give the game 5 out of 5 stars. It was excellent and the storyline is awesome.
