Late review7/10Besides the repetitive story and missions, the first Assassins Creed is true to its story, youre playing as an Assassin after all during the year 1191? I forgot.. Theres no happy moments no friends to hang out with, Altair was a born and breed Assassin soon to be Master, your mission is to kill 12 targets your master has given you to redeem yourself.Its simple Gather intel Plan Assassinate your target Get in.. Get outAssassins Creed 1 is True to its objective, theres a brotherhood and a Master something the rest of the sequels fail to understand. Its not an adventure game where the main protagainst goes on adventures its about the life of an Assassin.The real reason why Assassins Creed game story fails everytime is because of the Animus, the game is nothing without the animus of course, but you dont get to see how the character lives youre constantly skipping through time, You dont know what your favourite Assasins food is? what his favoruite colour is? what his favourite weapon to use throwing knives? Sword? their opinion of the hidden blade.Ubisoft releases a book of their game with more indepth story and details, why cant they make the story of the book into their games...
