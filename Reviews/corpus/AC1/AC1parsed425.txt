Eh, still my favorite game in AC storywise. While all AC stories are good one way or another, I really wish theyd reboot it from the start someday, and fix their ultimate mistake they made with Unity that rendered their further works  unappreciated, even if actually good.Mechanics are surprisingly good, and story is just amazing.
