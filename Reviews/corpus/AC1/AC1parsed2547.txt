I bought this when it was uber cheap because I wanted a good adventure type game to play. Over all, it was very repetitive, the story was kind of terrible imho, and the gameplay wasnt very hard. I enjoy running from rooftop to rooftop, and being one stealthy mother er, but Id probably recommend it on a 4.99  9.99 price range basis.
