Warning this game does not have proper support for the Xbox 360 controller let alone the Xbox One controller. Even when using the Xbox360ce emulator, you end up with the game completely ignoring your triggers. This results in loss of the ability to lock onto targets and to switch to running mode in the game. Sure, you can still play the game with mouse and keyboard, but this is still enough to ruin it completely for me. It definitely feels like a lazy console port.
