This game is a bit odd. On the one hand its a good game with a cool concept. But on the other hand its taken back a bit by the fact that its just drowning in repetitive tasks. Get used to do the same three things over and over again. After a while it kills the immersion. I found myself doing the minimum of tasks just to get back to the plot. But all in all it was a good game that definitely got a much better sequel.
