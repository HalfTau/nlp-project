An absolutely fascinating premise, a game within a game dynamic that hasnt been exploited before. Its a stunningly realised Medieval world, and the first few missions are breathtaking. Hearing the characters speak, negotiating crowds, and running up walls and climbing is just pure joy. The draw distance is great also.
