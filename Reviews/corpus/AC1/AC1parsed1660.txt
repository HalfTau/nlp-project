I always kept myself away from the this game but I could no longer resist the deal on Steam and I have to say it was worth the money! Very fun game and beautiful how they created the environments. Only downside was that deeper into the game it got slightly boring as you only go to the same cities. But I still recommend you to play it atleast once!
