Pros Interesting plot Great parcour mechanicsCons Terrible controls Unfinished port from consoles without some options subs, windowed/fullscreen mode  switch and more, overall pure options. Strange combat mechanic. Repetitive quests and missions. Its cool first few hours, but further all that stuff is so boring. Its like some grind MMO, but not interesting single player game.
