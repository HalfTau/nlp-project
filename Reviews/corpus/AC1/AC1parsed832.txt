Its extremely repetive even at a very early stage. Its not that bad a game, its just boring a lot of the time. Its very mediocre in many ways, placing itself inbetween in most ways. The fights, for example, are a bit like hack and slash and most can be won just by hitting the same button again and again. Yet, you will still need to think a bit over how to approach the figth to win them when there are for example several enemies, just not enough to make it a tactical or skillneeding figthing game. So its neither real hack and slash, nor gives you the freedom to make advanced moves, its just a bit anoying inbetween. In the same way, an assassination game should have some element of sneak, acrobatic skill or tactic approach, but most of the time, you will find it boring to slowly walk through until finaly you just ram through and find out that you could just have done that from the beginning, again it places itself in an annoying inbetween. While you carry out a lot acrobatic stunts, you dont really do anything. Unlike older platforms games, the game does most of the things for you. Unlike an old platform classic like Super Mario 64 or Tomb Raider, you dont need to practice your skills and calculate how far to jump, find out just how much to pull the controller to get over the small bridge without falling down or anything like that. The game will make sure you dont fall down and almost always make the jump, and even if you dont, it doesnt really matter. Assassins Creed is a good example of how much many modern games hold your hand, leaving out all the fun of having to focus and using all your skills to win. Its repetitive and drags simple things out instead of giving real challenges. There are so many better games out there for you to use your money and time on.
