I dont understand the love of this series, sure the game is enjoyable but it is so ridiculously formulaic to the point of tedium.The game essentially repeats itself in its entirety half a dozen times with an incredibly minor change in target and setting.Ive been told that this one is the least repetitive and tedious of the games prior to III, if that is true then good god the others must be dull.I wouldnt recommend at anything other than Steam Sale prices.
