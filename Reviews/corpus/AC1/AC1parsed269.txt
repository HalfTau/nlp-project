As the first Assassins Creed I ever played, I have to say I enjoyed it a lot. The story was pretty good overall. In each act the player gets to choose where to go for their next target between what targets are available and how much information they want to have before the assassination even if there is a minimum, which I like since it doesnt restrict the players actions too much. The mechanics are pretty well designed for the game, but are a slighly difficult to get used to in my opinion. The only thing about the game I didnt really like was the last assassination since it didnt feel completely fulfilling the way it carried out. The ending on the other hand was pretty good and got me wanting to play the next game in the series.I would definitely recomend this game for people looking to get into the series or people who want to try out a game like this.
