The original. You can see the precursors to the second and penultimate, IMO game. There are a lot of frustrating choices made, but the game is fun and the period, story and set peices are well done. If you want to stip right to Assassins Creed 2, feel free. Youre not missing much, plus they backtrack to cover any story you might be missing. Plus you could just read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia.
