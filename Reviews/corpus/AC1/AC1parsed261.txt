This is the game that started it all. Assassins Creed has had influence on many items, from movies to other games let alone the series it spawned. This game is slightly clunky, but as it is the first in the series, one can forgive any little flaws, the same way some artists early works are not as refined as their later efforts. It is fun, and has an immersive story which is somewhat literal in respects.As the only of the series I have played at this point though I have bought a few, I am unsure how the series goes through anything other than hearsay, but those rumors indicate that this is still one of the best. Also, I do wonder if the Arkham games took a few of this games ideas as basis for their own success...
