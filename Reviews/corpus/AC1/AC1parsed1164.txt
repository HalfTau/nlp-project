Nice game better then any assassin creed franchise. But, the story is very simple go to assassin bureu, find information about the target, kill the target, listen their conversation, escape the city, hiding in assassin bureu, back to Masyaf, and do it over and over again. Also there are no minimap so you need to open map every time u lost. i reccomended u to buy this game but, make sure u have a compass if you wanna play this game.
