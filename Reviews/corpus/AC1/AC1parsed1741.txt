The gameplay is pretty fun but the combat is very repetitive, as is the majority of the game which pretty much consists of multiple areas of doing similar things over and over.The plot is quite interesting but seems to have too little spread out over the game. There are times where you dont even really think about the game having a plot since youre too busy just doing the tasks in each area, especially if you try and do them all to get al information and help.Overall the game is still fun to play, Id give it 7.5/10.
