Pretty trash. This probably lay the groundwork for much better games but I pretty much regret wasting an entire day on it and not going straight to 2. The mechanics are super clumsy and infuriating. The bmovie plot is literal garbage. All of the characters are one dimensional dumbdumbs. They try to push this whole moral greyness thing but always show your target doing something egregious first. Eating babies or whatever. Its like grow a pair. Challenge me. Also the scifi bit is horrible.I liked the Middle Eastern setting in the most superficial sense but I think I should have spent my day working and saved up for a trip to Israel.
