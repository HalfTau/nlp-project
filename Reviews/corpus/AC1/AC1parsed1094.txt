Wow, Ive never picked a game in this series up until now. In a way, its amazing this series took off. Its a great idea, a wonderful gameplay conceit that allows it to be gamey via an ingame explanation the Animus. The story is good, like a Dan Brown novel. The gameplay is tight and refined, considering its the first entry in the longrunning series, and the graphics are decent considering the age. All that said, its amazing it all ever went anywhere as horribly repetive and rote the game becomes about halfway through! Unless you purposefully break the monotony by doing optional tasks, its basically a rinsenrepeat of go to this town, do 2 or 3 information gathering tasks, kill a guy. It wouldnt be so bad if it were an 8hour game, but its probably more like 15. I couldnt keep doing it. I skipped to AC2. Recommended only if you must see how the series started, but otherwise, skip it, the sequels are much better, and watch a Youtube video of the story segments in this game to fill in the gaps.
