I give it an 8/10.First in the series... Definitely should be the first one you play.My biggest complaint about this game is that there are no rewards for getting the bonuses or killing templars.Other than that, really fun.But so far, I think AC2 is my favorite, followed by AC Brotherhood tied with AC Revelations...Each one has better gameplay, but AC2 had unique puzzled temples which were intriguing to climb through.I am about to start on AC3 now.
