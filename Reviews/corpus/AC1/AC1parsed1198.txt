This game can get a bit repetitive and linear at times, but it still proved to be a lot of fun. I got to kill people, and then upgrade my ability to kill people. The story line was good as it brought about more killing, and the graphics were good, especially the ones where you got to be murdery. This probably sounds like the rant of a psychopath... But its still a fun game. I liked Altair more than Ezio, which is probably the minority opinion. For the start of the series this worked pretty gosh darn well, the health mechanics as it related to the storyline was one of the more inspired ideas. Buy it, kill some gaurds and templars, throw some knives and nap in some bureaus.
