An older game but still a great one. If you havnt tried the assassins creed genre yet, start from the begining. The storyline is great the world is spectacular, and the fighting is good. Its an old game so its not too expensive but I believe anyone would enjoy it. Yes, parts of it is repetative but that doesnt make it any less fun.
