I love the Assassins Creed games but the first one was deathly boring to me. The plot/script feels very rushed and the gameplay is totally barebones compared to any of the sequels. If youre new to the Assassins Creed games, Id reccomend starting with AC II and then learning about Altairs story by playing AC Revelations.
