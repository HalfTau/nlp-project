If you have the original, or an saftycopy from a torrent site, then use that instead of the steam version. It is soo full of bugsSuddenly some haystacks in carts/on ground have turned into concrete. If youre lucky, and have a big amount of hp, you dont die, otherwise, you just start from where you took a flag, or synchronized.The 40th King Richard flag, has all of a sudden gotten even more impossible to get. 20 tries before I moved on. It cannot be taken. Tried different positions before running off. Even tried going from the flag above to see if it did anything different, but unfortunately not.If youre one of those players that wants to collect everything in AC1, then PLEASE, for your good, dont play the steam version
