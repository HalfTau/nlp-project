Its Buggy, controls can be awkward when you first play, there are an excess of menus, and missions can be fustrating and annoying by how they are designed, yet inspite of all of this, the game managed to captivate my attenion and keep me coming back for more.It has an alluring atmosphere, intresting characters, and an alright story. The voices can be a bit bland, the ending is a little weak, and the Desmond scenes feel like an abrupt stop sign, but overall the story still works.This is my personal favorite of the Assassins Creed Series. This is the original Assassins Creed, and despite what some may think about more recent installments in the series, this game still delivers the experience that made the series so popular.There is a high resolution fan mod I would recommend with this, you can find it in the guide section for this game.
