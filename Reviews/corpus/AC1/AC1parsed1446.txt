The phrase is this a glitch or a feature comes to mind often. Still fun when it isnt glitching out but it can get controller throwing irritating very fast and dont even get me started on trying to just EXIT THE GAME. I dont even try anymore I just save and then close it via Taskmanager. I reccomened it when its on sale for 5 bucks or less but dont waste full price on it.
