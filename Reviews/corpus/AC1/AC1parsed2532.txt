This game is worth playing through just for the story. The gameplay is good, but it is also repetitive!Forget getting all the collectibles, and forget doing all the side missions. Just play through it for the story. Why? Because Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood is so good and improves so much over this game that its worth playing through to get the full experience.
