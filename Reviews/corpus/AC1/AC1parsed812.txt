The first Assassins Creed was a good game for its time but it definitely has not aged well. The good things about it is that its a great addition for a die hard AC fan. You get to play as Altier and know his backstory before the other ancestors in the franchise.When this game was released, the environment was quite rich in innovative and the NPCs acted and reacted to your character realistically. For its time, it was quite an achievement. However, the later games definitely are better than this one.I will list the cons. Repetitive Always have to select the Xbox controller setting every time you start the game. Crashing You have to use a mod to have your Xbox controller configured correctly. There is no in game reward for collecting flags and killing templars except for bragging rights.I would definitely recommend playing this game after playing the later AC games just to see the back story and how the whole franchise started. The storyline is actually very good with twists and turns. However, if you arent a big AC fan then you can go ahead and skip this one.
