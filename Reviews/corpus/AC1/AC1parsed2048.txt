If youve never played an assassins creed game before... I dont know if i would suggest starting with this one. I would more likely suggest you try playing the second one in this series. If you like the second one then come back to this one. Im not saying this games bad but I feel like the second game makes more of an impact on the player to make them get more involved and invested in this amazing series.
