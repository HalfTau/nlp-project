Much like the first Mass Effect, Assassins Creed is more noteworthy for what it tried to achieve than what it actually did. The missions are somewhat repetitive and the AI is occasionally confoundingly clumsy but the nested narrative is oddly compelling, helping to set up one of the most iconic lores in modern gaming. The sheer freedom it grants you goes well beyond what even some of the later games in the series achieved, offering myriad ways to handle each assassination rather than relying on the constraining optional objectives that were relied on so heavily in Revelations and III, and despite its age it still looks bloody gorgeous. With its nuanced storytelling and intuitive combat and freerunning, AC far exceeds its shortcomings.
