So Ive long been looking forward to play Assassins Creed and have heard so much good about the series. Now I finally got into it but Im SO dissapointed! Its one of the most repetative games I have ever played. I can take the view points but I sure wish there was more variety to the save citizen and assassinations. I kind of want to just hurry through the actual storyline and skip all these side stuff, but at the same time I want to complete the game 100, but playing this is starting to feel like a chore...and a game should not make you feel that way! Decent graphics and location settings Storyline is okay Repetative! At times strange and a bit clunky controls. No challenge whatsoever for a decent gamer. The game should feel lucky Im not too good at games!
