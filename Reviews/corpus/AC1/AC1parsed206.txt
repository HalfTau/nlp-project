I know Im very late to the party on this game. Only 9 years... bu this game is outstanding. When I first played it, I didnt know the release date, and I wouldnt have guessed 2008.ProsStarts the story to a very good series. Without the first game, some of the future references wouldnt make as much sense.The story is crucial to the rest of the series.Graphics are very good for a game that is this old. Dont expect lifelike, but its good enough for the first game in the series.ConsControls are a bit... odd...The gameplay is very repetetive.You will want to throw your mouse at some point for running instead of walking and causing suspicion. /
