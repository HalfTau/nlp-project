One of the classics from the early 360/PS3 era. You play as Desmond, a test subject for a mysterious project which involves the use of a machine called The Animus. The Animus transports the subject into the body of any ancestor from the subjects bloodline, via genetic memory. Altair is the ancestor of choice in this game. Theres so much running and jumping itll make you want to take up parkour. The animation is beautiful as well as the worlds. The worlds are so impressive, visiting places like Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, each having its own distinct feel and design. Certainly a work of art. Buy it, play it, love it.
