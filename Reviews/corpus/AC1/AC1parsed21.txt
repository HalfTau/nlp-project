The game has a good story and some interesting gameplay mechanics. The one flaw this game has that grinds at me at times is the repetative combat. Attack, Parry, Repeat, Break defense, Attack, throat stab. Overall you can find enough ways to jump on enemies or fight a large group, but the story is really what caught my attention.
