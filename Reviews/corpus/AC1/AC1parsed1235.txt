Assassins CreedCompared to Assassins Creed II, this game is unexciting and bland. Its really disappointing as the first entry for the series. Having completed Assassins Creed II and subsequent games in the series, I can say the whole plot behind the Assassins Creed franchise is great and well designed. Various weapons and fighting styles, use hidden blades and swords to strike down foes. Free climbing and running, you can scale walls and buildings. A lot of the environment can be interacted with. Constant crashing on the latest GPUs, GTX 970 4 GB 2015, to the point of being unplayable. The game world seemed really dull during my brief playthrough. Its quite bleak and lacks a lot of colour. The controls were also an abomination. Graphically its nothing fantastic. Even during release it was arguably poor graphics for its time. For a game about assassination its surprisingly lacklustre when it comes to the act itself. Its not really a stealth game, there arent many creative ways to carry out assassinations...its just odd. Assassins Creed II struggled with this as well, but it was far more fun and interesting, so I can forgive it. Constant repetition with menial tasks, like eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Boring. Pause interface is obstructive and annoying.Overall Score 4/10In my experience the games in the Assassins Creed series are decent but have never had that wow factor. Assassins Creed is probably the worst, and well worth skipping. Starting with Assassins Creed II is your best bet. You wont miss out on much of the vital story anyway, and youll save yourself from this painful game.Its definitely not good, or anywhere close, but its not horrific at the same time. Its just ehh..very, very bad.
