This is not as good as assassins creed II, brotherhood and revelations. But story of Ezio Auditore makes me to find out how great was Altair in battles against cruisaders. Compared to Ezio Auditore, Altair is forced to finish many repetetive missions. Unlike mentioned iterations of the Assassins Creed franchise, the first game has a basic plot. Despite of mentioned negatives it is still fun to fight, climb and sneak around in the historical versions of Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus and in such an intuitively way.
