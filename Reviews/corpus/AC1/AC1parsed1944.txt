When I first played this game, I was very disappointed. First of all, I wasnt playing Ezio, which really bugged me because I knew nothing about the other assassins second, I was VERY confused by the way they incorporated the Animus into the game, and had you switch between history and modern times. And finally, it can be pretty damn frustrating to have to walk across an entire city to simply avoid alerting guards those cities are huge, man! But after I was about halfway through, I began to appreciate it. Altair is, in fact, a really badassassin, and the switch between modernity and history actually makes more sense in this game than it does in the others. Though you need to be a paitent player to enjoy this game, I think it was worth every hour I put into it.
