So here it is. The first, the one that started it all...and its ongoing yearly Or so sequels and add ons.Short at sweet....for me one of the most overrated games EVER!....BUT, I will say that its actually quite fun and has a damn lot of atmosphere. Its the Batman Arkham assylum before there was one. Unfortunately, theres this huge open world which goes to waste, for the most part you go looking for flags and stuff....to what ends? Just to collect things with no reward?This is why the sequels did so much better.Regardless, the story  is great, graphics are rather nice, even for an 8 year old game and sets the stage for the sequel, which in my opinion was a much better use of open world.Ill still recommend this though.
