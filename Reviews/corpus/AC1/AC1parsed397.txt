Assassins Creed is the beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. The first game, telling the story of Master Assassin Altar IbnLaAhad, is an engaging and entertaining, story rich, and unique adventure into a combination of action, adventure, parkour and stealth. The game sets up, perfectly of course, an extremely lengthy and profitable, at that series of historical discourse between the Assassins Guild and the Templars, who struggle for ideological and political dominance over mankind. While the series is played backwards through a machine, The Animus, in this game, popping in and out of Altars world is not disrupted by the frequent snaps to reality as Desmond Miles. The PC version of this game unfortunately, while hard to control for some, has frequent crash issues, which disrupts the aesthetic and immersion of the game and savegames too. This game is not necessary to understand the Assassins Creed series, but it sure does help, and the PC version is bearable.
