Despite all of the issues with the sries currently, this game is an absolute gem. This is one of the games that got me into gaming. The story is interesting, I love Altair, and the game itself is really fun, with some really ingenius combat for its time. The graphics are a bit bland and colorless, and it may feel quite dated, but those really arent reasons to judge a game anyway. If you like stabbing things, freerunning, or feeling like an unmatched badass, this is your game.
