Well, I played it for the story. I was very disappointed that it could have been summed up in a paragraph. Gameplay is a big step down from the other games not a bad thing really, just means the devs have improved a lot. I would recommend skipping this title, look up the story on the wiki before playing the other games.I think Im glad I played revelations before this one. Had I played it first, I wouldnt have the dedication to even finish the game, let alone buy the second one.
