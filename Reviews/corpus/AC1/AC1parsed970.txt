Truly a good game.  Still one of my favorites in the series.  I started gaming with mouse and key board recently so I may be a little bias, but it seemed to be a little smoother with a controller.  Also there seems to be a few more bugs than there were on the xbox 360 version from what I remember.  Nothing serious, you may just not be able to survive a couple leaps into hay bails and one in the tutorial mission that may make you have to restart the game.  Overall I would give it a 9.5 / 10.
