One of my favourites, if not personal favourite in the series.The setting is perfect, controls can be clunky at times but theres a combination of fluidity and harshness that makes combat feel GOOD in this game. Traversing the world is enjoyable, and the story is enjoyable.Missions are rather repetitive, but never enough to detract entirely from the game. That being said, for any newcomer Id highly recommend reading a synopsis and jumping into Assassins Creed 2. The gameplay is arguably much superior, and the missions are much less repetitive.That being said, it is a great game unto itself, if a bit aged.
