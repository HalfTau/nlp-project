Assassins Creed does deserve to be acclaimed for its contributions to the stealth genre. From its innovative exploration of environments, including the addition of parkour and tiered levels, to the simplicity and immediacy of its control system even if Altair sometimes runs into the wall rather than UP them!Not only this but its excellent for its explorations of philosophy albeit rather simply and conflict of religion, by chosing the era of the Crusades, something it handled rather one sidedly Christians were very obviously evil, but did at least question the morality of the Assassins and the protagonist himself.In fact Altair is still one of the most memorable of the characters from the series, progressing from selfconfident, narcissistic fool to more mature and conscientious assassin.Unfortunately the game did interrupt this progression with the annoying scifi sequences inbetween where we encounter Desmond, however I suppose he does form a viable narrative link to Ezio in the future games, so this annoyance can be somewhat overlooked...Its still a good, easy game to play even now, with a narrative that will remain as timeless as a Dan Brown novel.
