NOTE Only worth it if it is on sale, game play is repetitive but fun for awhile.The graphics are okay and the plot is decent, but where this game really shines is the world size and freedom. You run around huge cities however you like, climbing up walls jumping from roof to roof and assassinating key targets... or anyone you please really. Youll die quite a bit until you figure out your specific fighting style but after that you can hack and slash all you please without any major issues. The one drawback is this game is repetitive as hell, the quests are always the same and the story line just isnt strong enough for me to bother with it. I play to kill some people and run around the tops of buildings pretending like Im some badform of Aladdin for a few minutes but that is about it. Overall worth it if you can get it on sale, otherwise dont bother.
