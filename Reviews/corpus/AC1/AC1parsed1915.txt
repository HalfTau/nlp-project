For all its hype perhaps its the series in whole, the first game in the Assassins Creed Series is boring at best.The story is light, perhaps only gets interesting once you reach Robert De Sable.This is repetetive gameplay with pretty visuals and reasonable audio.The side missions are completely filler material and prove very little value to a story driven promise.On the plus side, controls are responsive confusing at start, camera and parkhour generally works 90 of the time.I guess youd play it if you plan on playing the entire series.. what choice is there?
