Assassins Creed 1 is a mediocre start to the Assassins Creed series.Gameplay is simple. Go to city, do quests, do assassination, and get kicked out of animus.Do that a few times and the twist ending and you have the game.Gameplay 6/10Sound 7/10Story 8/10Overall the game is alright. Rush straight through the game to get to Assassins Creed 2.BTW no window mode
