I think its a 3/10 controls are really hard and the fights to and the game is very confusing.Edit I played the full game and it was ok. 7/10 it was hard controls but that may be because i played Blackflag before this one. Some setups were a bit weird. If you failed it and got caught by guards then you kill them or run away i killed them And then there were dead bodies in front of the guy i was suppose to kill so he got alerted and i couldnt do it. So i went and did another setup instead
