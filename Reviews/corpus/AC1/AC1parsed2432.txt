Buy it cheap and suffer through the frustrating controls. It isnt a bad game, it just isnt quite polished, yet. I really think you should try to finish it anyway, if only because it gives you an introduction to one of the best story arcs to hit a video game series in... ever? Believe me the sequels get better!
