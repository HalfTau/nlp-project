Assassins creed has many awesome mechanics and a very interesting story.However, the mechanics mostly fail and the story is extremely predictable.The combat goes from extremely difficult to super easy after the first mission. The freerunning often causes you to jump off random ledges killing yourself, the set up missions are extremely boring and repetative, and the world  being set up in the middle east  looks like a poorly textured sand dune.Here is why I recommend this game The story, while predictable, is great. Its extremely interesting and it sets up the world fantastically, the side characters are well developed and have strong motivations, and while the set up missions are boring and repetative, the main missions are interesting and pretty solid.Im really hoping that as the series develops the mechanics tighten up and the story continues in a similar fashion, but with less predictablity. The only thing that I would change is I would add a stealth mechanic. The missions could be far more interesting with one.If you are interested in playing I would recommend just doing the minimum amount of set up missions per area and rushing through the game and enjoying the story. Im only a few hours in Assassins Creed 2, but most of my complaints are answered by it so far.I give it a 4/10. Blamo.
