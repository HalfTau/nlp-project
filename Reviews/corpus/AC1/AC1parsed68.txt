This is my personal experience, you may not find this in your gameplay.Buggy as hell. During the very first tutorial the game would constantly glitch in multiple ways and at different parts. These glitches gave me no other option every time they happened other than to restart from the menu and redo what Id already done multiple times before, including the cutscenes. In the end I had to refund, and couldnt get past the first part. Also, id like to add that my computer DOES meet all of the games requirements. Judging from my irritating experience, I cannot recommend this game when this kept happening to me.
