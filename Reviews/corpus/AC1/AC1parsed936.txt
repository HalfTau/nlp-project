Here are my notes while playing the game if you dont have time to read them DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! ITS NOT WORTH IT.Pros Premise of the story has a lot of potential Very easy to run. GPU usage is 2030 GTX 970, CPU usage is 10 i7 3820 Running and climbing is a good idea let down by poor implementationNegatives tutorial is buggy and repetitious intro was intriguing yet boring at the same time. Go figure! buggy fighting mechanics it was very hard to control your character game has a lot of hand holding confusing messages in the UI mission consists of 1. Travel for ten minutes to city 2. Gather information twice 3. Plan attack 4. Attack never goes as planned the fact that you have time to interrogate the target before he dies means it must be a stealth kill for privacy but never happens alerts only go off when in hiding places even if you have not been found for 10 mins story is Altiar is arrogant and foolish, gets demoted despite still being sent on missions to kill key targets. Assassinations are clumsy but they are planned that way for story, if this is true there is no need of planning attacks if it always boils down to a fight. Desmond parts could at least let you run making exploration less time consuming and annoying. the introduction from every assassination is boring and long story gets interesting midway but the bad mechanics still hinder experience menu wont start with controller activated you cant swim FFS BUG! I attempt a mission to kill kill 3 soldiers, I killed two out of 3 failing the mission but when restarting mission dead bodies are still on floor alerting guards to my presence. Pathetic! these NPCs that are deranged pushing you every time you walk past are annoying and unnecessary boss fights are really bad. Chase till he stops then fight 20 guys, keep hitting boss till your player assassinates him automatically.
