Bought on 75 summer sale, purely so i could play through the game that started the franchise.Sadly, It keeps crashing every 10 minutes or so...Will try find a patch or fix if one exists then write an actual review.Im guessing it has issues with newer PC builds.Update Read the comment from Strazdaz, it fixed it for me. Thanks Strazdas! My rig specs arei7 4790K16GB DDR3GTX480Win764
