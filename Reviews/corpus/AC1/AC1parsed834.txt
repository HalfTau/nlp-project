I had Assassins Creed when it first came out on Xbox 360. When it first came out, it was a novel game, running around, gathering information, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and exploring beautifully rendered environments. Despite the control frustrations and the repetitive gameplay, it was still fun. However, with newer Assassins Creeds coming out all the time, you can look back and see just how bad the original Assassins Creed actually was. The game got completely left behind with its sequel Assassins Creed II with a much better character, better mechanics, better almost everything I think Lucy was slightly better modeled in AC1 over AC2.... Running around doing the same few things over and over and over again just to do one unique assassination, just feels more like a chore than fun. If youre thinking about getting this game for nostalgia, just skip it... unless you REALLY enjoyed it. If youve never played the Assassins Creed franchise before and just want to start, seriously start with Assassins Creed II. The story here isnt all that important and a nice recap is given at the beginning of Assassins Creed II.
