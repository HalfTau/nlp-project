Ive started playing through all the old AC games again for nostalgic reasons I guess, and I can honestly say that you might as well skip this one unless its on sale and youre a really big AC fan. A couple of issues with this game The controls can feel very slow and clunky at times, especially when youre climbing towers which you will be doing A LOT, the missions can get really repetitive pretty fast, walking through the streets and hearing people saying the same lines over and over again can get pretty annoying, same goes for the music when you get in a fight with a couple of guards, the vigilante missions where you help civilians feel like a chore and I got to the point where I just stopped giving aabout them because theres absolutely no fun in doing them.I had to change and replace some of the games files because the native controller support is worthless AC2 has the same issue. It didnt take too long to fix it but its something they couldve easily patched in if they actually gave aI also noticed at certain points the framerate seems to drop for no reason at all and theres nothing I could do about it.I liked the story and most of the actual main assassinations were pretty cool, but for 9,99 I would definitely skip this game. It was a great game for its time but it hasnt aged as well as I had hoped. Again if youre like me and youre trying to play through all the old AC games again, you might as well skip this one and start at AC2
