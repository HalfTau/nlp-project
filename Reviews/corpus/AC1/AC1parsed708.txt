For its time, a groundbreaking game. I really enjoyed it and have played through it 3 times now. The last time modded out with updated graphics.The storyline was the best part. Some of the busy work isnt that bad since it was the first game in the series but they should have learned that gathering flags and feathers is a waste of time. The following games improve on the story line but sadly they also continue the busy work side quests. For people with OCD like me, this can be a nightmare because we want to complete the game in its entirety. If you can complete the mission without them, just ignore the side quests and go for story line. It will be much more enjoyable.
