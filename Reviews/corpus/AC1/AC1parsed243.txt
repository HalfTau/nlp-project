So is this game still worth buying/playing? Having just beat Syndicate and awaiting Origins, I decided to replay it.In short, surprisingly, yes. Despite all the things Im about to say, I did enjoy playing the game and would recommend it to others.The graphics were not so great, but its expected. The story was decent enough, and worth going through if youve forgotten it for later games.Another thing to note is that this game is not really a stealth game like the series later evolved into. For the most part, planting yourself and slaughtering the guards after you is more effective than running, and there are almost not true stealth kill missions. On top of that, the game is missing the nearly essential stealth kill moves like haystack kill, ledge kill, and even the drop kill. So go into the game expecting more of an action feel.The thing that really ticked me off was the control scheme. There was a never ending stream of explitives as I accidentally jumped off walls, jumped into water, or jumped pretty much anywhere dangerous.TLDRDecent game, especially if you plan to play the others, but expect to wrestle with the controls.
