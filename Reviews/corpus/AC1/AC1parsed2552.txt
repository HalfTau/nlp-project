Okay. Heres the deal with Assassins Creed. Its a really great jigsaw puzzle that somebody put together all wrong. Its a little bit like God of War, but dont think youll like it because you liked God of War.I dont know. I dont want to hate on it, because I really do like it. Its a fun game. There are just things about it that dont make sense. For example riding your horse past soldiers at high speed makes them chase you.And its not like they chase you, catch you, then you have a conversation like you shouldnt ride so fast on the highway. They chase you, they catch you, they kill you. because you were galloping down the goddamn highway.The idea of the game and the story of it are really, really cool. But the game itself is a little bit hard to play because of things like that. But I maintain my former opinion try it and you might like it, because this is actually a good game. Its just got its little quirks.Get the demo and see if you like it.
