Wonderful Graphics, though it does tend to lag a lot after a few hours of gameplay. The storyline is well written, keeping the gamer intrigued as they play. I have been constantly on my toes waiting to see what will happen next. The difficulty level pleases me. I have to say it has been one of the most addicting games I have ever played. I highly recommend this game for those that seek thrilling games with heavy twists and turns!
