I play AC2, ACB and ACR before this and have to say that is was a disappointment. I get its the first game it needed work but really doing the same thing over and over again and again. If it wasnt for my OCD I would have never finished this. Get the spark notes, skip this game and go to AC2. Almost nothing but the ending has any real meaning anyway.
