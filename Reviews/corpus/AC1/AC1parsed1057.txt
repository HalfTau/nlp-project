Assassins Creed is a very ok game. the gameplay gets rather boring and repeatative and i find the combat system to be a bit touchy at times but the game is really great other than that. the storey is where this game shines which spawns a crap ton of sequeals. It is the first chapter so youre  better off watching the game than playing the game. Overall the game is just at an ok with its gameplay being the same over and over again but the plot getting invested in the game.
