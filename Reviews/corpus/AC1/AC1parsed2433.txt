I want to like this game I really do, but its just such apoor job of converting it to pc its unforgivable.Firstly it takes 4 menus 2 load screen and a conformation box to exit the game, which in all take about 40 secconds.The HUD is crap, its an xbox dpad, useless for a 1234 keyboard layout.the controls fair no better, it is a littral mapping of pad A  LMB, etceach button does about 3 things depending if your holding control or shift, I have 152 keys let me use them!Aside from that, the game is pretty slow paced, building up to the assisintations, which isnt as bad as it seems, despite the game trying its best to make movement not feel slow, becomes a chore.It does have some spark to it, the climing animations is fanstasticly well done, and fighting is enjoyable, but you have very little connection with  the enviroment around you, nothing ever changes or progresses, making playing it seem pointless.
