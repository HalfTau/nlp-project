Stupid game. Bore action, repetable and awful fight mechanics. Maybe, at the year it apeared, few got excited, but now, after you play some real open world games, you realize that Assassins Creed I its a game with a lot of issues. I have waste 20 hours of my life with this canadian crap. The move mechanics of Altair, the hero of the game, are still an enigma for me. There were moments in game when soldiers were trying to catch me and the hero just stoped near a wall. The reaction time of the hero is poor  after you take one or two hits, he finally reacts. You have to discover missions witch are the same after climbing some tall buildings  whats the point of climbing in the game? Its a game for xbox or ps, and playing it at pc was not confortable at all for me.  Maybe, the other parts of the game are better, but the first one was far away from my expectations based on the good critics of the game. And I have to say that the killing Robert De ... mision was impossible for me. Onestly, I like a game where you got the fighting moves in short time. It is not the case here. The fight moves of this game are extremly complex I bet even the ones that create this game, cant win some fights and you have to alternate them quickly. Conclusion I would abandoned the game from its begining, but I payed for it and I stubbered to play. Big mistake!!
