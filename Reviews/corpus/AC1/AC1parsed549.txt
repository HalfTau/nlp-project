Dont let the play time fool you Ive beaten the game. This was before playtime was counted. It was fantastic back then, but when I went to revisit, it was unplayable. Dated havoc engine. 144hz when you do the leap of faith you land on the BOX portion of the hay and die. Changed to 60 hz and game ctds. rip 10/10. Game is 10/10, but playability 0/10 on modern computers.
