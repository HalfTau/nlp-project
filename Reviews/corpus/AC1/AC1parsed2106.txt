The original one. Must play. Its different form its sequels but I like the fact that it is historically correct Assassins existed... during the Third Crusade. There are few weapons and missions are a little repetitive but I like the setting a lot. Sometimes AI does weird things and some bugs are hilarious.Oh! Also, no UPlay
