I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this game is. I bought the first 5 games of series because of the popularity and started with the AC 1. I wanted to start at the beginning of the story. First the game is beyond repitive. You have like say maybee 6 different quests and thats it. Its the same quests over and over and over. Then the maps are the same exact looking areas doing the same exact quests. Oh yea and the game is beyond buggy. Its like playing a crappy beta. The fighting also is atrocious. Even the open world is terrible due to the fact that you can never really run around and you have people literally just block your way every step. I hate this game. I think I wont even play the next 4 AC games I got because I simply hated playing the first one. I quit on memory 6 after i was yelling at my comp bug after bug after bug. Seriously dont waste your time on this garbage. Should of never been released.
