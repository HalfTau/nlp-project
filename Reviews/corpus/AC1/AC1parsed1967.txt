Back when this game came out, it was a breakthrough in game ideas, but nowadays, its rather simplistic. Time and again the player explores one of 3 sections of a couple of cities, synchronizing at viewpoints to locate the same menial tasks over and over so they can play the one significant mission of the segment. The story lasts around 8 hours, so when this game is on sale, youll definitely get your moneys worth, but otherwise I wouldnt call it worthwhile. For newcomers to the series, its not necessary to play this game to understand the rest.
