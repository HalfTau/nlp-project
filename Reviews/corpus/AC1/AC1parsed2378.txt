Assassins Creed is a good example of good concepts that were completely overshadowed by repetitiveness. In assassins creed you will hop across and climb buildings as if gravity doesnt exist, you will fall from the sky to assassinate your enemies like a badass. Yet when it comes to water, youll drown every single time. The interface, graphics, and controls scream console port, but its still far from being impossible to play or enjoy. The game became super bland and boring sometime after your second assassination, the game has the same routine for every city assassination. Climb buildings, eagle view, beat people, steal, or race around town for information, and then finally kill your target. The storyline is slightly above average with an ok ending but the awfully repetitive gameplay may bore you to the point of quitting before its even over. This game sets the foundation for all future AC game you might want to play this if youre interested in the series.
