First instalment of the series, baby steps.The game itself is still nice to play even today, it seems the graphics have been made universal and are not that bad.Gameplay, every action is like an animation, until its finished, nothing else can be done. This is also noticable when jumping the roofs, loads of falling into the streets.The Storyline is what captures the most in my opinion. Although it is attempted to recreate historical places and characters, I would probably guess most of the stuff is still fictional.Lets talk numbers. 9 bosses, 9 zones. Each zone 8 citizens to save, 8 viewpoints to see, 6 side missions to unlock information 1 pickpocket, 1 eavesdropping, 1 beatup, 1 assassinations, 1 flags collection, 1 roof parkout. You must do 23 side missions to unlock boss fight. After 3rd boss this is getting into a repetitive chore. Although there is increase in guards/npcs, it is still repetitive.Overall the game is nice, minimum bugs, good game play, still good time sink.Big thumbs up for no Uplay stuff yet, good things of an old title.Do recommend.
