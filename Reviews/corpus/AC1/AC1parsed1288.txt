This is the first game in the long Assassins Creed franchise and honestly this is one of the only ones which is true to its name. While the game is repetitive and boring at times, it is purely about assassinations. It is therefore unique in that sense as the mechanics that are there work great. If you are new to the Assassins Creed franchise then this is a good place to start, however you may not finish it and even if you do, you may not return to the game. Worth purchasing when on sale.
