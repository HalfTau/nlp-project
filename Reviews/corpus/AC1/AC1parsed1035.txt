When Assassins Creed first came out I never played it very long. I thought it was time to give it another shot. I have to say I really enjoyed that game. However, after the third or forth mission you really noticed that you always to the exact same thing. I really had to force myself through the last few missions. The ending on the other hand was great and made up for the last few hours spend doing the same thing over and over again. It is worth playing, especially if you want to get into the series, which I do.
