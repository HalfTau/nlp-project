Assassins Creed should be considered a classic in stealth games in myopinion. There arent many games out there, executing and implementing themeaning of a stealh game in such a good and interesting way as theAssassins Creed series, but even so the first AC has its flaws.Considering that the game is from 2008, the graphics are actually prettygood and the level design is really awesome and feels authentic I dontactually know in how far theyre authentic to the original cities, but theysure look good and feel realistic.The story is really awesome and interesting, leading you, the player, to thinkfor yourself which side you prefer or rather whose cause is right and whose iswrong.As I said previously AC isnt without its flaws either. Some of thechallenge missions you get throughout the city arent really that differentfrom your average mission, just that there is a timer running now and they seemto be added just before release because it is simply weird that Altair doesntseem to respond or say anything to them. Totally onesided discussion.The investigation part quickly becomes boring as it always follows the samepattern and it doesnt really add that much to the story of the game. So Iactually have to say that trying to get 100 in every memory is actually awaste of time as it doesnt really add much value to your overall gameplay oryour understanding of the game world.What I absolutely dont like also is that you as a player cant really decidefor yourself how you want to accomplish a mission. I personally would muchprefer to eliminate my targets without any suspects or at least without thewhole city knowing about it immediately but the game doesnt give you any realoption. That makes the missions still pretty linear, the only thing is that youcan somewhat decide from where you will strike, the endresult will stay thesame.Even though AC has its flaws, it also has many positives and I can onlyrecommend this game.
