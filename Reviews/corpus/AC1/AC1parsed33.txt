The game is extremely boring and repetitive.I played this game for the first time 7 years after I played Assassins Creed 2 and this just cant compare to the sequel.The overall story is okay, but the dialogs are boring. There are no interesting historical characters. The locations are tiny and often make no sense there is a synchonization tower surrounded by cliffs twice as tall, makes zero sense. There are 3 small locations the 3 cities plus an inbetween buffer area that is there to simply delay your completion of the game.The game progression goes like thisspend 5 minutes going to one of the citiesspend 30 minutes trying to investigate enough so that the next step unlocksdo the assassination in 2 minutesRinse and repeat. Boring.Overall, back in the day, maybe a 6/10. Today, more like a 4/10.The first game was really just a techdemo for Ubisoft. If you want to know the plot, watch walkthroughs.
