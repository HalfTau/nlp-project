My favorite of the series.... No, the gameplay isnt the greatest. Its very repetitive in its mission format, combat, and even aesthetics. AC2 greatly improved upon those aspects, absolutely.What the original Assassins Creed has is a story, a journey for Altair and Desmond Miles. Both are paths of discovery and debate, a testing of iron against philosophical iron. As Altair questions the precepts of the Assassins Order and Templars, Desmond learns more of how the conflict in the Crusades applies to him in the modern age. The plot is beautifully and intelligently for prose fiction presented to the player in a way that reveals tidbits consistently, yet subtly.Its a shame none of its sequels have ever matched the caliber of moral discourse in this title. However, for the presentation of the plot alone, with its twists and backandforths, along with a cliffhanger of epic proportions, Assassins Creed is a game worth experiencing.
