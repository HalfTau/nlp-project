Beautiful game, even if you do not have a top tier card. Controls are awkward to get used to at first, but once you do, you will be at home in any of the series. The story is interesting, the game play length is great, no short 4 hour stuff that you see from other games. I havnt tried a speed run, but the game is way too beautiful to waste on a speed run. Pick it up, have a good time, and continue on with the rest of the series.
