If you have played any of the other Assassins Creed games before having experienced this one, you might end up disappointed. However I find this game highly enjoyable if you can look past its flaws, which can be excused by the fact that this is the first entry in the series and the developers obviously havent perfected it yet.The controls can be a little tough to manage at times but thats something you can surely get used to. In my opinion the biggest problem this game has are the missions there is not a lot of variety in them, which can get tiring, escpecially if you compare it to the sequel.However the Setting, music, atmosphere, story and gameplay are all just as phenomenal as the rest of the series.
