Back when this game first came out I had bought it at full retail price on an Xbox 360 and I ended up hating it after seeing how bland it felt and how repetative it was. I ended up just giving it away to my cousin for his birthday after a few hours of playing.However many number of years later I just now bought it again for a 5 deal and I really fought to give it a second chance with a more mature mind and a better capable gaming platform. I am now a newly found Assasins Creed fan despite how horrible I viewed the game when it first game out and on console.Took me a bit of getting used to to understand the potential of the game once I fought through my first impressions and explored what it had to offer. Gameplay kind of seems like a unique style of travel instead of the old impression I had of it being a rock climbing simulation. Large sword battles and knife throwing action end up being really fun mixed with a pretty interesting story I now really like the game and finished it a few minutes ago.If youre like me, try giving it a second chance when a deal hits!
