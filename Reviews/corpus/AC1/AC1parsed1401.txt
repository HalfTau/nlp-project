Assassins Creed is a game about repetition. You enter a city, do two or three information jobs, then you go kill your target. Its that for the entire game. What sets this game apart from others is its originality. A world like this has never been seen in video games and its a truely unique experience if a little dated. Give this one a shot if youre wanting to begin the Assassins Creed series.
