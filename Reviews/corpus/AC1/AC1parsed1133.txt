 As the first game of the franchise, it is both novel in concept and scope of narrative Platforming elements are extremely polished and satisfying climbing is simple in practice and is competently animated Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous Voiceacting with one notable oversight, addressed below is excellent general sounddesign, too, is strikingly original UI, though it breaks the immersion a bit, is practical and aesthetically pleasing Bissfully short loadtimes games engine runs smoothly and efficiently Quicktravel is available as the explorable areas increase Swordplay, though not as emphasized as a gameplay element, is still quite cinematic and enjoyable Myriad collectibles and viewpoints to unlock, scattered throughout the world Stalking targets is broken down into a series of minigames though tragically unvaried there are only 6 variations, they nonetheless do their part to uphold immersion Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or 4 menu screens quitting a game has never been so frustrating Segments revolving around Desmond in the year 2012 often seem to drag on well beyond what is required to set up that angle of the plot seriously breaks up the pacing Beyond the drive to get a 100 save file, there is little incentive to replay after a successful playthrough Limited tangible incentive to explore and collect doing so is done so for its own sake Protagonists voiceover is decidedly American, in stark contrast to the authentic accents of virtually all other characters massive break in immersion
