I will start with pregame.U cant even play it through steam it crushes all the time.Dynamics are really bad it made me sick sometimes.Afterall, this is the first game of a legend serie.So, it worth buying when its on sale. Otherwise, dont buy it.Good story, no subtitle hard to understand if u r not really fluent in English.
