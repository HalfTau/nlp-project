I had this game first time on my PSP and still enjoy it. Tha campaign is good and long but gets slightly repetetive. Even the hiding from guards and jumping on people with a knife in your knife never gets old DJumping from insane hights into hay stacks, feeling your spine break every single time and leaping from roof to roof is just too thrilling to put tha game down for a while
