Recently Bought this game and the next three AC games off the Christmas Steam sale, and Id say it was sincerely worth it. Now, this game might not seem cool at all if youve played the later Assassins Creed games such as Black Flag, but if youre just starting, I highly recommend starting here, at ground zero. For me, the combat system was revolutionary, compared to Ubisofts similar game series Prince of Persia, it was a major jump. The fact that the city environments in the game are completely openended are also an awesome addition. It helps add a realistic element and shows you the effort put into the virtual environment. Now, I personally loved following both story lines, but that may or may not be interesting at all to you. In the event that it isnt, theres plenty of gory combat and backstabbing to cure the itch. So, do I recommend this game, YES. Though it doesnt have a very high replay value, its got great combat and plus, its the only Assassins Creed game that saves you having to get Uplay, which can be a little difficult.
