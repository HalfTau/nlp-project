This is a pretty good game, and i can see why it started off the assassins creed series leading on for many more games to come. The story is good, although it is sort of repetative, as in, heres your target, get info on them, assassinate them. good job, now heres another target, throughout the whole game exept for the begenning and the end, the end is good, its a fun game to run around the open world and do random stuff, and it is worthwhile, it is indeed an old game though the graphics and animations are rather good but not up to date6,6/10
