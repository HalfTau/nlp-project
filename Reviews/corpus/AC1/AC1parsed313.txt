This game is a perfect example of whether graphics or gameplay makes a game good.Graphically, the game looks beautiful. The visuals are incredibly stunning and the world looks beautiful. Graphics and visuals I give a 10/10However, the game is simply just not fun to play. It gets boring, repetitive, and you spend most of the game either A climbing walls or B fighting or trying to get away from guards. Thats the majority of the game. Pretty much had to force myself to grind it out the last few levels just to beat it, and now I can uninstall it. You can revisit all the levels again after beating the game, to get the parts you missed, or to find flags, but really..... Why would you want to? Just about anything you do will attract the guards and fighitng them is a chore, not anything close to fun.Also, the story failed to draw me in, but it seems to have drawn in some others. Hard to say if you will like the story or not.If you want a game just for great graphics, then go for it. If you want a game thats fun to play, look elsewhere. Ask yourself whats more important between graphics and gameplay.
