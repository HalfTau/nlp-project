While the story may seem a bit repetitive in terms of the process of missions, It is still no excuse to avoid this game when entering the Assassins Creed series. While Altiars story may seem to matter little, the real world tells of another story. One that cannot be missed. You were kidnapped by a modern day enemy, the enemies of the assassins centuries ago. They dig through your ancestors memories locked away in genetic code to find a key once thought to be lost forever. Part of their plan to expand. The gameplay might begin to feel dull, but if you plan to continue in the series you must start from the beginning.
