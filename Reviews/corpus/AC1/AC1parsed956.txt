The first of the Assassins Creed series happens to be my favorite I havent played all the Assassins Creed so my review may change later. Why is it my favorite? The gameplay is outstanding as is the story. You begin as a high ranking assassin name Altar. You and two other assassins are looking for the apple in a cave along the way you break the three simple rules that defines the creed, I wont go too much into the details. Once you get back to your master you are get underattacked by the templars, the Brotherhoods enemies. After you scare off the templars you get hold on trail for breaking the three simple rules of the Creed. You get stabbed in the body and left to die, or you thought. You are reborn and as a noivce so you must work your way up the rankings once again. Thats the simple starting of the game. The second best part about this game is that you dont need Uplay to play it. Now remember Nothing is true and everything is permitted.
