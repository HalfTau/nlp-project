This is the one that started it all. Almost a decade old and the thing is still very much enjoyable to play. The graphics are still passable, but you can tell that they were made for a system much weaker than what were used to today. There is a graphics mod on modDB that fixes this. Playing with a controller is highly recommended.Still my favourite of all the AC games.
