Game is not for everyone, and if you want to get in AC franchise, I advice you to start with AC 2.This game isnt the best in series, but definitely must play for AC fans and those who liked old ACs better.Game locations are worth to explore, i really liked music and main story is interesting.Mechanics feel clunky at times and NPCs arent the smartest, and there are moments when game just makes you angry.However overall game experience is OK, and if you are willing to do with some repetitive missions and and sometimes jerky mechanics, than you should give it a try!I would give this game 7.2 /10
