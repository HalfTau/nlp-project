i played for about 3 hours i know it says at least 30 but i forgot to quit the game for a while and i was just so bored!this game is for its time considered good and i can understand why  but the plot of until where i got just made me feel like making a myspace account and looking for people who are still connected seem more fun.the minimap is almost useless since even after syncing you dont get any info untill you press Tap and still then there is nothing to look for or to do besides a weak boring storyline and bad gameplay machanics3/10   because i loved ac2
