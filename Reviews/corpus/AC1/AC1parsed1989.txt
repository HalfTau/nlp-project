What I loved about this game is the incredible climbing and the world designed after historic cities. Looking out upon Jerusalem is pretty neat.What I didnt like about this game is the actual missions, I always felt like the stealth was obtuse and it always turned into oneatatime 10 vs 1 fighting.I played this game in 2009 and completed the main storyline.
