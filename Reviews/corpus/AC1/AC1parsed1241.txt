Its a good game not the best but still good. The only reason why i am not recommending it is because its not so good on PC. i have the game on the lowest setting and it still lags. all my other games are on high and they are perfect except for this game. and not just a little bit of lag, quite a lot, game breaking and i never had those problems on console. So if you want to buy it, buy it for console, which one? well that is your opinion, now have fun.
