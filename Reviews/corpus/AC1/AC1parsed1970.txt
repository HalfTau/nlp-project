Excellent story driven game. However, it is console port, not as bad as assassins creed 2 where screen does not even display keyboard keys, assuming i know all the hotkeys, but its something you can get use to. Side missions are repetitive, same objectives with different locations, it is optional but it gives more play time. AI is dumb and annoying. Other than that it is really good story, it outweighs all the cons. Game has no replay ability except collecting flags. Only bug i have encounter is game crashes sometimes, but i was recording so that might be the problem. Big plus is no Ubisoft drm
