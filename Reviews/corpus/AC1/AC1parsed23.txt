5/10 Extremely repetitive. You have to basically do the same exact thing over and over again. Extremely buggy. At the beginning, I was okay with the bugs leaps of faith not working, enemies floating, etc. but it came to a point where I couldnt finish missions because the game would enter a loop in which the mission would reset itself even after completion or me being teleported inside a mountain because of an enemy hitting me. Parkour fun but gets boring after a while. Kudos for the story
