If youre even a little limited on time  patience and you just want to play this to get a complete story experince from AC series. I suggest to go on youtube and watch a clip which gets the story in 560 mins. If you have time and are determined to complete the whole series storyline this is fine. Just dont pay the full price for it.For a game made 2007 graphics, enviroment and sounds are suprisingly good, of course there is issues with e.g. drawing distance but they couldnt think that someone really plays this with a 2016 highend machine. Main storyline is fine.PC gameplay is awful and the game gets easily pretty boring. Bad contrallability, clumsy combat, no quicktravel, tens of repeating and similiar miniquests before you get to the real main quest and and such a stupid AI.I dont recommend this unless you are obsessed to get all the games in the series finished or if youre unemployedProsGraphics 2007StorySoundsConsGraphics 2007Gameplay horrible character  camera controllability, clumsy repeating combat, etc.Repeating repeating repeating
