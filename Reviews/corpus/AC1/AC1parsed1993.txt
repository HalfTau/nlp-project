Great action, stealth and storytelling in a scifi, historic 3rd Crusade about Desmond becoming his ancestor Altair to help his forced kidnappers find a mysterious powerful object. I rate it 8/10.Pros assassinations, storytelling, parkourCons slighty glitchy, repetitive fights/annoying npcs and slighty glitched dome syncronisation points.Even though there are cons, this game is a musthave!!!
