If landing in hay bales kills you enable vsyncEach game is like a story expansion of the one before it, with some extra new bits that sometimes are fun, but other times just get in the way. Im glad theyre taking a year off. They need it.That said, this is one of my favorite series. Its like medieval GTA. The writing and story ideas I enjoy a lot. The first game will seem pretty bland if youve played anything newer. But I liked this era the most and Altair is my favorite.Id say pick it up on a deal if youre iffy about something a little aged with some repeated aspects throughout the whole game. 20 is kinda steep. If you didnt play it way back when, it might be a tough fit. But I cant really bring myself not to recommend just out of enjoying the philosophy of it.
