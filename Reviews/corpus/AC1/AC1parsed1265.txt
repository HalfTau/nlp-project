The first entry in the never ending Assassins Creed franchise. This game is what started it all for Ubisoft, love em or hate em. This game features a conflict between Templars and Assassins in a historical setting. If you love history then this is a great game for you. The atmosphere in the game is very good, it makes you feel like youre alone in this dark and deadly journey for redemption. The three main cities you explore are nice and detailed. The stealth aspect isnt perfect, but it is interesting and fun to play with. The combat is also interesting, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easy. The story, if you pay attention, is great and mysterious. Theres also a parcour system that allows you to climb buildings all sneaky like.However, this game has many flaws. Towards midgame point, the game becomes very repetitive, having you doing the same missions over and over again. What sucks is that to progress in the game, you must do these boring missions to get the next piece in the story. At points you might not care for the good story this game has because of tedious tasks.I love history and conspiracies, so this game was right up the alley for me. The combat and stealth was intersting at first but the game does get repetitive. I really like this game and its one of the better ones in the franchise in my opinion. Its a risk, but you might enjoy this game if youre more into story than gameplay.
