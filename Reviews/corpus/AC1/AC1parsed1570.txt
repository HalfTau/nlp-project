I wanted to see where the franchise originated from. It has okayish gameplay that gets a bit too repetitive and tedious at times, because you basically do the same 56 missions over and over again. Fun to jumpshank people though, and combat can be somewhat fun if you experiment a little with different combinations, although not extraordinarily so. Recommended on a sale, if youve never tried it before, and want to start the franchise from the beginning.
