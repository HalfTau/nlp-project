I am personally loving this game. Ive played it for 30 hours, and it is really fun. Assassinations are really tricky though, so dont be surprised if most of your attempts end in you fighting all the guards one by one until you kill your target, instead of a nice slick knife in the back.The cities are amazing in their scope and detail. However, the fact that theyre so large means you spend a lot of time in the game just getting from place to place.All in all, I very much recommend it. Oh, and one last note killing people with counter moves looks awesome.
