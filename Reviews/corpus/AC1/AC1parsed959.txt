If you havent played the assassins creed games I would not reccomend starting here!The newer games play much better although the story isnt as good as in this oneBasically any assassins creed game is an addition to this one in forms of movement, combat, quests, characters and story.You play one... you really have played them allGreat game would reccomend if you love the other games9/10  when thew game was released6/10  Compared to the newer games
