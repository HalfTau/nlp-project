TBH its a pretty bad game. Very repetitive gameplay and controls that just get boring after the first 2 hours or so. The AI in this game are  with annoying voices. On top of that, there are certain times where you just have no ing clue where to go, like the map just does not ing show you and you just run around like a ing idiot. The map shows you all these garbage uncessary symbols that just cluster the ing map.  this game.
