I enjoyed this first creed and although it was short on variety it had plentiful novelty. The free running mechanic, the scale of the cities, and the number of onscreen characters were all refreshing. Combat was a two button walkover and the approach to stealth was nothing but silly, yet the joy of traversal and intriguing plot kept me going.
