I really enjoy this game. This is my introduction into the franchise and I thought Assassins Creed 1 was really good starter. The only problem I had was the amount of time it takes to fully exit the game tied in with minimizing the window without glitching up or accidentially closing the game window. However, other then that, I love it.
