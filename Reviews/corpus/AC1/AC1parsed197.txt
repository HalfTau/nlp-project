Sorry I just didnt enjoy this game and I am a fan of the series in general. Parkour is very stubborn, fighting is dull, weapon selection null, buggy movement. Those annoyingbeggers. Jesus. Very repetitive AI comments. Occasional lowquality voice recordings. Not a complete portgame doesnt give you key buttons to pressjust a symbol that you have to look up in the menus to know what key that symbol represents. This is an issue in ACII, too. Thankfully it stopped in ACB.However the story isnt bad and the game never crashed. Music is good too. I just didnt have a good time playing it.
