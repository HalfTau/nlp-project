While the more recent installments have, at least in my opinion, begun to stray a bit from the path of quality over to the path of quantity, I still believe that the Assassins Creed Series, every single one of them, is worth every penny and a musthave for anyone who likes action games mixed with stealth and an awesome story. 9/10
