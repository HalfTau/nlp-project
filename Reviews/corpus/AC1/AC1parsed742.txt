i own all assassin creed games and i just got round to completing the first.  i played black flag for a bit and loved it so decided to buy them all.i completed the first one and was pleasantley surprised, i really enjoyed it, the game has decent graphics and a good story,one or 2 bugs but all in all its a solid base game to the francise im excited to start the next game.Recommended
