A soso start for the games franchise.Pros Graphics are really great and still hold up good even today Locations Masyaf, Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem and Arsuf seem realistic and nice Running and parkouring from rooftop to rooftop is very fun and cool though it gets boring after a while The combat system is quite good and can result in very stylish kills/assassinations if you master it similar to Batman Arkham Asylums combat system, though not as good as the latters The story is good enough the whole concept of the animus and reliving the memories of your ancestors stored in your DNA, plus the alternate history scenario are both nice it reminds you a bit of an alternative matrix story tooCons The biggest downside of the game is, in my opinion, its repetitiveness in each and every city you go, you end up doing essentially the same things pickpocket, assassinate, eardrop, save citizens, end up being discovered by the guards  run and hide over and over again etc., while only the boss fights are different each time and offer a nice challenge The lunatics and beggars that hit you or stop you while you are running to escape can get really really and I mean really really annoying, especially since they multiply in the final levels of each city The characters in the game are a bit dull and not easy to connect with, both the ancient and the modern ones, but only just a bit, generally they are okOverall this is a good game, you can feel it and I can recommend it, but its repetitiveness in each level is its biggest weakness in my opinion, it makes it feel boring after a few times, even though you get to do really cool things... if only the tasks were more different each time.Thankfully I read that the next installments kind of fixed that and made the progressing of the game more enjoyable and less repetitive, so I have that to keep me and eventually continue to the next game.
