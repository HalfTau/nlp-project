The controls are a bit clunky as it was clearly designed for consoles. I could not adapt with a keyboard  mouse to play the game. So I had to use a gamepad which is downpoint for me but eventually you get used to it. Storywise, it is a great game though it flaws in its development. It feels raw. After the 4th assassination youll eventually get bored. I only kept up with it because of the gorgeous level designs and the obvious need of closure.Id give this game a 7,5 out of 10.
