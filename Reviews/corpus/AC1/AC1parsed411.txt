For me I did not enjoy this game that much. This game has an okay story but it is so repetitive. Go to that city, assassinate the guy there, good now go back to master and tell him. The combat is plain awful and I did not say it was hard it was the fact that you just do everything in a repetitive way that you get so bored of it. I mean you can not expect that much from a 2007 game overall a 5/10
