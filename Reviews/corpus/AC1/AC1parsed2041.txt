I played this game the first time at 2008 but was so boring in the beginning that I gave it up and never tried again. Now in 2013 a give it another chance and bought in a sale. Had the same impression as at the first time, boring beginning, boring middle, boring ending.This game has a great history behind a horrible engine, very short options of side missions and these are not cool to be done and repetitive main quests, always with same way to be finished.Some more things in this game that sucks that are missing subtitles and achievements to unlock at pc version  I like these things, make every game more fun for me.I only recommend to play this game to understand the start of Assassins franchise, nothing more.
