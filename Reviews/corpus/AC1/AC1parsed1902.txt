I think the game has a lot to offer. Psuedoopen world, side quests and objectives, nice graphics for its time and decent mechanics. However, it just could not hold my interest. Most of my time played on this game was it running in the background while I alttabbed to do other things. I got it because I was given the latest version Black Flag as a bundle for something else I bought and thought I should play through the series as to understand the entirety of the story.Alas, Ill probably never get around to finishing this game or ever playing its successors.I do think a lot of people will get enjoyment out of the game, even if I didnt and as such would recommend it.
