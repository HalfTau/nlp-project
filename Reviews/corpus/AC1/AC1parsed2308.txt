The combat difficulty is not really challenging and the gameplay gets repetitive once you know the pattern. Play it till the end if you play to enjoy the story.Oh yeah, this game needs subtitles during the dialog.Note Dont bother to collect all of the flags i.e. the additional memories since it wont reward anything in the PC version.
