The original AC is a really good game but is definetely flawed. The story is pretty decent, along with graphics but the real standout is the mechanics. Climbing buildings and running along rooftops is a highly satisfying experience, especially in an open world, it sometimes doesnt work the way you want or expect it to but when it does its highly entertaining.As I mentioned the game is flawed. REPETITIVE, my biggest gripe with the game is the damn repetitiveness. You do the same thing every time in the same format and it can be extremely boring. I start to not even bother with the side quests because they were annoying and unrewarding. Exiting the same takes so long use alt f4, at times the camera is a bit wonky and listening to the same dialogue again and again can drive you mad repetitive.Overall though its a good game but far from perfection. 6.5/10
