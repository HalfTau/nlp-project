then why Recommending to play? cz it is.This was my firstgame to play. I will totally miss out the game if I didnt play through the end of it. The last missions are really exciting and the story is quite good. There is a great twist in the story at the end. The sword fighting combat, horse riding, building climbing all were quite satisfying. Besides the repetetive missions there are other some irritating problem like there are MAD PEOPLE roaming all over the ground and they keep just pushing me and that was really disturbing. The beggers were also very much annoying, they just kept begging until I gave them a puch knock out of their head. They beg as hard that I cant even walk because of them.Overall a good game. Im looking forward to play the nextgame.
