Assassins Creed, the first game in the series offers a really good story with great voice acting and sets the foundation for future games. The graphics have held up really well even to this date and sound is great.Now onto the negatives. Nearly every mission is copy and pasted, every city looks the same, the climbing mechanics are horrible, the control scheme is horrible, the open world is pointless theres nothing there, its open world for the sake of it but offers nothing that makes it meaningful, like quests, gathering resources, interesting points of interest with exploration, theres no money, items or loot and theres no experience or skills. To be quite frank, the game is bland, and boring.Okay, that sounds harsh, but I think the biggest thing here is that this game sets up the series and has some really great points that could be built upon. I think if you can bear through this game it really sets the scene for future games and the story is definitely worth it, but if youre looking for a deep experience with good mechanics, lots of items and interesting features, this is not the game. If youre looking to play the rest of the series and dont care about the gameplay or features at all, just the story, then this game will be perfect for you!Unfortunately, I really could not enjoy this game at all, I got bored after the first 4 hours and just could not continue playing. I watched the rest online and was happy with that, then moved onto the next game.Graphics For its style 7Sound 8Story 8Gameplay 3Replay value depth, amount of content, variety in gameplay 1Overall Rating 5/10  Average game.
