I found this to be an enjoyable game with a good, original story, and some for the time original gameplay. Ive played through most of the Assassins Creed games, yet found the setting in this one the most interesting I like the Crusades/Explore the Holy Land part of the game.From a gameplay standpoint, however, this game pales in comparison to the more recent games. You should definitely play this before you play any of the other Assassins Creed games. Otherwise, you will likely be disappointed.
