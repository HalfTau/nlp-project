I really dont get why this series is so popular. You open it, its fun, youre doing cool things, then you unlock counterattack and you realize that with counterattack you can easily kill however many people the game throws at you rather than the combo, which you can almost never get right. But you keep on going, since sure its the same combat mechanism repeated but thats not too bad. And you realize youre not playing a game, youre playing a set of minigames. Every mission is more of les the same, the places are pretty much the same. You spend your time running on rooftops to get to your destination to avoid the tedium of walking. And it offers a bit of enjoyment, until youre tired of climbing the nth tower to find the next set of identical missions.Sure some things in the game require skill, but its so tedius. Everything is just a facsimile of a fun thing to do and nothing actually holds up. Compare against say, Mirrors Edgge, that makes an interesting parkourgame that is actually fun. Much better than a random masked guy saying, hey buddy run after these flags for me.When I bought it, I had heard so many good things about the game, that I thought Id like it,so I bought 2 and Bortherhood alongside it. After starting the first one, I didnt even bother finishing it or installing the rest.
