Its a great game and most of the reviews will attest this. So Ill just skip to the cons1. Controls  Have you ever played Prince of Persia Warrior Within? well this game is worse than that. And considering you have two stances available, high profile moves and low profile moves, neither of which is very intuitive or responsive, its twice as bad.The protagonist will randomly climb walls, jump into water or not grag a ledge. During fight scenes he may completely ignore a defensive stance at the beginning. And some of the combat mechanices like counter by far the most important one are flaky at best.And the PC controller neeeds to be selected in the options menu everytime for it to work.2. NPC  There are some deliberately annoying NPCs like beggars, drunks and lunatics that will try their best to get in your way and slow you down. I have no idea why this was included in the gameplay and why so frequently.3. Menu  Its got a menu screen at startup, and a menu screen within the game. Mildly annoying.However a definite must to get onto the AC bandwagon.
