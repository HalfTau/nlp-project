The game completely and utterly sucks. The controls are horrible M/KB or controller  I played on a controller and theyre equally awful, not precise at all when you try to climb on things, most of the time you dont go in the direction you indend or it fails to function properly. In general, climbing plain sucks and when its one of the main draws of the game, it hurts immensly. Also the little side quests needed to do assassinations are one of a handful of recycled missions throughout the entire game it get repetative very fast. Plus, field of view for enemies is laughibly bad. Additionally combat is boring as hell, unresponsive, and the again the controls suck for that too. With that said, the combat is actually incredibly easy at the same time  have fun countering the entire game and doing nothing else to kill enemies while in the process never getting hit. This game is so repetative, with poor controls, and an incredibly dull main character all the characters act like cardboard cutouts with no personalities  not to mention a pretty lame ending. I dont see how anyone in their right mind could like this game. Oh and did I mention a bug that can currupt your savegame at random at any point in your playthrough  thats been present since it was released in 2007? Yeah  enjoy having to delete your save and start from the begining if that happens to you, even if youre 99 through.1/10  simply because the graphics were decent the year this was released, and it spawned better future Assassin Creed games.I payed 5 for it, it wouldnt even recomoned playing this if it were free for your sanities sake  one of the worst games I have ever played. Luckily, it spawned a good series despite being such a failure. With that said dont let disuade you from the rest of the series. My advice, skip Assassins Creed 1 read a synopsis on wikipedia and jump striaight in Assassins Creed 2  which is actually a good game.
