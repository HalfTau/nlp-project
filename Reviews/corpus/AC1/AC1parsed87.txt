Its repetitive   the most common negative critque of this game...Even if it is repetative, its only a problem if the gameplay/mechanics arent enjoyable. Arent all online FPS games repetative? How about sports, arent they repetative? What about racing games,  or RPGs?PROS Very unique for its time Story was enjoyable until probably the very end... but definitely before the series went crazy Much more plausible timeframe/settings because they didnt incorporate well known historical characters AC2 youre working with Leonardo da Vinci...AC3 you save George Washington, win the American revolution, help Benjamin Franklin...yeah please... Travel sections between different cities on horseback and sneaking into the next gated city! MOST IMPORTANTLY  I felt that as an Assassin this game actually encouraged sleath and guerrilla tactics more. The combat wasnt difficult but it felt the best when you were in and out and running away, unlike every other AC that I tried where youre in the middle of a group of soldiers dodging bullets CONS Freakin mentally ill NPCs that push you to the ground and you cant push, parry or kill them. MOST FRUSTRATING THINGS EVER!
