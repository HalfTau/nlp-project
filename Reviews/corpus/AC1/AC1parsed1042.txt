Started yesterday and finished the game today. What an amazing game, story line, fights, voices, for a game which came out in 2007 it is just great!I have played some AC from time to time somewhere else but never bought it myself.I will never regret this buy!Highly recommend this gaming serie for players who like an open world game with a great story line and fight mechanics.
