A must play for AC fans !Definatly a great beginning of the AC story ... the game mechanics are bit buggy and the sidequests are totally boring but the main story is just AWESOME... and the graphics still do a great job .... !I started with AC2 and played then Brotherhood but decided to start AC1 before i go over to Revelations... so far i can only say this was a good decisionDOnly problems are you have to reconfigure the Gamepad Layout to match the AC2  Layouts and ... well Altair is bit stupid when it comes to jump over water P so dont go mad DD
