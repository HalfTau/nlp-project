Unless you like doing the same thing over and over again, then this game is not for you.The goodGraphics  Considering it is not new game, it looks pretty good even now, large cities all with distinct features.Story  This is the only reason, I wanted to keep playing as story is great, but I just cant force myself to do it anymore.Movement  Parkour is great, one of the coolest features. Jump anywhere, climb, running on the roofs is pretty fun.The badControls  It may have been made for consoles, but controls are not really intuitive default onesCombat  Very simplistic, that doesnt require much thought, only pressing button at the right time.Repetitive gameplay  Quests are the same, everything is the same, if youve done it once, you will do the same thing another 20 times.
