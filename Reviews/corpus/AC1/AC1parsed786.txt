A very disappointing game.This is the 3rd game I bought on Steam many years ago 2009 and had technical difficulties on my old PC so I left it on the backburner since.I finally got to play it past the tutorial and it was okay.Then I went for the second prey and it was the same. Then the 3rd prey...still the same.Finally the 4th prey...still no change.Its always go there and climb all towers to get the map, do at least 1 activity then report to the bureau for some useless idle talk and finally hunt the target.Controls are not great, characters not particularly interesting and the present time scenes are barely useful, especially considering how slow it all is.In the end, interesting concept with a really nice presentation of its historical setting a period / place not scene often in games but terribly repetitive with no real incentive to wander around.
