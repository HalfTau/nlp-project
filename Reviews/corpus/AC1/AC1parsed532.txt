My experience was probably skewed since I finished Assassins Creed 2 before playing this one. Anyways, the game feels really repetitive, the landscape is gorgeous but the cities look pretty much the same. The game is only interesting during the beginning and during the end, the middle part is really tedious. I liked playing it, but its nothing like its sucessor. I recommend playing only if you really want to know the beginning of the AC series or if you have never played an AC game before.
