Assassins Creed is one of those games that goes out of its way to make you feel badass. For example, when running along rooftops, so long as youre within step or reach of something to jump on, run across, or grab onto depending on your skills obtained, Altair is going to look badass as hell running around and stabbing people.The game is not super difficult, but its fun to play an assassin. Dont miss the super conspiracy theme in this game, either!
