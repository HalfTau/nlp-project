Enthralling storyline and topnotch gameplay mechanics considering this game was made nearly 10 years ago. Few complaints, but none are worth describing aside from some expected cheesy character dialogue. The positives overwhelm any negatives. Recommended remove all of your HUD except the bottom right map to maximize immersion after youve memorized those items. I cant wait to start on the sequel.
