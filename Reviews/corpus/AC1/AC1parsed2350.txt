Assassins Creed is the beginning to a engrossing saga by Ubisoft. The story is first rate and the action sequences are seamless. The game has a thirdperson point of view and allows you to easily traverse terrain, climb buildings and initiate combat sequences from allout action to stealth assassinations. The game itself is a wonderful breakaway from the all too common firstperson shoots. Even though the game seems marketed towards consoles, Assassins Creed does not forget PC players and offers a fairly steamlined mode of control. By no means should Assassins Creed be overlooked by gamers as its ongoing story is critically acclaimed.
