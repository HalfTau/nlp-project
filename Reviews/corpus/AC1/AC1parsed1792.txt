I am pretty late coming into this game but I can honestly say it does not feel as dated as it is. The graphics are still okay and the combat felt really awesome. I put about 17 hours into the game which isnt a ton but I felt satisfied when it was all over. There are two story lines going on at once, a kind of crusade era timeline which I felt very immersed in, as well as a modern story line which was very interesting with a nice twist at the end of both. The gameplay during the modern story however leaves a lot to be desiered and can get dull at times, but luckily you spend maybe an hour or two at most in that arc. Overall worth the current price.
