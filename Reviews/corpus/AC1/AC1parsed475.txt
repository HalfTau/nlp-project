So I arrived quite late to the Assasins Creed franchise. With the purchase of our XBox One, MS bundled it with Unity which after a while I took quite a liking to but was left asking a lot of questions and wanting to know how the storyline got to where it did.So being an old PC gamer and preferring almost every game on a PC to a console I started looking into what games there franchise consisted of. After some research and marking down the main games available on Steam and tahnk you for a lovely Holliday sale 20162017 I got every single of the main game from the original Assasins Creed all the way through Rogue Black Flag, Unity and Syndicate will be played on the XBox One skipping the minor installments for mobile devices sorry not a mobile gamer Ubisoft, please stop releasing those p Ok to the review of this installment, this clearly is the installment of the franchise in terms of gameplay, it is quite rigid and lack polishing comparred what is to come, however the story of Altair and AlMualim is one I would not be without since it clearly sets up so much of what is to come later on.The combat system is ok but the quick travel system is a total mess and did at times make me feel like the devs had not played their own game from start to finish, but once you got the hang of it you figured out what to do and in what order. Which leads to the main issue of the game, it is a tad repeatative, it does however progress at an ok rate and you do not have to do everything to get the most out of the story.Overall, I am extremely happy I played through this game to get the initial installment of the storyline down.
