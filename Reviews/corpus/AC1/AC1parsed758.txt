Bought it on summer sale. The only time I played it before was when it came out, so I really forgot how fun and enjoyable this game is. The only problem I had was with crashes. The game crashed like 10 times in total of playing it. But aside from that, highly enjoyable game with well developed characters, interesting plot, and beautiful landscapes.Best part, though, no uplay.
