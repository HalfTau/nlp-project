The first of an awesome series where you get to follow in the footsteps of  Desmond Miless Ancestors who happened to be Assassins fighting for freedom. In this game you get to follow Altair, who lived during the Crusades of the late 12th century. The game can be repetitive, but I personally think the satisfying combat mechanics makes up for it and it becomes even better as the series progress further. Its most certainly worth a try.
