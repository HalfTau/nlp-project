Nothing more to add to what it has already been said. This is the first  AC, whoeever wants to play AC has to play it.The story, worth it totally, the gameplay is a bit repetitive when it comes to secondary missions. However, you can see the location of the crusades, doing parkour around the 1100 , thinking about that is really funny.Buy it, the money well spent.
