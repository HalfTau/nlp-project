Most of the time, a game series starts out strong and over the years the quality decays as the franchise is milked to death by its publishing company.However, Assassins Creed did the opposite the first installment in the series is actually one of the most boring open world games Ive played. The writing is okay, the storyline is interesting, but it falls short on delivery. The gameplay gets stale and boring after only a few hours. Youre required to complete a few minimissions before the main mission unlocks, which would be okay if the missions were actually fun. It becomes a chorea repetitive experience that makes you want to quit playing the game and never finish it, even though the storyline is decent. Thats what I did.If youre caught up in the Assassins Creed hype, do yourself a favor and skip the first one. Start with the later installments.
