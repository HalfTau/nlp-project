At first i tought that i would not get into assassins creed, i mostly bought this game to have something to play when i was bored but i really got into it. The gameplay is a little repetetive until you get to the assassination missions. The story is great and has alot of twists in it. When i finished the game i bought assassins creed 2 at once not kidding. Definetly worth bying if you want a stealth game you can play for a while.
