Undeniably a revolutionary game 10 years ago in 2007, but in in the present, it is almost unbearably repetative, prosaic and full of bugs.Do i recommend it? Absolutely. It is a classic and a touchstone, but it has not aged well, but that should not suggest that you should not play it. And if you are an AC fan, and have not played it, shame on you. It took me around 16 hours, you can easily afford that, if you are a fan.Gorgeous open world. Run around the rooftops of cities in the Holy Land. They have recreated large open landscapes, and the cities you visit are faithfull reconstructions of the ancient Acre Akka, Damascus and Jerusalem. There are thousands of npcs, living their life and all reacting to what you do at all times, this is very impressive, considering it is 10 years old.But the port is horrible. Not as horrible as other ports mind you, i got to play it for about 4 hours between crashes and odd bugs, so nothing that truly made me want to quit playing, just get back into the game quickly, and do not get discouraged.there is a general consensus about this game. It is boring and repetative, but if you want a taste of the beginnings of AC, then here it is, in all its anachronistic glory.So much attention to detail, that is often missing from newer AAA games, ubisoft really tried to impress us and take our breaths away, which they did.I dont want to go into details about game mechanics, because if you are a HC gamer, you allready know this series to some extent, and if you are not, then you still might be able to find something here to take with you, but it might be a little hard, technically.
