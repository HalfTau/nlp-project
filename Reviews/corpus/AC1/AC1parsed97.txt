A great game, and childhood favorite of mine, AC1 delivers on most fronts. My only real issue is around 4 crashes through out my 30 hour playthrough, several graphical glitches, and several mechanics glitches. No game breaking bugs were found in my playthrough. 360 version is less glitchy, and never crashed, however doesnt run as good/load as fast obviously. My other complaint is needing to play around a bit to get my gamepad to work correctly, but once it is all said and done the experience is quite nice.Compared to games nowadays I would say the experience is pretty bare overall. A few mission types, repetitive actions throughout the game, simple revenge story, that DOES however thicken etc. However, I would definitely recommend playing through this game to get a grasp of the world, setting, backstory, and characters, if you plan on playing through the series. I wouldnt skip this point in the AC timeline simply because it IS enjoyable even in its bare state, and it isnt a long game. 30 hours Main storySide Missions Did not get all collectibles AC2, Brotherhood, and Black Flag are better games in my opinion, but It wouldnt be fair to judge the game based on its newer releases.TLDR Good game, port is a little buggy, controller issues may occur during setup.
