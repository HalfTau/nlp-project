I guess I can see how this game would have been amazing back at the time of release, but I thought it was pretty lackluster. Its cool hoppping and climbing around like a in monkey, but the gameplay is so repetitive, the environment is frustratingly similar everywhere you go, and the combat is really pretty boring for how often you get stuck in it. Fleeing was fun the first couple times, but then it just got tedious what with Altair tarding out and climbing upI didnt want him to and causing me to have to run another marathon to find somewhere else to hide.And I cant tell you how many times I actually threw my hands up in frustration at the crazy homeless guys shoving me into guards. I swear they actually follow you waiting to strike. Thank you Assassins Creed for causing me to develop a legit hatred for homeless crazies.
