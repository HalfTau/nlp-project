Wow. Was not ready for the mindblowing, conspiracy loaded ending. A bit on the abrupt side, but the final moments of the game left me shaken and completely creeped out, but totally looking forward to more from the franchise. While the games biggest issue is repetitive gameplay, the story, combat and movement mechanics, sound, and graphical style kept me coming back again and again, anxious to see the battle between Assassins and Templars to the very end. Assassins Creed is a scifi conspiracy theorists fantasy with an interesting injection of historical fiction and definitely worth checking out.
