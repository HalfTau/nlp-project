Good game.  I give it a 8/10.  Remarkable for the visuals for a game from 2007.  Looses points for being repetitve and having a camera that you want to kill during combat.  Some points come back for having an intriguing back story.  I didnt realize this is a trilogy with a long story.  I figured it was just run and gun.  Intrigued for AC2.  I stalled out on this game in chapter 2 of 7, mostly due to the repetion, but got going again after seeing an AC4 trailer.  Took about 24 hours total to get through the game.  This is a pretty good stealth game, which is in my wheel house.  The combat is fun, but a bit nonintuitive and timing dependant.  After you get the hang of it though you pretty much cant loose.
