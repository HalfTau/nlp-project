 Highly repetiive, in terms of. Side Missons, story missions, maps, people, everything. Clunky Movement Very boring gameplay, if you get spotted its the same thing everytime just so overly repetitive. Story is half interesting, just couldnt finish it, so boring is the rest, takes ages to get to the story parts that it doesnt roll along, like someone paraphrasing a story to you. If its on the cheap worth a buy to get the basic feel of an Assasins Creed game. Runs great on any hardware, but not the best looking game from 2008. Really there is 40100hours, but its all repiititve. Game should of been 1020hrs just solely on the story and it would of been fantastic.
