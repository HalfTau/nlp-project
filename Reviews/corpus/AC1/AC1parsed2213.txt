Ever wondered what the memories of your ancestors were? Well, go find your own Animus, because in this game you control Desmond as he tries to find knowledge that can save the world through the memories of Altair. I would definitely recommend it to people who are HUGE fans of stealth, history and Assassins. However the game is very repetitive, and it has very boring sections where you see interactions with characters you simply do not care about. And that is why, on top of the very automated freerunning, I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the previously mentioned people. Try at your own risk.
