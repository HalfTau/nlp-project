Assassins Creed is essentially the platforming from Prince of Persia turned into a full game. Altairs climbing is nothing short of revolutionary platforming. Its far less indepth than Mirrors Edge, but its much simpler, quicker and easier to relive your childhood Spiderman fantasies. The graphics are beautiful, especially for a game so old, and the art style is superb. The streets of Acre are rife with sickness and King Richard is scruff, fat and ugly as sin. The plot is like a cross between a Robert Ludlum book and The Matrix, only if you add a whole lot more suck into the mix. I bet you the writer read the wikipedia article on cyber punk after they had just made a rad game set during the crusades and jammed in the Desmond sections as an afterthought. I normally dont care about immersion, but its at record lows here. I bought this game to feel like an assassin, but after the 20th bench The Lone Klansman sits on to evade the guards, this is a damn problem.
