The Good Game looks nice, artists  engine coders did a great job. Story ignoring the filler content the main peaks of story had you question your own actions, Id say story is worth it.The BadGame design, there is not much of a game behind all the art, just fillers with peaks of story.Ive tried to play this game twiceBoth times I got bored of it completely due to repetitiveness.After the first assassination, it is a rehash of the same.Each time a bit more salt is thrown in to the hash.If one could skip all the fillers and focus on the story, it would be a nice 2h interactive movie.I would recommend this game if you could somehow remove the filler content and just watch this interactive movie while taking control during main target assassinations.
