The first entry in the Assassins Creed series is, at best, an okay game. The visuals were great when the game was new and the gameplay was pretty solidits just that once you got an hour or two in, you saw pretty much all the gameplay there was! Exploring the Holy Land as a badAssassin in a mindtrippingly weird story is pretty gratifying, but the city guards seem to suffer form Criminal Scum disorder at times.If you like your games with weird stories, this is definitely for you if you cant stand repetition, then you might steer clear of it.
