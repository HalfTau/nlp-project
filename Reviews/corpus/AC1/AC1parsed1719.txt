This is a great game. Absolutely fantastic. It is my favorite video game series ever and though it is a bit repetative at times it is one of the best games I have ever played. There are a few annoying things with windowed mode and dual moniters and stuff, but they are avoidable and dont stop the game from being a master piece.
