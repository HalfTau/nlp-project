VERY cool when you start playing  cool grafix, amazing story  but there are basically only 4 quests that keep repeating all over again and again just getting harder to accomplish. So I really losing interest in the second part of the game, only finished it to see the end of the story no suprises there either. So you have too decide for yourself. You can get it if you get a good offer in Steam  woudnt pay the full price though.
