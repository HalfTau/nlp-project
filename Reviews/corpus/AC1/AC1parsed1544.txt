I dont even know where to start...this game is just absolutly amazing. For being an older game the graphics and overall mechanics are very good would give it a 9/10 in my books. This being the first game to this awesome series I am just completly blown away. The story line is somewhat difficult to follow, but the story itself is really cool, not to mention part of this game is based off of true events and characters. The game can be slow in some parts but when you get into those really intense moments its fast pased and the next thing you know, your standing and playing at the same time. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking to get into a storyline based game but also who is looking for the adrenalin. I will definently be playing more of this in the future.
