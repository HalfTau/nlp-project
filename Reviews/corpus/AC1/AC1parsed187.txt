This is a hard review to write. I like the Assassins Creed series. WIthout a doubt, the franchise couldnt have evolved into what it is today without this game. What I like about it is that it kept me busy for 20 hours. I like the whole apple thing. I like the freerunning/parkour integration. What I cant understand is that riding a horse peacefully is a crime that is punishable by death.... There are no cars, helicopters, bicycles, etc. Only horses. And if you ride one between towns, which is mandatory in the beginning, you WILL get attacked. That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in my life. Incomprehensibly stupid. I love the other games though lol.
