When I was first introduced to the Assassins Creed franchise, I played AC2 and never actually bothered to play the game that started it all until now primarily becuase I feared it would have been very boring and simple as there are countless things that were in AC2 but not AC1 such as buying equipment. However, once I started to play this game my opinion shifted and I realised why his franchise became huge.The graphics were far ahead for its time as it was released in 2007 and even though there are an occaional glitch or two, they arent majourthey are quite trivial and dont affect the gameplay. The story is a very good one as it focuses on a an assassin regaining his lost honour and title by assinating 9 templars and in doing so reveals much about corruption and deception. The character admitadly we dont see much of a development on as he is quite blandI prefer Ezio overall as we see his development and maturity more however, he adds a sense of coldness which i believe makes him more of an assassin. Even though I had feared that there would be a lot missing and would make the game simple compared to its sequels, there were things that did make it much harder such as not being able to have a killstreak, calling other assassins, having air/ledge/hiding spot assinationwhich I think was the most difficult part or having a double blade which made the game more of achallenge and makes it more fun.Overall, if you are looking to see what began it all, dont mind how many things are missing from it since AC2 was a huge leap from AC1 and want more of an Assassin game where the objective is to assassinate multiple targts as the main plot then this game then this game is for you and you should get it since it is quite cheap!I would rate this game 8.5/10 for being a brilliant start to an awesome franchise!
