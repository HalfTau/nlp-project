I wish I could say this was a fantastic game, I really do. There are just so many things done so well that other games fail at...the writing is incredible, the story gets better and better throughout the game, the gameplay mechanics are really cool and new, I was really impressed...and then they went and ed it up. Voice acting sucks sooo much...I hear wonderful lines and theyre ruined by the awful delivery. The story...oh god its just so amazing and good and creepy and awesome and then it just...ends...no fantastic conclusion, no Desmond escaping from the facility, no we have to wait for the SECOND one to do that F. And the allmighty thing that breaks the game is the controls. Theyre so horribly awful, whoever came up with it needs to be fired. It ruins the parkour because all youre doing is holding down two buttons and watching as Altiar does cool..no skill involved in that part. And then the combat system is ed because it only responds to what you tell it to do half the time and the AI sucks too so theyre constantly trying to hit you but then acting like nah Ima just wait here so then you try to counterattack and someone else attacks and then you die.Im just so horribly frustrated with how good this game could have been. So many things done amazingly well, and so few ed up, but those few things make it a bad expierence. 6/10...and Im being nice. Buy the third one, that looks good.
