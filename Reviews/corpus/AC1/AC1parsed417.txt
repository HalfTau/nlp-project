Note First time ever playing assassins creed, so my views will be based around that.The game as a whole was great. It wasnt incredibly easy, but not very hard either. The parkour was fun but frustrating occasionally due to clunkiness that ended up costing me a life or two.The controls and combat in the game are very unique and different from most other games, which I liked. I felt like an assassin and I definitely had to think about each move I was making or I could end up regretting it.The story was fantastic, and I could definitely understand AlTairs feelings. Him, as a person, changed throughout and became a completely different person at the end.Overall, I would give this title a 7/10. It was incredibly fun, but it was repetitive in the long run and had a clunky parkour system. Thankfully, the game is short so it doesnt drag on for long.
