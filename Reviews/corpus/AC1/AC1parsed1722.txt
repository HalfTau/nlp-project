Relatively easy to beat. Combat is decent. They were really confident in making a sequeal/many sequeals, because there is no definite ending to this game.Pros Freerunning, amazing kills and an interesting storyline.Cons Funny AI, some bugs and eagle eye is the worse vision feature I have ever seen. Historical inaccuracies.The idea of assassinating people is to kill a few, to saves the lives of many. Ironically, there are many cases in which you kill like a GAZILLION soldiers to save ONE poor civilian. I have probably killed about a few hundred guards in a city of a few thousands Jerusalem but I guess its still less than 0.1 so thats okay. Makes you wonder who is right after all. Still, , so even the creed can be cast away once awhile.Overall, Its a good game. Would recomend.
