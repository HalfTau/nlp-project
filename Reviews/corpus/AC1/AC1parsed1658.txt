Some good ideas and an all round decent game. The cities were designed very well and allowed great freedom when freerunning. The mechanics of this worked well also. The story was a bit convoluted and got repetitive as it made you visit the same places and do similar tasks quite often, Repetition was probably my biggest complaint overall in the game. Combat is fun but can become boring and disinteresting. The graphics have held well and the game still looks and feels aesthetically pleasing. Had a few bugs but nothing major. Overall I would recommend this game if on sale. 6/10
