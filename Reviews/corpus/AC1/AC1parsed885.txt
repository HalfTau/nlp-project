The assassins are masters of deception and stealth ... Walks quietly into two dozen men to kill one of them... then takes a 5 minute conversation with him, while the others wait.. then defeats all remaining men without a scratch.For me this game really lacks a bit of atmosphere. I couldnt identify with the main character at all. Maybe with the present time one, but certainly not with Altair. The missions were far to generic, the only thing worth taking a look at where the actual assasinations, which still were just plain right slaughtering till you kill the right one.The graphics were ok but nothing special for todays standards.I guess this game just aged too much, I remember a time when everyone was talking about how realistic it felt, and I do see why. But now it didnt really get me.Yet I recommend this game to gamers who want to finish the entire AC story. It still has a good game flow and the parkour is smooth. Its just too repetitive.
