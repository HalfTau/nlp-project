The mechanics of the game were no doubt revolutionary for its time. The scenery of the game was very beautiful too. Unfortunately that is where my compliments end. Nothing can hide the fact that you are a dog fetching a stick throughout the game, with its repetitiveness. The fun factor quickly faded and it became a chore to reach the end. I must be in the minority though, as it seems so many actually enjoyed it? To each their own i suppose... now where did i leave that bone?
