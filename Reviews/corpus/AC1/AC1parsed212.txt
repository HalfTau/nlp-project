One word after these words Repetitive. Over course of several hours of gamplay, I personally find this game boring after going through the games maps, and doing the same thing over and over, like i said it gets repetitive, same missons. Aside from that, SPOILER ALERT, theres no currency so the Master assassin just give you back your items. ALSO NO BOW AND ARROWS... I was disappointed. Aside from the Negative, Gameplay can be funny like throwing guards off of roof top, or sneaking up on them even though you would see them and killing them assassinating and the guard be clueless is all fun.Verdict is, This game isnt what it worth back then or now. Dont buy it until a sale is going, because its a waste of money in my opinion. Also REALLY HUGE DOWNSIDE NO SUBTITLES. BAD, BAD, BAD.1/5 for no subtitles.3/5 Story3/5 Controls5/5 OVERALL GAMEPLAY5/5 Funny gameplay3/5 Graphics3/5 Overall
