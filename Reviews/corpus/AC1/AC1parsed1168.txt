You just have to be fan of Altair no matter what  The storyline is pretty simple for the first AC game though, if you wish for better story, aim for AC II, Brotherhood and Revelations instead. Graphics is amazing for 2008 game and mechanics of climbing and killing is well made, I cannot complain about it at all. You may get some repetetive feeling sometimes, but you can just search for flags and roam around cities if you do not want to play the main quest right away.
