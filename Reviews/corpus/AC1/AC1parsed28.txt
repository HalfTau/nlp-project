I jumped into this franchise late and played AC4 first and loved the story and gameplay, so I wanted to start from the begining to get the full experience. I expected AC 1 to be a bit more primitive when I got it, but wasnt ready for just how bad it was. The story isnt quite as good, but thats forgivable. The problem lies in the fact that what little story there is, is drowned out by monotonous tasks that dont give that assassin feel. Theres very little sneaking around and assassinating of a target. Instead, most missions turn into a slugfest where youre fighting half the city guards. Theres no feeling of immersion, rather just grinding through battle after battle to get to the cutscenes to try and glean some kind of storyline. I finished it, deleted it, and vowed to never wasted time on it again. Had I played this first, I wouldnt have been drawn to the Assassins Creed franchise in the first place. Heres to hoping 2 and 3 are better.
