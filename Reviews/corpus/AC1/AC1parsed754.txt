Dont let the low playtime as of this writing at least fool you, Ive spent a lot of time with this game on other platforms.The first Assassins Creed game, while still a good game as the thumbs up can carry, is honestly inferior to the sequels in quite a few ways.The game itself is repetitive and frustrating at times, the campaign essentially consisting of three or four miniquests in new locations you can complete all of or some of for the same reward before an assassination ni one of threecities. This is repeated many times with roughly the same conersation taking place at each turn and only slightly more exposition offered. This brings in pacing problems admittedly present in most AC games in that the story moves quickly at the beginning, slowly for around 10 or so hours of gameplay, and then moves into the endgame of Altairs story like a runaway train while Desmonds story builds up to reveals and ultimately letdowns in the future games.In summaryFun mechanics in an open world that have been improved in future gamesInteresting story with some pacing problemUnfortunately repetitive campaign.Final verdict Probably buy it on sale. 10 or so, but its a good game.
