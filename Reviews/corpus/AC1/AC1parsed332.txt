10/10 game. This game is the birthstone for what Assassinss Creed has become. I have beat the game 4 times I believe now, and it doesnt get old. Crazy to see how different the original is from the newer AC games.A lot of people however, do say it gets repetitive, which in a sense I can agree on. Your mission for killing the templars is the same. Visit the city district, talk to the bureau leader, do viewpoints, save citizens, and 6 missions that are of the same relation. Once done, you go kill the templar, and eventually make your way to the next city and repeat it all. Although its the same, it does not take away from the fact that doing all this is FUN. It still has an awesome story line and is very relaxing to play.If you want to get into the AC series, definitely start from the beginning with this one. Its also crucial to the Desmond Miles story.
