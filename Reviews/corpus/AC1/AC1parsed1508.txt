The first AC game. I played this one when it was out.Awesome game, brought some fresh air in the game industry.The graphics were awesome at that time, the mechanics were something singular.If you have played any other AC game, you will probably not like this one... Its always like that. Unless you play with the mind that this was the first one.The plot is cool, as works nice with all the other AC games with Desmond.If you are a fan of the AC series, buy it and have fun.still better than AC III
