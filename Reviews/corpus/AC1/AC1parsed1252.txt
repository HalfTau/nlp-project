Do not buy this game if you run anything newer than Vista or Win XP. I have a GTX980 running Win8.1x64 and the only thing I can enjoy from this game is my screens flickering and saying Assassins Creed has stopped working. It wont even load. Im no longer interested in playing this series, and will avoid buying any Ubisoft game, after having read so many others having problems just getting it to run, and about all the DRM insanity they put into this game. It seems when they were porting this from console to PC another thing Im remembering from this experience.. dont bother with a port unless its extremely well tested on PC they were more concerned with people stealing it than having it run. Ubisoft, dont worry, I have no desire to steal this piece of garbage. I only wish I had a way to revoke the 20 you got out of this so I wasnt involved in funding your scam machine, selling nonfunctional games on Steam.
