Excessively repetitive. You do the same things all over the game, use the same methods and even fight in the same way. The game gets very repetitive and easy once you learn the basics. If you enjoy doing the same thing for hours and hours over and over a game, then I suppose you should give the game a chance. If not, move along, this is not the game for you.
