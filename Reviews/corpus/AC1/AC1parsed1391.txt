This game might well have been ahead of its time in 2008.The graphics and setting and atmosphere are like being in the old coutry in 1200 AD.Its an original and exhilerating experience to play this game.Yet lets face it it plays clunky, I am always fighting with the PC commands to get the game to play the way I want it to. The screen freezes which means starting from scratch at the buarough  if the spelling is unprecise I am sorry  is an unavoidable fact.Aswell as other glitches.However this is compared to the games of today which really is rather unfair.After all it was made in 2008 thats seven years ago in an ever changing industry.Although too it gets a little ominous at times with the same old routine from start to finnish.But in all I have to give this game a thumbs up and at its price is still one heck of a deal. Even if you were to pay twice the price of it now  it would still pay for itself in good fun entertainment value again and again.There is one thing though is its very frustrating to play because of the mechanics of the game.
