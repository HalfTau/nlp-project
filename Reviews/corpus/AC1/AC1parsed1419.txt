So, youll probably notice that my gameplay time isnt that high, and, well, I have a good reason for that. The gameplay. In my opinion, this game had one of the worst types of gameplay Ive ever come across, so this kind of forced me to try and get through the game as fast as I could. The fighting was very bland, the missions were VERY repetetive, and to be honest, I didnt enjoy any of the fights. Theres also the fact that there were no subtitles, which is a musthave for me, very limited soundtrack, Altair spoke in an American accent in a time where America didnt even exist Yes, Im aware that they change his voice in Revelations, although I havent played it yet. and it was far too easy to escape the guards. One of the things I really did enjoy, though, is the storyline, especially the bits with the onearmed assassin. Id recommend this to anyone who can stomache bad gameplay for a good story, but otherwise, I dont feel like this game deserves a recommendation. Unless, of course, youre planning on understanding the whole series story.
