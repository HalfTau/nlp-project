Assasins Creed. I find the lore of this series really good especially the start which is this game. Yes the gameplay is VERY repetitive but its the story that made this game successful. I would reccommend this if you are going to play through all of the Assasins Creed games. If not but want a AC game? get 2, Brotherhood, and Revalations
