The directors cut fixes a lot of my major gripes that I had with the original games. It by no means makes it perfect or even great. Some of the missions are still repetitive and collectibles dont really add anything to the core game, especially without any steam achievement enabled. But for anyone wanting to experience the roots and beginnings of Assassins Creed, this is definitely the place to get started.
