Im a huge fan of the series but I gotta say that playing this game has been painful to say the least. Storywise its interesting especially in the modern day section but parkour, fighting and guard AI are awful. You should buy/watch it on youtube only for the story if you are a fan of the series. Goodlooking for an fairly old game Altair Interesting setting God awful game mechanics Repetitive missions
