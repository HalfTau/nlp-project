I had a whole bunch of people tell me I should play this game for YEARS, so I finally cashed out and bought it. It is a good game and its not too difficult to get into. The gameplay is very lacking and unrefined when compared to similar games like Arkham Asylum/City and/or the latest Tomb Raider. However, as a starter to the fantastic Assassins Creed series, it is simly one of those mustplay games.
