Odds are that youve either already played Assassins Creed already, or never will so this review seems a bit like an exercise in futility so Ill keep it short.Assassins Creed pretty much singlehandedly created the open world parkour platformer game that everyone ended up making eventually. The game itself is still decent despite some design issues, such as doing the same repetitive side quests in order to progress the convoluted main story, or being able to beat the game by using a single combat move ad nauseam. Still, Assassins Creed both the first game and the series does a great job of taking you through various historic locations and keeping you engaged as it does. Its a definite recommendation from me.
