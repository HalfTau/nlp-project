IF YOU ARE HARD OF HEARING THEN PLEASE READ THIS! !Picked this up in the Steam Sale as I started playing AC games when Black Flag was released. I have played them all since then and loved them all equally, yes, even Unity. So thought I would pick up the earlier games so I could fill in the blanks in the story of the Assassins V Templars. However, upon starting my game with this first entry into the series I have found that this AAA game has no subtitles  not a deal breaker to  most gamers, but I have 80 hearing loss in both ears and therefore the dialogue is incredibly hard to follow. I should be able to get by and can find a lot of the dialogue of the cut scenes on the various Wikis, but it certainly breaks the immersion. Now I understand there is no way these will be added so many years after the game was released, and I also understand that all AC games from AC2 onward are fully subtitled, but leaving this hear pun intended so others who are hard of hearing understand before purchasing that it will dull the game playing experience somewhat. Surprised that a game of this size and with the production budget available it had omitted to add subtitles. Thankfully this has changed a lot in the past ten years with even small indie games subtitling important dialogue. I havent played enough to form an opinion of the game itself, but I am sure it will be as good as the others in the series.
