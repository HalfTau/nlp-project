This game was more frustrating then it ever was fun. After just finishing it I feel robbed but a sense of freedom in that I can now never need to return to this awful mess.There is a lot I could say about how bad this is but Im honestly not a reviewer nor am I sure how to go about wording everything correctly.I think the biggest bad point of this game was the abysmal controls. In everything I have played in my life, this god damn game had the worst controls I ever had to use. This in it self caused way to much frustration, simply because a lot of the time the character didnt do what they are suppose to which led them into danger or going the wrong way. Its bad enough that most of the actions requires at least a 3 button combination, seriously, sprinting you have your movement on left stick, hold right trigger to toggle run and then hold A to actually Free Run. Dont forget all the extra buttons on top of that, especially if youre in a chase.Honestly a terrible game, Im a very late bloomer to the franchise and I genuinely wished I just googled the first games story online instead of putting myself through hell.Avoid this game, read its story online and proceed to the others.I really hope the second is not going to be so god damn tedious.
