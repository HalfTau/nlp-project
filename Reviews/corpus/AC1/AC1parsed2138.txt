Amazing, considering the date it was released. However, it would have been better if the storyline was more creative, or actions were more exciting and not repeating over and over. As you are playing, you will find yourself trying to finish the mission as soon as possible because you are getting tired of it.Instructions of controls do not make sense,  you will get used to it soon though you can not put subtitles on or skip cinematics.However, generally, it is a good game. I recommend to play this game before playing Assassins Creed 2 to enrich understanding of the storyline.
