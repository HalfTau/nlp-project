a great game!ive played on the nintendo ds, xbox 360 now on pc its looks amazing!though when using keyboard/mouse i really had to pay attention to the begining tutorial to see what key/button is what xP xbox controller might be usefullwhen you first start up the game ubisoft may ask ya to register you dont have to.also if you have the problem when you are not able to get into full screen just exit the game and restart assassins creed.when i first installed the game it worked fine with windows 7 64bit hpbut after reinstalling i have to run in compatibility mode.
