If this is the first and only Assassins creed game youve played, please dont judge the entire saga based on this gamein my opinion this is the worst one in the entire series the game play is very repetitive.  To be fair, this was the first game that needed to be set to launch the entire saga.  The game had some very creative concepts like jumping off 30 story buildings, secretively assassinating with a hidden blade.  The story line is pretty cool too, I wont spoil too much but it has a matrix like storyline.  Overall its a very good play and a must if you like platforming and sneakily killing people type games.  It is also a must play first if you intend on getting into the assassins creed story lines.
