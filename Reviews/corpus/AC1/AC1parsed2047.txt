The first, and probably worst, in the Assassins Creed series.When this game first came out people, I included, thought it was revolutionary. The historical fiction story of an ancient battle between the assassins and templars that draws ties to present day conflicts, the philisophical conflicts brought forth between both sides, and of course, the free running mechanics. These story elements were things not seen often outside of traditional RPGs and this may be the first triple A title to do so. The story was a bit cerebral for such a wide audiance, and some gamers may lose interest, but I was captivated.That said, if youve played any of the instalments since, and youre just coming back to see who this Altair character is, youre probably going to be very disappointed. Remember all those pointless quests and collectables present in the other games? Here you will find the most annoying and most pointless examples of said quests and collectables. Thankfully, there are no achievements for this version, erasing any point of getting most of them in the first place. The story, while good, is the least interesting, and least weird, of the series so far. The world is very bland and the cities dont have few landmarks by which to navigate so you will almost constantly be bringing up the map to figure out where to go unless theres a marker for your destination.Overall this is a good game though, and I cant bring myself to not recommend it. If youre new to the series give it a try, otherwise just take everyones word for it from the sequels, Altair was awesome at everything.
