This game is a really interesting game. I love the idea that people can live the lives of their ancestors, who happen to be badass assassins. The gameplay is linear, and Altair may have a severe case of monotone, but I think it still is pretty cool to uncover a conspiracy, redeem yourself after killing a ton of friends, etc. It consists of running around Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus killing each target, dramatically. You kill about 3 targets in each area, then you kill another target, and then the game is done. Throughout the adventure, you can collect a ton of flags from each place, and can be annoying to find all of them.TLDR This game is for people who want to run around a lot stabbing people who are evil.
