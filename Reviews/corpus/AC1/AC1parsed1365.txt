I have played other Assasins Creed Games and decided to give the first one a try before Revelations to enjoy the plot a bit more. It is definitely a must have for all the fans of the AC saga, but dont expect too much  after playing huge Black Flag you will be surprised by the simplicity of AC1.PLUS the atmosphere, music, plot and the amazing antagonist make it absolutely worth it! Google the locations you visit and characters you meet  you will be surprised how this game is based on true storiesMINUS relatively short, not a lot of side quests, poor voice acting and voice quality8/10
