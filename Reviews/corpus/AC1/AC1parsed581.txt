The first Assassins Creed. This game is more a tech demo, than a good game. But you can still have a lot of fun with it, because of the setting, the atmosphere and the pretty good graphics for the year of 2007 console release.But be aware, every following game of the main series of assassins creed is a lot better in close to everything.
