The game is getting old now but still looks quite impressive with the settings dialled up on a modern PC. I recommend a 5 button mouse which it has special setup for and I played with at the time or a gamepad. I found the gamepad bindings strange and didnt rebind them at the time. But it would be worth doing this to use with a gamepad instead. Great story and setting which I actually found this more interesting than the latter AC episodes.
