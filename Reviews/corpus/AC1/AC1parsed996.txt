I had decided over the summer that I would start playing the AC games, so like usual I went to the first game, then I could at least get a feel for what the other games may be like. Though this game is very different from the other ones, I found it to be a fun start.If you have ever played any of the other AC games, I recommend not playing this one. I thought it was a good starting game though for the franchise.
