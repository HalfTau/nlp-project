A pretty good start to a franchise. Game is very clunky control and camera wise, often time youll run into a wall when you were trying to climb up a ladder, or a tree will pop into view when youre in the middle of a multiperson sword fight. It takes some getting used to but after a bit its just an acceptable quirk.gameplay can get repetitive, but theres still a lot of cool stuff. Combat is really satisfying, despite being relatively simple. Learn how to use counters and the game will be fun and not frustrating. Overall, a solid experience.Story wise, I wont get into spoilers but as usual in video games, the story gets a bat insane at the end. It sets things up well for the next installment and has me waiting to see what happens.Played with a steam controller Xbox one controllers have issues out of the box7.5 out of 10.
