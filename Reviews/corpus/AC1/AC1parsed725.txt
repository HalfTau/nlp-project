Being the very first game in the series, its a lot more linear than others, but more stealthbased. Less 2 hour long swordfights than later Assassins Creed games. Its almost ten years old and the graphics still hold up, the games environment was beautiful on release. If you want a better experience, Id say pick up a later game in the series to get more of your moneys worth. But this would for sure be worth it if it was a couple bucks on sale, especially if youre looking to start from the very start of the Assassins Creed series.
