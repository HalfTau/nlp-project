Best assassins creed game, awsome story, that is based on real events and real people in real scenerios unlike its sequals, and YES the assassins where supposed to be based on the real world Hashasins look it up!.What i like best is how it doesnt go too far into the relms of fiction and thus the game universe feals scarely realistic. Furthormore for the game mechanics and the missions are the best the game and series has too offer, it provides you with the choice and methods of how you kill your enamy or how you aquire information for it in whatever order you please. Also you go into the game nowing nothing about how the combat works but after a few replays of assassinations i found myself using the hidden blade and never getting a scatch as i badassly counter all my opponents moves.For computing issues, there is none, you can play fine with little lag on even the oldest of machines, if you have a problem you can lower the building texures or turn off some of the nonnescersery parts of graphics, even still they look fine at the lowest level. But i suggest not changing the character textures as they end up looking heleroius and unreal on the lowest character textures, but that never effects lag anyway. But anyway you should have little problem.Finaly the cities are pristine and perfect, using real world buildings, such as the Umhyyad Mosque, Temple Mount and the Catsle of Acre. Also the cities up into segregated class quaters, containing many souks bazzars or marketplaces and dingy dark allyways. However you will unlock these different areas as you progress through the game.Overall a 10/10 game, a great show to how a game should be made, and i highly reccommend you plays this.
