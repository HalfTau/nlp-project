I really wanted to like this game. Perhaps I didnt play it right or something, but many parts of the game felt like a chore.  Every single mission is exactly the same. As soon as youve seen all three cities, the game is nothing but tedious investigation quests which consist of finding lame wannabe assassins and doing fetch quests for them. Also peppered throughout the cities are viewpoints, which are actually pretty fun because you have to find ways to climb tall buildings. Then there are the rescue citizen missions which are so completely out of place its ridiculous. Sure, lets make the whole game about stealth kills and then force you to fight some guards in the middle of the marketplace in plain view of everyone. Lets also have you do it about 10 times per city. And every citizen has that same canned I will repay this kindness I swear it line afterwards. The only time this is worthwhile is when you unlock a crowd of scholars to get past some guards. The AI for the guards is absolutely atrocious as well. Just inexcusable.This series got far better with the sequel and the Ezio trilogy. This game feels like a prototype for the series rather than a worthwhile game.
