If you are new to the franchise Id recommend starting with AC2, however if you are already a fan, this is definitely worth picking up during a sale. This is the root of the franchise and has repetitive missions and flaws, but I really enjoyed seeing the completely different setting and it also is the most realistic AC to date imo and the assassins are really ruthless which was neat to see for once.
