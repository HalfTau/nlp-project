I played this a long time ago on the 360 but could never really finish it due to varying reasons. But seeing as all the Assassin Creed games are on sale I went ahead and got all of them for a pretty decent price of 5 a piece, which isnt bad for such a big series. Replaying through the game the story isnt half bad, and am looking forward to reviewing the other Assassins Creed games in time.One big negative thing is the way climbing works.  It isnt horrible, but there are times where you would want to climb up a building fast rather than jump off a building killing yourself in the process.  Other than that, this was a big hit in the series and is a great story, providing you are more of a story driven person. 8/10
