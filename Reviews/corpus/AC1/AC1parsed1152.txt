Assassins Creed is one of the most unique storyactionRPG game ever made. Smooth combat and facial animation put even recent RPG games to shame. The middle east during the times of the crusaders is believable and feels very authentic. This game is executed to a very high level and is definitely worth the full price even after so many years.Assassins Creed on the PC is however not without its faults. Make no mistakes, this was madeforconsole. Any PC gamers will immediately find the PC controls clunky. There are many consolenastiness such as checkpoint saving and ridiculous combat controls which plainly does not work on a mouse and keyboard. I gave up trying to remember all the different keys for all the combat moves and used only block/retaliate which requires only right and left mouse buttons.The gameplay can also get quite repetitive and its a chore to do the tasks because 90 of the time you are wading through people and trying to blend in. Run a bit and you get caught. Bump into someone, you get caught. Its fun the first few times, but gets really annoying after a few hours. Sometimes people just wanna play and walking slowly doing nothing is not playing. Replayability is poor because after 20 hrs, i just wanna get it over with.All the funky console issues aside, I would definitely still recommend all RPG fans to get this game. If you havent played Assassins Creed, you are missing out.
