Just finished replaying through this game as I have not played it since it was released back in the day on Xbox 360.If you have never played Assassins creed before, this game is a must play. Ignore everything below, as that is written from the POV of someone who has played and completed nearly every game in the entire series, and went back and played this one now on PC. The series was one of the best and most revolutionary ones there were. I wish I could experience them for the first time again.As someone who has played every single Assasins Creed from start to finish, going back and playing this game was painful in terms of the mechanics, camera angles, repetitiveness.The main storyline is still good although repeptitive, and I did enjoy the nostalgia seeing how the series got started in terms of the pieces of eden, abstergo, and desmond.However you are assigned to assassinate a total of 9 people, and before you can kill one of them, you must complete at least 23 mini tasks.There are only 3 different mini tasks in the entire game Pickpocket a random citizen for info, talk to an informant and complete his task, and beat up a random preacher/wellknow citizen to get info from them. You do this NINE times. You literally pickpocket, escort/run through city, and fist fight a citizen a total of 2527 times, and then assasinate a target. 9 main kills, 23 mini tasks before each one.Once again want to emphasize if youve never played the series, please get this and play it through, as youre starting one of the best and most successful game franchises of all time.First time played 9/10Going back years later after playing the whole series 7/10
