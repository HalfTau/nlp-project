I spent about 20 hours with this game, including the 2 hours spent replaying major sequences because the game broke. Including the final battle  I had just beaten him and the game crashed, and the restart was a good 20 minutes earlier and had to be replayed. The technical issues with this game on PC are embarrassing, especially considering how long ago it came out.As for the game itself  its an open world game that punishes you for exploring the open world  the dichotomy between your range of motion and the responses to the world to your action is really weird, and doesnt support the goal of the game. The number of activities available is pretty small for this kind of game climb towers, help citizens in battles, and then some missionspecific tasks that are the same every time. There are flags to gather, for no purpose. There are templars to kill. For no purpose. Its like they read a guide on how to put an open world game together, but forgot to make it worthwhile. Which is too bad, because the environments are beautiful, and not something you see in many other games Middle East in the Crusades era. Fighting isnt horrible, but it isnt great. All the pieces are there, but it doesnt cohere into a very good game especially in light of the games that have come out since, it doesnt stand up for a return visit.
