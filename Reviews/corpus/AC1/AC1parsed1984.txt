Boring and repetetive. Its initial shine quickly fades to give room to endless slodging through the same side quests you finish before each one of the nine assassination attempts that you must complete in order to progress through the game. The stealth mechanic is decent, though it oftentimes is undermined by the overall arcadedy feel of the game. Did it only once to experience the story and dont plan to do it ever again. If you plan to tackle this franchise you might as well skip this one, or just watch the story gameplay videos on youtube.
