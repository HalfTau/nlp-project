Assassins Creed is one of the most well know Action/Adventure series to date, and rightfully so! I have always been a big fan of Assassin Creed, and owned all the collectors editions on my Xbox, but as I transitions to PC, I really missed Assassins Creed. AC really kickstarted my gaming hobby, and now that it has finally been released to PC, I am more than happy to say it made a smooth transition, with slightly better graphics than on consoles! Directors Cut is not much different than the original game, but is still a respectable port to the PC. I cannot say much about the graphics as they are very outdated by todays standards, but keeping in mind this assassins creed is over 6 years old! Gameplay feels fast paced, challenging, and smooth! Story is pretty basic, and the entire game is basically repeating the same 3 primary missions, over and over again. The whole climb everywhere feature is amazing, and still beats most games to date! I love that we finally got a PC version of Assassins Creed, because its an outstanding series!Concept Honestly very basic, the storyline is very repetitive, following one basic task to the next. 75/100Graphics For its time, its outstanding, everything has a suprising ammount of detail, and is very respectable. 90/100Sound Sounds effects are great, but the overall soundtrack is very boring, and feels like it was left to the last second while in development. 75/100Playability Using a keyboard and mouse feels great and was very well implimented! Combat is smooth and entertaining, and climbing up buildings feels great! 95/100Entertainment Concept is basic, storyline is basic, campaigne is barebones, but the amazing gameplay and graphics really boost Assassins Creed Directors Cut. 75/100Replay Value Moderatly low.Overall Score 82/100
