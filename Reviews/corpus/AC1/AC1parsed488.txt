Never really dabbled with assasins creed but recently i brought a lot of the games in a sale, was gonna start with the first and play them through.I am enjoying the game so far but OMG the controls are so clunky and bad it makes the smallest thing difficult, if its cheap buy, but be prepared these controls damn theyre bad capitol BAD.
