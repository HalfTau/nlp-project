This is one of the glitchiest ports Ive ever played. Within the first 3 missions, I experienced the following unable to complete the wallclimb in Solomons Temple because my character bugged out on the first handhold and would not respond to any keyboard/mouse or controller input had to restart the mission, characters flying out of the world during the assault on Masyaf 3 separate times within 5 minutes, camera glitching around wildly during present time sequences without any input, and my character bugged out during a leap of faith and died and now whenever it reloads, I fall out of the world and die over and over again. I had to start a new game in order to fix this.Not to mention that its a 5step process to exit the game, which is ridiculous. You have to exit out of a mission to the animus in the present day, then exit the animus, then choose to exit to the menu, and then you have to load a profile before you can actually choose to exit. This should be 2 steps at most  quit to menu, select exit.
