Its a pretty good game and it introduces some neat mechanics, but its very unpolished. Considering that the game ends with a to be continued, you should play it if youre interested in the franchise as a whole, but Im not sure how strongly Id recommend it by itself. Its a great launching point for a franchise and does some cool new things but it does have its flaws.Full review here
