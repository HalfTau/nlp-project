Great game back in its time. Still a great game by todays standards. The gameplay is smooth and usually intuitive. You might notice that the games primary SKU is for a console by the menu style. Its a little offputting,  but once you actually get into the game, you forget about it and focus on the story or the missions. If youre using a gamepad, you probably wont notice. The voice acting is superb and the views and vistas are breathtaking. The environments are wonderfully immersive and keep you interested in the story.This game is worth its current price of 20. If you havent played it, youre missing out.
