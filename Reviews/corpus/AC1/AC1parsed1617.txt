 interesting story cool mix between historical settings and Animus UI huge map after unlocking the areas horse riding assassination missions smooth combat with impressive combos no uPlay falling into water kills you after a while the guard fighting gets repetitive progress save system graphical glitches bad video card optimization audio can go out of sync in rare occassionsA somewhat crude and at times clunky introduction to the series. But I really liked it. Why? Well the story is okay, but the assassinations, THOSE take the cake. Not all are equally good but all felt satisfying. The combat is fun as well although having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive after a while. The later ugrades that Altair gets make the combat even better. Falling into water kills you in this game which is rather immersion breaking why would a trained assassin not be able to swim? but not game breaking. The horse riding is cool although sometimes the horses handle poorly. Many people do not like the Desmond timeline but I do, it adds flavour to the story. Overall a cool game that has some bugs and boring/annoying parts which get mostly negated by the smooth combat and assassination system. Recommended!
