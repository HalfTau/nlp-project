Assassins Creed games are love or hate kind of games much like Battlefield or Call of Duty. I myself as a history buff have enjoyed each and everyone of the game in the franchise. Each game feels different and is made to be different unlike COD. The reason why I like this one is because of the setting Middle ages and how beautiful the game looks. Also the Desmond trilogy AC 13 has the strongest storyline. I liked Black Flag, Rogue and Unity aswell and Im waiting for Syndicate, because each game changes the gameplay and the feeling to it.BUT the first part in AC is repetitive because of the games mechanic. I honestly prefer AC II over I because of the variety of missions and activities. This game will remain a classic for me but its not the best in the series unlike most games are.Oh and its the only AC game that doesnt require Uplay, even tough I have nothing against Ubisoft. Some people on Steam complain it on a daily basis which I dont get. I agree that you can have opinion but whining about Uplay or Ubisoft isnt good for your health.But verdict, its an 8/10 game.
