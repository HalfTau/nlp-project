3/10  One of the worst games I have ever played. There are some cool mechanics in it  I cant deny that but after a while and this moment comes very quick it  becomes VERY boring. It is also way too simple and contains a lot of bugs you can fall under map or you can have situation when you cant trigger cutscene. The worst part is the ending  last chapter is nonstop fighting that looks like this defeat 5 guys, watch cutscene, defeat 10 new guys, watch another cutscene  it goes like that at least 10 times S DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT PLAY IT EVEN IF YOU SOMEHOW GET THIS FOR FREE. STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. EACH TIME YOU TURN THIS ON GOD KILLS A KITTEN SO BE AWARE.
