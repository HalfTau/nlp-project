So recently I decided to marathon all the Assassins Creed games available on PC and 100 complete them. This one I didnt 100 complete but I did do the story and some side stuff. Here are my honest thoughts on just the game itself, if you were to buy it now.ProsInteresting story line in and out of the Animus.Combat can be quite satisfactory and challenging.Is not too easy.The locations are quite cool and interesting.Desmond.ConsGraphics are very outdated which is unsurprising seeing as how old it is.Gameplay is very repetitive do some spying then kill your target. 9 times.Freerunning is quite slow and clunky, but not too bad.Cutscenes are very dull, boring and overwinded.Voice acting isnt great especially from Altair.Altair is quite a boring character with no spirit.Being stealthy is very dull, pointless and sometimes very hard.Overall, if you want to have some fun with a one off game then DO NOT BUY THIS, unless maybe its on sale. There are much funner games for 10. If, however, you want to start the AC games from the beginning and understand it all like me then buy it, but do know IT IS NOT NEEDED! You can easily start from AC 2 and not really miss much as that is a much better game!
