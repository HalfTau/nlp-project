The game that spawned a whole new series and brought a new meaning to gaming.Assassins Creed is one of the best games of its era. Relatively large openworld maps to explore, storyrich, excellent voice acting and animation, the only thing that this game lacks is a monetary and item purchase system that would later be implemented in Assassins Creed II.Another, lets say, weak point of the game is its repetitivity at some point in the game, youll find yourself doing the same things over and over again find something, go beat up some dude, follow another dude, steal a dudes letter, and so on.TLDR a musthave for any Assassins Creed fan.
