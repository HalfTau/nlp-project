I really liked this game. That is until the issues started showing themselves. Like pickpockets that cant happen, and the assassination of William, at the end of which something crashes either the game, the video driver, or both. Im really upset now at having to play the same scenario over and over again. Ill probably just give it up and remove the game from my library. You might not have these issues, but if you start noticing weird things, or get game crashes, you soon will tire of this, as I have.
