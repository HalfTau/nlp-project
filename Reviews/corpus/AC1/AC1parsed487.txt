At its time of release, it was a brave entry with its mix of free running and stealth based gameplay. It is immersive, and gives you a real feel of the history and geography of the third crusade. The cities themselves feel large and unique, with lots of NPC characters.The graphics arent too bad for its age either.One of the main reasons I would play this is the story, as it provides a lot of the starting canon for the rest of the franchise. Each assassination feels purposeful, and taking a life has a consequence. Some of the targets I developed a personal anger towards when learning of their deeds, which indicates the strength of the writing.However, for the good there must be bad. For a start, it runs badly. Freezes throughout loading menus and occasionally in game  often mid combat which is awkward. The investigations required for the assassinations are repetitive, and tend to turn the game a bit grindy when you are performing them.The combat for some reason I just cannot fathom. I appreciate not all blows would be blocked, but the counter system makes little sense in the type of attacks that can be blocked. It boils down to luck  or maybe I am missing something. Late in the game the number of enemies is honestly ridiculous, and when you are surrounded by enemies winning is nigh on impossible. It got to a point on a number of occasions when I rage quit and resolved to watch the remaining cut scenes online. The missions themselves are sometimes hit and miss, I cant tell you the number of times I fell in that damn harbour, I mean, an assassin that cant swim? Really?
