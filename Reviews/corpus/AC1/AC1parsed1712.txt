Because this is the first game in the series, I had to play it. It is really nice, the graphics are okay and the story makes you wonder what comes next. There is one thing I didnt like though. If youre running a slow computer, you have to start the game through opening the folder it was installed in, and navigate to one of the dxs of the game. There is no standard ubisoft information about it anywere which is really bad. And then it doesnt even show the playtime! My 1.8 hours on record is the time facing blackscreens and freezes trying to start the game.
