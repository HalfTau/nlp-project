i will never figure out how this game received a sequel or turned into a franchise...it has bad ai, bad level design, buggy climbing mechanics, boring gameplay 15 hours of two button combat, terrible story and awful writing, mediocre voice acting and probably one of the worst endings in a game i have ever seen.i cant be bothered to write a full review for this, too... they couldnt be bothered to actually make a game, not just copy and paste same objective 9 times and slap a halfboss battle at the end.eh.
