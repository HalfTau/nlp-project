Incredible story and graphics. Gameplay is good but not optimal. I do not like how the camera works but I got used to it. This game is just amazing. The plot is very well written and strategies are needed to pass some parts. Sometimes you need to be pacient enough to repeat some parts until you get it done. I suggest to look around a lot before deciding where to go. Totally recommend this game.
