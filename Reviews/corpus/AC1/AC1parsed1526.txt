Ive had so many problems with this game, I have the Titan video card 6 GB and even with all the graphic driver updates as well as  game updates not to mention verify integrity of game cash as well as register with Uplay  and still have problems so I start the mission and  I can see the background I can see a cloud and so forth but when I walked towards and individual to complete a specific function Lets say like stabbing them or trying to move them out of the way.  The background in the game disappears transparent than only ladders and pillars or floor stones remain visible everything else is transparent drives me nuts, right click then left click on delete local content equals waste of money not to mention that theres no such thing as a Crouch key or Sprinting,  And OK so they want me to hold down my right mouse button, then hold down the letter  S  so that I can sprint and then touched the space bar to jump.. then press the A to interact to slash locking mechanism, just for a thought maybe this game should not be for PC use a consul OMFG...The game has been specifically ported to PC from consul.
