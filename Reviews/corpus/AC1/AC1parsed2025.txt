Just want to answer the probably often upcoming question if this game is still worth giving a shot now where there are so many predecessors aroundYes, it is. Altough AC has turned into a yearly release game, which usually means a decline of quality, it is one of the few games that actually has a story which is not like from a mediocre tv soap episode. AC 1 sets the tone and introduces the storyline which is very interesting. The graphics are still good, and set the right atmosphere. I personally liked the set of AC1 the most, because I really like the history of the crusades in 1190. The designers did a real good job to give the player the right atmosphere and setting of the holy land and its lookalike back then of course just of our todays imagination of it.Its a great game which you can actually playthrough pretty quick, so it is worth the time. The only let down is the repeatance of the game which starts to bore. Here you can feel the understandable fact that this franchise and its genra was in itS birthstate, it set the technical aspects right detailed sandbox cities whith ACs well know climbing aspects. Yet it lacked in the gameplay later on. Sidemissions you have to accomplish to get to your actual target are monotonous, but you can achieve them fast and dont have to do a lot of them.Beside this, the game has one of the best andd atmospheric soundtracks thanks to mastermind Jesper Kyd know for Hitman Soundtracks as well.If you can get your hands on it, in sale for like 3 go give it a try its definately worth it and is  the respectable first game of a good series of games.
