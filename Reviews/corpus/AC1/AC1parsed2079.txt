Ive been meaning to finish this game for a while now. I played Assasins Creed II first and absolutely loved it. I still havent completed this one, but Ill get to it some day. From what I can remember, I enjoyed it. Sorry for not being able to give more details.I will say one thing though the minimap is rubbish. It doesnt show the outline of any buildings so you cant use it for navigation at all, unlike the second games minimap. From what I can recall, the minimap is basically a circle with cardinal directions wirrten on it with a opqaue background inside that contains a load of markers for quests and whatnot that the minimap if of no use in getting to.
