I think Assassins Creed is such a weird franchise. It has so many cool things going for it, but then theres a whole heap of things that bring it down. I guess I would give it a Yes as a recommendation via Steam reviews, but from what Ive played so far, my overall opinion on the series is more neutral.Anyway, this is the first game in the franchise, and there are some really interesting things about it. No other game has really done free running so openly like Assassins Creed, or approached history with such a expansive and imaginative point of view. The time period is very unique and well realized. The simple mechanics some of which are okay, and others which unfortunately are not well polished are also surprisingly welcome, because for someone like me, the combat and gameplay isnt exactly what draws me in, its the world and history, so I dont want to waste my time learning some complex systems.I think the problems lie with the combat and movement which are extremely hitormiss and the storytelling. Having most of the cutscenes take place from a static third person perspective is really off putting, and gives a really poor Bmovie vibe for any story that is present. As well, the whole modern timeline thing is just ridiculuous. This game and the series as a whole needs to do without it. Especially considering there are zero likeable characters in my opinion in the modern timeline. I just dont care about any of them.Overall, Id probably give this game like a 6.5/10. I think its a really decent game, and its definitely worth a look, but grab it on sale.
