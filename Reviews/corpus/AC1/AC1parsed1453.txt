This is the most inconsistently frustrating game Ive played all year. The game seems designed to make you think it has quality and then it punches you in the face with annoying NPCs and redundant quests that have nothing to do with the sparse primary storyline. Im bailing on it halfway through. I have better, less frustratingly annoying games yet to start. That, and my cursing at the screen has my wife concerned for my physchological state. Seriously? I know people swear by this series, and I purchased several titles in the series on supersale a while ago but I think Im putting this in my I hate the Game Mechanics library category. Ill watch the YouTube Lets Play to finish the primary story. This game has way to much grinding and struggling with swooping camera struggles for my taste.
