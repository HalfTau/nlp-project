Assassins Creed is simply brilliant! The beginning of a fantastic series! Sure, its pretty much the sameyou do all the time, but i still find it very entertaining! The story is great, and Altar is awesome.The only problem is a Leap of Faith Glitch that ive encountered multiple times. You basically do the jumps as usual, but when you hit the haystack, you just simply die, which is ing annoying.Besides that, 10/10EppeyX
