This is the first Assassins Creed game, featuring Altair as the assassin. This title achieved a impressive recognition and is responsible for one of the most successful franchise of all time.As all of AC games, the graphics are awesome, atmosphere is great and the historic context are very interesting. The problem with this game is that after play a number of missions you realize that the missions are kind of repetitive and then the game will be losing its appeal. But anyway its a great game, it was a blow when released and have a important role in the games history.
