The first part of the famous stealth actionadventure series. It laid out strong foundations for the following games but sadly cant stand on its own.Pros The scenario show the Templars as ambiguous enemies rather than just as evil monsters Many historical characters are involved and you can visit culturallyimportant places like the Great Mosque of Damascus Videogame elements such as checkpoints and regenerating life are interestingly part of the story The graphics are still strong for a game that was released in 2008Cons The PC port is awful  you cant exit the game quickly, gamebreaking crashes will happen several time and an option to display subtitles is lacking The handling is poor and too often you will die or be spotted due to the game not registering correctly your intentions Extremely repetitive gameplay and the bizarre need to fill the ending with combatIts sad but the game is really just a tech demo for the rest of the series. Assassins Creed is extremely frustrating, which is a shame considering the story is good and taking place in such an underrepresented setting.
