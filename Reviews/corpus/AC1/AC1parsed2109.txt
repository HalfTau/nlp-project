Im a huge fan of the Assassins Creed series... except the first one. Really, if youre new, just start playing AC2 instead. You wont be missing much. Especially since the intro cinematic to AC2 covers everything important about AC1s story in about 10 seconds. Every mission in the game is kill this guy, because reasons and starts out with gathering information, which means doing one of 4 types of sidequest where you can do exciting things like sitting on a bench or following someone into an alley so you can punch them a few times. After you do enough repetitive sidequests you unlock the assassination targets location. Then you kill the guy youre supposed to kill then run and hide. Then do it all again for the next target. Nothing changes about the missions other than the location of your target.
