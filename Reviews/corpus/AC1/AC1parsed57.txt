I cant really recommend this game to many people. I have played all the AC games except for Origins. I have bought them for my PS3 and Windows gaming computer. I love them all. But this game isnt great. I mean its not terrible on in unplayable or buggy. But it is really mediocre.So the positivie...1 the setting is really nice. It is set during the i think third crusade. And it is a pretty coo setting.2 the story is really good. Has character depth. Really no complaints.The negative...1 you literally do the same thing over and over over again. THere are mobile games with more diversity than this.2 literally...you keep doing the same thing over and over.3 building upon that, there is some really frustrating gameplay mechanics such as running past guards can turn them hostile towards you and then you have 10 guards chasing you. It makes transversing throughout the city a real pain in theto do. Makes it exceptionally slow. There are a lot of little details here and there that make getting around a real pain and more of chore than actaully fun. Random drunk people in the street will bump into you and then set the guards off. causing another chase.The game is worth a play if youre a fun of the AC games and want to see how it all began. But other than that curiousity, there really isnt much reason to play it.
