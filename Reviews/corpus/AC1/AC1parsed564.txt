The first Assassins Creed is a damn fine game and one of the first things that truly got me interested in history. I find the story and the setting to be most intriguing and honestly I would recommend the game on those two merits alone.Progression of skill is something in this game I remember well and it really bothers me that they did away with that in the later entries. In this game there is a true sense of progression of skill as you go through your missions, learning new ways to fight and perfecting your movement.When I first started playing I hardly knew how to move around or use my sword properly but by the end it became easier and more fluid purely through practice and earned skill.And thats something I really miss.
