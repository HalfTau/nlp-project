A very good game, though not in my top list by any means. Had some great gameplay elements but was repetative enough to lose its charm before the end. Combat was smooth and well executed, though I prefer a style that doesnt rely so much on timing and simply learning specific enemies moves. The open world was very well executed and clambering around the cities never really got old, which says a lot for the game. The really repetative part though was the missions. There were only 3 or 4 mission styles that could each be executed in the same manner and I found myself losing track of which mission I was on simply because they were that similar.The other games in the series improved upon the failings of the first though, so if you want to play those, it would be worth playing the first just to get the storyline.
