7/10  There was the basis of a really good stealth franchise here, one that looked great and had a pretty intellectual message. Shame it never got to be a full fleshedout game, and instead leaned hard on its flashy but shallow combat, and its cool but janky freerunning. Later sequels would make the story dumber, the freerunning faster and less believable, and the combat shamefully easier, but have more content and  most notably  no god damned crazy people shoving you back and forth like a tennis ball.Needed more substance, and a lot more dialogue for radiant NPCs, but as a core experience, the original Assassins Creed feels a lot bolder and more imaginative than later games in the series. I see the game now as something like a parable, the repetition of key mechanics and events serving to showcase the heros journey and growth, and how he perceives his macabre work. Then theres some t about Stonemasilluminatemplars and a supernatural bossfight ending, at which point I switch off entirely. But at least this game had my bloody sword in a scabbard that was attached to my body in some way. Seriously, dont get how this is so hard to do, but it makes a big aesthetic impact, seeing my weapon just hovering there. It cannot be so very time consuming to give every weapon a sheathe. Please Ubisoft, cut the sci fi nonsense in your narrative, and bring back scabbards! Then Ill start buying your things again.Provided they actually work.
