 gorgeous mapping... feels like the middle ages thus nice atmosphere great character design free running is very funny, well coded story kind of lame games about evil templers... we had that! like a million times! the fights are SUPER easy, but get a little less easy in the end... still, you are nearby unbeatable due to health regeneration in combat the mission design is very repetitive... the game gets boring very fast
