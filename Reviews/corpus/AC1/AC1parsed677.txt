The best setting of the AC series IMO.  Still I cant really recommend buying this one unless you want to play through all the AC series or just want to look at ancient middle eastern cities from on high.  The original game is monotonous, even though it is pretty short, and the ending is rather confusing because you arent really sure if you are actually done.  But dont judge the entire series based on this game as the rest of them have much better gameplay.
