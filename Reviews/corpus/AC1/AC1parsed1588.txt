Now where do I begin.....THis game isnt perfect by no means especially on the PC, I have encountered so many bugs and have had the game crash on me dozens of times, but this game just has that charm with it that you cant just cant say no to. the story in my opinion is great which kept me in the game and the mechanics at the time were revolutionary even though they were a mess looking back at it. Yes it gets very repeatative when you are finding information for each assassination and some of them drove me up the wall but performing that assassination without a problem was just so rewarding. Recomending this game however I just cant do, I love the assassin creed series and Im always telling people to play them but for PC this was a buggy mess and my DX 10 file would not play so I had to use the DX 9 and that still didnt work perfectly. I recommend you play this on console as it is more stable and less bugs, the graphics might not be up to scratch with the PC but the gameplay will imporve dramatically and less bugs will occurRating 7/10  but as mentioned will play better on consoles
