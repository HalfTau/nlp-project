Even after so much time and playing the other AC games, I decided to go back to the root of the Desmond Story Arc. In terms of story it has a great setup leading into the next game dealing with Ezio. Altiars story was a little short but his was not meant to be but a window. His story plays a greater part latr in the series but Im getting ahead of myself. Remembering the controls was easy, though it seems easier on a controler properly  bound However the controler made the camera slow to utalize, unless I over looked a sensitivity option somewhere. The game had a lot of glitches in it from jumping against a ledge that you would normally catch only to miss follwed by NPCs glitching in their movements durring and after a chase. not to mention the occasional crash. I could have done with a little more story but that my personal preference.Story 4.5Graphics 5Controls 3.5Stability 3
