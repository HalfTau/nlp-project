If you would like to know what the fuss is about this franchise you came to the right place  sure, the first episode is at least 6 years old but it still looks good and plays smoothly. Sure, it is not as refined as the rest  it has its shortcomings but many you can only realise once you played the sequels. It has its repetitive side missions, yes, the combat is a bit more difficult than in current gen games even controlling the protagonist requires you to learn several stances, yet, this was what started it all and to understand the rather complex and detailed story of the franchise you have to start with Altairs journey.If you do not like the first ride you can leave the rest. But if you grow to like the Assassins you are in for a very long journey, my friend!
