Went backwards on this series as well... started out with ACII. Realized needed to step back a few hundred years and see what Altair was all about. Got hooked! Line... and... sinker...! The series offers more than a good RPG backdrop but a continuous storyline that stretches beyond a typical RPG. After completing this installment had been playing ACII when stopped during memory sequence 4 to play 1st AC/Altair I finished ACII.The rich storyline and a deep one at that, surrounding Ezio makes playing this RPG series compelling, entertaining, and challenging. You will be challenged on many levels while playing this series. AC will seem simple after playing ACII, but if you like reading a book series, puzzles, different skill challenges, and realistic game play, you will enjoy this series... on some level. Looking forward to more Assassins Creed story line and gameplay.p.s. the music sound tracks are soundtracks are awesome and worth getting... ACII, ACIII, ACIVNote have not finished and/or played ACIII, ACIV but do have the soundtracks, the music in all three are worth the purchase
