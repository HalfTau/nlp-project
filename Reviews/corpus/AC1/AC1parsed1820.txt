The game suffers on lack of options like resolution or fullscreen mode. The game must be forced to go fullscreen and sometimes the Steam overlay doesnt work while playing this game. Also quitting is seriously too long. But ignoring that its a pretty nice game. Short enough to not get bored, also completing every single DNA segment is also fun.Anyway I dont mind this game and I cant say if I recommend it to you or not. Give it a try if you want.
