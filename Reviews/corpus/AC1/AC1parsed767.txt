was good at the time of release, but now nah, if you played AC2 and later ACs, this one feels very old with alot of missing mechanics , it doesnt even have aerial kills and character movement and climbing are really slow and dumb as hell, however, the story still stands out until now but has no to minimal impact on later ACs, so if you want to play the whole series then i recommend you start here, otherwise, skip it as you will not miss any important info.
