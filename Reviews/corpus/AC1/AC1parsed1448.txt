I took me a few years to catch up, but now I truly understand why this game has become such a classic. Too bad nobody except good friend Google tells you that in the PC version, the additional memories i.e. flag collections are meaningless since only console achievements, but all the other things and ideas were truly revolutionary. And now it even kind of makes sense why there are now so many AC games. However, now spoilers.
