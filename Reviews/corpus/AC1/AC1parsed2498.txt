After trying this one out a couple years ago, I came to it slightly more mature and with an xbox 360 controller. What a treat it was. Although some really didnt like the modern but virtualassassin setting, I didnt find it too annoying and actually thought it somewhat intriguing. To me, the highlights of this game are its graphics, combat, and historical atmosphere and setting. The world is bright and the animations extremely fluid. Speaking of fluid, so is the combat as you assassinate one enemy after another executing counters and sweet but brutal combos. If youre a history fan, this game also has a rich historical atmosphere and storyline to follow, although its basically completely fictional. I picked this game up for 3 and got 20 very enjoyable hours out of it. Not too bad at all. 8.6/10.
