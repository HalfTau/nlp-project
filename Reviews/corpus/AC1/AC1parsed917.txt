I first played Black Flag and loved it so much that I wanted to start this series from the beginning. Going back in time to 2007, the parkour was slow and the combat even slower. The storyline was weak and pretty linear. HoweverDespite the flaws it was still very fun and unlike Black Flag, the side story set in the present is actually just as interesting as the main historical story. Also, while the storyline is repettitive is that how you spell it?,does get kinda crazy towards the end. Play it through if you want to get the full Assassins Creed storyline. If not, Id skip to a later one. I wish there was a nuetral rating for games on steam. I enjoyed it though, so Ill give it a thumbs up.
