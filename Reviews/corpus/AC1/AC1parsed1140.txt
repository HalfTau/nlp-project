After finishing the game the first time, I thought Id never play it again, but here not 12 months later, I played it through again.Its simple and yet elegant. The quests are all the same, but I still liked going through them because the combat is very good. In the 2nd game I did better because I mastered more moves. I owned this a long time ago on PS3 and could never get the controls right, but I bought it for the computer and computer controls for fighting is what I grew up on.I got to where Id have 2030 guards coming at me and I would own them. Run from the guards? Blend? Why? I just cut through them after I got counter moves. And after I mastered breaking grab, I really was almost unstoppable.If I could ever figure out how to counter the templay combo move that ends up with a throat punch, Id probably never lose a fight.It is a great game.
