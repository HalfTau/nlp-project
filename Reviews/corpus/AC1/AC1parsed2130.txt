Assassins Creed is the quaintessential Ubisoft title  fantastic idea, rushed out before it was finished that leaves you disappointed.There is a core game here, which could be amazing. The idea behind the gameplay mechanics are great, and the free running features are smooth at times. Yet, theres nothing more to it. Its essentially a techdemo.Im informed that the other Assassins Creed games are MUCH better, and have a better storyline, and dont have you repeating the game over at the halfway point ala the first Assassins Creed. If thats the case I look forward to the other Assassin Creed titles.I originally played this game on the 360 when it was initially released. My hype was high and expectations were perhaps uncontrolable. I remember getting into an argument with the Ubisoft rep who would come into our store about how crap the game was. He wasnt too happy that I wasnt going to shill it hard to people.However, the first one is stale and undercooked at the same time. The crashes to desktop are beyond frustrating. DX10 version is unstable and unsupported. The DX9 version strangely runs smoother. I get the impression its the Steam interface which causes the crashes.Overall, Id suggest watching the story on youtube and jumping on hopefully the much improved Assassins Creed II or Brotherhood. The first game is everything that is currently wrong with UbisoftFull of BugsRepeated pointless gameplayCollect 100 lots of 100 different itemsPromises and hopes that never live up to the expectationAll of this distracts from what COULD be a really great game.
