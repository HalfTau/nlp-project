This is a fantastic game to kick off one of the best game series I have ever played!  Some great graphics for a game which is rather old now!  The only problem that I have with this game is that the gamemodes are rather repetative and you can get quite bored whilst in the middle of playing it.  Also when it comes to actually quitting the game, there isnt an actual choice in the menu to do that! But other than that a fantastic game!
