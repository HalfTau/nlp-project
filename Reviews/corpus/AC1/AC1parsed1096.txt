Boring gameplay consisting of repeating the same actions over and over. Several technical issues not recognizing xbox 360 controller correctly problems with playing intro movies no possibility to skip intro and dialogues in the game game freezing in some fights you cannot see enemies due to weird view angles where something is obscuring the view only reasonable way to exit the game is Alt  F4, otherwise you will have to exit to main menu actually you have to do that twice in different menus, select and load your profile and only then you have the possibility to really close the game !.This game is a waste of time, terribly overrated.
