i love this franchise so much that i want to give all of them 10/10 and call it done !But In All fairness i will review This game for u here i finished this game more than 9 times on differrent platforms !Now there is a lot of thing going on in the franchise about story and the hidden secrets and everything  WHICH i love and recommend u to see , but i keep this review to GAMING and if u want the juicy details just search the web in general .ok let me tell you a few things first NAME it is that the name of the charachter altair, which is an arabic word that means  BIRD in general or a flying bird of not a specific type.FAMILY NAME  IBNE LA AHAD is also arabic meaning the son of no one .IT DOES NOT MEAN BSTARD ! it means son of no one, born from no one !i just want to point out that in assassins creed 1 or assassins creed bloodlines for PSP u dont see the family name !!!it was added either from assassins creed 2 or the brotherhood .in fact you see it in the begining of brotherhood but i dont remember AC2 right now !let me state this was a nice addition and was in sync with ac1 and was not one of the things that ruined the franchise or was not in sync, because many things were added in later assassins creed that are just not right ! this is not one of them.THE WORD ASSASSINS  is also arabic coming from the the world ASSASSIYOONS, which even in the game you hear on the people in masyaf tell altair  assassiyoons way  or something alike that i dont recall, but he says ASSASSIYOONS !now assassiyoons come from the word HASSASSIYOONS which comes from the word HASHASHIYOONS which comes from the PERSIAN word HASHASHIN HA  or  HASHASSHIN S  in english .NOW here is the important part  assassins or hashashin ha DID used to smoke HASHISH but the word HASHASHINS is not coming from HASHISH, in the old times around the 13th Century which was the era of the first assassins in PERSIA ! they used to call all drugs and medicines HASHASH, and at that time one of the incomes of the assassins where to sell medicine in general or HASHASH which later became whats known now as ASSASSINS !Check the pictures i uploaded on STEAM, if you combine what i wrote under the picture with the picture you get some funny juicy details.but you must have high knowledge to understand, for example why under Rafigh or Rafeeks Pic i wrote ALMUALIM when clearly hes not ALMUALIM !but then again it is almualim, then why would i write it there...??!?!Also almualim is arabic word meaning TEACHER !now i myself will PROMISE you that i will write a book about this franchise and i will be the one making tha last installment in its franchise . i can wrote 6 pages about what is LEAP OF FAITH !believe me there is a lot more to this game than the surface...The Combat  is a lot better than the games that came after since it required more from the player than HEY JUST PRESS THIS BUTTON !The Story  is ROCK SOLID ! i wont spoil it 10/10The Character Altair is FANTASTIC ! it was THE BESTand ONLY RIGHT CHOICE EVER ! The GRAPHICS are EVEN BETTER THAN assassins creed REVELATIONS !!! EVEN NOW U GET HIGH QUALITY ON PC  even till 2020 or more its good... The way the developer, SINGULAR 1 person had the universe in his/her mind is marvelous . The controls and the gameplay and the hud is all designed at a deep level to make the universe come to life UNLIKE SOME LATER ASSASSINS CREED GAMES !!! The side missions are repetetiveThe travelings can be frustrating if you try to achive every in game collectible....As a game developer i promise you 1 day before i die, in the middle of world war 3, i give you the last assassins creed a 10/10 game with a gameplay taken back to its wonderfull roots and a story that sums up the entire franchise like no one will ever believe it !!!i give this game  9.4/10reviewed by IMMORTALEADER
