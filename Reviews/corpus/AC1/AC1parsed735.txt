Ah, the first amazing game in one, if not the most, amazing game saga of all time. Assassins Creed Directors Cut Edition is so amazing, with a gritty and brooding atmosphere. The game is fully open world, allowing you to fully explore the dark depths of actual places such as Damascus, and Jerusalem. There are plenty of opportunities to save helpless obese guys and screaming young Arabic girls. This game is very realistic, in which if you do anything socially unacceptable, such as stabbing people, the guards will take notice and chase you. In this case, you must break the line of sight by either climbing to the roof of a building or hiding behind your intimidating vigilante friends. This is not a game for the impatient though, as it takes time to slowly stalk a target and slide a blade into his rib cage without the citizens seeing you. If you are the type of person who would rather run in screaming, and wildly slash your way through the swordwielding guards, then I would recommend some other game. Although, hacking guards is a large part of this stealth game. One of the largest building blocks in this game, and every other AC for that matter is parkour. If you like jumping over benches, scaling large walls, and swinging on beams to escape the soldiers who really dont like you, then this is your game. Although the controls are a little foreign at first, they become natural soon after you finish the tutorial level. The story is good, with many twists and turns, with a suprise ending. One thing this game lacks is cutscene quality, I mostly slept through the long discussions with the Bureau Leader. Although this game was made in 2007, it still holds its ground as very well constucted, with very good graphics for 07 and a deep story. And, if you enjoy the other AC games, this is a great place to return to. Would stab and slash again 8/10
