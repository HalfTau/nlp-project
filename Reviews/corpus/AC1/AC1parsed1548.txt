Its a good game and a great startup to what is now an amazing series.It does have quite an expansive game world and the storyline as a whole is quite compelling. It does have a very large repetiton factor, with exactly the same set of preassassination tasks to complete for each target.What I liked most about this game was is the way it made me question what was true, right and fair in the world. As Altair moves along his quest, he starts to change the way he looks at the world. This then translates into the games message.Overall, a solid game that took me 24 hours to 100,  8/10
