The way I see this gameCons  I prefer to leave Pros last You are one of the gamers that wants to complete this game 100? If you are, it may get boring for you and I will explain why. As others have said before me you just have to climb specific towers or buildings to unlock an area of the map usually between 911 in every assassination. Then you have to interrogate a person, pickpocket another one, eavesdrop yet another, gother some flags in under 3 mins or kill some guards in 35 mins. You will be assigned with 9 assassinations in total which for me the whole proccess is as described by others REPETITIVE.BUTProsI really liked the story, even though it was short it was intelligently written. The gameplay for me it wasnt boring because in every assassination you unlock new moves which keeps you wanting for more. You are able to kill any guard or citizen you want  even though you instantly lose life when you kill a citizen  and of course you have to face the consequences.Overall for me its a great game worth playing and I recommend it to anyone that loves action games.
