Finally, after so many years, I managed to play and finish Assassins Creed. Quite repetitive gameplay yet very enjoyable. Reminds me of Mad Max. You basically keep doing sameover and over again, yet its somehow addictive and rewarding. I havent found all the collectibles yet I finished all side activities out of all memory banks. Took me 13h of total gameplay to finish the game. I can honestly recommend the game. Despite time passed since original release, its still worth checking, for the gameplay and for quite interesting story.
