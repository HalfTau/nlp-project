If youre a fan of action/adventure games, this is a great one to have.I am not going to say its perfect as a game.Unless you get really good at the rooftop jumping, and stealth assassinations, early on, youre going to have a sore thumb from holding the low porifile button while walking through the streets to avoid templar and guards alike. The story is great, and leads off into what has to be one of the best game series Ive ever played.At the risk of seriouslyoff some fanbase, I dare put it up there with the Legend of Zelda series.
