The original Assassins Creed is a great game for its time. It has a lot of excellent elements jumping off tall buildings, climbing buildings, etc. that made itfun. However, the game definitely shows its age. The graphics and game play particularly some of the climbing controls can be dated and/or frustrating at times. In addition, I noticed quite a few clipping and other strange bugs during taller climbs and some of the fights I had.But, as the original epsiode of an excellent series, it definitely is wroth one playthrough.
