After 10 years of not playing the original, I finally got around to it. Is it fun. Yes. Is it really good. No. Besides the obviously gorgeous art and the now formulaic gameplay, looking at the game structure and features that could be considered bugs with older eyes the game just doesnt really impress.Ive died several times now due to being pushed into the water by a drunkard, Altair, the master of Assassins cant swim. My most recent boss fight seemed to have me being chased by a kid, which turned out to be a woman in knights armor, good luck carrying that, not to mention having all these fully clad armored guys hop over roof tops just like me and Im the guy with the special freerunning skill. Running up a non climbable wall happens, running into stuff happens, getting pushed and toppled by crazies happens when trying to run away from heavy guys. The fighting system is really broken in a way, just hammering X on my controller works most of the time.The fully realized environment is impressive and nice to look at, but the fact of being in a playbox becomes apparent all too quickly. All the assassins bureaus are the same place, all the high towers which have an eagle sit on them look the same, you will run across the exact same big brute guy several dozen times and just sitting on a bench watching people pass by will get boring super fast.Overall its an impressive piece of work that spawned a lot of other material of which I enjoyed Brotherhood the most, but it is very flawed and far from perfect.Update Changed the score from 7 to a 6, that final battle is a chore if Ive ever seen one... F you Robert.
