The gameplay, map and graphics are pretty good but story is boring and repetitive. I only recommend it for AC collectors.I played this game only because Im an Assassins Creed franchise fan and i ended every single game, so I had to end this too.  Gameplay isnt that bad, movements are good, combat is alright and parkour is just like in other Assassins Creed games, but you dont have a lot of things to do in this game after you end the story since there are no secundary missions/quests etc.Graphics are extremly good for an 2008 game and theyre still good for 2017 in my opinion and optimization isnt that bad.Story is crap, except first and last missions, every in every mission you do the exactly same thing, make this game boring af. If I wasnt  a fan of the series I wouldnt ended it since its very repetitive.
