Assassins Creed IWhat to say.My personal opinion on this game ismeh.The game starts with the player taking control of the Assassin Altair or technically, Desmond MilesAltair has an interesting character development inside of a good story.The gameplay is a little wacky because this was the first entry in the series, a bit of an experiment originally supposed to be a Prince of Persia game, you can probably tell by its roots.Overall the game is good.The port is also kinda meh itself, but once you get used to it its sure to be a good experience.
