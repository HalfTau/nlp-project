Visually, Assassins Creed was way ahead of its time.However, despite its great potential and the revolutionary combat system, the game suffers from VERY repetitive gameplay and missions, which are basically the same all the way through, only in different locations. The story is thrilling and delivers an acceptable beginning to the franchise.Worth a Playthrough! 08/10
