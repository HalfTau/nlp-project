Its too bad that people get to know the more recent AC games before this one. When they decide to explore the first game of the franchise, they find it boring and repetitive. I was lucky enough to play it at the time it was released, and I found it to be a unique, engaging, GORGEOUS game, with an extremely wellwritten and intelligent theme. Sure, its a bit repetitive, but building each individual assassination and carrying them out as a true assassin should is very rewarding. Its too bad that the following games in the franchise stopped urging the player to seek alternative ways to kill their targets, cause thats something Assassins Creed does right.
