Why are people reviewing this in 2015? Most of the negative reviews are from people playing it years later. The video game industry has evolved and improved a lot since 2008 and no matter what anyone says this game was revolutionary.I guess if you didnt play it back in 2008 and are only picking it up now, then it doesnt really have as much gameplay as Black Flag for example, but that doesnt make it a lesser game. Very few people can pick up Super Mario 64 or Unreal Tournament today having never played it before, and find it amazing. Thats just how it is. The gameplay for the later Assassins Creed games only got better because this was the foundation and they built from there. This is my favourite Assassins Creed game and it shouldnt be overlooked.
