Even with all the issues I came across with this game, I did finish it and I do recommend it.First, I will start with the issues I had. I almost did not get past the tutorial. I had to go through it 3 times, and it was frustrating. It was at the spot where you had to kill a guard,  then another spots him, and you kill him. I would kill that first guard, and he would literally fly off the map. The other guard went to him, which was off the map so I was unable to get to him to kill him. I exited after 2 tries, was going to give up but tried a 3rd time He still flew off the map, but enough away that the other guard did nothing but stand there. I killed him, tutorial went forward.Other issues I had were with movement. Some of the viewpoints were challenging to get to because of it. I would be literally grabbing the ledge next to it and it wouldnt get on the boards. I would try jumping and he would jump THROUGH the boards and down to his death. I finally gave up getting them all, but I got quite a few. Movement all around was very clunky and frustrating to deal with.While the game is very repetitive, it is enjoyable aside from those issues. I was very happy that fast travel became a thing after discovering the 3 cities. I probably would have quit if I had to travel through the Kingdom every single time.Main character is fairly boring, but is decent. I enjoyed the storyline even though it was fairly predictable in some aspects.The graphics are still pretty great to this day, even with its age.All in all, while my review points out many negatives, I had a lot of fun with it. I do plan on playing through more of the games as time goes on, so I do hope many of the issues were resolved.
