NOTE Dont hold the downsides of this game against the rest of the series. They simply dont apply.Its a pretty game. FANTASTIC game mechanic for moving through the world, but its like they spent all of their time making a gorgeous looking game and putting together an amazing game engine and almost neglected to actually build a game for them to be used in.Pretty cool until you realize how repetative it gets.All in all, its totally worth playing as a way to learn the basic controls that the rest of the series will build on, and as the first part of an epic and utterly insane story spanning thousands of years of humans history.
