Not a bad game storywise but has its fair share of issues. Very repetitive. And when I say very it means that each city youll visit offers pretty much exactly the same informer quests, saving helpless old ladies and viewpoints. If youre going for completing EVERYTHING youre in for a extremely borring ride. Other issue is combat. While a lot of the time you can simply guard and the counter attack to dispose of the enemy, some attack were just completely not countereable. Not sure if that was a bug on my end or a feature, save to say combat got really annoying after a while, Overall not a terrible game but definitely the worse one of the series.
