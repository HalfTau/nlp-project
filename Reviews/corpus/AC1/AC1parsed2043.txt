The first game in the Assassins Creed franchise is somewhat repetitive but you get to get the hang of it  how to climb buildings, get from one end of the city to the other by jumping from rooftop to rooftop, and how to kill enemies using different strategies. The storyline is great and everything about the franchise gets better and better with every game!
