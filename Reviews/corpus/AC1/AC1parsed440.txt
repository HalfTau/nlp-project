I have a few gray hairs from all the time I put into trying to find all the flags. I couldnt even find all the Masyaf flags, and there are only a couple dozen of them. Seriously, what kind of self respecting Knight Hospitaller leaves a flag in the middle of a plank that connects the roofs of two buildings?Overall, I love this game, the community is awesome one of the best communities I know thats centred around a video game and the graphics are really good considering that its about 10 years old at this point.
