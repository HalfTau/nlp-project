This is the game that started my assassins obsession. Even though I bought it recently on Steam, it has my 10 full walkthroughs 5 of them with flags, templars, citizens and viewpoints accomplished, a lot of memory block replays.I played it first within a week of its release not knowing it, and up until now, the game fascinated me several timesSo, I recommend the game despite its sometimes repetitive gameplay please name the game where gameplay isnt the same throughout the game.
