At first I really loved the game. The controls were good, the story intriguing and the graphics just awesome. Until half of the game I just couldnt stop... well, then came the other half. I wont lie to you, I didnt like it so much after the first half, mainly because it then was just the same things over and over again. Running around the city, fullfilling your tasks which also were the same and I really hated the market stand quests... frustrating s... so yeah. At some point I only asked myself when is it gonna be over?But, as I mentioned before, beautiful settings, mindblowing story, cool stuff you can do and it really makes fun to stroll around the diverse cities. I know most gamers love this game, myself... not so much, but it is still a very good video game title that you should definately should check out at some point or another.
