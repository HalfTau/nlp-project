To start off Ive played this many moons ago on PlayStation, was on it so much I knew ever road like the back of my hand!So! You cant get this normally, I had to buy the GTA pack from green man gaming, its not listed but GTA 12 are included in the pack!So lets be honest with this game, it dont work on windows 10 because windows 10 sucks eggs! But thankfully a little tweaking here n there it runs fine! Its not the best graphics by todays standards n yes it did take me about 2seconds to download it n yes my wife calls me stupid for spending 2k on my pc to end up playing old classic like this! But Im happy n its good to blast down the roads n have a shoot out! Its worth going back to this game in my eyes, it will never truly get old!
