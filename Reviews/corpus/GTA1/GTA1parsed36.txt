To be honest, I was never a big fan of first Grand Theft Auto game. Maybe I was a little too young to understand how to take missions, back then I also didnt understand much of english. So, the only thing I was doing was driving around, killing people and jumping on THAT bridge. It was probably enought for me to have fun. Not sure how much time spend playing like that but I know one thing  it didnt lasted that long for sure. There were many good games around that time so I probably moved to another game.After years, I wanted to give first GTA game another try. Finished some missions, played around for some time and, at least for now, no more. First of all, this game is really hard compared to other games in series. You cant save game after mission  you need to get way too much cash if you want to save your progress and move to next level. Does that mean its no fun at all? NO. Its really fun. I probably enjoyed it more than newest Grand Theft Auto games. Its kind of game made purely for fun. Also, that main theme song Joyride by Da Shootaz is my second favorite one in whole series, its so great. There is only one thing that Im kinda of mad at  Rockstar never released mission packs London 1969 and London 1961 on Steam. For what reason? Im not sure. Since they brought back Steam pages for both first and second Grand Theft Auto games, maybe one day they will do something about those addons... at least I hope so.At the moment Im making this review, there is no way to buy first GTA game on Steam. You can hunt for old GTA Complete Packs on websites which sells games BUT there is no guarantee that it will be included at all. Guess you could also check Steam forums, there are always people who are making info about that. If you are fan of series, if you ever wanted to try it or maybe you played it years ago  doesnt matter, its worth all the trouble of trying to get it.
