This game is like hardcore GTA. one shot one kill, for both you and others unless body armor is worn, its 4 shots 1 kill. No saves, so you die too many times, you lose and have to start over form scratch. Missions are pretty simple, no money system, but points system that acts like money. sports/morobikes are too fast to even drive, so you will most likely crash to everything. no minimap so you will get lost most often. This game is pretty okay for a old game, but I just cant play a game with no minimap or some type of map. 6/10
