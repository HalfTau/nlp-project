Grand Theft Auto is the root of open world exploration and gameplay. Released in 1998, this classic title started jump started the future for gaming. I dont recommend this game just because its classic, I recommend it because it genuinely has good gameplay. The world is rather large for a game of the late 90s, and gameplay is actually better than a lot of Indies of today. Multiple mission routes mean endless replay value. If youre not the type to follow story, just go around stealing cars and killing es, hoes, and pedestrians for mad points. Its a real shame the developers gimped on the graphics of Grand Theft Auto. Even for a late 90s game, the graphics for Grand Theft Auto is god awful. When my avatar leaves his car, I cant tell the difference between his front and backside this makes shooting quite chaotic and confusing at times. If you look pass the graphics, there is lots of fun to be had from this classic title. Play it.
