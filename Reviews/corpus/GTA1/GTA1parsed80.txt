If you can get this game to work or part 2, they are totally a blast to play! I remember the just running drugs, hitting up on gangs, and out running the cops! Unfortunatley the new GTA games do not make you feel the same way this one did... the closest GTA to the original is San Andreas.Bascially you meet people or answer the phone in this top down view mission based game but in a open world situation.
