Dungeon Siege stopped working the application will close now, can someone explain to me what is going on and why do i keep having this issue? i got a 1400 asus gaming pc 4 days ago so im pretty sure my device is not the issue and i do not want to rate this game bad because i played it and loved it when it came out
