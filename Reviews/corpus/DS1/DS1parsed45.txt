I LOVE Dungeon Siege and will play the heck out of it!  However some of the things I love the most about it are NOT in the Steam version sadly.  LOA expansion is not available and multiplayer is disabled.  The multiplayer, especially, is why I bought this!  So I could play it with my sons and husband, like we used to... and we loved LOA.... who DOESNT want the pimp hat and the eggchucking spell??  Awesomeness x 100!   If you have a way to play this with the actual game, with the expansion, do that.
