Unable to play on Windows 7, despite a multitude of guides attempting to assist.The crux of it is that the game starts but the mouse is nowehere to be seen which then requires searching the screen with an inseen pointer and waiting for something to highlight to get ones bearings, clicking, the proceeding to the next step. Getting even halfway thtough character creation alone, took roughly 20 minutes.Please dont place something for sale and advertize it is playable for specific operating systems that it likely isnt. Luckily it came in a larger pack but this all just feels like the whole toxic asset trading that led to global economic collapse...albeit on the scale of local frustration.
