I have to agree with Yaso Kita. This game is really a nostalgia jerker. It was also MY first real game i played with my dad when i was a little kid. It is as awesome today as it was then. Even back then I saw the flaws of the game I had the cracked version so i was able to spend hours upon hours running around that forest with no path and then you look at the map and see it is just green...hahaha great memories but anyways, this game was and is always gonna be close to my heart so I give it a 10/10 I know that Yaso said its a 10/10 for the first playthrough, but ive played this game through 13 times. I have counted. and it is STILL a 10/10 I HIGHLY recommend it
