I just installed this again after diving back into ARPGs this last month Grim Dawn, Titan Quest, Diablo III. It still is, as I remember, the epic game I played back in 02. That was before Steam  so you dont get to see that I invested over 100 hours into it. Yeah the graphics are dated, resolution is low and it isnt supported any longer  but it loaded up and ran perfectly for me. Besides, the graphics are a reminder of where we were when it was released. This was a huge deal then.No load screens, a long campaign with all the trademark rpg elements  and what most people arent mentioning is the music  you get a Jeremy Soule soundtrack that helps sell the feel and emotion of the game.If youre not up on composers  Mr. Soule wrote the music for Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind among many others. He was quite prolific in this early part of the century.A highly recommended game  only sad Gas Powered Games is no longer here, can only imagine the amazing games they would have made now.
