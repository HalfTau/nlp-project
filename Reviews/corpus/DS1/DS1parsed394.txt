I really loved this game and had a lot of fun with it.   Beyond ridiculous I cannot give this game a recommendation...The issue?   Well, the Steam version ruins the game completely.  By this I mean, and this is a spoiler you NEED to hear!  Once you kill the Last Ending Boss the game immediately cuts to the Main menu!?!?  Your supposed to be able to look at your loot, watch the ending!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and then have the option to move some of your characters to multiplayer.... you get non of that!   I just spent over 30 hours on a game just to have the ending robbed from me!   Looked this up on google this problem has been since it was put on Steam and they never fixed it, its been years!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTFIf your going to buy this, buy the actual disc,  Im beginning to think steam is not the way to go for old PC games as I have had other issues with some other pc originals from the early 2000s as well.
