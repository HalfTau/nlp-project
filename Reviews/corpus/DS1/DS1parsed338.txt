All i can say is Wow... not touched this game for like 15 years or so, i absolutley destroyed this game when it was released, so when i saw it on steam i was like well it costs next to nothing, why the hell not, lets give it another blast.about 10 minutes in after i had got used to the low resolution i was hooked again, I have been playing Diablo 3 for the last few years and as much as Diablo 3 is an awesome game, i never reached the level of immersion i did with DS all those years ago, So here we go again, slashing my way through Ehb once again,I would add to anyone starting out, check out the DS discussion pages here on steam, after reading through them, i have now got my DS upgraded to the Legends of Arianna expansion and also have it running in 1920 x 1080, which really does polish the game off nicely...Anyhow, laters i got Krug to slay.
