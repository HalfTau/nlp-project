Dungeon Siege is exactly what the title says. You siege dungeons with a party.This is one of my all time favorite games. Party based RPG. You cant go wrong with this one. Dungeon Siege has a fairly long story too. Hack and slash. There is combat magic nature magic and basic melee weaponry. Grab a pack mule and get ready for many many hours of dungeon crawling. A bit lacking in the class development but I have to say that is this games only down fall. Its wickedly fun!10/10 Would Siege Dungeon again.Edit One minor grip its very very difficult to take screenshots. And prepare to die. Alot.
