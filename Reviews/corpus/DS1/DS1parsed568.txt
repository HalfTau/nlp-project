If you can get this game to run smoothly, so anything windows 7in windows xp compatability mode and lower, its a good throw back even if the multiplayer has been removed. The combat in this game is epic, with anywhere from 1 enemy to 30 enemies in single battle not to mention your 7 other party members thrown into the frey. It fast passed early 2000s top down fantasy Diablo/Baudlers Gate style adventure role playing game with a bit more fluidity in its motions. The only down side is it doesnt run on Windows 8
