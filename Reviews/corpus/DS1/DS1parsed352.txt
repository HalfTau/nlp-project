Dungeon Siege was one of the first games I remember playing, and while its starting to show its age, its still very playable today. Unfortunately, the Steam version contains a few odd features broken cutscenes and no multiplayer among them but overall I would strongly suggest purchasing Dungeon Siege if its on sale, its a great game to lose a weekend to.ProsClassic game with excellent replayabilityMassive modding communityConsNo multiplayer on steam versionCan be a hassle to run on newer versions of Windows
