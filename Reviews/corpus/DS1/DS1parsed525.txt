Hell yeah, any Steam friends of mine into MMORPGs or RPGs or MMOs or whatever the difference, this game is a flash back to the past. Very rustic, and old, dating back to 2002, I played this when I was like 6 or 7, and decided to play it again 12 years ago, its even better than I thought. Not sure about Dungeon Siege 2, I played that as well 7 years ago or so, but it wasnt the same, it got pretty advanced and felt like WoW. It was still fun though.So you guys should get Dungeon Siege, very diverse open world MMORPG,ton of different items and stuff. Focuses on a few branches of skills Magic. which is Combat Magic and Nature Magic. Melee weapons, such as Maces, Swords, Clubs, Axes, Scythes and a lot more random stuff. Ranged weapons, like Bows, Crossbows, and I think theres even a laser gun at one point from a steampunk robot enemy you fight in the game.The game gets really addicting, make sure you save frequently, it crashed about 20 hours in and I lost about an hours worth of progress.
