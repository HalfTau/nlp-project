Game works perfectly fine for me on Windows 10. No glitches, high framerate, no problems saving/loading, zero crashes.Played through the game multiple times on the original physical discs. Its easily one of the best partybased dungeon crawlers of all time. While the graphics may be modest by todays standards, the depth of party combinations is huge. Every character can be developed as you choose, and with eight party slots you have an insane number of possibilities.Do you want nothing but low polygon archers mowing down low polygon spiders, you can do it. Do you want a mix of low polygon warriors, battle mages, and healers fighting low polygon dragons, you can certainly do that. As long as you dont mind low polygon counts the sky is the limit.
