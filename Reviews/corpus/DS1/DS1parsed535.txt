An absolute classic Action RPG with beautiful and varied environments, tons of different enemies and one of the greatest soundtracks in gaming. It could possibly be too old for a lot of people, but for me it is still totally playable, though at the time of release it was incredibly polished. One of my favorite games of all time. I do think that Dungeon Siege 1 beat Diablo 2 in the single player, even if D2 nailed the multiplayer.This Steam release is mysteriously missing Legends of Aranna though and there is no multiplayer unless you bootleg it thank god for this though.
