Ive read reviews of this game at the time of release and, for some reason, it was viewed as the bomb. Sadly, it aged painfully bad and I dont see anything remotely worthwhile about it.An almost total lack of narrative nor characterisation makes this game nothing more than a repetitive pattern hack, slash, loot, sell, buy, rinse and repeat.Maybe its just me but I like my rpgs to, at least, lie to me enough to make me feel like all the hacking, slashing, looting, selling, buying are all in the interest of some heroic or not cause, whatever it may be.
