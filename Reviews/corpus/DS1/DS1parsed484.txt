A note to developers selling old gamesIt is not my job to fix your game. If you are selling a game you know does not work for an OS that comes standard on computers, THAT IS THEFT. You are taking my money and giving me nothing in return. Stop being dishonest.Enjoy the couple of bucks now. When you come knocking on my door for 60 bucks for the latest release, Ill laugh and slam the door in your face.
