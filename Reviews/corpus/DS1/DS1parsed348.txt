its a grat game if your like looting party managment and a massive world to cut a sloth of distruction across.The worldthe game is open world....kinda.you never really stop to load and you can walk from the end all the way back to the start,tho you never will as the game plays out in a line where you just keep pushing ahead againts a world of monsters that wants you and your donkey/ party dead.the lootloot a big thing here, your be throwing away and picking up new stuff all the time so if your a love your look your gona like the later part of the game.the combatcombats mostly auto attacks from your party, unless you have spell caster then you have to manage some the stuff they use auto casting AOE can be bad at times and re summoning things like minions and re casting buffs...ectthe gameplay over allthe game really a kind of sit back and relAxe/kill,there are things you have to watch out for such as monsters aoes or traps, and you have to keep on on mana and healing,but other then that its a good game to have some music tho you may want to hear some the dialog and a drink and waste a few hours into at times...it can get kinda zen as its simple enough to let your mind shut down but you still need to control itlike PvZ kinda mind shut down
