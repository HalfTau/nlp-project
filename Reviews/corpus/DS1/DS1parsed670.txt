One of my all time favs from childhood besides Morrowind.I can recommend it to everyone, though I must admit, that there seem to be problems for some Windows 7 / 8 users, but I have seen nothing so far, that couldnt have been overcome just by setting the correct launcg options.This is a must have for everyone who wants to play some old school game
