Great game, bought it for nostalgia.Unfortunately steam doesnt provide the expansion pack, but some how does allow piracy promoting topics on the community board.But If youre in to classic rpgs and dont mind long grinds and 100 RNG than this could be a game right up your alley.The lore is great and the graphic design is top notch for its time  in my opinion  various sceneries and many hidden treassures and other secrets and tons of side quests and even audio dialogue!NOTE if youre relatively young or just cant stand poor graphics or challening slow pased gameplay, save your buck for the next COD.
