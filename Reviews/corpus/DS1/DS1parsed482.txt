I love DS, have done since it first came out over a decade ago.Had the original copy and the xpansion, but alas time and a child later the copys got scratched and then eventually broken.When my hubby saw the sale going on here, i squealed, i was soo happy to see my fav game again.... OH but how dissapointed i was, this collection is NOT complete, where is DS 1 and 2s xpansions? Why is the multiplayer disabled NO MORE CHICKEN LEVEL FTW!!! !I do recommened it, works absolutly fine on Win8.1, the crashes it has, has always been there it was even incompatible with Win XP FFS, lol so that never has bothered me SAVE SAVE SAVE PEOPLEBut this is a very very butchered version of it, i am deeply dissapointed, and i had no idea Square Enix took them over, which is proberly why the Xpansions are gone and mulitiplayer too... When you buy a collection you should get a collection NOT half the collection and call it a collection.That being said, i do recommened it, specially for those old schoolers like myself who absolutly love these type of games!
