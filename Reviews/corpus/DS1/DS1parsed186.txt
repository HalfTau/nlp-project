One of the classics of my childhood. Loved the game back then as I do now.Graphics are obviously outdated but for a saleprice of 1,49 there is nothing to do wrong if youre into RPGs.GameplayIts a group based, real time RPG/hackslay with different class systems.Warrior, Archer, Naturemagic sorcerer, Destructivemagic sorcererEach class plays their own part in the group of up to 8 characters.In addition you can add a mule to your group in exchange for one character spot.The mule serves as a bigger storage for items.On easy the game can be enjoyed without worrying much, a healing spell there and a healthpotion on another place and youre fine to go. Youll get through the game within 1012h.On normal the game will take you essentially longer and will force you into micromanaging your group throughout combat, using the pause button and rearranage targets, positions of your group members and abilities used! especially the mages!I didnt have the guts to sit through on hard yet... but its a challange if you want it to be! Many different items and spells with different looks and animations Many different races, enemies and landscapes to explore Audiovoiced story line and NPCs Modded multiplayer does still work I recommend tunngle Nostalgica for me! Low price Hardmode is ttery difficult as splash damage wipes you the  out That ing bluefire trapchest at the shore in front of the dark forest10/10
