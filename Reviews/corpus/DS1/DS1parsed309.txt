I played the original RPGs a long time ago on my Commodore 64. Bards Tale, Wizardry, Ultima, Might and Magic... the games that started it all. Then a great many years passed before I revisited the RPG, in fact, it wasnt until MMORPGs came about that I fell in love the with genre all over again.Playing through Dungeon Siege I felt like the dots had been connected between the old school RPG and the modern MMO. I bought 1, 2, and 3 in a combo pack, but I only played through the first. I played through it entirely, and enjoyed the trip down memory lane. Im going to recommend it, its a good a game and deserves a thumbs up, but youll likely only enjoy it for the nostalgia if youre old like me, or as a history lesson if youre a youngster. Its probably the oldest RPG I can imagine any one enjoying playing through start to finish.
