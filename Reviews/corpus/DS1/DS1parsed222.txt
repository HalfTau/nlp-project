This is one of the first rpgs that I remember playing through to completion, and I loved it when I was younger. I recently began playing through it again as a lets play for my YouTube channel JadekindVideoGaming if interested. I am still enjoying the game, however it has not aged as well as I might have hoped. There have been several technical issues with the game crashing or not loading saves, which have caused some frustration. Additionally, I feel parts of the game drag on for too long, and that there are general pacing issues.All that said, I am still enjoying the game as a trip through memory lane. I would recomend this game, yes, but as an older game you should certainly know what youre getting yourself into when you begin.
