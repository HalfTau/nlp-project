A good attempt to make a dungeon game in 3D. This game had its problems and things I didnt like. Monsters dont respawn making it difficult to level up. Moving characters on to the platforms were bothersome and often made me angry. Magic verity is limited leaving you with little options. The story is lacking with no depth, you just go from one village to another killing monsters. The world is linear, just follow the path to the next village. The game is full of wonderful dungeons, hence the title.The start of the game is very difficult as you start as a former with nothing. Monsters dont respawn so making sure you get enough exp points requires some thought as you may have to share combat with members of your party. The idea of a pack mule is cool.Controlling and moving your party can be annoying, specially with platforms. Save often, you never know when the game my crash. After defeating the final boss, the video cut scene would not play for me. I had to watch it on YouTube. The final boss battle is boring, you just stand there and attack.Multiplayer has been disabled. The game is probably more fun to mod. Microsoft has made the game easy to mod and has even provided some tools.Overall the game was OK. It just didnt offer any reason to play it again or much to offer besides environments. I recommend playing the second game instead or playing another game like Divine Divinity.
