Be aware  I may be a bit biased since this game was a really nice part of me growing up, so nostalgia may be a factor here.However this game is A REAL GEM, lovely mechanics, a nice story, pretty nice characters that youll most likely remember a long time after playing this, great soundtrack and sounddesign which means adaptable sound depending on the scenario.Apart from that this game will give you good bang for the buck I did pick it up during a 75 discount period, but even at regular price this would be a good deal.IF you keep in mind that its an older game, however I find the graphics to hold up pretty amazingly, its definitely playable.Some complaints the expansion for this game was a really big one and changed the game immensely problem its not included nor is it possible to buy it on steam !!!! So no legends of Arana The resolution is quite poor but that is to be expectedThe AI is pretty horrible, so the best experience might be had playing this without companions.The multiplayer mode doesnt work, but people may have found ways around that online.Apart from that, it works when you start it, which cant be said about the steam version of dungeon siege II see my review from that game if you want.I still would advice to give this a try since its a really nice game, thats also the reason why I still fondly remember it from a long time ago, and it holds up to my nostalgia.
