The best part about this game is the. Be sure to go to Guides in the steam Community and look up how to enable the Multplayer mode with the Steam Launch OptionsYou wont Regret it. Unlike DS 2 this one installed and ran properly for me when I set my game resolution to 800x600. Too bad steam doesnt do a better job making these oldies more compatible with new machines. It would be a godsend and make it worth paying the money. Not to mention it would breathe new life into these classic existing titles. This game is quite epic. If it werent for the terrible graphics this game would have made it very big. The maps are very large and immersive. It feels like you can play forvever and not run out of content. And in Multplayer mode it gives you the Multiplayer maps and mods that allow for adjustable difficulty levels allowing for some better replay options.
