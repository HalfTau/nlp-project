This game is my entire childhood. Played it nonstop with my brother and some friends in multiplayer... Imagine my disapointment when I found out that the steam edition doesnt have multiplayer.Pros Music is perfect. Some of the best video game music ever made. The atmosphere is very immersive and a real joy to rediscover. Still packs a good challenge.Cons Doesnt support todays typical resolutions. Controls/Camera is little meh.not too bad considering the original release date, but not up to par with todays standards NO MULTIPLAYER!
