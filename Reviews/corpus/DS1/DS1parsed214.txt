Great game.Dungeon Siege Heaven, is a great start to a trilogy that ends very far from where it started. The first installment offers a good story and decent gameplay mechanics. I have three things to say. First, a least consider consider reading the dusty tomes that are scattered about the Kingdom of Ehb. Second, one of the dynamite barrels in the mines, when detonated, regardless of game difficulty or strength of your hero, will kill all caught in the blast radius. Third, Merrick, the one frozen in a popsicle in the ice caves, is so squishy. Try to keep him throughout the game as an added challenge. It also makes you feel better about yourself and more accomplished.If you are reading this review and are making a decision to buy this game, just go watch some gameplay footage to make up your mind. It has some outdated graphics and story that will be lost in a slew a games that are much better.The way I see it at this very moment is this I cant wait to play the game again in a few years to feel the nostalgia of truly well made game. More importantly it makes me summon the courage and idiocy to try to make it through the pit of despair. It gives me hope that one day I will find the pyramids in the endless desert. I will find them. Merrick I love you. Good luck now, and try to stay warm.
