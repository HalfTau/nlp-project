Dungeon Siege is an RPG masquerading as an ARPG, blending the best features of each genre1 It offers a party composition system that is reminiscent of Baldurs Gate. You can hire key NPCs into your party as you meet them. You share weapons and loot among 6 characters at a time.2 Similar to The Elder Scrolls, you gain skill ability by actually using skills, not as a pickable reward for gaining levels. Love this.3 Lots of side quests.4 Lots of hackyslashy gameplay, and a breezy lightness to the whole thing.Today, you will need to look past the dated graphics, but this is a solid game.Be warned that Dungeon Siege requires a little effort to get running on a modern computer. As delivered from Steam, youll get crashes and black screens. I was able to find what I needed in the Steam Forums, though, to get it running on Windows 7 at 1920x1080 resolution.
