one of my favourite childhood games had a blast in singleplayer and multiplayer ...to bad they disabled multiplayer though but other then that this is a really really fun game lots of awesome memories...played this game back when i was 7 years old when i owned the CD copy before i even knew about steam...im going to give this game a 10/10 for awesome gameplay, storyline , atmosphere , immerstion , voice acting , combat system , and so on its just to much of a badass game to not be played. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an awesome adventure game ..trust me once you play this game for the first couple hours you will love it and yeah i know i only have 11hr in it so far but thats cause i own it on steam now . if i knew about steam back when i was 7 years old i would have much much much more then 8,000 hrs game time since im 21 years old now . again trust me any old school hardcore gamer who has played this game will agree that its a totally badass game D so my advice is to give this game a try
