I remember loving this game when I was a kid and i even still played Dungeon Siege 2 every now and again and was excited to get the origanal on steam. started it up, game is extremly choppy and most the texture fail to load and everything is grey. couldnt even pick up the first fireshot it was running so terribly.  Would love it if the released the expansion and a patch or two.
