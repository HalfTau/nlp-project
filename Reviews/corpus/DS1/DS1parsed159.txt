Classic action RPG.  The game can kinda play itself but it can be relaxing.  The sound track is amazing, almost worth the price of admission, Ive always liked Jeremy Soules work.  The con would be no fast travel was fixed in dungeon siege 2.  Seems almost required.  If you forget to do a quest you have to walk ALL the way back to the area where you missed it.  And that can be a very long way.  Definitely check your quest log before leaving an area to make sure you didnt miss anything.
