Closer to an adventure than an RPG, its like Diablo but without the loot, the clicking, the atmosphere, or the character customization. Its an RPGLite dungeon crawler which is really a lot of fun. Of course, its very dated at this stage, so only recommended for fans of the rpglitediabloesquewithhardlyanystorythatdescendsintotedium genre.
