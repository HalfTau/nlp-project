Great game. A lot like diablo. Dungeons are not instanced, so there is no loading. Its somewhat limited thought. Magic isnt elemental. Fire monsters take as much damage by fire spells as ice monsters. Its somewhat imbalanced, melee is overpowered. The party system and mules are awesome. I just love being able to control a party of heroes instead of only one, but at the same time not a whole army. It is like playing a truly rpg pen and paper by yourself where you control the whole party, or only one hero if you wish. Its not perfect, limited in a lot of aspects, but overall a very enjoyable game with unique features afaik.
