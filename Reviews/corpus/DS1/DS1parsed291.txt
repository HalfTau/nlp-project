Well...how should i put this.Dungeon siege has everything i could want in a hack and slash rpg with a big spectrum of things to doI started playin this back in 2005 and i have never regreted looking for a copy of this game at a retail store in lincoln.So whats great well first, id like to get this out of the way the main reason i love dungeon siege is the fact that you can command an army of 8 soldiers 16 if you count summoned creatures. second when it comes to most hack and slash games they come to a point to where you are just grinding for hours on end and it almost feels like a job to finish what you started. that cannot be said about Dungeon siege, further more id like to point out that this stands between a cross country sim and a VERY long map game. What this means is that once you start the game you are in for the journey of a lifetime as this game has the whole map connected throughout. So if you want to walk back well its about 20 mins both ways through each town. Yes each place is checkmarked with a town so it is convenient yet a pain to walk back...just keep going. And fourth yes the COMBAT, the combat in dungeon siege game focuses on four classes melee fighter, archer, nature mage and combat mage. each has its own sets of advantages and weaknesses mostly the magic but its fun as hell to experiment with. Imo the best class is the archer to an extent That said dungeon siege is my alltime favorite h/s rpg of the century, it tops any other for 2002 if you can name one. One thing i cannot leave out is the graphics, because for 2002 these graphics are really well done for a dx8 game. The scenery the weather and the atmosphere are perfect for this game. So thats how i feel about dungeon siege a game that gives me nostalgia everytime i play it.Hopefully you will get as much fun as i did out of it.  p.s. i still love this game to DATE.
