Ok Id like to point out to all the people who are stupidly complaining about the lack of Multiplayer that1. The game  came out in 2002  and is over 13 years old!2. Gas Powered Games, The games developer has long been out of business. No company  No servers  No Multiplayer. If you want a Multiplayer Dungeon Crawling Action RPG game Go play Diablo 3.3. The game is PERFECTLY playable on Win10 as a Single Player RPG.PROSRuns on Win 10This remains a very good RPG with Diablo style loot and a very flexible skill  combat system.Play how you want, weapons/armor are not class restricted the gear system is reminds me somewhat of the Elder Scrolls games.I enjoyed playing this so much I bought the digtial copy just so I could replay it.As this is an older game NO mirco transactions are present in the game or any of that P2W crap that is so prevalent in many of more modern games.ConsInventory managment. Unless you buy a few pack mules in town you are going to be constantly dumping items .Leveling up skills can be slightly grindy.Steam version lacks the expansion pack.
