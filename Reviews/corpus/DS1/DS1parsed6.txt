I absolutely LOVE the gameplay, graphics  storyline. What I dont like is that I have 3 entirely different computers  it doesnt run on any of them at all. Being an older game, I wonder if that isnt the problem.  Same thing on Dungeon Seige 2. This is a risky buy NOW. It used to play fine on all older operating systems. Its a great game IF you are lucky  it runs.
