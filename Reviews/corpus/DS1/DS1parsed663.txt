I spent many hours playing this with multiple character builds before I got it on steam, lots of fun had. I bought the Dungeon Siege bundle x3 on steam expecting ease of use, functionality and no drama in getting it to work and sorting out CD keys and updates on multiple computers of my family...Started gameMultiplayer disabledNot cool.I normally would give this a big thumbs up but the steam version has multiplayer disabled because the online servers are no longer in existence, the problem is that local/LAN has also been disabled along with that for no reason at all other than laziness I guess, because they just disabled the multiplayer menu button in the main menu.Even when I played this by myself I used the multiplayer function so that I could use my characters when I wanted to play with friends and for certain features in the game host settings that were not in singleplayer.So you are better off getting it somewhere else.
