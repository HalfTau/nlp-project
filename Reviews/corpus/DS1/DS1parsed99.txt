Absolutely loved this game, and was thrilled to find it.... now i have logged 200 hours trying to get to the friggin crypt because of Exception Detected crashes..... and due to the hours trying to get to or past that point, i am no longer eligible for a refund? Steam, really need to fix this problem... so many forum posts about the issue, and im sure direct reports as well..... we pay for this stuff, some support would be wonderful.
