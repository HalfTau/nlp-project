I bought the game  had graphical issues left  right. Even tried every fix listed  nothing fixed the graphics. Textures disappeared, graphical triangles popped up everywhere,  screen would be blocked by blocks. I think it would of been a fun game  looked good when the blocks  triangles wherent there. If you can get the game to work think it would be a fun  great game though.
