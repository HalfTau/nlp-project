This game is actually quiet fun to play even considering the problems I had getting it to load on my W10 computer. Beautiful landscapes which are quiet visible even with the outdated graphics. Surprises around every corner and no fetch quests.. Combat can be made to be a bit strategic. They could have done a bit more in terms of character interaction then I would love it. Worth playing anyways.
