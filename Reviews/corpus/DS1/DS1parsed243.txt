DONT BUY THIS IT DOESNT WORK.Note Everything below was written a year or so ago, when the game used to work. I have modified the review as of today and it goes like thisDont buy Dungeon Siege from Steam. It does not work. Simple as that.Well, that is to say it never has worked, but some clever bod on the community had put together a wonderfull little suite of bug fixes and enhancements that made it a joy to play.Some rather less clever bod at Steam decided to remove this fix because... well... you tell me.Thank you Steam, for desicrating a seminal game from my youth.After 14 years I forgot how brilliant this game is. It starts slowly, and perhaps less seasoned players might get bored in the 3 or 4 hours it takes to really pick up pace. But once you start to build an effective party, its hack n slash RPG giggles like the good ol days.A lot of people complain about the multiplayer being removed from Steam, but really thats never why I played Dungeon Siege.Highly recommended.NOTE You will have to do a little bit of work to get this to run nicely on Steam  such as installing Killahs Fix and also modifying the command line options, but this takes about 10 minutes. This will also enable you to play the Legend of Arrana expansion. A little more homework and you can easily mod the game to enable the single player mode on the multiplayer map, which gives you many more hours of explorarion.
