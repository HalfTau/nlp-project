Dungeon Siege is one of my alltime favorites. I have some great memories attached to it, and so I cant really recommend you get it without cautioning that I am rather nonprofessional about it. HOWEVERDO NOT GET THIS VERSION OF THE GAMETHE MULTIPLAYER, AKA THE BEST PART, IS DISABLED. STAY AWAY! AWAY!You can hack your way into it, but its annoying and stupid.
