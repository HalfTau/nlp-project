Best game ever!!! The origional game which made me fall in love with Rpgs in the first place!!! You want to be a fighter? Pick up that rake next to you, swing a few times, get better... You want to be a shield tank? Pick up that lose board lying in the rubble over there, now go find a hoe... start swinging, get better want to be a combat wizard? Pick of that Fire Ball sheet, thorw it around, get better/ Nature? pick up a Zap spell... Use it...  and so onSkill points? ok, some people WILL hate this but... WHAT SKILL POINTS?? use a weapon/spell/shield... GET BETTER! Amazing story... Difficult enough to feel like a challenge... easy enough not to feel like a hitdiedrink potionsdiehit grind fest... The only way you will fail is by user error... thats not to say this game isnt without its brains/tactics though....You will not be dissapointed
