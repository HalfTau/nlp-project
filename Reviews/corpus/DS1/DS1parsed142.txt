It is a very good and fun to play hack and slash game, it has no rpg elements but still feels like one. Thing is i played and finished it when it was kinda newly released BUT with a Win10x64 o.s. it is nothing but trouble. Even totally locked up my pc while playing it. Task manager, alttab, ctrlaltdelete had no effect.IF YOU DONT HAVE A PC WITH WIN XP AND OLD HARDWARE AVOID BUYING IT. Dungeon Siege 2 is an even better game but it have same issues either
