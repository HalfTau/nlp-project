Remember that flick Uwe Boll made with the dude from Cannonball Run?  This game is EXACTLY like that.  Cannonball Run dude is running around the Nascar circuit trying to get up Loni Andersons skirt in the movie, and in the game youre doing...uh,  That may be be Stroker Ace.  I think there was a movie based on this anyways. Maybe it wasnt exactly like the game.  I think I remember Loni Anderson though.Oh wait, now I remember where I was going this.  This game is a lot like Loni Anderson in that it used to be pretty hot but it hasnt aged so well.  Still... Action RPGs started with Diablo, but they started to branch out and experiment with Dungeon Siege.  Its a good bit of nostalgia but its goign to look pretty fugly and the controls weve come to know in Action RPGs have been refined a lot since those days, so its going to feel a bit weird at first.  But, just like Burt Reynolds stache, itll feel right before long and youll just go with it because its warm and nostalgic and tickles a bit in all the right places.
