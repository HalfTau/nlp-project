Dont mind my hours played, I completed the game multiple times before it even was on steam.This game is, without any understatement, half truths or exaggeration, a.One of my fighters was dying too much, so I promplty gave him a bow and, since then, he has become a formidable archer. No releveling, no grinding. Yes, he was slighlty worse than he could have been if he started out as an archer, but its the possibility, and the feasability of such a possibility, that truly elevates this game out of the mediocre bunch for me.That, and the insane amount of spells, armours and weapons the game has. I replayed it just to see them all, and I kept seeing new ones on each playthrough. There will come a point in the game, where you will play only for the satisfaction of seeing your epic ironclad, firecasting heroes do battle. You will come back for a quick fix every evening, because yousuffer from withdrawal. Yes, its true, because even the slightly dated graphics of the game dont reduce the epicness of it by even a single iota.
