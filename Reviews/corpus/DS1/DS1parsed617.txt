I think if I had played this game when it first came out Id have been more into the game, so as a fair warning, this review is from a gamer here and now only recently playing this game.So what are its problems? Bloated loot system with no town portal to sell said items, a difficulty step missing between normal and easy easy is too easy and normal is punishing even at higher levels, scant story and an enviromnment that obscures almost every monster to come your way. The game almost plays better being constantly on the map rather than the normal top down game mode, the party members battle AI is atrocious, the pathing is specious at best. Traps are either very deadly or inconsequential with no inbetween. The textures of everything blend into a hodge podge. The battles do better than constant pausing a la Baldurs Gate, which can be done at any time, but is really only suitable for corner cases.Basically, any advancement that had happened since this game was released casts a pall over the game which I think would have been much more revolutionary at the time than it is now. Its old school and not in a fun, engaging way, but more of an, Im only hanging out watching my guys fight just in case I need to press the heal or mana keys or I said kill the freaking wizard/cleric that keeps ressurecting the monsters, you dolts! kind of experience.
