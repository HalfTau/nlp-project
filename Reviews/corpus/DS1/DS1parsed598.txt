This game was one of my first game, the 2 others were runescape and medal of honor allied assault, Im proud to say that this is one of my first games that Ive played cause this game was amazing, the campaign is epic, I could do it a lot of times and i was never bored and there is the multiplayer, ultra epic, you could play on the campaign map but with people online or friends, it was amazing, there is also the multiplayer map only, it was amazing, damn this game was like a drug to me, it was simply amazing, the monsters, the gameplay, the maps, everything was perfect plus I remember all the good times with the 2 best clans of the game called FS and the one from dungeonsiege.frThere was some really good mods to make the game even better but the sites are unfortunately no more available.The multiplayer is now dead, you cant even access it anymore, why did they had to closed it?This game is seriously perfect.I hope they could do like they did with Age of Mythology and Age of Empires II, it would be the same game but with better graphics and maybe some more new items and new online with hopefully a lot of players.If you want to play multiplayer you can play the multiplayer map alone, add this  zonematchtrue in the set launch options of the game.9.5/10
