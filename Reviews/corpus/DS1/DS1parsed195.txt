I dont play a lot of games now a days. I believe although that I have scorned genres that could please me. This clicktomoveclicktoattack RPGs fall in those games. I loved torchlight 2 when i played it. And I this game resembles torchlight 2 a lot. However, it is PARTYBASEDRPG, where you get to control multiple party members.At the price this is available nowDungeon Siege Collection, includes I, II and III, it is a must have, even if, like me, you dislike the genre.For playtime, I have played this game for 8 hours in the first two days, which is kind of a lot for me nowadays.Strongly Recommended!
