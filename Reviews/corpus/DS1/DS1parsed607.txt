Now a classic and despite the series and fanfare it spawned remains undeservingly without a true spiritual successor. The reviews Ive read from my peers thus far are spot on. This little TacticalRPG was way ahead of its time. Touted as a Diablo killer, clearly inspired by Baldurs Gate the expectations were high to say the least upon release.Admitedly though and to no surprise the fledgling developer at the time Gaspowered Games may have bitten off more than it could chew as the title falls short in many aspects of its predecessors. Still this shouldnt deter you from giving it a go as it is a solid piece of work from start to finish.Unfortunately however Steam has failed to acquire the Exanpsions which contain necessary patching and multiplayer is relegated to LAN, TCP/IP, Hamachi or GameRanger. All of these options require time and effort to coordinate play with others rather than being able to just jump right in. Still if you like ARPGs give this one a chance.It should also be noted there were many mods of varying qualities great and small including a couple of conversions such Ultima V  6 all thanks to the dedicated Dungeon Siege Community  should you be interested extending the experience.
