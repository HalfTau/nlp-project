One of my all time favorite games as a kid. This game doesnt have a very in depth story due to its age but the gameplay and constant excitement of leveling and finding new spells or companions keeps me going. The soundtrack feels epic and never any loading screens other than the first making the game feel relaxing to play. My only advice is to not be frightened by the single plaeyer character creation since you play the game zoomed out quite a bit and dont see the characters face much.
