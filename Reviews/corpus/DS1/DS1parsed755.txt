A great, classic game with fair character customization. I havent played the newer ones, but this one is simply amazing. While the multiplayer is disabled, the singleplayer works just fine. Just remember to save frequently, as dying in this game is merciless, and Windows 7 occasionally crashes the game. Other than that, the choices of being a warrior, ranger or two types of mages, or just mixing it up a bit, because you dont need to specifically pick a class, the game provides hours of entertainment. Before you question it, yes there is a difficulty setting, from easy to hard. And honestly, Im finding Normal to be pretty difficult as it is.
