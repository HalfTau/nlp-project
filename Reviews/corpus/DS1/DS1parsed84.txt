This is a classic staple in the Action/RPG genre. In my mind, it may be more basic than Diablo or Baldurs Gate, but it has unique qualities about it that make it stand out in my mind. It may be old, it may have a lacking story, but overall it is a fun experience that anyone who considers themselves a fan of RPGs should pick up and kill time playing.
