A fun Dungeon crawling adventure! Its not as featured as Dungeon Siege 2 but it does feel like an epic campaign.There isnt different areas or waypoints you just keep scrolling on forever which makes the game feel very large. You level up between 4 skills or buy spells so the charecter developement isnt very advanced you will be most focused on a party then a single charecter. This is a classic Hack n Slash you wont regret
