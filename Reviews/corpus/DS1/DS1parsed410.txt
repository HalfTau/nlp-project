This game introduced me to RPGs. Growing up I was always an avid RTS player and added in some FPS to the mix as well. I picked up this game initially on the CD version and I was hooked. Did a 4 player LAN session with friends and it was one of those LANs you never forget. Such a well made game. I dont play it now but its a must own for classic collectors. Those CDs wont last forever!
