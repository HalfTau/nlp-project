Watch Rosss game dungeon on this game. My only advice after that is to play it when you have alot of free time, its best to play through in the span of a short period of time. Also after you beat the main game you can enable the expansion using mods, and using even more mods you can play the multiplayer in singleplayer. If theres some things I dont like about the game its that caves and dungeons go on for longer than I like and they are really close togeather, ontop of that 2/3rd of the way through each dungeon/cave I keep thinking Man, will this ever end. Other wise this is a fantastic game, I highly recomend it.
