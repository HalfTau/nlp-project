i grew up playing this game with my dad, and its never lost its charm. i love it. however, it took me a LONG time to figure out how to get it to actually work on my laptop, as its not compatible with windows 7. i dont understand why they are selling it without being more clear about how to fix it so you can actually play it. i reccommend it though, because once you eventually get it to work, its a great game. theres plenty on google to fix it so its playable, and make sure to disable steam ingame and not to launch it from within steam.
