The game is your typical Magic or Sword vs Monsters of Western RPG. The graphics are super outdated but it would of been a blast back in the day. With full dialog audio, the game has a great story and progression even with the little play time I had. The difficulty just jumped off the cliff and I had no more penitence to keep on playing. Overall I give this game a score of 7.2  GOOD.
