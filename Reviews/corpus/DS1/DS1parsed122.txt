Dungeon Siege itself is a great game. Its a hack n slash rpg with some tactics and you will fight in a party.You start first alone, but over the course of time you run into potential partymembers, which you can recruit. Several locations to visit, several quests and good music done by Jeremy Soule also responsible for the music for tes III morrowind and tes IV oblivion . However, there is one big problem. This version here on Steam aint complete. There was also an expansion released called Legends of Aranna, developed by Mad Doc Software. And that expansion aint included. Thats right, you will buy an incomplete product. Without LoA Dungeon Siege is just not complete. And that is not the only thing that is not included. Gas Powered Games released a mod of themself called Yesterhaven. That one isnt included as well. For LoA there is also a bonuspack called Return to Arhok. but it only works on Windows Xp. That one can be downloaded for free. But since its a bonuspack for LoA you cant use it with the steam version, as Steam lacks LoA.Therefore i would not recommend to buy Dungeon Siege from Steam, as it is not complete. And i doubt it will ever be complete, as it seems the current owners on the rights of Dungeon Siege, Square Enix, have no interest to give steamplayers the complete version. Rather get the version with LoA from something as Amazon or any other source.
