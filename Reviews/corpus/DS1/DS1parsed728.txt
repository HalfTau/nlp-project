I used to play DS1 long time ago, so it has sentimental value to me. Graphics are old, some stuff from moderns rpg games is missing loot all option, item stats comparision..., middle button for camera rotating is kinda annoying, but the game is still fun to play. And music by Jeremy Soule is very nice. Too bad LoA expansion is not available on Steam.
