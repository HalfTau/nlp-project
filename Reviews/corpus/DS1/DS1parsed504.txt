An awesome game that is missing from Steam. I have put many hundreds of hours into this game in the past. The copy that Steam sells DOES NOT WORK ON NEWER SYSTEMS. It is also missing the expansion Legends of Aranna. The disc version works perfectly, even on newer systems. WTF STEAM. If you want to play this game, find disc packs instead of the Steam version, and I assure you that youll have a much better time. This is a very fun game, but DO NOT BUY IT THROUGH STEAM.
