A once fantastic coop RPG game, ruined by Square Enix. The multiplayer was disabled for a reason, as its buggy and laggy as hell due to whatever Square Enix did to the game. This game also has severe compatibility issues with Windows 7, even with TnL disabled and those commandline options the game had severe framerate drops randomly. Even if you loved the game in the past, I would avoid this version.
