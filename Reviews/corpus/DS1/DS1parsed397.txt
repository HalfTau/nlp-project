I love this game. I played probably 1000 hours as a child. It has a great lore, gameplay, mechanics, beautiful world design, was moddable, etc., and was ahead of its time when released. The graphics arent super great, but it came out in 2000, so you really cant blame the developers. And the score is one of a kind, music like no other 3 I would reccomend this game to anyone.HOWEVER.The steam release of this game is downright unacceptable. The game does not run on newer computers without fiddling of the game files after dowload, nothing hard in any way, but one should simply be able to jump right in. A game so grand deserves at least that much. And even when you do that, the game is still very hard to play. The screen flashes, parts of the HUD are not where they should be, and mouse clicks to not register in the correct location. These problems are due to the game being out of date and a simple update would make this game enjoyable once more.Another thing I dislike is the fact that the multiplayer campaign is inaccessable in the steam release. There is a whole other fully fleshedout world and a more indepth character creation system that can only be accesseed via the multiplayer tab.If it werent for these two issues, Id say its more than worth its price.Id like to request a developer make a modern remake/remastering of this game, make something along the same lines because DS2 and DS3 are far too different and simplified in a way that makes them not enjoyable or if someone could suggest a similar game to this that actually works, Id be very appreciative.
