Dungeon siege is a classic hack and slash with some RPG elements to it. By the time it was released, it was a technological and gameplay marvel, but for todays standards, its a very bland and generic fantasy game that has some cool mechanics, but poor depth.Graphics have aged very poorly, but the animations are very tight and still an impressive feat considering the games release date.Gameplay is a strong point, with an innovative it was back in the days party management system and class/job experience system.Story is poor, very poor. Voice acting is ok, but since the story is so generic, it does not shine.Music is very good. I think it is the early work of a nowfamous game composer.The game has two glaring flaws 1 it drags its content too much, too slowly, making the pace of the game very troubling 2 the Steam version DOES NOT COME WITH THE EXPANSION, Legends of Aranna for reference, you can download it in the internet, just search for Dungeon SIege Steam Fix.Overrall, I  recommend the game for old fans and for new gamers who would like to experience historicgames, such as this one, if only for the discovery.
