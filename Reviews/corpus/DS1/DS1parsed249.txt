I had a blast playing this game back in the day. My first experience to the ARPG formula. One of the best aspects of this game, was playing with friends online. Square Enix, since getting the franchise had no problem spending money to put their name all over the game, but disabled multiplayer, one of the games best features. The couldnt bother to even patch it. Without the multiplayer function, a big part of the reason I have fond memories of this game, I cant recommend the game.
