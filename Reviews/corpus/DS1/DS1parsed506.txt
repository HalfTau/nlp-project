I just love this game.Yes, it is quite old by now, but for me it is still one of the best ARPGs ever made.I had this games on disk years ago, and have many fond memories.I think the difficulty is spot on, the party system is great and there is even something of a story.I also can not complain that it does not run I have no problem running the game on mywindows 8.1 laptop 64bit.Of course I have to agree that it is sad that the expansion Legends of Aranna is missing,but what can you do when stuck in a mire of copyright politics?Also, and that is the AWESOME part, there is a MOD which lets you play the Multiplayer mapas a singleplayer with a party. This gives you many more hours of gameplay it is longer thanthe included singleplayer campaign.It even has a better story than the singleplayer campaign!And yes, it runs fine on the steam version and gets around the problem with the blocked multiplayer.Here the link
