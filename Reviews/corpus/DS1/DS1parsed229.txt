Just a quick review for the Steam Award Nominations. This is my alltime favourite RPG. Great combat, a lot of variety, has mods and can be played online/in LAN. Beautiful soundtrack and modding adds a lot of playtime even if you cant easily find players to play with anymore. Graphics are still fine, but youll need to tweak the settings quite a bit on newer operating systems and GPUS to be able to play.
