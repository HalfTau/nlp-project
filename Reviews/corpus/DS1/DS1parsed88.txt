This is one of my favorite games. I still play it regularly. I am not coordinated enough for first person shooters so these hack and slash quest games are great. I especially like the little details like the doe and fawn in the forest that bounds away as you approach. I really like the 360 degree look around.  Wis there was more of this type.
