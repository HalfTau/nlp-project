Fun game so far, I give it a 4/5 given its time... Decent lore and storyline which is the only reason I play these older games. The camera is a little tricky but I got used to it. Different from most ARPGs because your attributes and skills level up as you play instead of you picking which ones to level up. The looting system is different because you cant hold a lot but, so far it seems like there is no benefit for hoarding which puts a nice spin on things.If you are on Windows 10 and it is crashing use the following steps to get it to work Right Click the game in your library and click on propertieslocal filesBrowse local files. When file explorer pops up, right click on DungeonSiege.exe application and click properties. Go to the compatibility tab and check the box that says, run this program in compatibility mode for then select Windows 7 and click Apply and then OK. You will have to launch the game by using the DungeonSiege.exe each time you play the game. It is a little bit of a pain but, at least it makes it playable.Update 8/20/17 Just finished the game I noticed that if you used the steps above to play the game that steam will not track your play time. Also, the game still crashed on me a couple times so make sure you save often. I am a little bummed that the ending sequence has been removed from the game. As soon as you kill the end boss the game goes right to the main menu. You can look up the ending on YouTube but, it shouldnt be that way. As others have said, there is an expansion that Steam doesnt offer which is a bummer. My rating stays the same because dispite the things I mentioned, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and only paid 1 for it.
