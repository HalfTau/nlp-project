This game is far to old to be on steam. The interface is glitchy depending on what kinda computer you have. I had to combind 6 different problems to get it play.. and if i moved my mouse to fast it would crash.The game itself is amazing, however its been forgotten about and dried up over the years. The game gets a8.6/10but dont buy it unless you plan on fixing it for an hour and have to stop and save every 5 secs!
