If you like these kind of games, its pretty good fun for its price when its on sale. usually around 1.90 Id say its a pretty good introduction to the genre if youre looking to try it out.Took me 33 hours to beat the main campaign, and then there are two other campaigns as well, one thats slightly shorter and one thats a lot shorter.Make sure you get the patch that makes it compatible with modern computers and adds the missing expansion content.Theres also a decent amount of community made campaigns that you can find online, but I havent tried any of those out yet.
