I played and beat the retail version of this game many years ago and I guess I now have it on steam from buying the Collection. The Campaign is really long so I wont be playing through it again obviously.It says online that the campaign is 28 hours on long average which wouldnt surprise me and since this was the only RPG I had and one of only a few different PC games I didnt seem to notice the time going past as I just played a few hours day by day.I have good memories of this game, running through different zones, killing enemies and collecting loot, I remember dying a lot of a few points and having to run back and fight enemies one at a time when Id reach a point I was to low geared/ level for the specific enermies/ area.I never played Diablo 2 so this was my old school RPG before I got into Diablo 3 and most likely what got me interested in playing Diablo 3 to begin with as Id never played a game like this before.Game is pretty old to pick up and play in this day and age but its a top notch isometric RPG and since there are only a few of those around its worth a play if you need more games like Diablo or Path of Exile in your life.
