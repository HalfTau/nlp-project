This game is unplayable for me and countless others  possibly for you too.Dungeon SIege is a blast of nostalgia for me, and Ive played it numerous times over the years. As wear and tear seems to have finally claimed my hard copy of it, I decided to purchase the steam version.And then it crashed. Everything seemed fine up until the opening cutscene  which displayed weird texture glitches  but that stopped when the cutscene ended. As did the entirety of the game. After a quick search and about half an hour playing around with suggested methods, I managed to stop it from crashing. Except those texture glitches were still there, popping in and out in countless places all over the screen. So, back to the forums with me. Theres lots of genuinely helpful guides online, all of which touting the same 3 or 4 basic fixes but none of these worked for me, or for countless others. I patiently tried these fixes, and various combinations thereof, but theres been no change whatsoever.This game might work for you, in which case youll almost certainly have a great time playing it. But the level of detail Ive had to go into to simply stop this game from crashing is outrageous, and even then the product Im left with is unplayable. It is, in this state, a total waste of time and money.
