Its a hack n slash game. I love hack n slash games, I played the hell out of Torchlight 2 and Diablo II back in the day.I played Dungeon Siege for the first time this year and, while I probably would have liked this game when I was a kid when it came out in 2002, I was 9 years old, I find there is something severely lacking in this game.You basically walk around and kill a ton of enemies and drink potions from time to time, which makes sense, it is a hack n slash game after all. But Diablo II was fun. This is not. It feels like the developers added more monsters and made the paths between quest objectives longer so that it could give more length to the game. But it is basically empty. And the storyline is absolutely atrocious.The game is not completely awful, the gameplay is well done. I think it is simply a boring game. Ill still give a try to the other games in the franchise though.
