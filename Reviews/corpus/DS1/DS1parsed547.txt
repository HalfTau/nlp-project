This is a very nostalgic game for me. I remember this being the first RPG I played and LOVING it. My one issue is that they dont offer the expansion pack which includes a whole other campain and some extra functions that help make the gameplay a little easier. I would love it if steam added the expansion. I do admit the gameplay is a bit linear, but overall the environments that they create and the ways they manage to blend them together with no loading screens is amazing.
