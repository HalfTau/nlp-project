Lets me explain it as simple as this...Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege II are superb and brillant games, it is a shame their is no multiplayer option on Steam, which like all other players of this game I am disgruntled about.With that exception, you want to push this game on the higher settings more and more, and it is a shame there is no impossible setting to try.Awesome!Now Dungeon Siege III, is an unbelievable disappointment that carries no elements of its predecessors.Stick with the first two in the series, and mentally rename the third to not taint the titles.Universal Gamer
