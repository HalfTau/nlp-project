Game is broken, glitchy, and requires launch commands to fix. BUT if you get past all the crashes its a hugely deep game that rewards exploration. Town portals dont exist here. If you dont reach the waypoints which are WAY out of the way, you will not get back without treking again. Play multiplayer with Hamachi and use their MP dedicated map. Best with friends.
