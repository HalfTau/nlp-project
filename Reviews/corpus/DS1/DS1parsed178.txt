Love this game. It is a classic. However, if you are running a modern system it will probably crash at some point. Whether that is during game play, or after you save your first game, shut down, and then try to load again, something will go wrong. This game isnt really supported well so you will need to hunt down fixes online to make it work. If you do get it to work, good on ya! If you dont, well, you were warned. I do wish Steam would make a bigger effort when allowing these types of older games onto the sytem to support them and make sure they work always.
