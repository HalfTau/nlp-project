Dungeon siege itslef is an awesome game, a really fun rpg experience. However, it is ruined by steam stripping it of multiplayer, and after the final boss, it boots you straight to the menu screen. No end game or anything. you cant even pick up the loot dropped by the boss. Major let down. Also does not include Legends of Aranna, the expansion. Glad i bought this on sale super cheap, or id be super peeved.
