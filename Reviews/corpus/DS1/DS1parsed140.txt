Bought this game since I remember enjoying it quite a bit in the good ol days. Disappointed though. Why would steam make you pay for something that does not work properly with more recent OSs? There is a roundabout way of making it work, but it seems to be more trouble than its worth. Surely they could figure out a way to patch the game to run better, or at least give us a warning that its not compatible as I did not see the warning when I purchased it.Good game from what I remember, but not fun buying it, dling it and then discovering it doesnt work 100
