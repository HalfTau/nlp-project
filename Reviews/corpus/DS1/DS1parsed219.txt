This is perhaps one of all time favourite games, I got gifted the original CD copy which I still have as a child. The fun of exploring the world, with an interesting story, and theres an expansion although steam seems to have the legends of aranna which adds some of the most fun spells and funky gear.Theres plenty of characters you can have in a party, as the game gets progressivly harder for you, and making gold isnt always as easy as it seems.The ambience, music and scenery may be dated to some, but to those that grew up with it then its a welcome sight to see because the game itself has so much to offer
