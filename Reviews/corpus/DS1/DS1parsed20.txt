Excellent oldschool RPG with great music and atmosphere. I like the huge map, good variety of enemies, great music, excellent combat, magic, and weapon systems.If you have issue launching the game in Windows 10, try launching it directly from the .exe file by right cliching and selecting Run as Administrator. This solved the Exceptions crash for me, The game only crashed twice in this mode in 20 hours or so of playtime.
