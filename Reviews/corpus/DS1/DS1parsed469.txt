Dungeon Siege 1 and the Legends of Aranna expansion are fantastic examples of the old days of RPG games. They were published back when games required skill and thought to complete rather than a clickfest on rails to the finish line. The games story is thin compared to modern games, but it is fairly compelling. Although the game does have a linear playthrough it is still a great player experience.The biggest letdown here is the steam version. Naturally, they disabled multiplayer and vast numbers of purchasers are unable to use the expansion pack. These issues can both be resolved by digging around for the guide online. I highly recommend picking this up and playing through it before you play DS2 though as the improvements in DS2 will leave you a wanting a bit more from this.
