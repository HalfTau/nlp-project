Ahhh Dungeon Siege, I believe this was the first RPG type game I played on the PC. I loved the sound track so much as a kid and it brings back so much nostaliga to have played this again. I also was able to get the Legends of Aranna part to work and was able to play that too. The ShadowJumper, so much fun to kick his  again. An amazing game, part of my childhood, over all just so awesome to be able to see the world of Aranna again. 10/10
