Of a truth, this game is a classic.Support 10/10This game is very old but is now on steam.  Therefore I give support for this product a 10 because the developers never stopped supporting it.Graphics 7/10Graphics are not bad.  In some ways they are slightly above average.Sounds and Music 7/10Music and sounds are average.Gameplay 9/10For its genre the game is nothing less than a classic.  I therefore give it a 9.Fun 9/10Oh yes!! This game is awesomely fun to play.Price  Worth every penny I paid for it!Bugs and Execution  There are a few bugs in the swamp area so save often when you get there. Other than that the game executes fairly nice. It is also compatible with win7 if you ahve installed DX9.Overall  This game is a classic action rpg dungeon crawler.
