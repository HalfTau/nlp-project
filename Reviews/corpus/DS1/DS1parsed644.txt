Dungeon Siege I found to be a very good game it was immersive, exciting, Adventurous, and I really enjoyed it. If you like fighting dragons there in here And one in particular really full or overfilled to the brim with life and a huge sucker Big and mean. If you like dungeon crawls there here exciting and rewarding at the same time. If you like expeiriencing a castle right down to its dungeons with the rack and other means of torture there here. Even to wander brazen rivers of lava so real you feel the heat thrown off the screen. All of this along with a grand story behind it as well Thats Dungeon Siege. If you enjoy spending money on choice armor and weaponry to arm your mates and yourself that is here too. The only thing I must say I was very disapointed in the ending you killed the beast and as all the goodies exploded into reality all around me the game abruptly ends  the gaming menu comes grinding down your screen with out a chance to pick all that loot up or being given the privelage of the rulers of Ehb to grandly thankyou for your heroic part in saving their land or anything its just over thats it so the ending being somewhat disapointing but all in all its a grand game in the line of RPGs Robert A Enns
