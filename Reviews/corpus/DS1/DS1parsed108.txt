Best game. Just. Its one of the best games. Reminds me of being a kid again, and doing my first multiplayer maps...But why am I not recommending it? Two reasons. This doesnt have the expansion, Legends of Aranna I think is what it was called and the biggest one? YOU CANT PLAY MULTIPLAYER. Even local connection doesnt work! I expected you couldnt play using the now defunct method they had, but disabling LAN alltogether means even connecting with a PTP client like Hamachi is impossible.Thats the best part, and its gutted! Too bad.Edit  There is a work around for the multiplayer where if you use google, you can find whats needed to edit a line of launch options for it to work. For the sake of making this review full, I figured Id put this in here. However, in my experience, not everyone will know this. Yes, multiplayer can work with some editing. No, I still dont recommend it thanks to the lack of expansion and the extra map that required the expansion, and because you do have to use a work around to get multiplayer to work.
