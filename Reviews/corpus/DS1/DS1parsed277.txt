EDITED While the game initially has multiplayer disabled there is a guide that allows you to access the multiplayer menu in the steam guides.  Just follow the instructions by accessing the Network option and having Hamachi.  If you want to play singleplayer in the network you can do that as well as the benefit of multiplayer is you can have more enemies to kill.Ive changed this because of what I have discovered.  It makes me happy.  However, I still find it ridiculous, and annoying, that they disabled the multiplayer menu where what they should have disabled is their matcmaking and internet options.
