An outstanding game that I played years ago and lost the software over time.  I picked up the collection at Humble Bundle and redeemed it here on Steam.  I just finished the game moments agoWin1064bit720p max playable w/o quirks and highly reccomend this very underrated game.Unfortunately when it was originally released it was up against the massive powerhouse known as the Baldurs Gate franchise.  And it faded in comparison as did so many other cRPGs during the years of the late 90s to around a decade after that when Baldurs Gate ruled cRPGs.Pick up this game and enjoy.  Watch some Youtube vids for gaming assistance/guides or the forum here!For my use I created a shortcut link and added the resolution to the command line for best playability on my PC.
