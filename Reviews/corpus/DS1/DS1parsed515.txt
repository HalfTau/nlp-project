If you have not played Dungeon Siege, then I suggest that you check it out. It is a fantastic party based dungeon crawl game. It is however a bit dated and to enjoy the game at higher resolutions I reccomend that you look into some modified steam run parameters to get the game much better looking and removing the framerate cap.Ive gone through the game a few times back in the day. I cant resist going back for another go on Steam. If anything just to see the epic terrain set pieces!
