Its unfortunate that this is missing the Aranna expansion but its still an amazing game. I remember when I was 12 and my dad had this game for his computer. It was the only rpg game he had and he let me play it. I remember the graphics were amazing and the gameplay was amazing and it was just amazing. Now, I actually have the physical copy with the expansion but Steam gave me this when I preordered Dungeon Siege 3 and since I have a newish computer and Im lazy and dont want to be bothered with disks I played it through Steam. The graphics have... not aged well but if you can get passed that and the bugs and the lack of optimization for newer machines, this is still an amazing game. Its a blend of Diablo and Baldurs Gate and you level up your skills by using them. ie You want to get better at swords so you use a sword more to level that skill up. If you dont have the patience for an old game that crashes occasionally then you might want to give this a pass but if you dont mind then definitely pick this up!
