Best to play this awesome classic via the exe, not via Steam.Also remain in 1024x768.This was my first arpg and from day one I was addicted to this masterpiece.A lot of management between the characters armor  weapons and you can even a pack animal with you to take more loot with your party.The world is very big and with a lot of variation in flora, fauna and monsters.I completed it back then and now i wanna play at least to the swamp Is this a game for you? I dont know, but I can tell you for me personnaly I like this more than part 2 and 3 together !
