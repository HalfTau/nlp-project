Old school RPG formed in the ripples of the Diablo  wave.It was great back then, but, after a recent replay, it does not hold up too well for me.The story is not worth mentioning, the autoattack does not really allow to use the multitude of spells at hand and it is not well balanced or too much fun overall.Also the games always crashes after defeating the final boss this apparently is a known bug.
