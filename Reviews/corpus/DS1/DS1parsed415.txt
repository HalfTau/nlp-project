Incompatible error messages for this version of windows and way too many exception crashes.  I found that deleting and redownloading took care of that problem. The characters still seem to have a mind of their own sometimes but I can live with that. Its a real treat to be able to play one of my favorite XP games on Windows 7 and a 42 screen. Fantastic.
