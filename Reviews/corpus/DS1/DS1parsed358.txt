A quite boring hackn slash with a combat that requires minimum input from the player. Good audiovisuals, but boring gameplay and story. I cannot recommend playing this game to anyone, but I recommend getting it for Ultima V Lazarus mod, which basically lets you play Ultima 5 with Dungeon Sieges engine and graphics.
