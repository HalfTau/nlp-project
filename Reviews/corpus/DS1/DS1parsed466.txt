Do I recommend this game? Yes.Do I recommend the Steam version that Square Enix has given us? No.The game is plagued by a number of seemingly random bugs and thanks to the fact that the expansion is not included I would expect to spend less time torrenting the game and trying to get that to work, or even installing my disc copies that I still have and trying to get those to work. I bought the Steam version expecting compatibility issues to be solved. This port is the perfect example of how to make money without doing any work. Dungeon Siege deserves better.
