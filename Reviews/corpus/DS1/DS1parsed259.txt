this game pretty much sucks, maybe it was good once but it aged likeloledit heres a real critique of the game for crybaby nerds who take steam reviews seriously...... the first 12 hours of gameplay are unrewarding and uninteresting, playing a solo magic user is an unbelievable grind, and the combat is dull and slow. the camera controls are crap, the game ignores your controls and commands semifrequently, which is annoying as hell. art design is bland, music is unimpressive, and the plot is incredibly dull and practically nonexistent. the game did not age well.
