Starts of excrutiatingly slow. There are some good early areas, but a lot of boring ones. But the further into the game you get, the more interesting things get. Maybe thats kind of normal for this kind of game.Its definitely worth playing if you can get past the beginning.I recommend playing on hard, but there is one issue. It looks like the game comes with Legends of Aranna preinstalled. The problem with that is that LoA introduced a stealth nerf to the gameplay. The game is significantly easier with Legends of Aranna installed though I cant really recall if it was the installation that did it, or if it depended on which .exe you used.I always used to recommend playing on hard with LoA NOT installed, but it doesnt look like youll have a choice now, except that if LoA IS making it easier, you will definitely want to play on hard not normal. Depends on your personal preference though, too, of course.
