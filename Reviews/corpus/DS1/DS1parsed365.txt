A good ol game. Requires a few workarounds to work at its best on modern PCs but it is certainly a great game. If you like your typical DnDstyle RPG games, well Dungeon Siege is in the same style but much more combat focused. You can have 8 dudes at once in a giant melee moshpit, and still find it difficult at a normal difficulty. The minigun doesnt do as much damage as Id like.On a scale of ham to vegetable, Id say its about pretzel.
