Bought the 3pack Dungeon Siege I, II, and III for just over 10, so I wasnt expecting much  especially from a game that was 15 yrs old. At first I found it cheesy and the graphics were almost too unpolished to stomach. But after I finally got out of the woods and into a dungeon, I started to truly appreciate the game. It wound up reminding me alot of Dragon Age  Awakenings and Diablo. The music is pretty cool, the graphics once I finally found a zoom level I was comfortable with  2.5Dish werent too bad, the battles got epic at times, and character development and the interface were awesome. There is little to no plot, and it is fulltilt hackslash, but overall I found it to be well worth my money and time. I give it enthusiastic thumbs up to anyone who wants to have some fun.
