One of my alltime favorite games. Ive played it through several times, and as a fantasy RPG/dungeon crawler, this game gets just about everything right. You start off as a solo adventurer fighting mobs, and looting treasure and weapons. Along the way, you meet more adventurers that join you in your quest. Ultimately, you end up with a party of six, and you choose how you want each person to develop their fighting style.Other DDstyle games like Baldurs Gate have a very steep learning curve, and are heavy on the player maintenance. I think that Dungeon Siege strikes just the right balance between playability and maintenance.
