Assuming it works for you, yes, absolutely I recommend this game.  Its an extremely well designed game that plays like a cross between Diablo and Baldurs Gate.  Combat is quick and accessible, yet still strategic enough that you can and should use the realtimepause feature.  And unlike a lot of older WRPGs, you dont have to worry too much about screwing up your character build.  You get seven more characters total, and health slowly regenerates even if you run out of potions or healing spells.The caveat with this game is if itll work for you.  Im blessed, I have Windows 10 and it works perfectly for me out of the box as far as I can tell, but as you can see with other reviews, thats hardly the case for everyone.Still, this isnt an especially story heavy game.  Two hours should be more than enough to tell if youll like it and itll work or not.  So definitely give this one a try.
