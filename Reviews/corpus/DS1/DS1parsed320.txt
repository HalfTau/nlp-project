Normally I would put yes but in this case Im not. I was looking forward to playing this all day since its been so long since I last played it. But everytime I start a new game it crashes before I can get all the way through the intro video. And that is extremely disappointing for me. I remember enjoying this game a lot when I was a kid but now I cant even play it.
