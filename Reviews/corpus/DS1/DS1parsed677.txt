WARNING Steam did not impliment their own multiplayer for this game!You can easily fix this with one quick google and a small download, though.Still, I do NOT recommend this as its such an old game, albeit an awesome classic, and they did literally nothing to it, including no compatability or even slight graphics update. GPG  Steam in duo do not support it, making it mind boggling as to how this even made it on Steam to begin with.You may as well go and get a copy of it for 50 cents at a hawk shop.Waste of money.
