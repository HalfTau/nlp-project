Dungeon Siege was the game of my childhood.As a classic hackandslash rpg released in 2002, it built the foundation for modern rgp today. Elements taken from  Dungeons and Dragons were lovingly brought to life with early game engines, while clever Easter eggs were hidden throughout the game for only the most dedicated of players to find.This Steam version, however, is not complete and Steam is preventing players from providing guides to fix this. What was availaible previously with purchase, the expansion and mod packs, has been stripped from accounts while guides to revert this have been taken down because Steam isnt making money off of them.The game is from 2002 its buggy, the graphics are fairly poor, and the mechanics are rudimentary. The community playing this are people who grew up with it, and Steam isnt going to entice new players to play an old game if they wont even allow that community to fully enjoy it.
