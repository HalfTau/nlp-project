Vincent Prices most helpful reviews Dungeon SiegeDungeon Siege is an oldschool adventure RPG with clicking, grinding, skill advancement, and more grinding. This game is inferior to the most masterfully crafted RPGs of old such as Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 in nearly every single respect except one.You can play as a spooky scary skeleton, and for that, its character creation has no equal. 10/10, can recommend.
