Dungeon Siege is a awesome game in which you play as a heroic farmer who, when evil strikes, picks up the nearest pitchfork and begins repelling the various threats to the world. It is a very fun game, and I will admit that much of my love of this game is nostalgiabased, but I think it is still a decent game by todays standards. It has a cool leveling and XP system where earn xp in things that you do EX To become good at melee combat, use melee weapons often. It also has many secrets and shortcuts waiting in the world, for those who enjoy exploration.However, the game is not without flaws. However, these flaws are mostly caused by Steam and Gamespy rather than the game itself. One of these is the game not including Legends Of Aranna, the expansion for the game, but if you look online, you can probably find a way to integrate it into the game If not, feel free to add and message me, as I have the files available. Another problem is that the multiplayer ran on Gamespy, so to play multiplayer, you need to find an alternative method Check online or steam guides for Dungeon Siege for help. Overall, I would reccomend definitely at least trying the game out when its on sale.
