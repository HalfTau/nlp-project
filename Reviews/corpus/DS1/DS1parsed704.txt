Have played this recently and spent a good number of hours on coop whcih is quite nice, though this game, can feel monotonous, though if u get ur head into gettin the right equipment and using spells like a real mage which the inter face unfornunatelu preclude slightly then it is fairly rewarding. Wehn I find the time, I willl move onto its sequals and if they are anything like this, then they will be worth playing..  Good game.
