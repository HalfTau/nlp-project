I cant believe that this game has spark a long running franchise. Seriously, before people gave me I am too young or This game was good for its time, I actually played good action rpgs like darkstone, nox, and the original diablo and enjoyed them. Dungeon Siege should be forgotten, as it has two major flaws with the game.The Bad1. Easy The game is too due to having regen health, 40 million health potions throwned at you, and the foes you faced being too damn weak.2. Boring The game throws several dozens opponents at you on a small map. So every few steps, some might pop out, and you ever kill them or run to attract more of them. But the biggest sin is combat, as melee fighters just auto attack, which leads the game to be walk spot here, sit there as your guys hacks every 200 people on screen.The Good1. Presentation The game has good music because of Jeremy Soule being the composer, very good gwaphix for its time, really out of date now, and the game is not buggy.Conclusion Just shock how this piece ofgame is beloved by many people, and how this game made a franchise. At least Dungeon Siege 2 and 3 are actually above average games.
