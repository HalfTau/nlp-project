Blast from the pastThis game is like jumping into the hot tub time machine, the equivalent of a magicalnostalgicchair. Sending you back through its early 2000 textures, this game was the first rpg adventure party based I stumbled upon, installed through a demodisc in the year 2002.From what I remember, Dungeon Siege had one of the more memorable introductions. Just a farmer, the adventure starts and throws you into an ongoing quest. An rpg of progression from the very beginning. This game like many others have suggested, is without a doubt one of the classics that deserved more praise than it had. Games like Diablo, and baldurs gate were great in their own right. However there is something unique and special about this game. The graphics were ahead of its time its still lovely to play and look at the textures  character animations. The music sets the tone nicely, and the storyline sucks you in to keep playing. Above all else, what I remember fondly about this game was the great layout of the menu, inventory, and weapons. Whoever designed this game has an extraordinary eye for detail. It is a testament amongst the years gone by, that many players remember this gem, or find it through another rpg game to boot it up.The only thing that has nothing to do with steam nor game developers niggled me and others in this review section, was the fact it can crash upon loading an error. I found some ways to get around this problem, as addressed in the reviews which happened to work for some play throughs.I give this game a 10/10. With the loading errors, I place it at an 8/10.Still manageable to play a great game of its era.DRMFree 13/07/2017.
