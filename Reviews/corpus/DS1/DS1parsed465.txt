I have always enjoyed this game, and since it is somewhat dated, I had played it on disc. You can have a lot of fun building your protagonists skils either through melee, ranged, or two sorts of magic. The more you focus on a skill, the more proficient you become. As you journey about a somewhat linear story arc in which youre asked to move about the world while gaining friends along the way, you become more adept at who you are. But, youll soon find yourself overwhelmed by loot if youre the kind of packrat like me. I was never able to complete the game because I got hung up in an artistically beautiful ice cave and all my characters including me died. I hope to continue playing and avoid the same trouble in future. I rank this game 5 out of 5 Stars, despite its dated appearance. Very easy to play.
