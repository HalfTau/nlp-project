This is easily the best hack n slash RPG I have ever played.  I started playing this title when it was first released, and I still find myself coming back to it after over a decade.The control and combat system is pretty intuitive, and camera only bites you when you have your back to a steep wall extreme zoom.  That isnt much of a problem, however, since you can turn the camera around with ease.  The party manipulation options are somewhat indepth, with multiple selections for formations, movement ranges, and aggression.  Probably more than whats needed to play through the game, but workable nonetheless.Another great feature is the loading screens or lack therof.  You load once at the beginning, and the game streams the entire world without a pause the entire map from start to finish.  The maps are not huge by any means, but big enough that this is an impressive feature given when this game was released.Character development is also interesting your party members develop thier combat effectiveness by how you use them melee, ranged, caster, etc..  You can also switch fighting styles at any time, just be mindful that a jackofall is a masterofnone unless you grind all your skills on the multiplayer map.The singleplayer campaign has just enough content to keep you focused on why youre stomping your way through hordes of hostile creatures, and doesnt overload you with too much lore.  The multiplayer offers an additional map that you can use, and both the single and multi maps can be used for it.There is also a massive mod community for this game, which also keep it alive for those who own computers that have left this old title in the dust.Like I said, it is downright fun and cheap, too.
