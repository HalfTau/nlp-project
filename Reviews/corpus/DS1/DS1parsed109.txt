Pretty good for an early dungeon crawler.However, if youre a big looter/hoarder like me this game is not for you. There is a lot of drops throughout the game, but theres no outlet for it all. You have only a finite space that fills up quickly and no merchants to sell it. There are merchants in the game, but they are so few and far between and there is no way to portal to them All the loot you carry eventually becomes either useless or valuable depending on your decsicion making skills and so youre constantly having to leave stuff behind rather than get gold for it. inventory cleanup is ugly and annoying and frequent even with a pack mule in this game and it is what finally got me to quit playing it before I finished it.
