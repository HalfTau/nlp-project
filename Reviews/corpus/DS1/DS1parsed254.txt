this game is absolutely fantastic! after I installed it I played it for nearly 9 hours non stop, the level of difficulty is quite challenging and the squared graphics brings back that good nostalgia feeling. super recommend!obs. the game wasnt working until I set all the graphic setting to the minimum. I thought it would make the game bad but it doesnt get in the way of the fun while playing at all
