Dungeon Siege was one of my favorite games as a kid and after all these years i still love this gameGameplay Dungeon Siege is basiclly a Diablotype like dungeon crawler game, linear, simple but very effective and addictive in my opinion.One of the things that made me fell in love with this game is the fact that you can have a group of 8 people in your party at once.This compined with the Great Ai in the gamefor the most partpretty much skyrockets Dungeon Siege into one of my favorite games of all time.Music Being composed by the legendary Jeremy Soule Dungeon Siege has a Great Soundtrack overall, defiently fits the areas and environments in the game well. . when your not mowing down tons and tons of monsters that is.Graphics For the early 2000s this game looked fantastic and i still think i looks great today. Story The Story in this game is . .umm . . very basichonestly i barley care about the story, while the story is kinda meh the story doesnt really take up much time and doesnt get in way of the gameplay.This is unforgently one of those games which modern computers have more trouble running it than an old computer would, Square bascilly ported it to Steam with no attempts of making it more compatible for todays computers, i can still run it though without much trouble and some help from the steam forums.The fact that not even the so called Complete packincludes the expansion pack Legends of Arannawhich is a great expansion packFinal Verdict 9.5/10 this is a classic and one of my personal favorite PC games of all time, if you like me love rpgs and you havent played it yet,While the steam version is not the best version of the game id definently suggest checking it out dispite the expansion pack missing and the combatability issues with newer Computers.
