I played this game back in 2004 and in those days, what made this game so great was the multiplayer.Since the multiplayer is long gone, I dont know what else to say but Im disappointed. The single player is still fun though, brings back memories and all.Dungeon Siege has one of the greatest OST the main one is very catchy.., and I love how inventory works, for its not one of those inventory system where swords, armors, potions are just square stickers. There are no attribute/skill points. You just keep up with one type of combat for each characters Melee, Ranged, Nature Magic, or Combat Magic to level them up. And I personally love the story in this game.I would recommend this game, but since there is no multiplayer, buy it when its on sale.Humble farmer
