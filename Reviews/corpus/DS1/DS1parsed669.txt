One of the most greatest games of my lifetime. I will never forget the classical RPG gameplay that this game has provided, with its adventurous and wonderous story and setting. Ive enjoyed this game ever since it had came out and is a must have for people who like this style of gameplay such as this. I am more than excited to know that this game had gone on steam, but its missing personally my favorite features, like the expantion to it and the multiplayer. But maybe theres some multiplayer provider out there for this game still, just takes time to look around.
