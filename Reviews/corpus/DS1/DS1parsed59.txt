My hours dont count, for steam wasnt around back then. In total id say i would have around 1500 hours of play time if steam existed back in 2003. But this was the game that opened me up to the gaming world in the first place. Were in 2017 now and the graphics are extremely outdated. looking past that. the game is truly one of a kind for its day. brilliant storytelling and gameplay is kinda fun but repetitive. Its sad to see this game not come out with legends of aranna because that would be icing on the cake. I would consider this game to others if they have the temperament to look past graphics because it truly is a ride.
