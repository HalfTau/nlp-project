Its simple, this game has a lot of flaws and difficulty spikes but its just an absolute classic. i used to own this on disk many years ago so yes, I did finish it and put hundreds of hours into it. It might be due to the fact that I never owned the DLC and thus dont miss it but yeah, if youre looking for all that extra content go find it somewhere else. If youre satisfied with the base game then just get it immediately. theres a ton of content and a super lengthy campaign either way.as for the gameplay, this game features a pause to give orders system which works really well since youre quickly overwhelmed by amounts of enemies if youre not careful. theres always a lack of inventory space but you can buy mules to carry tons of yourand many companions to choose from. at the start the item choice is very limited but the further in you go the more interesting and useful they get so theres a good reason for looting and spending half your time sorting through your various inventories to take the best stuff with you for when you can use it because this game throws higher leveled items at you in droves, youve always got something to work towards and with very customizable classes for your heroes you get to use nearly every strategy you can think of.
