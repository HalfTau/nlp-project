I would recommend this game to anyone whose computer can play the game.  However this is more of a question.  The game will not let me past the intro.  I get a message Exception Detected and I have to click the game closed.  There have been times when I have bypassed this by hitting ESC but now that does not work. Anyone know anything about this?  Would appreciate any help given.  Have tried different resolutions including the one mentioned in one of the reviews.  My notebook will not go down to 800x600.  The default setting for the game is 640x480x32.  I am hoping this is not a resolution issue.  Thanks.
