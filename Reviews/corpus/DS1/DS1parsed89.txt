So..... it crashed during the opening into cinematic. Multiple times,  without fail.Between that and the Expansion not being on Steam, so you cant even play the whole game.... meh, you can do better things with your time. I mean, Id beabout now if I couldnt refund the thing. Too bad, I was optimistic on this one.
