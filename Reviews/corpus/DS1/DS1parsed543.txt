I was having problems with tearing until I installed this game in Linux/Ubuntu using Wine.  Game works pefectly.  Windows 8.1, not so much.  Ive tried all of the remedies listed for installing this game in Win 8.1, to no avail.  Yes, I have a Dell Inspriron 15 laptop 5000 series with the Intel graphics card.  Ive even updated to the most recent drivers, and the display is still tearing.  Thought that Id give it a try in Ubuntu 14.10 using Wine, and it works.  Steam, needs to support this game under the WIndows platform if they want me to recommend this game for purchase, as this game IS NATIVE TO THE WINDOWS PLATFORM!  Maybe Linux is the future...
