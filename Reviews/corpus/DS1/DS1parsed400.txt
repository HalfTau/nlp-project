As of now, it is quite an old game, that modern monitors cannot display, as the VGA display needed doesnt seem to be available. I have completed it several times, as its quite easy  you cannot wander off the selected tracks. The game crashes in several locations, but providing you save the game regularly you should be OK. Ideally you need a laptop that has gone out of date running Windows 98 if possible. The second Game in the series runs on any DOS up to Windows XP.Most of the older games fail to run on Windows System 7, Which does have a software based XP Emulator  it does actually work. After that you can forget running any of your older stuff from Windows 8 onwards.
