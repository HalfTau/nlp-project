Windows 10, game works for me. Its still playable, no widescreen resolution though. Sound effects are terrible and the graphics obviously dated. Game is also a lot easier to play from the 1dimensional overlay map than the actual 3denvironment, since you have a better vision of whats going on and its a lot easier to click on enemies. You will be playing this for nostalgia, if at all, though.
