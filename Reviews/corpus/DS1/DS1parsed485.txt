Expansion not included although there is a guide on the steam community to enable it and multiplayer... Which is also disabled. Out of the box the game is not complete and does not include some vital game files... Such as the ending cinematic which means you CANNOT continue to play your character after finishing the main game...Worst of all, for me, it doesnt seem compatible with Intel HD...Shame.
