Do you like an RPG that has no class system, letting you build as YOU want?Do you like a storybased game, with none of those silly lame romance tropes?Do you want to be shoved right into the action, with simple controls that are easy to learn, yet hard to master?Do you like shooting chickens out of a minigun?This is the RPG for you. 11/10 would feel the Ehb and Flow of this game again.
