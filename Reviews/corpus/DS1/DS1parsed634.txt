Value!Having only played the first game, the addition of the other two titles in the Dungeon Seige complete pack was very welcome, even more so thanks to the expansions included, but the cost of the pack is justified easily by virtue of the quality game that the Original is.Bursting with atmosphere, Dungeon Seige is a 3D take on the Diablo 2 model, though with fixed level layouts.Dungeon Seige is a long game  you progress across the world map seamlessly and you easily notice the distances that you are chewing up, as key towns are few and far between. The experience of this game is probably more akin to the idea of a Lord of the Rings type quest than anything more computergame/zonebased, because as I have mentioned before you really get the feeling that you are blazing your own path, one that only occasionally intersects with civilization. Echoing ice caverns full of crystal avatars fill you with apprehension as the prospect of questing for hours without seeing the light of day is very real and a gameplay element in itself, and once you escape a gruelling forest zone midway through the game you are confronted with a seemingly impassable swamp, rather than the stereotypical sunny metropolis populated with traders.Dungeon Seige is also a difficult game  an example being the aforementioned swamp which pits your squad  albiet experienced and doughty  against hordes of difficult creatures marshalled by witches and targetting your most vulnerable members.The difficulty of the game, and the sheer distances of travel involved, is counterbalanced by the joys of a steadily improving squad. You have the choice to ally yourself with various squad members  more than you can ever hold in your total squad, in a feature that reminds one of the Baldurs Gate series and adds to the sense of blazing ones own path  and you cant wait for your hitherto skinny and ragged heroes and squad members to stumble across great shields, shiny helmets or keen longswords. Improving your skills relies simply on using related items  keep using a one handed longsword and a mini experience bar built in to your melee item combat slot will reflect your characters steady improvement in its use, ditto for ranged, nature and fire spells.In summary of this ragged and illformatted review for which I beg your forgivness  I am partially distracted I assure you that this game is a worthy investment of time and emotion  love your squad, covet your packmule, listen to every word of prerecorded dialogue and seek out all encounters, because you are living through a bonafide high fantasy advanture, and it does, eventually, end.
