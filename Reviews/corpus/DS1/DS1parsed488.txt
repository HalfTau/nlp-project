The game is great, but it has a missing link, the expansion, even though Steam or Square Enix doesnt deliver the game expansion Legends of Aranna you can go to the Guides section on the Community Hub and easily enable it,Just as you can join our growing Steam groupand our Discord serverEven though i disagree with the lack of support from Square Enix, i will give a thumbs up since ive fixed their errors and also because the game is great.My aim was always to keep this gem alive, i think ive may have succeeded a little bit.
