I adore this game. My first Dungeone siege Game was Dungeon siege II and I can see similar gameplay when I play the first one. First time I played I could see where the second game got their mechanics and while this game has a more simplistic version of the second games levelling system I love it!! My first time playing I found it charming but as I contine to play the charm has turned into respect for the team that made the game and love for the game itself. I might be a little biased to my series as the dungeon sige series was one of my first RPGs but 10/10! !
