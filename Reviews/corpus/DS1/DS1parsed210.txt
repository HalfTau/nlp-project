Okay, this game has no story but well who cares, the gameplay make so much fun, running around slaughtering evil while atmospherical music is playing in the background, the best is the grant range of different spells, weapons and armour, they even go up to levels you will probably never reachThe singleplayer campaign is mostly linear nearly all areas have a buch of sideways but you could just run past them without missing anything, quest are like the story mostly irrelevantThe better map is the multiplayer map can be played in singleplayer if you download the mod, it is basically open world and contains some easter eggsTo sum it up, would cleanse Aranna once again from evil
