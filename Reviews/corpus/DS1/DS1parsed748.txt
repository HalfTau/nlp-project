Lost amongst the many hack and slash games that flooded the post Diablo market, Dungeon Siege deserves your love. Somewhere between Baldurs Gate and Diablo, you will control a party and can pause the action at any time, but loot lust and hacking/slashing abound. There are ways to get multiplayer working on Steam, but even if you are just in it for the single player, its worth the price of admission.
