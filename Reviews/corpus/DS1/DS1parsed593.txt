The classic dungeon crawler lives!  Dungeon Siege remains one of the most dynamic, engaging and complex games in its genre and it plays smoother than ever on Steam.  Do not hesitate on this.  The price is great, even when it isnt on sale, and stands high among modern Dungeon Crawlers like Torchlight 2 and Diablo III.  If you are a fan of the genre, this is a mustplay.Leveling is smooth and effortless, requiring little maintanence, as skills and stats level through use.  You start as a blank slate, and as you use weapons and spells, your stats and your proficiency in those attack types increases automatically, similar to something like modern Elder Scrolls games.  Its a fluid and fun style.  Add to that the strategy element of having AIcontrolled companions fighting alongside you, who can take commands or be set up in formations with proiorities and focuses that you choose based on their stats, with a number of optional playable units to hire from towns and dungeons.This is a fast game, too.  It has all the challenge you would expect from an entry in the genre and encourages exploration and experimentation as you progress through the game.  Do not hesitate to invest in this title.  It is one of the greatest PC games of all time and remains one of my alltime favorite Dungeon Crawlers of all time!
