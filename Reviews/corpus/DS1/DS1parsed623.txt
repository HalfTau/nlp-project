Lovely game, especially for its time! Lots of hours of fun adventuring and dungeons! Though if you try it, get ready for an anticlimactic ending the Steam version has no cutscene after defeating the end enemy, oh and no multiplayer. Still worth playing despite these silly shortcomings. 4.5/5.0 stars for original CD version. 3.0/5.0 stars for Steam version. Enjoy!
