I was happy to see this game againone of my favorites. Unfortunately the game does not do well with Windows 10. Tends to drop you or freeze up, up to a complete restart. You might also end up on the end of the maptheres more territory to get to, but the trail ends  in blank squares to nothingness.Steam has never disappointed me before. I will not abandon such an amazing service over a hiccup in one game thats over a decade old. I only paid 1.99! I dont even want a refund. Steam people, you are the BEST. This game just doesnt work.
