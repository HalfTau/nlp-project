A great game and a wonderfull flash to the past. Nostalgia aside a very good game with awesome gameplay. With a range of different companions along with a purchable mule to slave around your gear. If you like RPGs or if you dont, do yourself a favor and go ahead and buy it.Steam usually does a goood job but they have yet to impress me as they have removed multiplayer along with the DLCMultiplayer Fix  Launch Settings, type zonematchtrue BAM DONE XD
