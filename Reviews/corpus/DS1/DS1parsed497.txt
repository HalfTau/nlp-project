I cannot recommend the game as it does not appear to run properly Win7 64. After spending about 3 hours trying various fixes and compatibility options and running into a multitude of issues including an invisible mouse cursor, missing videos, and crashes at various points but all prior to actually playing the game, I have to say you are better off making a purchase elsewhere.
