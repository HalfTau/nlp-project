I played the demo for this game back when it was launched and thought at the time here is a very good game with good graphics and a different approach to the RPGs. until then, I had not known the Ultima series, and the continuous fighting instead of the turn based was very new to me.Dungeon Siege is a very good game, it has a balanced skill set 3 primary, 4 secondary skills to develop and allows te player to use 8 characters in the same party, resulting in a very good way to balance all the skills between the team.Almost at the end of the single player campaign you have a very strong team that smashes and breaks every enemy that crosses your path.On the bad side, the Steam version does not come with the legends of Aranna expansion, which would be a very good  addition to the games available.All in all, it is a very good game to play once in a while. Really recommended
