Doesnt work. Ive tried literally everything, researching for hours on how to get this thing to work. The farthest Ive gotten to is when youre about to gain control of the player, but then a EXCEPTION DETECTED! box shows up and the game crashes. Im not the only one to have this problem, I actually found almost a dozen forums with people having the same problem. None of them have a solution that worked for me. Youll find a link in some of the other reviews down below. Tried everything in that, didnt work. Disabled Steam overlay, didnt work. Forced it to run in compatibility mode for Windows XP, didnt work. Tried screwing with screen resolutions, didnt work. I have no AV software installed, so thats not intefering. Pretty much tried everything I can think of, didnt work. This game doesnt work. I also bought it foolishly before it was on sale. Thank you Steam, for essentially making me throw seven dollars down the drain.
