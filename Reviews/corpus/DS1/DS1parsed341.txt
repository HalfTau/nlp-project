It is an old but a gold game.Pros Exciting and rich story Lots of items Lots of enemies Nice graphics Considering its release date Cool environment design Long gameplayCons Some elevators are too small to carry all of the team. Controlling all the team is sometimes really difficult.Totaly worths trying.
