8.5/10Somewhere between Baldurs Gate and Diablo lies the awesomeness of Dungeon Siege.This is one of those sadly underrated classics which should be much better known, Give it a good shot and youll see why.Ill be the first to admit that its pretty ugly, even by standards of the time, but thats OK. The story isnt as well executed as BG, but better Than most Dungeon bashers. Voice acting is minimal, but competent, just enough to give a little flavour and highlight major plot points.What you get, though, is A HELL of a dungeon basher, Amazing atmosphere and tension a load of options for selecting your squad and what skills and equipment they take with them, and a horde of enemies more than capable of taking you down if you get sloppy. Watch every step, keep an ear out for ambient sounds which may be clues of a coming ambush, and dont rush in to grab loot unless youre sure your exit is clear!RPG aspects are a bit like the Elder Scrolls series, you get better at what you do most, and the skills that go with that. Eventually your squad will be moulded to your playstyle, although some party members for hire have clear advantages in one field or another.If you like dungeon bashing RPGs and havent tried this one, why not?
