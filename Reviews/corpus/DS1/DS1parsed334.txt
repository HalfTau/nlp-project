I love this game. Its my favorite PC game, period.I highly reccomend this game. BUT I DO NOT reccomend buying it on here if you have Windows 8. Its a waste of money. I I spent a long time trying to figure out how to get it to stop crashing BEFORE even getting to the main menu. Finally I got there but Single Player and Multiplayer are crashing still. Multiplayer crashes before entering the game and single player crashes during the opening scene. Theres 7 bucks Ill never get back. For a game that wont run. Thank you, Steam.
