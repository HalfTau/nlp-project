Dungeon Siege is a great game, but the Steam release is ludicrously hobbled. As a matter of fact, there is no way to bu the expansion pack for this game on Steam... or to really get the game to work correctly at all, as it turns out. I have about 45 minutes logged with this Steam reease and Im honestly wondering how, because I sure as hell cant get it to work.Even if you have an older rig that can run this game, youre better off looking for a boxed copy. Retail price is 6, and I cant recommend it, even for 75 off. Avoid.
