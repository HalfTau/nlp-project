I bought the game for the nostalgia and i thought it would be a nice idea if i could run this on my rig thats way better than my rig 10 years ago.But guess what? It runs. You can start a new game. Just as when the intro starts,  to quote one of my favorite steam curators Youll see a light show of graphical glitches so much youll think its a different indie steam game full of gimmicks then branding it as a game just cause they know how to launch games on steam.If you dont skip the intro cinematics lightshow,  It will crash.If you skip the intro cinematics lightshow,  Its as good as a crash because the lightshow is still there. then it will crash.Dont buy it. A complete waste of money. Youll just be disappointed with Gas Powered Games and Square Enix for being inconsiderate pieces of sh!t who didnt even try to bother to test if their game works on the platform. unplayable.
