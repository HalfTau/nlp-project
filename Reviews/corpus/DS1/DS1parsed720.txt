So, when I bought this product, it was sold as both Dungeon Siege as well as Dungeon Siege Legends of Aranna. That was its base game and one expansion pack for it. For some reason, Steam decided to block access to the Legends of Aranna Content. To top this off, they blocked access to Multiplayer. This again removes more content from this game as the one map is only playable on Multiplayer. Now maybe they blocked multiplayer to keep people from trying to log into Zonematch which its servers went down long ago, but they blocked the whole multiplayer menu, not just zonematch. This means you cant even play this game on a Local Area Network.So, the game has lost more than twothirds of its playability from what it once was. I suggest buying the CDs online from Ebay if you want a proper version of this game.
