Enjoyed many aspects to this game and the graphics held up alright many moons later. The story wasnt the most interesting and the hardest part of the game was figuring out a way to balancing your party as there is limited foes and experience points out there to share once that was figured out, it was fairly easy afterwards with a few challenging parts. The music is very comfy and familiar, the loot was interesting, and the environments as well as enemies were varied and often intriguing. For a game call Dungeon Siege, I cant recall going thru more than a couple of actual dungeons, but I guess Rolling Valley  Swamp Siege doesnt roll off the tongue well. The game didnt seem to have any bugs, though sometimes I had to switch resolutions so it would fit properly, but that might be an OS thing anyway. If you like RPGs with multiple party members you can use simultaneously, you will most likely have a good time. Considering its age, the game is great value at 5 dollars or less.
