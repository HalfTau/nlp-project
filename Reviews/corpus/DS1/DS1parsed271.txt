Dungeon Siege is a classic RPG and I always get nostalgic playing it. When I first played Dungeon Siege I was really taken by the simplicity of the skills mechanic and the fact that once you are in the world there are no loading screens  you just constantly walk through one giant map. Theres not much story to the game, just some serious grindy RPG action with some side quests thrown in for the completionists like myself.One thing I originally liked about the game was that there arent any confusing skill trees, just specialisations and attributes in which you can level up simply by doing things  hitting things with a stick gives you melee skill and mostly strength, while casting spells gives you magic skill and mostly intelligence, etc. This is now the very thing I dislike about the game. While its nice and simple it does kind of make combat slightly boring as you dont have an array of special abilities to manage well, none unless you have a mage. Sure, mages have spells which they can switch between, but only being able to actively switch between two spells without some complicated process and having no autocasts just gets tiresome. I still really love this game, but I think if it werent for the nostalgia I probably wouldnt be enjoying as much as I am today.If you played Dungeon Siege on its initial release and enjoyed it back then, then it might be worthwhile getting for another play through, but if youre new to the series I would recommend skipping over this one and starting with Dungeon Siege II, which has much better gameplay. Now, back to the grindstone.
