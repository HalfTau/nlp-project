Just finished the game. I played it around 10 years ago. This version is unfortunatelly very buggy expecially at the end in Castle EHB. I had to save the game after each battle. After finishing the last boss there is no animation nothing at all. The game simply displays the main menu.Anyway I really enjoyed playing again this title. Good game.
