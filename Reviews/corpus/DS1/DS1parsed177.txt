One of the few realy good point n click / hack n slash rpgs out there.Worth every dime if you enjoy that sort of game.Now im not gonna give a big page of why this game is good. Reason is, one could say my mind is clouded with so much good nostalgia that i cant give a reasonable review about its pros and cons.But being a patron of this game, jumping in and out doing some replays now and then with varieties of mods and siegelets i still cant stop loving this game.Iv played the CD version since i was a teenager and got a way more disturbing amount of hours ingame than displayed on steam, it has stuck to me like a good book you go back to now and then.If you are a Diablo fan or any other PnC/HnS rpg fan i strongly recommend you play this one out.
