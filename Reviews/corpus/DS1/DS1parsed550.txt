Awesome old school rpg , best part is that the steam version is windows 7 compatible  unlike my old cd copy which kept telling me that win 7 hated running it .The price at the moment is pretty good too , at only 7.00 ,Heaps of quests to under take , the option to choose who you want in your party during the game makes this a must have for old school gamers and new comers too .What more can i say about this game lol .... except just go out and buy it ,
