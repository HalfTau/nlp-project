Game does not work, gets to create character screen and freezes every time.  I have a new system and windows 10.  Im not interested in troubleshooting anymore.  Im so tired of buying old games on Steam that always have some kind of compatability problem with new systems and newer versions of Windows, and require a ton of research and tweaking just to run.  Im just going to ask Steam for a refund and sigh heavily... again.
