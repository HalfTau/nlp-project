As far as mindless dungeon crawlers go, this is probably one of the better ones although it does show its age a fair bit since its release back in 2002 graphicswise, the A.I. and the games interface isnt exactly optimal. The story isnt very compelling and isnt really there at all per se. But if you like dungeon crawling this is the game for you. I play mostly out of nostalgia.6/10 Its alright.And if you are running Windows 7, be prepared to troubleshoot because this game does have trouble running in the newer systems, not a performance issue, but just getting it to run. That being said it is fairly simple and getting it to work shouldnt be too much of an issue for most.Edit Library  Dungeon Siege  Right Click  Properties  Launch Options width1280 height720 fullscreentrue vsyncfalse maxfps60 bltonlytrueFor those wishing to play in 1920 x 1080 just change the numbers but be warned that the UI gets really small and unless you have a giant screen, eagleeye vision or the screen 35 inches away from your face youll have a hard time seeing anything.And the number of hours Ive actually played is closer to 250300ish. A lot of idle time and many different characters.
