If it werent for the persistent glitch that doesnt alllow me to backtrack because it traps me when I push forward in my game, I would have happily finished with epicness at every turn! I had it all figured out too and I also knew where to farm money and epic items! Oh well... thats not the games fault though. For what its worth, I would still recommend this game to everyone just dont run it in a high tech computer haha Now Im amped to play the sequel, which was actually the first game I played that was Dungeon Siege!
