I finished this game years ago along with the expansion legends of aranna which seems to be missing on steam... I got this game in a bundle when purchasing DS 1 2 and 3. Anyway for a quick review about this gameStory       5/10   I mean cmon a farmer suddenly becomes a warrior and a mage 1 min after some random old man dies..Music      8/10   Very good music IMO, somewhat memorableSound      6/10  Sound effects are okGraphics  8/10  Not bad at all I imagine at the time they were top notchControls   6/10  The controls are frustrating at times and chars do not respond too wellGameplay  5/10  The gameplay is what makes this game so frustrating the mecahnics are kinda broken, thing that gets fixed in its sequelFinal score 6.3  Not a horrible game but not good enough to be remembered, it hasnt aged well either. I will recommend  it anyway but only to hardcore fans of dungeon crawlers. Also the expansion if you somehow manage to get it Legends of Aranna it doesnt add anything new to the table except for some useless pets.
