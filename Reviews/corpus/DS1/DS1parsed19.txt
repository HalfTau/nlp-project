I played the game over two years, on and off. In general, it was worth it. There are some points that will annoy any player, but its up to you to decide.If you like RPGs, especially the old style, go ahead. It will take hours to end and you might feel dissapointed, but, hey, you just went through another game. My comments for your benefit1. Unlimited world concept Go back and forth, no stage logic not open world like Skyrim, game is still linear. Graphics are also pretty good, given the time of desing. You will enjoy playing in the world of Ehb.2. Leveling up system according to your play style, no class logic that limits your player and the weapons/armor you use3. Up to 8 people in your party, including mules that can carry all the loot you find4. Merchants placed in key areas, so you can buy/sell5. Decent battle techniques and camera controls. Nothing fancy but if you zoom in you can enjoy the battle contains spoilers, hover mouse to view2. Unlimited supply of potions makes any fight easier. I had 2 mules packed with healing potions, I could have killed the boss and his family.3.. My first RPG was Baldurs Gate and I remember I was caught up in the mythos of the game given, I was 20 years younger, but still...4. If you dare multiclass your hero, he will never get to use the topnotch weapons/armor. Stick to one weapon use only. Othewise, the limitation from the requirements makes the good gear unusable.5.. You kill an imp, then 5 levels up you kill a bigger imp. Though it has unlimited monsters, many different kinds, it felt like a chore after a while. I was just moving and killing, moving and killing, like I need to clear a field from weeds. No story why the monsters are there or what their role is. A huge map filled with thousands of monsters, thats all.
