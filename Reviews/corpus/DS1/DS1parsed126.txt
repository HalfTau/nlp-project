I played Dungeon Siege as a kid but I could never finished the Game.So Ive got it for under 2 bucks on Steam Summer Sale and finally 15 years later beat the Game.The story is almost nonexistent and the graphics are heavily outdated.Its a mix of classic HackSlay Diablo and some of Baldurs Gate Tactical mode Gameplay.No teleporters here or other travel options , it goes straight forward or you have to go backif you need to sell / buy your stuff. Very oldschool And maybe annoying for some players.Soundtrack is good, something reminds of Neverwinter Nights.You should not expect a Titan Quest , Grim Dawn or anything like that.It has its own charm. Maybe you have to grow up with that Game But for me it was a great nostalgia trip.
