Game keeps crashing... Too many incompatability issues... Despite trying everything Ive found on google...Why are you selling games that arent working Steam?Had it not been for this being in a pack with Dungeon Siege II Which also has issues, and MULTIPLAYER disabled!And being in a pack with DS 3  Expansion...Id be getting a full REFUND.Im still thinking about getting a refund to be honest... I feel somewhat ripped off.Firstly Why take multiplayer OUT of a game? If it doesnt work, make it work!Im having to play multiplayer on DS 2 through GameRanger using a NONSteam version of the game...Getting rather fed up and frustrated with steam to be honest...Selling games that dont work , ripping out multiplayer on some of the best games...Why?
