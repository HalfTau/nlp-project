Great hack and slash game which I recommend despite its age.Two downsides It gets a little boring at the end if you try to explore all the areas to their fullest every corners of the map as there are some areas that are huge when you detour from the main path although there is usually something there to be explored such as a cave/chest/etc. The ending cutscene does not load on this steam version so you cannot loot the last boss after killing it. This is a common issue and I have tried a few suggestions from steam forum with no success5 starts for the game3.5 for the steam version because of the ending issue I know, 1.5 stars because of a small issue but for me it completely ruined that completion feeling
