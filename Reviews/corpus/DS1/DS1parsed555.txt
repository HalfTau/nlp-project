sighA decade ago, I played this game so much my grades in high school suffered.When I saw that the game was on steam, I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to relive the memories of this excellent game.I bought the game. I just didnt GET the game.The game would probably run, if it werent for crippling compatibility issues that result in random crashing. However, Steam, in their infinit wizdom, DISABLED THE MULTIPLAYER ENTIRELY. Seriously. Main menu. Click Multiplayer. Youre greeted with an ugly not skinned at all and rude dialog box that simply says DISABLED. Thats it. Nothing.I bought this game as part of a bundle with Dungeon Siege 2, and Dungeon Siege 3.Dungeon Siege 2 multiplayer is ALSO DISABLED, and Dungeon Siege 3 isnt even a DS game, in my opinion. It might have done better if they gave it a different name and didnt try to step in the footsteps of such a great franchise.Seriously, I wish Steam would have just let this entire franchise of games rest in peace. I honestly would take my money back and return these if that were an option. I feel like I did not get what I paid for.
