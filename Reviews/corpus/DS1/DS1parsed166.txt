This is a fun dungeon crawl game.  Reminded me a bit of baldurs gate but felt faster paced which I enjoyed.I didnt finish it but I dont think that should be a stain on its record  it entertained me for about 15 hours and what more can I ask of a game.I liked it.  If you classic PC RPGS you might too.  Check it out.
