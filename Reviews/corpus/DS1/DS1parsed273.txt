Bought it for nostalgia. That lasted about 10 to 15 minutes in the game. I mean, I loved it back then but its almost 2017 now and some things... well, should be remembered only. There are many games that age well and even being 20 years old can be picked up and have fun with. Dungeon Siege, is sadly not one of them.
