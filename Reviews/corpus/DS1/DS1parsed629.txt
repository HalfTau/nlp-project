Someone made a review about this game saying that its not playable due to the graphics being a little outdated. Some classic games arent played because of their graphics, they made sucess back in 2003 because they were innovative and the story and gameplay were satisfying. Im not talking only about Dungeon Siege.. Prince of Persia the Trilogy is another exemple of a classic game with relatively bad graphics compared to nowadays. That doesnt make a game bad though. Im sure that if you havent played a master piece like Dungeon Siege back in the release year, if you give a real try ull see what Im all about here.Everything in this game is good, specially the soundtrack, which is amazing!
