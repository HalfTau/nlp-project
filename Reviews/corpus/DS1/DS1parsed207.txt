When asked what is the best Isometric RPG Dungeon Crawler game is, most people would say the Diablo series Diable II to be more specific. But for me, my first steps into the DiabloClone genre was this game and I immediately fell in love. I beat the game over a day and half of playing at a friends house on his PC and couldnt get enough.
