This game is not recommended if you have not played it prior to its release. Most people, like myself, buy this only for the nostalgia and amazing gameplay. However, Steam has made it almost impossible to play, without the community, you could only dream to get hands on this amazing architecture of a game. It still brings the joy from old days, though, Once you get it up and running.
