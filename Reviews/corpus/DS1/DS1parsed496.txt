Dungeon Siege works perfectly under Windows 10 on an Ultra HD 4K TV with the most recent Nov 2015 NVIDIA driver update.Dungeon Siege including the expansion provides many hours of gameplay.  The quest line is linear and there are occasional puzzles to be solved.  The gameplay is solid and the game is fun to play.  Keeping the multiple party members together can get a bit tricky at times especially in areas with lifts or moving platforms, but is something the player will get used to micromanaging.Great to be able to play this timeless classic on the latest hardware so many years after initial release.Spent 20 hours lost in Glitterdelve Mine.  Would gladly get lost there again.  I am one of those hardcore gamers that refuse to consult walkthroughs ... and boy does this game make me wish I was more reddit friendly!  LOLRating 9.5 / 10
