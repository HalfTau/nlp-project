I love this game. Seriously, its one of my all time favorites but I cannot recommend this to anyone who owns a Windows 8.1 computer and is feeling nostalgic to revisit this beautiful world again because you cant. Its not compatible with Windows 8.1 and Im pretty upset that Steam didnt put a huge disclaimer in the product description about compatability issues because I just spent real money on a game that doesnt work.NOT HAPPY
