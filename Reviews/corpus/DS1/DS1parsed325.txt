Great Diablostyle game, had a ton of fun playing it coop. By default, the Steam version has multiplayer disabled, and doesnt have the expansion Legends Of Aranna which is why Ive downvoted it.Both of these problems can be fixed though, for the full game, playable online, in any version of Windows including 8 or 10.The following are exerpts from Steam user Killahs messy guide hereDownload as ZIP the DS1 Steam Fix 600MBand just overwrite your DS1 directory atSteamsteamappscommonDungeon Siege 1I didnt need to use the registry fix, but YMMV.In your Steam Library, find Dungeon SiegeRight click / Properties / Set Launch Options...put in the following line, using your preferred screen resolutionwidth1920 height1080 fullscreentrue vsyncfalse maxfps60 bltonlytrueOnce you get past the menus ingame, it will warn you about the resolution, but just click ok and ignore it.In order to play multiplayer, you simply need to be able to connect all the players. If you have your network properly setup, you dont need to do anything but internet/host and give the other players your IP. If not, there are tools like Hamachi, Tunngle, and GameRanger available.If the game is not functioning correctly in Windows 8, 10, etc, standard troubleshooting applies, but it definitely works in those OSes without any special tools.The optional bonus pack includeslots of art/manuals/etcDS1 Tool KitSiege EditorDS Stat CalculatorThese Mods Yoodiv has not used mostCircle of Lorent recommended by YoodivAllysiumArcher ModAtomic FXBounty HunterDeath SpiritDSRevivedDownload through your browser hereI have a similar review/guide for DS2 with expansion in multiplayer here
