The game is mechanically clunky. Im not too hard on games that are dated they tended to be fairly unpolished by modern standards. However, what I didnt understand or enjoy was how monotonous each level of the game felt. Maps just went on and on. Some maps are just one giant room filled with the same creatures over, and over. Simply said, I was bored, and thats not something a game ever should illicit in you, no matter the age of the game.I didnt even get to the other issues the game had, namely the disabled expansion. I cant bring myself to mindlessly crawl through the same area any longer. There are too many other games to play that arent as mind numbingly stupid.
