This game as well as its first sequel are classics of their genre. As it is, as sold by Steam, I would not suggest purchasing the game. I played all the way through and what youre getting here is the bare minimum version of the game. Its bugged as it is, and while some glitches can be worked around with enough knowledge and personal tweaking, there are some things, like the missing ending video files after fighting the last boss that prevents you from obtaining his loot, and thelack of access to multiplayer that dampers just about the whole experience. It was fun while it lasted, but theres a better version of the game out there. Also, by default, no Legends of Aranna. Stick to the real deal. Again, I recommend this game and the first sequel, just not the way its sold here, even if it is dirt cheap right now. Well, you get what you pay for I suppose.
