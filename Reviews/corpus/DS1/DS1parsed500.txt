probably in the wrong place.. but if possible could someone comment on my review and explain how to get rid of the color texture chopping? ive tried compatibility mode on 8.1, 7, xp, vista. ive tried all the resolutions, horrible graphics, best graphics, searching the web, and nothing works, but since ppl are reviewing it and have game time i know its possible, thanks in advance ps. will delete this when its resolved and post another review with my actual thoughts on the game along with the found solution and credit to the answerer
