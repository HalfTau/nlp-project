Graphics Siege  The War Against WindowsThis is potentially a great game, however, it doesnt work for many people with later versions of Windows esp 8.1 and the multiplayer is currently disabled. Added to that is the fact that the game is unsupported outside of the community, and you end up with a real risky purchase. Id say just look elsewhere until the game is reliably working unless you happen to have an older computer / OS.
