Good solid game with a nice soundtrack, offers interesting combat/encounters a unusually big party with up to 8 members that you can customize with various random loot and spells that drop, only negative aspects i found are that in some areas the camera controls are clumsy and the overall story isnt flashed out enough, coming to a unsatisfying conclusion.
