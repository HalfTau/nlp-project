Why isnt the 1.50 version with Legends of Aranna available on Steam from the beginning? It fixes a number of issues the base game including improved itemization and more reactive AI.If it wasnt for a guide telling you to activate the LoA expansion Id be hard pressed to really recommend the game because of those issues.Granted the camera is still awful, even worse in the LoA campaign but its almost a minor issue compared to the things that it fixes or improves.
