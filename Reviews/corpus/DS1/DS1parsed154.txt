I like the game. Theres lots of enemies to fight and loot to get. Seems like just when you and your party members have full inventories you find a merchant to sell all your stuff.Not really finding anything worth spending all that hard earned money on though.The game is not open world and you do follow a certain path with a few minor offshoots.BUT... although i dont recall any bugs or any issues early on in the game Ive come across quit a few in later chapters, starting around Chapter 5. In Chapter 5 and 6 the levels fail to load completely some of the time and that wrecks your progress as you cant save or anything. Sometimes the game will lock up with a Fatal Exception Error while saving, or just lock up your computer. Forcing you to have to restart the from your last saved point. Has made me save a lot more often than I normally would.Not sure how many chapters there are or if this will continue... but up to this point, I liked the game.Im going to give this a thumbs up... but buyer beware of possible glitches later on in the game.Im using Windows 10 64bit.
