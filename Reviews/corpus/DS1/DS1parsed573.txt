The old classic Dungeon Siege from the old times. This was one of the best action RPG series out there for its time. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are nice at least for its time and there is a variety of options for you to adjust. The AI adjustment is great for the character and the party members, and it allows you to set them up so that they either only do exactly what you tell them to do and nothing else, or set it up to engage enemies automatically or to stay in formation, no matter what.The skill system and leveling is simple. By swinging a melee you get STRength and your melee skills increase. Casting spells combat and nature magic schools gives you INTelligence. Using ranged weapons gives you DEXterity. You can also play as a jack of all trades or specialise in one or two things.The potions only use the amount of healing or mana you need, and the remaining HP/MP in the potion is kept for later use. You can also combine contents of halfempty potions. This was a great thing back then, and it is still a very unique way to handle it.The multiplayer used to be very good, with netcode being able to stay in perfect sync between players. Not sure how it works these days as the directplay functionality may not be so good anymore. But if you can use Hamachi or something similar you should be able to set up a game with relative ease.When I tried this on Windows 7, I couldnt get it to work. The game runs on Windows 10, but can crash occasionally so if you decide to play this game, save often!If you can find all the workarounds anf get it to work, then this is one of the best action RPGs of its time, and well worth grabbing on a sale.
