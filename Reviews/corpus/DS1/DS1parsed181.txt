Runs fine on a Windows 10 64x Rig.Naturally there are a few minor tweeks to do before starting your game, but this take nolonger than five minutes to do.Ive finished the game without any crash2desktop moments, and even have it installed on a windows 10 86x machine with crappy intergrated GFX. it has crashed on the 86x machine, but this is most likely down to bad hardware, not the game.10/10 still lives up to the nostalgia, and still very playable.
