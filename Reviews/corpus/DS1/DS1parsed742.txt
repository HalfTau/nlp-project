Just realized I had this and Im going to go play it later.Dungeon Siege is the most playable Diablo clone out there. It was made before the consolization frenzy, but its not so old that the graphics make it hard to play.What I love about it is the lack of character classes. In that respect, it is as sandboxy as Elder Scrolls. You gain skill by doing things, which allows you to do them better and equip better equipment. This is the best possible way for an RPG to work and I dont understand why more developers dont do it this way.Speaking of sandboxy, play multiplayer by yourself. Total sandbox with no quests. Very cool. I got lost in a mine for a week. It was awesome.I havent played DS1 recently enough to comment on controls or sound, but I dont recall having issue with either of them.So I give Dungeon Siege an A. Its my favorite of the franchise.
