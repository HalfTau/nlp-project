First go into the file directory and change the compatability mode to Windows XPI loved this game when it was new before I had Steam and continue to play it from time to time.  I admit I prefer the Cat Mansion mod, but even without that its a very good example of the genre.Automated attack allows a casual aspect and control of up to 6 characters allows for playing around with character development.  The story is pretty straight forward and theres not much descision making, but, if one were suficiently dedicated, there is an editor that could be used to create whatever plot line and world archetcture desired.The game is dated and doesnt always run on modern systems thus the compatibility mode suggestion and it barrowed heavily from Diablo for equipment style.  That said, it was a great game in its time.  Fully modable, seamless area transitions, multiple characters, side quests, network play the game had LOTs of potential.It has its flaws.  It easily could have been more dynamic with both story and NPC interaction.  The lack of a more open world or respawning monsters made progression limited, but again, the editor allowed for all of that.  I suppose the game itself could have been more fully developed by the developer, but at the time the focus was on encouraging an active modding community which was a true novelty when the game was released.Ultimately its the casual control style that keeps me coming back to this one.  This game is fun to play.
