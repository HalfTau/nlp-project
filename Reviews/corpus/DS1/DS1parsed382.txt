When the game will stop erroring out on my laptop, I will write a good review. I exceed all of the requirements to run the game, i can go through the entire main menu, the whole character generation, then when i get into the introductory video, it says there is an exception detected, makes me wait 3 minutes, then says Dungeon siege has stopped working. Steam, please let me play the game of my childhood ,
