Square Enix and Gas Powered Games should be ashamed of themselves for attempting to sell this game. The entire thing is glitched and not compatable with newer windows systems. This should have a disclaimer that it is NOT compatible with windows 10. This is a shame because I am sure I would enjoy this game a great deal.
