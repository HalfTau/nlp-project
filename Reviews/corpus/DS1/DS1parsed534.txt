Rather dissapointed.I bought the dungeon siege complete set, as I have a great appreciation for rpgs, especially ones like this. When dungeon siege finished downloading, I started it up and immediately a little box came up saying that the program may have some compatability issues. I clicked ok and started the game. I created a character, selected my difficulty and started my epic journey. Except I dont think the epic journey was composed of large grey and neon colored triangles. The game seems to be incompatible with my computer, something I discovered after I purchased it. I can see nothing except these large streaks and triangles of rapidly changing colors. I am apparently not the only one with this problem. I have searched everywhere, and I cannot find anything that works. I am more dissapointed with steam than anything else, however, because of the fact that they would sell a game which has been complained about not working, and then not even offer a buyback. I even found the original copy of the game off steam, which still did not work.The final verdict Do not buy if you do not have the exact specifics listed, or unless you somehow know that it will work.
