The game is broken. It literally does not work. Graphics problems that have 18 different possible solutions none of which worked for me and a complete and utter lack of response to this issue even though it is well known. They literally are just trying to take your money.Edit on a different PC the graphics problems do not exist. I will not post spec, if you really care then PM me.That being said, the multiplayer is completely disabled. Which again, would have been a deal breaker. Square Enix used to command my respect. Now I walk away from any game that has their name in the title. Yes, i am that mad over what I consider a theft.Edit 2 Except classic kingdom hearts. Thatstill rocks my socks to this day.
