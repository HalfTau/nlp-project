TLDRDungeon Siege Steam Version is a wonderful polished RPG dungeon crawler but the Steam version is severely hobbled and buggy.THE GOODThis is a wonderful fun game, classic Chris Carter.  It lets you control up to 8 characters in a party with an elegantly simple control scheme.  The environments are superb.Accursed Farms does an excellent review of this game on YoutubeTHE BAD AND THE UGLYLike so many games from the 20002010 era, this steam version has fits with modern 64 bit OSs like Win 10.  Before you buy any of these games, even on sale, check out the discussion forums on Steam for the game, and look for posts about getting the game to actually work under Win 7 or 10.  Graphics tend to be limited to fixed sizes like 800x600 and are resistant to resizing to modern 16 by 9 screen dimensions.  Steam also strips out things like expansion content that eventually became part of the standard game package.  Finally replayability is limited due to the Steam version not being compatible with the original retail versions upon which most mods, modding tools, conversions and player created content are based.
