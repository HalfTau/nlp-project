Graphics are a bit dated but do not detract from the experience.Voice acting a bit cringeworthy at times.Gameplay is fun and absorbing, dungeons give literal meaning to the term dungeon crawling with ability to control up to 8 party members, including mules to carry extra loot.Soundtrack generally excellent with music from Jeremy Soule composed for Guild Wars/GW2 among other games.Story is quite simplistic.Overall the game is fun and kept me playing until the end.Do yourself a favour and buy this game, and before playing go to the community page and read through Killahs guide on how to enable the EXPANSION as well as MULTIPLAYER.Yes the game did crash for me several times, ensure you quicksave often. No bugs encountered during my playthrough.6.57/10
