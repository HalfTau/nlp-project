Those who pretend some Steam version can be downloaded with Legend of Aranna included are pure liars. Its illegal content to update Steam version with cracked nocd version. Square Enix dont own rights about DS1  DS2 addons. you must replace your exe files to anothers at your own risk some guides owners add you as friend, help you to solve all problems about DSLOA install but when its end, come to beg you for free gift game. NEVER TRUST ANY GIFT. Unfriend these swindlers immediatly because real friend never ask to you something just to help you.V EVALUATION Even if this Steam version doesnt include Legend of Aranna, i must admit i take pleasure to play it because iam real fan of this serie i talk about DS1  DS2, DS3 is only pure joke and wont be DS game.Good easy realtime HacknSlash without need of gear optimization to play it 4 classes to play  Warrior meleeshield, Archer ranged, Mage natural or war autoleveling stats depending on which weapons you use, on each up you gain major xp on your main stat depending on weapon your use and full regen HP/mana, on each fight round you receive short xp to increase stas  skills. progressive difficulty some hidden areas to discoverBad no tp to city/merchants to sell junk, you must use spell to convert junk or play game as roguelike getting only essential no shared stash to share your items between characters multiplayer no mobs respawm in solo game you must play with limited XP  loots no world quest saved in multiplayer when you quit game, you loose all current quest activated, but it seem possible to do quests each time you log in mage classes are pain to play due to lack of active spell slots only normal difficulty mode missing content  broken endgame.Buy it only when discounted price like 75 off or less.To be continued iam currently testing Steam version fully, ill update later my evaluation...
