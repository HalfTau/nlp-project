the game runs fine on Win7! i have seen no glitches so far, i am only short into the game but none of this crap that others have mentioned being this early in the game. as for the multiplayer, that has been shut down for years, Zonematch shut down around 2006, steam had nothing to do with it, they dont own the rights to simply give you multiplayer to a dead service. im curtrently running it on a win 7 64bit with a nvidia geforce GTX 750 Ti and it runs beautifully. my thoughts would be they screwed up the installation. the good reviews you find about the game i do agree with those. i just wanted to let you all know that it works on win7 and why there is no multiplayer.
