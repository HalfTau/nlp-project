I love Dungeon Siege. Plain as that. Dungeon Siege was one of the first games I ever played and it has caused me to fall in love with RPGs forever. I have played this game countless times before it was on Steam and I genuinely wish I could go back and play it again. This is an amazing RPG. It is very linear, so you dont have much of an ability to explore, but the story shows you anything you could hope to see in the world.8/10
