I absolutely love this game, but why on earth have Valve not included LoA? Or BW for DS 1/2? The only reason I brought the complete pack was because it was supposed to be complete in my opinion youre better off buying it from some where that actually includes the ENTIRE game, even more so for the fact that LoA is basically needed to complete the DS 1 story /So I would suggest this game to anyone who loves old RPGs or just RPGs in general, this is a fantastic game along with DS 2 but I personally wouldnt buy it off steam as you dont actually get either expansion for DS 1 or 2, so go to GoG or somewhere similar that sells this  expansion and buy it from there!EDIT The only way to activate the expansions is to follow this guideall credit goes to Killah as hes the one that figured it out, Im still leaving my review as negative but thats a negative on valves part as they should include the expansions, the games are faningtastic!
