I wanted to go through the dungeon siege serie, starting with this one, but... I stopped after Stonebridge.Game mechanics is old, graphics, while acceptable, are really outdated, and the story is quite hard to follow. Its just about pointclick.Personalisation of character is not developed based on a usage system, the more you do something, the better you become, quite logic but it doesnt offer more than stats.Rating 7/20  dungeon siege 2 seems to be more interesting, and as there is no link between the 2, better off starting directly there.
