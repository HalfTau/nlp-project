I usually do not leave negative reviews for anything and try to see something positive in every product I buy. But with this game, I cant help it.The game tries to be a partybased Diablo, but it fails miserably at it. The combat is very simplistic leftclick, wait for the enemies to die, move on and makes Diablo feel like a game of chess. The leveling system is one of the most boring ones Ive ever seen your 3 stats and 4 skills grow naturally as you fight or cast spells, and all they do is allow you to use new spells and slightly increase your chance to hit  no active abilities, no auras, nothing. The level design is atrocious you are going to fight the same copypasted groups of enemies for an hour in a long location consisting of copypasted corridors, then move to another similar location, and so on. The story is nearly nonexistent, the lore entries are very scarce and dont give you much information about the world. All the characters are very forgettable, and the companions never say anything beyond the few lines the first time you meet them.Overall, this game feels like a techdemo for a decent engine that was sloppily put together by a bunch of programmers under extremely strict time constraints. It is probably the most generic and forgettable game Ive ever played.I will give the game credit for its visuals pretty good for its time, music and certain technological innovations. Jeremy Soule did an amazing job, as always, and you will recognize the musical style from Morrowind, Neverwinter Nights, KotoR, etc. I, however, dont think music and visuals can make up for the lack of... well, game.P. S. The Steam version doesnt include the Legends of Aranna expansion. You can easily download and install it, thanks for this amazing guide
