This game is the essence of hack n slash. That is literally all you do. It gets very tedious, very quick. Granted, the graphics are very nice for its time and I enjoy them very much. Much of the scenery is very inspired and you can tell they took the time to make it very detailed.That being said, the maps are beyond huge. Its so easy to get lost and it can get very frustrating, quick. If all you want to do is hack n slash. This is definitely for you. The party concept of this game is awesome! You can have 7 people total in your party including a pack mule to carry all of your inventory which is very convenient. You have 3 main skills, Strength, Dexterity and Intelligent. Swordsman, Bows and Spells.I played roughly 46 hours total and got to chapter 4 out of 9 chapters. I also killed and explored EVERY bit of area as I worked my way towards 5, but its just..so tedious. Honestly, its fun for what it is and Im hoping to finish it one day, but no rush. Lastly, the story is fine. Its pretty interesting and the side quests are fun, even though they are just done along the way. The only problem is again, the maps are so insanely huge you might skip it and not even know. Problem with that? No fast travel and if youre a 100 kinda guy. You will be gritting your teeth on the way back from Chp. back to 1.
