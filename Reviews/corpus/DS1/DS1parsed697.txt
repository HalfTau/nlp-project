HOLY SHT, this game is focking AMAZING! was pretty much my initial reaction to Dungeon Siege when my best friend showed it to me someteen years ago, and that reaction hasnt faded ever since. Dungeon Siege is to roleplaying/combatadventure games as RoboCop is to, well... movies, basically. It took the world by storm, and sure, not many might acknowledge it these days, but its still one of those permanent milestones which just smacked you raw with how great it was and still is, even compared to modern crap. Hell, even being threatened by two horribly shtty excuses for sequels didnt ruin either of em. Hell naw! They just kept on truckin, and everybody with any brains knew this the original one is the best one. Nuff said. 9.5/10
