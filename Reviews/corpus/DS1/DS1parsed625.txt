Having played through DS1/2 before a few years ago, I got this as part of a package deal DS1,2,3 and didnt notice that it didnt include all the DLC/xpacs. The game itself looks pretty horrible on modern hardware.IMHO if youre going to play Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, you play it with all the DLC/xpacs. Even more so if youre going to play it in multiplayer, which simply doesnt work as is in the STEAM version.If anything, they probably bundled this to get people into buying DS3, which is nothing like Dungeon Siege 1 or 2.
