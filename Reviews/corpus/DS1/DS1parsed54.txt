This has always been one of the most adventureinspiring games out there. With a large open world and tons of content to explore, an open class system thats brilliant before its years, Dungeon Siege tends to receive far less praise than it deserves. Particularly because of the unnecessary tinkering that has been done with it get it on Steam. Multiplayer, in the days that it was available, was a masterstroke and a great feature of the game, and although you cannot import an entire party into a multiplayer game that you can none the less play on your own, its recommended to employ the workaround to do this because it just adds to the hours of replayvalue and the challenge involved.RPGs of this day and age are of course technically superior in every way to this game. Look at its successor Dungeon Siege 2, that improves upon virtually every aspect of the game. You can tell, however, that Dungeon Siege was a developers teams dream brought to life and they are very proud of it, despite the monetary adversity they faced during its production The Chris Taylor interview about Dungeon Siege, particularly the bit about Apple as an investor is definitely worth a listen.Despite its aging geometry, lowresolution textures and poor UI scaling to high resolutions when applied to this day and age, and despite the alternative games that I play just as well, I keep coming back to this title at least once every two years for a full playthrough of the story.
