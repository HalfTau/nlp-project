Oh boy, the memories. I still have my copy of Dungeon Siege and Legends of Aranna lying around here somewhere. This game is a classic, and years after I had stopped playing because I had actually overplayed it and worn out my interest in it, its still fun. Only now, I have all three of them and get to see whats new in the more recent editions.
