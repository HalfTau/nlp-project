Bought the 3pack Dungeon Siege I, II, and III, and decided to play through them.  Dungeon Siege 1 is old.  It came out in 2002, and the graphics are reflective of its age.  The gameplay itself is amazing however, its a great RPG from days long past, and the ability to have up to eight party members was actually a breath of fresh air.  There are some definite balance issues, especially with how effective mass melee is.  Still, it provided a great atmosphere and RPG experience, with fun leveling mechanics.  The ability to change characters are you go is actually fun, although it felt like specialization was almost always superior.  The loot system had a few flaws, but overall was great.It begins rather slow, and the first level farm  forest levels felt rather tedious.  After you begin to immerse yourself, the experience takens on a better form.  It feels almost liek Baldurs Gate, with a bit less character and world building.  For its time, I think it was an incredible game, and I wish I would have played it back then, I think I would have found it amazing.  Despite that, I think if you are a fan of RPGs, this is a fun Action RTS with minor questing.  Some of the quests are more difficult, but in general its focused entirely on the action and the character building.  While some later battles do require micromanagement, the game itself its very long or difficult.I played on medium difficulty and finished the game in 14 hours, while taking a leisurely pace.  Recommended for fans of RPGs, especially older ones.  Aside from that, DS1 probably  wont be your cup of tea.
