One of my absolute favorite old school isometric PC RPGs, and its also one of the first games I played on my first real gaming PC. I somehow actually stilll have the intact box and CDs sitting around in storage somewhere.You control up to eight characters at once, including a pack mule to act as extra inventory space. Characters can be specialized in a few ways, with two different schools of magic, ranged, or melee attacks. If you are feeling saucy, you can combine and make a hybrid class, such as a spellsword or some kind of other variant. You can succeed with nearly any party combination, so there isnt much pressure to min/mix the perfect party combination.Combat is very microheavy, with lots of little subtle things needed to keep your party fighting in top shape. Although the game starts slow, youll very quickly end up with a party of four to six characters and youll be slashing through huge parties of monsters. Youll need to pay attention to what spells are being cast, positioning of your characters, and more its very consuming and very satisfying when you get through an encounter unscathed.With a modern eye, though, there are a lot of rough parts to the game. Camera control is a pain, and controlling your party can get really overwhelming when you have a ton of characters. With casters, it can be clunky to switch between spells in combat. I really enjoyed this game and I still enjoy it to this day, but it might be hard to get for someone who didnt play it back in the day.
