Never knew what this was, got it pretty cheap and thought Eh might aswell try it. I absolutely love it, its great, even for such an old game where i have trouble keeping track of where i need to go, it entertained me highly. Sadly because there is some confusion about what i need to do and the rather repetitive gameplay i stopped playing and never actually finished the game. Still a good game though. Overall a good 7/10 Id say.
