Dungeon Siege is a pretty solid Action RPG in the vein of Diablo. Although it requires some coaxing to get functional on a modern OS it has aged remarkably well and mainly only suffers from somewhat wonky controls which get worse when youve more party members to manage, a rather awkward camera, and some exception crashes though in my case that last one plagued the bandit cave area so horribly that it effectively ended my campaign, so your mileage may vary.The graphics are still pretty passable and in some cases still quite beautiful, no complaints aside from character display UI issues in the inventory screen probably caused by playing on a higher resolution than the game was designed for. Throughout the game, a fairly dark, earthy theme is mostoften employed.The game features an excellent, genreappropriate, soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule ,,... but has some weird sound effects issues wherein an item drop sound may play when no items are dropped. Some basic, often unconvincing, voice acting is employed for important characters.A pretty standard fantasy storyline that doesnt really stand out in any way, although its not unbearable, it is very linear and can get boring pretty quickly, making it hard to play for extended periods of time. Characters are very basic, as seems very common amongst Action RPGs.
