Dungeon Siege was a great hack nslash dungeon crawler RPG when it was released and the mechanics are still solid even today, although the graphics have dated poorly.The reason I do not recommend is that it is unplayable via steam and does not include the expansion pack Legends of Aranna.There are a few guides that purport to help you run the game via the steam installation and although Ive spent numerous hours following them to the T and reinstalling the game, it still does not work on Windows 8.1. The hour Ive spent playing was logging into the game on multiple occasions to see if it would workIf possible try and get the original digital discs or make isos of your original discs and play the game that way not via the steam copy.
