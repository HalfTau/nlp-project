Bear with me while I get all tearyeyed while describing this game.This here is my childhood, one of the first PC games I played and loved, and still play from time to time.Its old, so it looks old, and you might have problems with running it in modern resolutions..Matter of fact you might have problems running it at all, but luckily a lot of people are passionate about this and I have found fixes and workarounds.And when you finally do manage to run it, oh boy..This might be my nostalgia speaking, but I rarely find myself as immersed as when playing this game.The music is epic, composed by Jeremy Soule, who has worked on the TES series, Warhammer games, Starwars games etc.Its not complicated, you have a clear path to follow, some side areas and secrets and side quests.Combat is simple, mostly just click and forget and not die. Its beautiful.Voice acting is sparse, at times amazing, at times not so amazing.Oh and it is quite a lenghty game, so you get your moneys worth.If you are a person who likes to explore old games, this is definitetely worth your time.
