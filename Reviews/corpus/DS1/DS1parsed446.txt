Initially I was having a blast with the game, but It feels too dragged out. Its taking to long to get to the next story section to hold my interest and the gameplay mechanics, while solid, are nothing to write home about. The equipment is rather boring and the limit to 2 spells for mages is awful. Its also strange to see stregth requirments for archers which means you will have to give them melee weapons for a bit to get their stregth up.Maybe if I didnt have so many options in terms of other games I can play I would push through to beat it, but its getting harder and harder to launch the game because it feels like a huge slog. It takes hours to get to the next story section and even then, the story isnt even that interesting.It was interesting to expirence this game Ive only ever played a few hours of DS3 which is hugely different and it was fun for the first 5 or 6 hours, but I just cant push myself to finish. I am really hoping DS2 is a step up from this.
