The game is great and I still love this game a ton. The reason why is that it is different and unique. It allows you to do what you want when you want. I have well put over 400 hours over the past 8 years when I still played using the disk version of the game. DISCLAIMER!!!!! The game is full of bugs as it has never been optimized for newer technology and can crash at anytime. If you are to buy this and have problems, there are many guides that can help with the issues or help stop some the reasons it crashes. If you do play I recommend saving often so that you dont lose too much progress when you do crash.
