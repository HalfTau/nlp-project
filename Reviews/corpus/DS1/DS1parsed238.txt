Diablo  Youre going to do great things my childDungeon SIege  Yay!Years laterDragon Age  Youre gonna do great things my son.Dungeon Siege  Yay! No...Jokes aside, this game is great. I used to play this when I was younger and I would always do the story AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. I litteraily counted myself beating the game about 9 times, the only thing missing is the DLC for it. Then I would be set for this game.If you want a classic diablo styled game, then get this one.
