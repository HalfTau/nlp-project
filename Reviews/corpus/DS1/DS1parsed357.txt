An old favourite that is still fun to this day. If you want a big long journey with chaotic cluster combat and tonnes of juicy loot then youre going to want to play Dungeon Siege.The combat is glorious once you have some people in your party you can have up to 8 and doesnt begin to get old and manages to keep a consistant level of challenge going throughout the entire game.Graphically its obviously dated but looks incredible for a game from 2002 and hasnt aged too poorly in my own opinion.The sound design is incredible. The music by Jeremy Soule, who also worked on the Elder Scrolls series, World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria, Neverwinter Nights and Baldurs Gate and ambient sounds create an incredible atmosphere when exploring and travelling that is hard to match in any other game, though when you enter combat the music stays the same, which feels a tad out of place when youre in a cacophanous brawl of 25 people.So the game is great, youll agree once you play it but that is where issues lie  the game does not work well on modern machines without some tweeking. I managed to get it running with only a few insignificant glitches on Windows 7 by followingTry it out, i worked for me and it will hopefully work for you too!Also,to get the expansion pack, Dungeon Siege Legends of Aranna, a highly recommended addition that adds hours of new gameplay in a new campaign, tonnes of little convenient things like automated potion sharing and showing DPS on weapons, as well as increasing the level of loot variation by insane ammounts. Just get it, you wont regret it and if you DO regret it then fight me or something.
