Great game! Until the ending when you kill the final boss and the game crashes before you look at any of the equiptment he dropped. You cant even read the dialogue at the end of the game cause the game just goes straight to the main menu! I definitly think this kind of wrecks the game and I woudnt recommend it because a game is as good as its final ending, and with no ending its kind of crap
