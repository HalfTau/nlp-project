DONT BUY the Dungeon Siege package here on Steam.Why not ?BecauseMultiplayer option is disabled by steam.DS 1 end sequence is missing from the game resulting in game crashing.DS 1 and DS 2 multiplayer option, multiplayer maps and expansions NOT included.So bottom line, only dungeon siege 3 is fully playable, but since DS 3 aint as good as DS 1 and 2, in my opinion it aint worth buying the package including all 3.Atleast not untill STEAM include expansion and multiplayer option for DS 1 and DS 2, and FIXES the bugs they have put into  DS 1 aswell.So follow the forums for DS 1 and DS 2 to find out if the bugs have ben fixed before buying.
