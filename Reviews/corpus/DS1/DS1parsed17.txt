Classic game, shame multiplayer is almost unworkable.With multiplayer hobbled, and barely working via work arounds, the main of appeal of this game is gone. The single player mod is lonely and boring.I got it on sale, 0.99p so i do not feel too ripped off, but If I paid full price I would be disapointed.
