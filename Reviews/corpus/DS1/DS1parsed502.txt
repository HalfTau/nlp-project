Fun older game. The environments are beautiful and believable, and exploring them is really fun. Character development isnt as good as it could be you level up skills by using them, in theory this should be ok, but over the course of a single game hybrid classes seem gimped compared to specialized ones. I love that this games spell system is old school and relies on finding spells, like Diablo 1, it makes playing a magic class feel more adventuresome. This game is also unique as a sort of dungeon crawler becasue you never have to backtrack to town, you always move forward... hence the name Siege. It gives a compatibility error on my Windows 8 machine but seemed to work perfectly. The only big let downs are 1 that the multiplayer has been removed, which doubly sucks because it had a different world and story... and 2 the expansion set is nowhere to be found, bummer. Gas Powered Games put love into this game... I recommend it especially if youre looking for an RPG to play on an older machine or craptop.
