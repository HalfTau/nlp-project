The first time I completed this back in 2006 it took me 24 hours.The second time it took me 26 hours.The third it took me 27 hours.The fourth time back in 2007 it took about 30 hours.This game has so much replayablity it seems some what unfair! I havent really been in the mood to play it again lately but I know its coming some day!I keep going back and wasting hours of my life running around Ehb, and thats a good thing!
