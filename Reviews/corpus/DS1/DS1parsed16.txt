At first, I set lauch options and fixed some minor issues with the Steam version.  Lo and behold, the steam version deserves its poor reputation.  I just finished the game, not remembering it was the ending from when I competed it in 2003.  I didnt even get a chance to pick up the loot from the final boss, it just went immediately back to the game menu.  What a frusrating release.
