This is one of the best classic adventure games i have played.It features the classic way of intruduction to new creature, stronger one, Bossfight which leads to a bigger boss fight, though Gomm should have been a lot more difficult.Unfortunatly the steam versions Multiplayer is locked and it does not feature the legends of aranna expansion pack.Would be playing for a very long time to finish it.Would recommend having a fix for resolution and multiplayer.Speechless of how steam treated this game.
