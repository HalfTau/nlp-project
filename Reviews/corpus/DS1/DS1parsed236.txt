Horrible experience! I just purchased this game today because it was my childhood favourite only to be dissappointed with the loading of the game. I wasnt able to play the game at all as halfway through the introduction, there is a displpay saying exception detected. What is that supposed to mean even? Please help to rectify this issuea as soon as possible.
