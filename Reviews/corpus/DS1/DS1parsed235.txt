A classic. Back in the day, when I was a kid, I didnt like this game much for it was 3d. Nowadays it is hard to find a game with so big world and so much different environments. The gameplay of the game is sometimes boring almost always the same yet very attracting. It is a mustplay IMO. Especially if you are ready for the oldschool.
