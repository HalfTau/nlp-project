The level up system is like runescape where you use that type of attack and level up the associated attributes with use. Game was amazing as a kid and the combat was a mix of diablo and dragon age. The game is very dated to be warned and the Jason Stathom movie adaptation is so cheesy you could make a pizza and still have enough for some Mac N Cheese. Whatever you do dont get the third one though. Its the tried and true result of someone making the decision that they should take everything that defined the game, throw it out, and try to pass off a steaming pile ofto its fanbase. Shout out to that Red Rental Box for saving me ample money in this current market mindset of bait and switch games.
