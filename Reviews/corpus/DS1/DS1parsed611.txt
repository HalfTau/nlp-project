As much as I like the game, it does not play on windows 8 0r 8.1. I will still play it on my windows 7 desktop. Perhaps, if someone is capeable, a new version of dosbox can be used? Wishful thinking, I know. I still reccommend this game for anyone who likes Diablo, Devine Divinity or The Neverwinter, Baldersgate series of DD games.
