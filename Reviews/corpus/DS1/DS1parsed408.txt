Surprisingly entertaining fastpacedaction fun and best of the series.Its a pretty linear game, following down a path, that takes you through every chapter.If you can run it, you can enjoy it. If youve got some brandnew Nvidia/AMD graphics then .. look in the forums before you buy it.It mostly works quite well, but the AI controlling your party gets really confused sometimes if there are too many groups of enemies and then it gets quite frustrating to play, when your party spreads out and most certainly die.Avoid death at all costs, because even though resurrection is quite easy if you stand close enough and you are not in combat at the same time, your character drops all items on the ground on death, that totally clutter the screen and each item needs to be picked individually.. Sheesh.There is no honour in healing. Since there is no exp gain from healing, setting up a companion to be a healer would render it totally useless in time, because it will never gain levels.You can have six members in your party AND two Packmules!!.. Awesome. Unfortunately the mules can die too, leaving an even bigger mess to clean up, but its quite rare that they do.Save often.Its easy to understand why this game spun a sequel and after playing the second installment I understand why it stopped. The third game, which is the first I played, is something completely different.
