Classic game that most likely wont win over new players. This game is more of a party manager than anything else. You will be managing formations, spells, and potions for your entire group. The game progresses in a linear fashion revealing lore unique to the Dungeon Siege world. At the time of its release the graphics were top notch. I still enjoy some of the environments until this day. For some reason the ending cut scenes were removed and the expansion is absent. Im sure licensing issues are why the expansion arent included. Multiplayer is also stripped away. There are steps to replace the content found in the Steam community. Overall I have a level of nostalgia attached to this game that still brings me back to play every so often. If you like reading fantasy lore, managing your party, and sorting through loot, this might be your game.
