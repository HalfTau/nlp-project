Still an enjoyable Hack and Slay, but I suggest to ignore this unfinished steam edition.Multiple crashes in one Playthrough  one ruined the save game.After the final boss it quits into main menu immediately.No outro.No credits.No Fame after almost 30 hours of tough gameplay.No AddOn available.Seriously?3/10
