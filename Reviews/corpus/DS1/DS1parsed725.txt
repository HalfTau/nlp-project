This game is some kind of hack an slash where you dont need to attack. You just walkthrough dungeons. When a monster appear in your range, your caracters autoattack and autoaims. You just watch, wait and health your caracters. Its a one button press on h for heal all your team instantly. You can collect items that monster drop.... but after few hours I figure out its totally useless doing that. You just lose time and most items are just bad. Collect gold? Seem useless too. I get bored really fast.
