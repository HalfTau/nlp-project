This is mostly a nostalgia driven review and as such you probably should take that into account before blindly following this recomendation.First of all Im basing this review on my first experience when as a 13 year old I received this videogame as a christmas gift from my parents. When I first got to play it I was blown away cus it was an action game with some Age of Empires control schemes and I loved the setting, the exploration bits and slaughtering monsters all over the place with my weapons and party, so I decided to get the whole package again when I saw an offer here 13 years later and due to the holidays getting closer I felt nostalgic to play it again and I feel pretty much everything I enjoyed from it is back, minor a few things.Would I recommend it? yes, its a fun game with an interesting control scheme however it has a glaring flaw to it and that is that the game once completed it offers NO REPLAY VALUE at all
