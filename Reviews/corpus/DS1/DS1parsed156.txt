I used to play this game with my dad when I was little, and would would reccomend this game 10/10! its old, but so fun youll probably forget that witin the first 10 minutes of gameplay. I wouldnt reccomend buying this game however, if you have a computer than either runs poorly or often has compatibilty problems. The game probably wont work. If you have a good computer though, buy this game! you wont regret it!
