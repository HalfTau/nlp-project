A fun classic dungeon crawler in the vein of Diablo, but with in depth party management and a better story. The world is well built, finely detailed and fleshed out. Explore off of the beaten path and youll find all sorts of neat little nooks and crannies. Combat is simple enough for managing a party of brave adventurers on a lootfilled quest, but satisfying. This is a good, moderately old game.
