Surprisingly fun coop game that doesnt really explain itself too well. Its just an oldschool RPG where you go around exploring the world, slaying monsters that come your way.Challenging at times due to it being so archaic, but also its also tuned well.Only problem with is that setting up the coop is difficult. Read up on it before buying the game to know what you are getting into. It also might not work for you in the end.I also dont recommend playing this on your own. Its a good laugh as a coop game, but on your own you probably wont be laughin as much.
