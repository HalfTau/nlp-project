This game was fantastic back in its day.  Its a contemporary of the original Neverwinter Nights, and while that was more for the cerebral DD style RPG gamer, Dungeon Seige married hack and slash with RPG in a new way.   Rather than be like Diablo, it went the direction of being linear, giving a bit of an epictale sort of feel.Unfortunately, I cant recommend it for purchase and use on newer machines.  Its not natively Win7 compatible, which is normally not really a problem, but its older code for graphics management bleeds over to cause some pretty nasty glitching in HUD graphics and gameplay stuttering on nicer machines.   Ill need to run it in a virtual machine, which is beyond where most gamers are willing to take something they pick up on sale.   It may also run a bit better on ARM processors or similar systems that do not have discrete video cards.As a game, 8 of 10.   But only buy it if you have something crappy to run it on otherwise, youll look to the sequels.
