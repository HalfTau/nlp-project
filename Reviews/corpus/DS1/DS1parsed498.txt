Only AFTER you buy the game and run it do you you get a message that says this game is not compatible with windows 7. Specifically there is no mouse pointer visible in the game. Good luck clicking on anything in this pointandclick game.IF you have a modern computer, Win 7 or above, save your money and dont buy. I wish I could get a refund.
