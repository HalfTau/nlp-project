Some honesty to your paying customers would be nice Steam. Along with maybe release notes, version, and other details since we are purchasing software that ultimately we are going to have to either fix ourselves or rely on a dedicated and passionate community to take care of.Also, enjoy the note to Windows 7 users. Windows 8 users are just ignored, then?Bottom line, there are games older than this that run better. Spend your money elsewhere unless you still have XP or other OS.
