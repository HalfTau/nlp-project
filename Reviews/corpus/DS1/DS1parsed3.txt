dungeon siege, nothing takes you wayyy back the way dungeon siege does, if you are like me and love dungeon crawlers, or just rpgs, this game is awesome. i realise that it is quite outdated, but that honestly is one of the best parts, you go back to gaming as how it used to be, not getting your hand held the whole time, so it feels like an actual adventure. if you dont mind the graphics, it is super fun and i highly suggest it.
