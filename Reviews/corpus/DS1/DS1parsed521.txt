I do not agree with the claims that its been cheated outta the expansion nor the multiplayer... Search around the forums and you are bound to locate away to get it back.There is manyways to retrieve them not about to mention it in the review due to backlash of promoting torrenting yet we deserve a complete collectors edition and i highly doubt that Valve is entirely at fault for not providing it.Well, it seems that multiplayer is strictly over LAN hosting, so need to know how thats done, and that those that do get the multiplayer also to provide such things.
