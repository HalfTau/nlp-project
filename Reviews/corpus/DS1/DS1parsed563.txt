Listen i like a good RPG Squad tatic based game as the next guy, but Im sorry this game is just too old! sound effects not good if your running windows 8.0 i doubt itll work, you cant teleport back to shop controls are hard, your companions suck, and its long as hell. If your in for fun not for u its like playing hardcore all the way. If you like outrageous prices in shop for sucky items and over a million enamies per level that can easily kill your guys go for it!
