Pure dungeon crawling at its best, sure the graphics are a lil dated, but still some great game play, fans of DD will feel at home here. Still has one of the most streamlined and funtional, nay, enjoyable UIs ever seen in a RPG. So much freedom and exploring it puts most modern games to shame. I am looking forward to playing its 2 sequels aswell.game play 5/5story line 4/5graphics 4/5
