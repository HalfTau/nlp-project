Old game with hero leveling. You are starting with one character and being able to reach 8 members focusing them on melee, ranged, attack and support magic combat. You can buy a mule to carry your loot as after only first dungeon I did not have empty slots. Overally game is good but far from being excellent as it lacks some kind of surprise in it, it only brings you stronger enemies and solid story and bosses.I finished it in 44 hours, slicing bunch of my free time and I enjoeyed it very much.
