The game itself is good, if you can get it running. There are still crashes however, although there is several patches/mods out there to fix it, although the last cutscene is missing, which I also noticed with Thief Gold, or Thief the Dark Project, as it was orginally called, where cutscenes were completely missing in the Steam version. While I do recmmmend this game, I would suggest, if possible, try to find the disk copy of this game. As I used to have it, and the end game was one of the best moments cut short in this version.
