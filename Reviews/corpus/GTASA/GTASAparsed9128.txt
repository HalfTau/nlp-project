This is a great game.  They fixed all of the problems with the previous two 3d Grand Theft Auto games.  Its fun, some frustrating missions but when you beat them theres a sense of accomplishment.Then you get to the flying missions.  Did anyone play test these missions?  Theyre ing impossible.  The controls are complete  Like many people, my San Andreas experience comes to an unsatisfying dead stop at these mandatory flying missions.  If it werent for the flying missions, Id give the game a nine.  But as it standsPwninator Score 6/10
