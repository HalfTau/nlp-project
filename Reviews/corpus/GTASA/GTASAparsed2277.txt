Love the game, im kinda not into modding the game but as far as the gameplay it is amazing. I rememeber having my PS2 setup because that was cool backthen and recorded GTA San Andreas from my tablet and uploaded it whole to youtube. It is alot easier to make and edit videos for the game now since elgato was released and Ive been ever since making videos on this game. So if amyone is reading this, please put some interest into this game eventhough it is old and outdated.
