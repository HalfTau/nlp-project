I originally played this on the PS2 when I was 8 years old. I didnt know how to really play it but my human nature was able to figure out how to jack a car and blow an old womens face off in the street. Now that im older I can truly experience Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, I will tell you the good and the bad about this game, first I will start with the goodThe goodRight off the bat youre able to roam around the giant city of Los Santos and do whatever you want free of any real life reprecution, and once you start to play through the story missions of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas you will be able to unlock more of the map and explore neighboring cities Los Ventures and San Fiero with the wilderness around it if you really want to explore. This game is set in the early 90s with the earlier rap music and gang activity being a very real concept in the game with you actually being part of the Grove Street Families and doing missions for Big Smoke, Ryder, OG Loc, and Sweet Carls brother. The map is still huge and has so many side activities when you complete the main story. I really enjoy this games music, gun play, and story much more than say Grand Theft Auto IV.The badThe game looks very dated even in the HD release on PC, 360, and Mobile. The physics get a little jacked up when you take the annoying frame limiter off, I was trying to swim with the frame limiter off and I swam slower than a turtle with a missing leg, I couldnt even go underwater correctly with that annoying frame limiter off. Its story has been done before and has even been done better in some games like Saints Row and Saints Row 2.Thats it for my review, im gonna give the game a 9/10 because its not perfect but its still one of the best Grand Theft Auto games to date period.
