EDIT Rockstar ruined this with the newest patch, dont buy it. Do not support this ery! I really hope this wont be a new way to deal with old games. Rather than pay for new license they removed the songs and made the game even worse as a port of the mobile version. Geez thanks a lot R. I dont know what happened to the company, Rused to be good and trustworthy but has gone to Its shameful that the greed of big corporations ruin the game and rip off the customers who bought this. Im happy that I still have the ps2 version and it still works although the disc is kind of scratched, hopefully R wont send someone to pick up that retail version. Because this feels almost the same, time for me to get a retail version somehow for pc as the update ed up all the mod support as well. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.OLD REVIEW BEFORE THE RIP OFF PATCHIgnore my playing time on steam, I use a downgraded version for mods sake. I used to have this on my ps2. After that I got this for PC, just because with mods this classic gets even better than GTA V in my opinion.
