New sorta patch removed 18 songs from the game, all of which were immersive to the time period and location this game is set in, presumably due to copyright reasons despite being entirely legitimate in keeping the songs in, since they were already in the game for 10 years.. and then just as an added you ontop, they remove your saves and removed widescreen support. What the ?!?
