An excellent game to have if you like the developers patching the game to remove songs, resolutions, save games, and mod support. Made especially for that type of person who loves having pieces of the product they paid for taken back from them by the developer. If we let this one slide, every company in existence heres looking at you EA will use this formula. Why keep songs in the game and repay licensure when we can just take the stuff out a few years down the road? Who will notice? rockstar. Im not buying anything else they make until they get theirstraight.
