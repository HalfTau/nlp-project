Ill have two Number 9s, a Number 9 Large, a Number 6 with extra Dip, a Number 7, Two Number 45s, one with Cheese, and a large Soda.Ill be completely honest here. This is possibly either the best or the second best GTA game made. Even though you may experience issues with performance and drivers/OS incompatibillities on newer OSes Id say its still playable.CONSGraphics/Performance issues with modern hardware.
