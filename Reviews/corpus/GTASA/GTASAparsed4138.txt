Old but great game . At one time I was convinced that this game has nothing interesting to show , but after 150 hours of really good gameplay Id recommend GTA  SA to everyone . This game has its own spirit , as you travel through mountains , cities , deserts and forests . Many easter eggs , myths , some of them are really scary . You cant get bored there .I regret that I couldnt pass through one of last missions of this fantastic campaign . This game is worth any price and it will be forever in my heart .
