Picked this up when i was 4 on release, Tried to play it with my ps1 controller but my ps2 was like nah get the ps2 controller you spent hours on this game and become a proper gangster, I would shoot people all day everyday, it got say back i even did drivebys in school.I had to pick this game up on PC just to see the graphics ya know, well it is a beautiful game to mod on. I turned CJ into the hulk and smashed the ing city, i was even able to smack that dirty  who sucked me off in the car and ran off with my money, the  wastoo tbh.But  it anyways, good game.
