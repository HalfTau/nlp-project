One of the best game stories I have ever played. Not to mention the improvised multiplayer mode that is very popular.This game is Rockstars first complete game in the GTA series. It contains the most options you can take about your character CJ so far. You can eat, you can draw tattoos on your body, you can train at a gym, you can drive and tune cars, swim and A LOT more. This is the reason why GTA IV never surpassed GTASA.update for badge
