Probably one of the best gtas out there. It has features that are really cool that other gtas dont have like how you can get fat if you eat too much, how you can exercise to become stronger and learn new moves or to increase your strength, and how you have to eat to actually keep your strength. I think it would be cool if they added some of these features in later gtas but idk why Rockstar didnt bring these back. The graphics are pretty good for its time period and its a big open world also for its time period. The only thing I dont like is how its hard to lose the cops even at 1 star. Idk if you have to always get a paint job to escape or if you can just drive away but so far I was only able to escape by getting a paint job. Overall 10/10 to hear big smoke again.
