I would pass on this unless it is dirt cheap. Ive run into at least three progression stopping bugs that, considering the amount of time this game has been out, no one seems to care about enough to fix. It looks alright on high resolutions and settings, but things like dodgy controller support inverting camera will invert the movement during minigames, generic press joypad 4 prompts, etc, the aforementioned bugs, and all of the little hitches make this a really poor pc port that I hope will not be indicative of the GTA V port.
