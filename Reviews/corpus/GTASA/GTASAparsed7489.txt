Frankly, after the debacle that was the steam update/downgrade of GTASA I can not recommend this game, or in fact any other R game, to anyone.Theyve had ample time to respond to the situation but chose to ignore it  could have accepted the situation if they would have responded to the community, but the silent treatment spoke volume. They have our money, they dont care.Well, dear R  you might have gotten my money, but its the last Euros you have ever gotten from me.Good luck with your business practices.
