I still fail missions because of cancerous reasons, but still its an awesome game. Besides it being one of the 1 games of its time, to me at least, I had great expierience with the game. And playing it over and over and understading more.Besides that is there so much more to do besides missions, this game has several minigames inside it, sidequests/missions, collectable oysters, horse shoes etc. and much more!Even though this game is very old, and there are much more modern games like GTA V, which is also an awesome game, this game can help you waste your spacetime like the speed of sound.
