Easily one of the best GTAs ever made. This game was one of the last GTAs to offer a true sandbox and roleplay experience with several side activies to boot. These features would be ethier very lacking or missing entierly in the major modern era GTA games gta 4 and 5 respectivly in comparison to San Andreas. While personally i like GTA 4s story more GTA San Andreas story is a close second. The only downside to the PC port is the controls are inverted in places they shouldnt be the lowrider rythem minigame is a good example of this.Overall if you feel like playing one of the older GTAs start with this one as its easily one of the best ones.
