A lot of people are complaining about the recent patch that removed a few songs, and broke saves for some. But other than that its still a fantastic game, im sure theres a mod out there to bring back the deleted songs, and if youre just now buying the game, you wont have to worry about the broken saves, because it only effected saves made before the patch.10/10 would relive my childhood on the glorious PC Master Race again
