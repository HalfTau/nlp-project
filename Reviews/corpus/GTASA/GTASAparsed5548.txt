So. GTA San Andreas, my childhood. This game is like GTA 5s big papa. Its like Straight Outta Compton in video game form. I remember always asking my brother if i could play this on his Xbox, and when i got to play, i played ALOT. When i had freinds and relatives over id play split screen.Enough with the nostalgic review and on to the real one.Short about the story In GTA SA you play as Carl Johnsson CJ who after 5 years on the east coast comes home to his brothers in Groove street, but things have changed since he was last there and he now finds himself in a city full of street gangs and criminals and must get himself to fit in again.Gameplay Gameplay is overall pretty good, can get a bit clunky at moments and the game has a few bugs.Map The game is set in an completely open world based off of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Fransisco. You start of in Los Santos but to get to the other cities of the map you have to complete main story missions.Characters The game has some really intersting characters, some even based off of real people like Eazy E. Voice acting is great.Side missions and minigames After youve beat the game there are still tons of things to do, like purchasing properties and apartements, a few minigames and sidemissions. And still after youve done all that you can mess around with cheat codes.The game is not the same as you remember it if you played it a few years back, recently they released a patch that removed a few songs and broke saves wich you might have guessed caused the fans and community to outrage, but it was copyright issues so what could they do. If you want the FULL game i recommend buying a physical copy online or at a local game store.Id give this game a solid 8.5, would be a 10 if they didnt release that god forsaken patch.Sorry if the review felt lacking, but its my first atempt to a serious review and i hope it helped someone.
