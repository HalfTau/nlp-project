unfortunatley i bought this on sale because its san andreas. like cmon. However what i got wasnt the port i rembered its the android port. complete with very bad l.o.ds unnoticable on an android screen but on a pc display its bad, less than thirty feet from you the cars turn to cubes. the they took the whole 169 aspect ration completley. aka no 1920x1080. they stripped the soundtrack to which i dont mind it has a user track player. it crashes unexpectedley and because its an android port. the modding communitty is built on bassically a different game. so no help there. i really wish i could say its worth the 5 bucks i spent but it just wasnt!
