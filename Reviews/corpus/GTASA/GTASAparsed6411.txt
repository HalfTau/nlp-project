Quick notes that, people keep asking me to try GTA mostly pointed to San Andreas or GTA V. The graphic of SA tbh its not great consider its 2005 i wont complain about itSo i try it and this is my reviewPros, Cons and TLDR At the bottomGreat game for people with 64 MB VRAM Intel Chipset mostly, Open World and mysterious easter eggs, great story and it feels big than GTA VNotes Google for the 1.0 Patch. It completes the game theres the Hot Coffee Mod
