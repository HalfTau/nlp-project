I do recommend this game very highly... but not with the latest patch by Rockstar.Seriously, what in blazes is wrong with you Rockstar?  Its one thing to take songs out for future purchasers, but what about those of us who have owned the game for a long time?  Youre removing content we paid for.  You are making a very good case AGAINST buying games digitally.I hope this move bites you bigtime.
