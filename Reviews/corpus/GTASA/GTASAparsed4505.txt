Ok.this is the second game i bought on Steam after first game i bought it was Flatoutwich im glad i bought it.I dont know why everybody call the Steam version the worst one,problary their PCs was with Xbox 360 version of the game wich i dont like it too,but i have the same version like the retail one from 2005.Now,let go towich i found a little stupid but also i like it,Carl Johson CJ searching for the guy responsibile for his mother death in wich it was killed in a driveby by Ballas.SPOILER alertNow CJ returning home seeing his and his brother gang called Groove Street almost has destroyed by Ballas.He is going to 3 citiesLos Santos Los AngelesSan Fierro San FranciscoLas Venturas Las VegasTo find out more details about his mother death.He meet new friends and enemies in this 3 cities.Also we meet a character from another GTA,i let you find out this.I wont speak anymore about story because its too long.The gameplay is good for a 2004 game.The guns and the open world are very good.Final note9/10
