The first Grand Theft Auto game i ever owned was GTA Vice City. I didnt think much of it, but i certainly heard a lot about it. But when i bought it, my god was it beautiful, violent, addictive and brilliantly done. For me, most sequals tend to be rather rubbish or never tend to be as good or better than the last.Gramd Theft Auto San Andreas, is it better than Vice City, is it brilliant, adictive, perfect, awesome and does it deserve a 10 out of 10 with a legendary game of the year award. Yes, yes it does, hell, id give it a 11 out of 10. This game was by far the best in the whole GTA series. It is by far Rockstars master peice.However, this game is best to be played on a console, NOT A PC. Ill never understand people why that brand the PC the master race. Its not, if there is one thing ive learnt about a PC is that there is always a problem, problems you never get on a console.It broke my heart to see this game have so many problems, crashes and freezing. Sadly old games, even new ones will always have problems. I love this game, but i simply had ugly problems trying to get the game to work and when it did finally work and save, it will freeze, crash or worse. Legendary games like this do not deserve such horrible problems.This game on the console will get a solid 11 out of 10, but for the PC, its going to have to get a painful upsetting 3 out of 10.The graphic are lovely, the game play controller is decent, the story is brilliant, the map and open world is beautiful, but the problems are simply devistating. I dont know if its a windows thing or a computer thing, but if anyone ever wants to buy this game, maybe you guys might be lucky, maybe youll have the same issues i have. But please, if you do buy it, get it on sale. The game isnt bad, its the problems that ruin the game that makes it so painful to play. Ill still play it, but it will never be the same like it was on the PS2.
