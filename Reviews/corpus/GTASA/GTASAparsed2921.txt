This port is really good. Hard to believe that a game this old could have life breathed into it, but it really does. Particularly after playing the AWFUL port on PS4, I appreciate the work that went into making this version worth the price.It does still have a bit of jankiness, but the increased draw distance from the original is noticeable and really immersive. Some people complained about the original color filter missing from this version, but honestly after playing the newer games its not something to miss.The ability to freely map the controller buttons is nice, even if the inteface for doing it is rough.Overall, the best way to play this game!
