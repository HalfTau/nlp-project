I bought GTA SA thinking it would be great to play, as I had read several great reviews of it. For the maybe 30 minutes I had playing it, it was great. Then my mouse stopped working. Im not sure why or how I didnt change anything in the settings. I would not recommend this game to anyone because I wasted 15.00 on a game which had a major component stop working after less than an hour. And unless Steam can resolve this problem, or gives me a copy of the game that works, or refunds my money, I will no longer be purchasing any games from them, nor will I recommend any games to anyone I know.1/10 review because mouse doesnt work. Otherwise, it would easily be a 10/10 game.
