Bought San Andreas on the recent Exploration Sale. Runs bordered even at native resolution. Rockstar still didnt fixed the widescreen issue, the game looks stretched either vertically or horizontally, depending on your ingame setting. I can accept such issues from Delta Force games, seeing as theyre older, but Not from GTA games, because Rockstar clearly has the resources to fix these issues, but doesnt have the will to update the games that basically made the company. Which is a damn shame.EDIT changed the rating to positive, because some things work better now, the game is more playable. Still bitter about cut content.
