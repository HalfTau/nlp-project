loved the game on ps2 but not for pc i couldnt care less about 18 songs getting removed . but my big gamebreaker is that theres no controller support even though it says there is i tryed the xbox 360  controller and ps4 controlelr still neither worked although those choosing to get vice city the ps4 controller worked fantastically will not waste money on any other gta titles for pc any longer considering there ineptitude at basic controller support which most  other developers seem to be able to get right but if u like the clunkey mouse and keyboard setup for this game get it if not id pass
