This game has passed the test of time and to this day remains one of the greatest videogames of alltime. This game achieved a new milestone for the Grand Theft Auto franchise that, in my opinion, was not surpassed until the release of Grand Theft Auto V  almost a decade later. One seeking beautiful graphics and nothing else may want to give it a pass, but those seeking brilliant gameplay and loads of fun have really missed out if they havent played this game.
