Out of all of the Grand Theft Auto series, I honestly have to say that this game is my favorite. Sure, GTA V is new, but this game tops it in many aspects. The cheat codes and system for weight and muscle make this game unique, while the story is amazing. The rewards for 100 completion provide incentive to completely finish the game. For a game that was made in 2004, these graphics are great. Well optimized and runs smooth on less powerful and older hardware. I have had some glitches in the game, such as the mouse not working which is why i used a controller for this game and the right stick on the controller being useless unless you are aiming downsights or in a car, but they dont really break the experience for me.10/10
