remains to this day one of the best GTA game in the series below i will go over the things i like and dislike about Grand Theft Auto San Andreas so lets begin.Graphics5/10Well Graphics dont matter and here it is no exception the game looks dated of course but i dont care and never will, Of course it is always nice to have good graphics but i never drags away from the overall experience in my opinion.Gameplay 7/10Well gameplay is the most important factor of an open world game and GTASA is good however its controls and camera often feel overall awful and shooting aint great either but the gameplay is not bad. driving is solid and the RPG mechanics in this game are welcome.Fun Factor 9/10Now this is where GTASA shines it is easily able to hook you inn for hours at a time and causing chaos around San Andreas is some of the most fun ive had in a GTA Game, til this day i still enjoy GTASAVerdict  7.9/10Grand Theft AutoSan Andreas is a good game tho it has aged terribley i still enjoy it alot it aint the same game it was back in 2004 still i recommend it for the small prize tag of 9,99Pros Can easily be played and enjoyed for hours at a time Gameplay is solid tho some mechanics have aged badly the gameplay is mostly good It is very affordable and definetly worth the asking prizeCons Gun Mechanics have aged badly Some Missions are repetitiveBTW!!!!!! Played it alot more on PS2 and PS3 so dont let my steam time fool you guys!!!!
