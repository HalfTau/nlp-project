Basically the Steam release of GTA San Andreas is the worst version of what is, in my opinion, the best game ever. 18 tracks were removed from the epic radio lineup. Ok, this is bad, but it doesnt break the game. What really breaks the game is the removal of any 169 resolutions! Were talking about the most common aspect ratio today 720p and 1080p and Rockstar has, for some insane reason, seen fit to remove support for this resolution.In my long years of PC gaming Ive never seen a patch that detracts from the game. This is absolutely ridiculous, and I can find no logical explanation whatsoever.DO NOT purchase this game on Steam as it forces the latest patch which breaks the game. Find a retail copy.
