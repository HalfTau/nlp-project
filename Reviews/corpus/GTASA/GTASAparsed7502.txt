Classic simply classic game. Completely ruined by this update by Rockstar having removed 17 songs from the radio, 1080p screen resolution. But worst of all having completed the game a few times it seems that now even the mouse is not working as it should, having to pause the game 10 times i short succesion just to get the mouse to unfreeze is simply unaaceptable because it used to be fine before this absolutely unnecessery update.
