Another great game in the GTA series, San Andreas shines on every level. There are tons of features, and lots of things to do, beyond the countless missions in an interesting plotline. The world is deep and well made, I was surprised when I found out that the area I believed to be the whole of the world was barely 1/5th of it. Combined with what youd expect from a GTA game lots of cars, radio, guns, great controls, you shouldnt pass this up.
