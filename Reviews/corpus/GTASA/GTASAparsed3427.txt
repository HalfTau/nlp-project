OK. Im supposed to write a review for the game that Ive been playing for more than 23 hours but loaded page directed me to somewhere else. Speaking for playing hours, 0.1 is for Windows version and the other one is for Mac version. Theres no any difference between the two except for the platform which the two are based respectively.In spite of being presented prior to this decade its still a really a good game, featuring the second largest payable area in the whole series. Main storyline and side missions are challenging, interesting, and durable. One can simply stick to it for months, just like my little brother and young me did.There are bunches of cheating codes there. Id like to recommend them if you are gonna explore more trivia of this game, but it doesnt apply to missions. Completing whole missions without using any cheats might be hard but its a good way to enjoy the story itself. Dont worry about money accordingly. You will earn a lot through missions and your properties would ensure you are an upcoming millionaire of the State and San Andreas.Enjoy it!
