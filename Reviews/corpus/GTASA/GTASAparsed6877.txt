Great game, 9/10.People say R removed 196 widescreen and 1080p but these options are in the game and theyre working well.Those 18 songs that they removed are not a reason to not buy the game, there are a  of tracks to listen to. Havent seen graphical glitches or crashes Those bad reviews are just stupid kids that played GTA for 30 min
