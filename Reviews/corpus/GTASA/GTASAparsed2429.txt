I wish I could say I recommend this game I really do I loved the time I put into this game before refunding but the absolute lack of bug fixing from rockstar makes this game nearly unplayable. I have lost tons of progress because of this the main problem being me getting stuck in the gym  going back in immediatly after leaving. Theres also numerous graphical bugs and control problems that rockstar has completely ignored, from looking up and the ground disapearing to textures being screwy theres also the incredibly high camera sensitivity that makes it impossible to play without a controller ontop of the incredibly close camera it makes aiming nearly impossible. Driving isnt great either mainly because of the non autoadjusting camera meaning you have to control the cameramaking driving incredibly difficult. If you can ignore the horribly outdated graphics, the numerous bugs that cause you to lose hours of progress in one fell swoopthe terrible controls I would totally recommend it as the story is pretty good and the music is classic 1990s rap so it fits the atmosphere of the ghetto pretty well theres also different radio stations if rap isnt your thing. The characters arent half bad and who doesnt know about Big Smokes famous order of two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.
