Game playing fine thus far. Only downside is that audio is skipping a lot, moreso at the end of sentences, resulting in dialogue cut short. If playing with a controller, swap control scheme to joypad instead of its default preset.For now, Im recommending because GTA SA is an amazing game. If anything gamebreaking pops up, or something that is too much of a nuisance, Ill be sure to return.Edit Crashed 20min into gameplay after posting this review with audio repeat tearing at my ears even after the client shut down.
