Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was the best of the series. However, Rockstar destroyed this version of the game by ripping out 18 songs from the game with a mandatory update. The company stole content that I paid for. Please buy a used physical copy of the game to enjoy all of the content, and dont give this greedy, backstabbing company your money.
