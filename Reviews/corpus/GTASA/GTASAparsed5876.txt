Always will be for me the best gta, because of the storyline and old graphics, but those busta rockstars removed my fav. soundtracks  KDST Running Down A Dream, Woman To Woman,   RadioX   Killing in the Name of,  Hellraiser, Personal Jesus.If you want to play it, dont buy it and download somewhere older version, or buy it actually and downgrade to version 1.0. where it was rolling fine like cj rolling a car over.
