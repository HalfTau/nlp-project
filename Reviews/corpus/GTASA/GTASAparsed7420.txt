GTA San Andreas, the best GTA ever, got censored recently!Rockstar removed 18 tracks of music and changed the build of the game to some inferior Xbox version without widescreen support and the old save files are not even compatible with this new version. Thumbs down for this blasphemy!Glad I got the PS2 and boxed PC version of the game. Try and take them from me!
