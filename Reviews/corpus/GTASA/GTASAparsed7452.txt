Hang on, hang on. Put your pitchforks away and hear me out for a sec.I love this game. This was the game that changed gaming back when people were mad that you played as someone not white. I played this game from hours to days on end and it is still one of the best games out there.Unfortunetly a recent patch destroyed it in multiple ways, the main reasons being...1. Due to Rockstars legal papers expiring they removed all music from the game.goes into it a bit better than I can.2. This created an odd bug with some of the cars causing cars to... act up or bug out I guess.3. The update destroyed all save files. It wouldnt matter if your buying it but still.4. For whatever reason the resolution was messed up and nowyou cant play at 1080p and the game wasnt made to be played at a lower resolution making it look like sht.Overall I have to say, WTH. I mean this isnt going to remove the songs on Xbox or ps2. And the songs are still on all mobile copies of gta. So why only pc? sigh Rockstar. Im somewhat scared if they are going down the same path as Ubisoft with the bad choices theyre making and their Social Club you need to sign up to play newer Rockstar games.In the end, your better off getting this game on mobile, witch is an odd thing to say for me because I hate mobile gaming but any smartphone can now play it, so might as well. Or hook up your dusty ps2 and go shoot hookers in flying cars over area 52.
