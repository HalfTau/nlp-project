Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is the best series in the GTA series, awesome characters, visuals, cutscenes, ect. Mods make the game 10x more fun and you can just do what you will, better than GTAV by far. The steam port is kinda bad and buggy, its awful but can be 100 fixed with patches made by users. Awesome game HIGHLY recommended!
