I have played this game for many years and have beat it so many times that I lost count. In this game you play as the main character CJ or Carl Johnson. The main thing you are trying to figure out is who killed your mom. As you go on this journey you meet some great characters. I played and beat this game on every system it came out for and Im still replaying it because its such a great game. If you havent played this game and youre thinking of getting it, dont give it a second thought, Its a must play game. I rate this game 756.225 Chipz out of 756.225 Chipz.
