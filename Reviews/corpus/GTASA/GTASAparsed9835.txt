The developer issued a patch all these years later that TAKES OUT content from the game 17 songs, 1080p resolution, surround sound and more. Its the most unethical act from a big publisher Ive ever seen here on Steam. This breaks consumer laws in most countries, and its basically an illegal act. Shame on Rockstar never buying any of their products anymore and on Valve for allowing developers do this.
