Soon as I got on that bike and headed to Grove Street my childhood felt reborn! Cannot wait to complete the game once more and pretty much feel like it has just came out with endless possibilities such as eating till you throw up and smashing a workout down the gym, plus managing girlfriends again ha. Would recommend this to you guys for pure nostalgic reasons
