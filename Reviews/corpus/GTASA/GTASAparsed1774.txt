Well I recommend this game to people who actually want to play a brilliant storyline and also have fun.. I see a lot of people are angry because you can not mod the game anymore. Well, thats not a reason not to buy this game! It still has one of the best if not the best stories ever in video games. Its not a short game either. So if you want to enjoy the natural beauty of gta san andreas you should buy it, but if you want to play modded games just dont buy it. Anyways if you buy it enjoy playing it
