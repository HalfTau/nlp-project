Its no wonder this now runs on an Android. It looks like it might run on a Gameboy Color.San Andreas was updated on Black Friday of 2014 to remove some songs Rockstars licensing expired on and given a new system so it could be ported easily between console, computer, and android device. The game looked better on a PS2.Would recommend buying an older copy, the graphics are a real eyesore and the withdrawn music is unfair to the people who paid for the game beforehand. Its like buying a CD and having it taken from you years later.
