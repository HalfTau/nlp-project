I have had many memories playing this game on the PlayStation 2. And I know the game is great, but this Steam port is a little damn sketchy. Let me break it down.CLEO mods seem to be unsupported. crashes the game upon savegame loadThe User Tracks do NOT work. this crashes the game during gameplayRandom crashes upon themselves.A bunch of other problemsMoral of the story is if youre going to port a game to PC for Steam, do it right. Other than that, this game was literally the best of its time and went as far as being the bestselling game on the PlayStation 2. The story is AMAZING, the soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the game and the whole game is just awesome. But the Steam PC port? Not so much. I wish R still released patches/fixes for the PC port but, of course, they are far too busy with other stuff.ScoresPlayStation 2 version 10/10Steam PC version 8/10So what are we supposed to do if the Ballas roll through? Throw shoes at em?
