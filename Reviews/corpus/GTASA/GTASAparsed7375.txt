Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is the 6th game in the series and one of the best.The player takes the role of Carl Johnson, an exgang member that just heard that his mother was killed and comes back for home for answers. He is almost instantly brought back into his old gang and for the rest of the game he goes on trying to take over his neighborhood and later that whole state.Players that have played GTA3 or GTA Vice City know what the game is like killing, shooting, racing, and just running a muck. And nothing really has changed since the previous games other then a couple little things like the player is able to swim and not die instantly, flying is easier and parachutes are added, lock on isnt perfect but better then before, and the game adds a fatfitness part where the player has to watch what Carl eats and exercises so that he isnt too fat and slow or too skinny and weak.One major thing over previous installments is the shear size of the state of San Andreas which it is about 2 to 3 times as big as Vice Citys layout and is full of things to do.The music is a mixed bag for me as most of the soundtrack is full of rap/hiphop and the only stations I would listen to was the talk and rock stations and sometimes those got boring so I was glad I could mute the game and listen to my iPod.The voice acting in San Andreas is awesome as all the characters from Carl to Officer Tenpenny all sound like they are real people in this faux world.Now unless someone was living under a rock for the past couple years, San Andreas came under fire for having a hidden sex game but was only unlockable if the player owns a cheat device or has the PC version and unofficially patched the game so really the game got a little more heat than it should have. And in this edition that part of the code has been removed totally so players wanting to see the hot coffee are out of luck.Added into the special edition is The Introduction which chronicles the events leading up where the game starts.In whole the game is a blast to play and if you own a PS2 you shouldnt be caught dead with out it.10/10
