My favorite Grand Theft Auto game yes, I like it more than IV.  Loads of fun, large sandbox world to explore, overthetop scenarios...  Everything your typical GTA has.  However, I think the crazy fun supplied by the Hydra and the Jetpack make this game into so much win.  The only thing I dont like about it is that flying controls are SUPER complex and they take a looooong time to get used to this is mandatory too.  Fun game though, definitely get it if it goes on sale.
