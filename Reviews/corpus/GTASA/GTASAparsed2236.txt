you cant go wrong with a classic. this game is what got me into GTA this is the most fun you can have with it being legal. but this beats even some illegal things.not to mention this will run on about anything.so get out into the world of san andreas and mess some fools up.this game is pure fun. i played it on ps2 and it was the best. now i have an alienware gaming laptop. and it just increases the fun. the fps has to be at least 100.
