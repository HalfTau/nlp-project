I was yanking my tshirt by the collar whilst eagerly waiting for this game to be released.. due to.. obvious reasons Ubisoft has made terrible ports for PC before.As soon as I played WD2, it felt so goddang smooth and they really did add a lot of detail into the settings of this game.If you wanna buy it, I say you should. Its a new game, its something youre probably interested in and its not half bad! Im enjoying myself so much.  The characters are fun, the invasion modes are fun, coop is fun I dont think story coop is a thing but you can basically explore the map and do mini missions or just hang out theres quite a bit to do though, it is indeed seamless.Pros Great Audio Great Dialogue Great gameplay mechanics Great animations those freakin parkour animations man! Great story so far Very fun subjective, but heck, Im sure the 99 of WD2 consumers would agree! Fast travelling.. MMMMM YES MY BEAUTIFUL FAST TRAVEL FRIEND! 3 A male black character that DOESNT get seen as a crook when he walks around, but rather a stud in the eyes of civillians since theyre very friendly n stuff!CONS Theres just master volume settings for audio? You cant turn down either SFX, Voice or music specifically.. not that Ive seen anyway. But heck, I could be blind. Prooooooooobably not though. So yeah, no specific audio volume settings c Although the world itself is very live theres a lot going on and its LIT AF, along with there being a ton of stuff to do personally I think theres not enough dialogue with the main crew unless youre interacting with an OP or they let you know about a new OP, like no random chats here n there.. but thats just me I guess, to each  their own. Some people would like more dialogue among the crew outside of ops, others might not. This is more of a PERSONAL CON. All in all, a solid 10/10its ok
