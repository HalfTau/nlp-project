What kind of backwards new patch is this?! They remove over 12 songs from the game we already paid for?!And why would you go and remove 169 resolution support?!Hey Rockstar, Whats next? When all of the rights of the songs in GTA San Andreas expire, what you gonna do? Leave us a game with no soundtrack?! SMH...Thanks for ruining the game...
