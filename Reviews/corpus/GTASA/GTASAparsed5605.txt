San Andreas remains the best GTA game ever released. The sheer amount of things to do, combined with the time period they captured, ohsoperfectly, make it an experience you cant miss.Its like walking into an early 90s rap song. Regardless of the older graphics, you feel part of the world. Its not even all that big, in hindsight, but feels that way because of the density of interesting things to see and do.The story is also really good, and I quite like the radio. The country one was my favorite. Very fun to listen to while flying around.The flying cars cheat is the best cheat of all time.
