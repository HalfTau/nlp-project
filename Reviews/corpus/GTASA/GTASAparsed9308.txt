Youd think the sequel to a hit game would have better graphics, but San Andreas decided to stick with the same gfx. Its annoying. But, I feel like I now really understand the AfricanAmerican community. This game gives them a liveliness Id never even begin to imagine. Theyre just like me but more violent and they say the N word with such familiarity. Almost as if its a term of endearment.I believe this game should be a sort of documentary aimed at racists who need to view the black comunity in a different light. Once theyre finished with this game, They will realize just how similar we all are  as one huge Human Family.
