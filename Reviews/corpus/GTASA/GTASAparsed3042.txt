Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a really great game, it brings back memories and since Its able to run on my computer perfectly fine with no issues at all that is a big plus for this game, Ive no issues with the game itself other than not being able to lock onto people but that doesnt matter too much considiering this is on the PC!I would highly recommend purchasing this game for yourself or for another friend if you enjoy GTA. But please keep in mind that this is only a one player game. I believe there is something you can download to go online, I havent tried it myself but I heard its like any other GTA game.
