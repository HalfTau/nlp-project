I mean, its no Simpsons hit  run, everyone seems to like this game for nostalgia reason and that it was good at the time, but to me it doesnt seem to have aged well, but thats from a perspective of someone who didnt grow up playing this game, but I just made the nostalgic biased statement at the start, so, I see why people enjoy this.If you havent played it before, SAMP is a fun optionIf you have played it before, enjoy your nostalgia
