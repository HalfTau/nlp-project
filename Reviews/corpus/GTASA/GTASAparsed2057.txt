TLDR Best GTA with a horrible PC Port that needs modding to be as good as the PS2 version.Definitely the best GTA game there is to date. However the PC version of this game is a joke, numerous graphical features from both the PS2 version and the mobile version are missing. The widescreen option just stretches the picture without any adjustements to the HUD and while a 60 fps option is available, it brakes some parts of the game like lifting weights, sprinting, fast bike riding and swimming. Also the KM controls are completely broken with drifting being completely impossible without using a controller. Ah yeah, and they cut radio songs out because Rockstar were to cheap to prolong the licences. HOWEVER all of the here listed issues except the Keyboard controlls and the 60fps swimming are fixable by using mods which can be done quite easily by following this guide
