Personally my favorite GTA, with one of the most diverse game worlds ever created. I could write a giant essay on this one game and how awesome it is. Only problem is that this is the Steam version were talking about, which removed a lot of songs that helped give this one the personality that it achieved more then 10 years ago. Dont buy this version unless youre willing to snoop around the forums or the web to find a downgrader, patch, etc.
