I dont play this game on Steam which is why it says I have only 1 hour gameplay. I actually downgraded to version 1 so that the game works with Mods. San Andreas PC version is certainly worth picking up, the graphics still look decent, the controls are great however vehicle controls can be a little slippy depending on your mouse, takes some getting used to.As mentioned earler, this game works great with Mods. There are several websites that are dedicated to featuring the best GTA Mods which really improve the game. Take note that Steam version does not work with Mods  so you will have to downgrade the game files to version 1, which requires a free software which is downloadable online.If you prefer online games, I highly recommend you check out Samp. Its the online version of this game with many servers and chat. To use Samp you have to own GTA Sanandreas Version 1.
