Warning to windows 10 users, the mouse doesnt work in game which can be very frustrating.Easy fix which I use is after starting the game I set the Processor affinity to CPU1 which fixes the issue.This game IMHO is the best of the GTA series.Loved the story line and the depth of the game.Huge diversity of things to do in the game without it feeling like a useless feature.9/10 Due to mouse issues.
