Works bad on Windows 8.1, mouse started working again after I upgraded to 10.While this game deserves being a classic, it really did not age well. The gameplay feels clunky and the lack of any sort of quick saving or checkpoints makes some of the missions absolutely terrible. Buy Saints Row 2, its the best GTA anyway.
