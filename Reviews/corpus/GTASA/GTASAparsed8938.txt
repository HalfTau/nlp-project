Dont get me wrong this is an amazing game on console but on pc it is god awful the controls are horrid and it has been poorly ported over to pc and is therefore plagued with glitches and bug its unbearable and to be perfectly honest it hasnt aged well even at the time the graphics were not seen as very good. And unfortunately the nostalgia isnt enough to get you through this game and it is not worth the price in fact it isnt even worth the space it uses on youre hard drive this is from a massive gta fan. DONT BUY THIS GAME FOR PC !!! !
