San Andreas. I remember playing this game back when I was young. I was like 13/14 when I first played this game back in the day. I never owned a copy. But my cousin and friend did. A few years later I got it on PS2 And iPad But nothing beats the console version of the game.Sure it was low quilty and bulky. But thats what made it great. Now with it on PC it feels a little better with a Graphics HD mod.But Ill never forget where it all started on console. And even though I play more on PC now. I still have time for the consoles.Old and New..
