Grand Theft Auto San Andreas ReviewThis Game was My childhood Game, still remember all the cheats now 10 years down the line. the amount of time i played this game flipping cars,having police chases, Hitting cars with zero gravity and stealing planes. this game was far by the best GTA there is, would love a remaster or even put GTA 6 to a similar style hungry,thirsty,sex apeall,relationshipsonly thing that lets this game down now is the Graphics otherwise would be playing it constley. highly reccomend for hours of fun. 9/10
