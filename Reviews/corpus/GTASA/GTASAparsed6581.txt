This version of the game does not meet the franchises typical standards. The graphics are lame and do not even equal the quality of those on display in the Steam store. Apparently the new patch has stripped the PC version of the game of everything that makes the PC a superior gaming machine. I played for approximately 10 minutes before deleting the game. IT was simply too painful.
