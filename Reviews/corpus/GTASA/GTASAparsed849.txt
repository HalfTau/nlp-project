San Andreas in my opinion was a better game than GTA IV.  Game play was very similiar to Vice City with several improvements to the depth of the game.  I loved fighting for territory with other gangs  as with Vice City the storyline, voice actors, radio stations,  vehicle controls are superior.  Unfortunately I have a glitch that only allows me to play on Steam until it rains in the game environment.  Luckily I still have a DVD copy  can still get my fix, however because of the playability issues which may be mine alone, Im unable to recommend the Steam version at this time.  Im running Win7 64bit with an i7 processor, overclocked graphics card, 8gb memory,  SSD HD.
