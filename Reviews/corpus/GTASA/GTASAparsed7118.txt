Since going V3 and not allowing us to use SAMP. San Andreas is pointless, not to mention they took out mostalready from the orginal. Rock stars sucks as devoplment and Im never buying another game off them. SAMP was like 90 since its gone, so will everyone one else who bought this  steam version. you rock star and hope to god this company goes under.
