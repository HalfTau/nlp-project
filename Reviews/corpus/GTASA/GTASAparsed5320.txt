My actual playtime for this game is offrecord, based off of the years I spent on it via disk when I didnt actually own Steam.I would say 300 hours playtime.San Andreas remains to be my favourite of the series. Great story, great music. Full character customisation The map is gloriously huge, with 3 different ambient settings Huge variety of side quests and tasks Character skill building via gym. RPG element is GO.KRose remains to be my favourite radio station. Everyone else in my house as a child hated KRose.Or at least my singing to KRose. Or maybe it was just repeating the whole thing over and over in a badly imitated accent, including the pool table birth part.One of my favourite things to do was see how many vehicles I could destroy by parking my car in the middle of the road and shooting the gas tank. Youd be surprised how many people need eye tests. I swear another 10 cars would drive right into that thing without stopping.Best way to make cash, ever.The 5star police chases when I flew my plane over area 69, resulting in a hasty parachute down in a complete panic, were intense.One of the most comfortable games to play ever. If you havent tried GTA before, I recommend playing this one before GTA V.
