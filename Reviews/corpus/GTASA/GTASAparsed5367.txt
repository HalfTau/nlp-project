GTA San Andreas is... old, but gold. An amazing gaming, awesome storyline, great gameplay and the best part is  you can run this game on almost every computer. Also lets not forget you got all yo homies lookin out for you. D 10/10  Ballas are scum. I highly recommend you buy this game. Its a classic.
