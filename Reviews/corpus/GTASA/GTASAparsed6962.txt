This game is ok. It hasnt aged well. Graphics look horrid.My main gripe with this is with all GTAs. They micromanage how you complete missions. You must use a certain car. If the car is destroyed, mission failed. That may be a minor thing to most, but for me in breaks the immersion. It also adds an artificial difficulty, because the missions are usually too easy to begin with.
