It aged poorly and the pc port is a very flawed one, but it really is one game Ill always come back to. Great characters, good story to run though, fantastic map and a lot of challenging activities to do as well. The thing I cant get over however is that the game runs into minor physics issues when not running at the locked 25fps mode, like not being able to dive when not using this absurdly low framerate figure. Really high framerates, what a modern machine would run at uncapped, even stop your car from going backwards.
