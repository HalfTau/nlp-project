The GTA San Andreas is for me. One of the best 3d GTA games. the characters is unique from big smoke to the truth to officer tenpenny. The missions itself is fun, some not so fun bit frustating, but it adds to the game, from chasing trains to breaking into area 69 to steal a jetpack. I have most of the GTA games but i always come back to San Andreas.
