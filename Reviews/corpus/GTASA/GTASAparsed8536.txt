GTA SA is the best GTA game ever released imo. It has a very good, sort of emotional story line. Theres tons of things to do. Rockstar says GTA V has the most massive map ever, but once you play this, youll notice a lot more, as GTA SA has 3 cities  the country and 4 Airports, while GTA V only has 1 city  the country and 2 Airports. As for the people saying negative about the controls, theyre really not that bad once you get used to them and bind them to the correct keys. Also, there are tons of mods out there including multiplayer, but youll have to downgrade to v1.0 to play it. I dont suggest modding singleplayer until you finish the game or dont care to finish the game, as some mods can screw up the missions like they did for me. Id give it a 9/10 just because the controls were bunky at first, but I really recommend this game for hardcore GTA fans especially if you played it on the PS2 back in the day. The experience is much better on PC. The render distance mod is probably my favorite, I love seeing all of the cities from the sky.
