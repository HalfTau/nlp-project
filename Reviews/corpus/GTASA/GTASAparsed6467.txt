torrent thislatest update ruined everything. fixed resolutions, and they removed 20 songs from the original game because Rockstar i guess was lazy enough not relicense the rights to them.basically the only way to enjoy this game on pc is to torrent an old patch, play that and install SAMP to play online, otherwise youre better off playing the console versions. which is sad because the pc port was at once the best port of them all
