Well this final version for the GTA 3rd Generation RenderWare Engine series appears to be at the limit for more powerful GFX and advanced gameplay. All I can say is maybe avoid using cheats that will ruin your stats as well spoil this game too often. Trust me you best exploring this city game for yourself, without magic.They are some unofficial patches that can enhance this game further to fix those long term abandoned bugs and DirectDraw fixes. This game works best with Frame Rate Limit locked at 30FPS as CJ cannot swim and dive properly when the FPS is not locked at 30.But if you want to risk and improve your adventure with those unofficial patches, use those link downloads at your own risk!
