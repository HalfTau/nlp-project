damn, age is not a problem for this game. So much effort put into it. Ive played all gta games, and I have to say that this game has the most features, ad its  so customisable. Huge world to travel and SO MANY places to discover, so many hookers and crIminals Tto kill . This game really makes you feel like a gangster in the 90s.Btw i have played this game fully years ago,i just bought it again cuz why not !
