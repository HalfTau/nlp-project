To be honest, there is nothing about this game that I could say I dislike, other than the impossibility of modding, but GTA SA is a very solid game, with a strong storyline and numerous weapons at Carls disposal, as well as a wide selection of cars, motorbikes and bicycles, there is something in San Andreas for everyone to enjoy! Just not the kids! I could easily spend years happily kicking cops asses, and all that Just has a tendancy to crash on some Windows 8 PCs.
