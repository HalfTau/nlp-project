Honestly The BEST Grand Theft Auto game ever created! In My OpinionI would have more hours on this game but I recently bought this in the Summer of 2016 and transfered my saves over to the steam version.Personally I prefer this map over GTA Vs map because it feels A LOT bigger then GTA V although that is only due to the complicated road system that San Andreas had.The Story is pretty good! Takes place in 1992 during the Crack Cocaine epidemic during the 90s and takes real events from the LA Riots and the CRASH Scandle. Although the game seems pretty ghetto, thats only in the VERY beginning and VERY end of the game!I also prefer the gameplay over Vs gameplay. Carl is more customizable than Michael, Franklin, or Trevor. As Carl, you can upgrade your skills RPG style like getting stronger or if you want to be a fat man then you can be a fat man or if you want to be some buff guy then you can totally be a buff guy. If you want to learn karate then you can learn karate and use that fight style or if you prefer to be a wrestler then you can be a wrestler! There is also Gun stats which increases your accuracy with a all of your guns unlike GTA V where it just says shooting. In this case to increase your stats for guns, you have to use a gun in the same categorye.g. Pistol/Rifle etc which increases from gangster to hitman. Also, the more you drive, the more the driving stat goes up making it easier to drive and deducing the percentage of not colliding into other cars/objectsSame goes for bikes and planes.I dont think we need to talk about graphics.One last thing... a few years back, Rockstar made a patch removing songs and deleting old saves. This can all be fixed from downloading a downgrader patch which doesnt only fix the songs but also lets you install mods again.Oh... And One Last Note. Rockstar, you should actually remaster this game! It would be much better than GTA V and make no sense for a GTA VI to come out.
