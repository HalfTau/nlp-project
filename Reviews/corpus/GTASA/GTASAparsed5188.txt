This is my Steam review on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, lets start by saying that even for a game made in October of 2004 it is a very good video game. Created by Rockstar Games, and I love playing it I personally love doing the singleplayer campaign then working my way over to Multi Theft Auto. I also like installing modded police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and last but not least skins. If anyone asked me Shall I buy Grand Theft Auto San Andreas or Grand Theft Auto V? Id reply go with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. It is not that I dislike Grand Theft Auto V but personally I feel there is more of an oppurtunity to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. I also feel there is more of a challenge to the game itself let me be honest I have beat Grand Theft Auto V Several times as for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas I have never beat it. I try so hard an work for so long I never actually get around to reaching the end I also feel there is a way more detailed story to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas then there is to Grand Theft Auto V.
