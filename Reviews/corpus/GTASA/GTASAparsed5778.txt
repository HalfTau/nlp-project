Great Game, Really good storyline with lots of cool characters and fun stuff to do, there are a few anoying missions. However, they are not to difficult. Although, the the remastered version isnt availible for PC the graphics are still pretty goodfor a game this old, especially when optimised. Even once youve completed the story there are still some fun things to do such as taking over gang territories and taking part in races. The music on the radio is and great and the map is huge with lots of places to explore. If all of that isnt good enough you still have a load of fun with the cheats on the game like flying cars. So when ever theres a sale i recommend you pick this up. 9.5/10
