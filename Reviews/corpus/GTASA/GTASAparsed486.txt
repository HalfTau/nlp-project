The game is good,love it,and brings back some old memories,but it has a LOT of bugs. I wont count them now but there are bugs,and it wouldnt be bad to bring out a small update fixing these bugs,because some of them are really annoying. I know its 2017,very few of the people still play it and rockstar doesnt give aabout the game,but still. But all in all still fun messing around with cheats and playing the missions.
