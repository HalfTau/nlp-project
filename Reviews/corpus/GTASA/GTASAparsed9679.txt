I have trouble picking which one of GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas is my favourite, because they are all genius games, but for being an upgrade of the previous titles, this might just be the best one. It keeps the elements of its forerunners that made them great, and adds a brilliant story, a massive world and weeks and days of gameplay.Protip get this game.The multiplayer mod is worth checking out, but that goes for the other titles just as much.
