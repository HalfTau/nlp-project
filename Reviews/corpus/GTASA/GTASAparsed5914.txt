As of right now I do not recommend this game because of the recent updates.I was never planning on modding this game, I bought it cheap just so I could relive it again, and quit once I felt satisfied. However, I cannot play this game at all due to the updates. The mouse controls are totally broken and the only solution is to mod the game. But I cant install the mod that fixes the game unless I remove the updates, and I cant remove the updates unless I install a downgrader. This adds a few extra gigs and some extra download time. YAY!Because of Rockstars incompetence and/or laziness I need to download 2 mods JUST TO PLAY THE GAME AS INTENDED.My suggestion would be to dig up an old console version of the game instead.
