Wow, just wow.Grand Theft Auto PC ports are very well known for being a mess and any Rockstar port for that matter, including the Max Payne 3 port that people acclaim for no reason but to change an ALREADY mediocre port well, unless you frame capped it at 30fps, which made it pretty good and make it WORSE? And to do so TEN YEARS after release? Thats just not smart man! First off, lets talk about how bad the port ALREADY WAS. First off, most of these issues can be countered with a simple frame cap. But lets get to them. First issue Getting stuck on bridges and objects you wont get stuck on in the PlayStation 2 or Original Xbox ports. This was ridiculous, and often times when going into fort carson from the railroad bridge, Id get STUCK.
