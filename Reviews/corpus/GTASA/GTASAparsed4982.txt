Having been a fan of the series since GTA III, and seeing that each game has its own pros and cons not excluding this one, I have to admit GTA San Andreas is still my favorite.  The stoyline / voice acting is arguably the best in the series, with no shortage of wacky characters as youd come to expect from a Rockstar game.  Plently of diverse missions and locations to explore a massive map for its time with exellent character customization.I only recently purchased San Andreas on Steam but have sunk countless hours since its intial release on the PS2.  Its definitely worth the price tag for this classic, and a nobrainer if you happen upon it on sale.
