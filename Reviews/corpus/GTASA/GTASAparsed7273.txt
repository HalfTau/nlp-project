Ive had a phyiscal disc of this game for a long time now, and purely for convenience I picked it up on Steam a while ago. However, the recent update essentially stripped content and broke saves. As of this time I recommend pirating the game instead of purchasing it on Steam, because right now you would be paying the same amount for less content than you would have gotten a few months ago. Either that or find a used copy on Ebay. I have tried contacting Rockstar on the issue and of course they havent replied at all. Rockstar has gone on my list of companies to not buy games from anymore, right next to Ubisoft and EA... so good going with that. Wonder how much content they will remove from GTA IV/V in a few years.
