Possibly the best game Ive ever played. An awesome game unmodded, and even better modded, that is, if you know how to downgrade it from the unmoddable steam version. Lots of nostalgia.The graphics arent the best thing in the world,  but the good gameplay and stellar storyline more than make up for it. A classic in gaming, and a mustbuy.
