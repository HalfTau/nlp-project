The best GTA, second to Vice City.I have played all GTAs since the first one, and there is something about GTASA that makes me come back. The world, the characters, the music, the challenges, the gameplay, the culture, the catchphrases, there are so many special things about this one. There is a genuine sense of freedom and progression through the game.I would love to see some kind of remastering of this one with high resolution textures and models.
