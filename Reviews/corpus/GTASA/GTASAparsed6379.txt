Game crashes when you are messing with the files.Its a great game but....Rockstar needs to make it the following happen.1 and formostIt needs achievements and Cards for this game. No ifs ands and butts.2.It needs to have a Steam Workshop embedded into this game. Should be simple to do right? I mean its kinda a pain in the  to try a mod this with higher graphical detail then its current Steam version has.3.Fix all the known problems that causes the game to glitch and crash on play. Needs to be fixed up but at the same time let it be more Mod friendly to streamline all the mods.And I mean all of them in the GTA community no matter how Suggestive they may be. Its a 18 game is it not? Make it one.4. Aside from the top things I said before. Please allow RockStar Official Servers into making Multiplayer for this game. It would be outragous and fun at the same time. Oh but disable the MP Codes kay?If Rockstar can do all this and update it to a point where its previous version can allow modding to it. Do it and make it so. Because I cant afford redownloading this game again on my Satellite. As well as the many mods that are needed for its Prime version.
