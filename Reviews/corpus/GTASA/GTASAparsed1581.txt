A true classic, completely brilliant. I played it on console originally, when it released for the original XBOX. At the time, I was 7 and only played it to drive the cars around, not knowing I held an amazing storyline in my hands. Since then, my XBOX has been lost, as well as my console copy.I decided to buy this game again. Im 18 now, and more understanding of this games potential. The nostalgic effect I get when playing this game is crazy. Highly recommended and Samuel L. Jacksons performance as Officer Tenpenny is great, I can recognize his voice anywhere.
