This is a castrated Version of GTA SA with missing modsupport and cutoutfeatures.17 song tracks have been removed by radios.Express Yourself,Woman to woman etc. due to expired song trackswhile this is not as bad as it sounds, as you can easily put your own music into the game, its still a sign of lazyness and brandingt! Modding makes the game glitch out modding is a PAIN IN THEbr no Steam Workshop Support. according to the Forums a framelimiter breaks many missions in this gameGood luck trying to install some HIghRes and ENBmods.The game itself is plagued by clunky driving and flyingcontrols mousesteering isnt disabled by default!! !.You would guess they did at least get that right in a game mainly revolving around driving and shooting, but no.The Main Character is out of breath after 5 seconds of running and youll have to go weightlifting with QTEs to run a second longer.Also it lacks funny and extreme characters like in GTA IV and V! thisI am out of here!
