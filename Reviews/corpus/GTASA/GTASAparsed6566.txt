There is not much else left to be said about Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.  It is one of the greatest games ever made and it pretty much left us all speechless when it came out. Its funny how after SO many years, I can easily remember the map and even where all the hidden items and guns were located. Countless hours, countless mods and all the countless stories we made up as we were playing this game as kids... Thats something hard to forget. The map feels huge, the music is amazing and the gameplay is great. All the customization, minigames, hidden items, vehicles, landscapes, the driving schools, the war gangs... There are just too many things this game does right. After playing it recently, the missions and races that I found almost impossible are a piece of cake now. Nevertheless, they are still a lot of fun. As for how the game looks, yeah, well, it does look kind of old now the game was released in 2004! but a few texture packs here, an enb there and a mod here, and youve got yourself a beautiful looking game.Regarding the recent patch... Yeah, it sucks, but I wouldnt personally punish the game rating it bad as everyone seems to be doing. I wouldnt want anyone missing this game just because of the patch. Just use a downgrader to get it back to 1.0 and there you go! All the amazing songs that used to be in the original game are back and you can add a few extra mods. Takes less than 10 minutes. Enjoy your stay in San Andreas!
