WASD! Responsive controls, good action, smooth animations.PvP features a 4v4v4 layout with a few different maps that change node layouts to cap flags / gather resources on. Interesting concept that leaves your team learning when exactly to give and take.2 PvE modes including Horde Mode and Scout Missions with multiple locations / reward tiers / boss battles that offer good replayability. Gotta beat that clock!Classic infected characters from the Dead Island series that we all love, including the Butcher and Ram.4 characters currently now with ultimate abilities and individual persistent leveling. Characters feel unique and BALANCED, but would like to see more variety similar to the ones in alpha.Account leveling / workbench leveling now implemented to let you craft higher tiered weapons and increase character strength. Workbench also now lets you use gold to easily craft weapon blueprints you have without having all of the required materials.F2P! As of this post nothing in the shop that breaks gameplay so that is a huge plus.Game is constantly being updated and some core features have changed drastically since then so my review may differ.
