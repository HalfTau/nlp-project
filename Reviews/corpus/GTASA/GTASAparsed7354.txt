So this game is amazing that just goes without saying but sadly the new update for the game is absolute If youre going to get this either pirate it, find an old copy or get a downgrader or else youre stuck with plasticy graphics and the removal of 18 great songs from the game. But if youre willing to put up with all that then sure buy it but remember. No modding for you. Only v1 and v1.01 allow modding. Other than that I give v1 and v1.01 10s all across the board, v2 gets like an 8 for no mod support, and v3 gets like a 5 for making the game look plasticy and cartoonish andalso lack of songs and no mod support.
