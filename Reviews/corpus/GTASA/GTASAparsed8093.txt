San Andreas really is an amazing game, but there are two major flaws. The first is the fact that while playing, your mouse can deactivate suddenly. Im not the only one with this issue, infact most people have it and there seems to be no  longterm solution. Sometimes you can pause and unpause to reacctivate it, or other times it simply stays dead. Secondly, the controls simply do not work with PC, and it has no controller compatibility. Both of these things make this game, sadly, unplayable. I recommend the game, just not on this platform.
