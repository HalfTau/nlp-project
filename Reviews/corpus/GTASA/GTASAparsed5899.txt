Are you having an obsolete or low spec PC? Are you looking for some good game for some small money? Are you an open world games fan? Are you an oldschool gamer?This is the game for you!GTA San Andreas  My first GTA Game i played for real and, a game I probably dont need to introduce to anyone, unless they either spent last 15 years in a cave, or with no computer, or simply were doing time in slammer for murder. A Game that probably anyone who calls himself a gamer knows.This is game that really got me into games like this. I was around 8 years old when i played it for the first time Im 17 as I write this review,And I instantly loved that game. This game is 10 euros but gives as much or more fun as those expensive new titles.Now to the real deal.Graphics? Probably best you could get in 2005.Gameplay? Fascinating, amazing and immersive.Character customization? You name it you got it  Tattoos, haircuts, Clothes, martial arts, and, whats impressive for such an old game, Fat and muscle levels which actually affect protagonists body in pretty much real time.Story? Dear authors...y u no hollywood yet?Easter eggs? Of course! Pretty good ones, its a rockstars game afterall.Bugs? yep, they happen, however nothing really disturbing unless it happens excessively which appears to happen rarely.Modding? Sure thing. There are tons of good mods, scripts, models, textures etc. Youll just need to downgrade the game since usual steam version cant be modded.Map? Pretty big and well detailed with lots of interesting places.Soundtrack? Really good, eventhough I mostly listen to rap, I enjoy listening to almost any radio station in the game.Worth the price? How do you even dare to ask? Absolutely yes!In short  Get this game. You wont regret it. Total 10/10.Any questions? Let me know in the comments.Thank you for reading.
