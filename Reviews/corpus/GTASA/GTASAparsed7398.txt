So I finished playing this again a couple of months ago... It was nice, and kinda nostalgic. I played this during my college days and was addicted with it, lol.Then theres the update. I said Oh, rockstars cooking something good, I see? Was gonna play it again, but...I was wrong. Rockstar has just gutted this game like a fish. Gone are tracks I liked, and save games dont !!! work.Screw you Rockstar. Who knows when youll pull some crazylike this, AGAIN.
