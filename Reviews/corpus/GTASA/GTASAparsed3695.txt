Last update Rockstar put out broke it. It literally does not work for me, it crashes on pauses and mouse doesnt respond unless its at max sensitivity. They also removed a lot of songs because they lost the license to them.Buy a physical copy if possible or get it elsewhere, just dont buy it on Steam.
