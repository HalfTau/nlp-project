Phenomenal game.Ive played about 7 hours for the past two days and Ive been enjoying it much more than GTA V and IV,runs perfectly fine on a potato computer I love the fact how you have the decision to buy a property, therefor making you work hard for it, amazing.I sort of like the idea of three different cities in one game, Las venturas, San Fierro, and Los Santos, however it fails at making it a massive map, I can get to las venturas in about 3 minutes or so.
