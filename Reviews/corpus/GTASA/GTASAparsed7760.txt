A timeless classic, still played today. Dont play the other GTAs, Unless its GTA 4, TBOGT, GTA V, or Vice City and then never play this. This game is too good to ever go outdated, I reccomend buying it, if you have a Windows 8, its a hassle to install. Not really, it takes like 1 step, but installing mods on the other hand is a pain in the rear So I really reccomend you buy GTASA, for 15 dollars even though I bought it from the Rockstar Game Sale its worth every dollar.
