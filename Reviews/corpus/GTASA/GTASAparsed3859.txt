Though this game may have bad graphics, it is a good time killer. This game has many interesting cheats. This game is not hard on your potato pc. If you like oldschool or open world games with many hidden features and easter eggs, this is your game. Just make sure to buy this game on sale.This is Chuck Norris, and I approve of GTA San Andreas.
