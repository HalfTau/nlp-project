I got the game because ive enjoyed other renditions, however it is a huge let down, because there is no way to look around. all you can see is a front view. which locks so even when you tur around instead of seeing whats infront of you you only see the face of your character. i looked in the controls and couldnt find a button setup that allowed that. also the aiming shoul dhave been set up to use the mouse, it is not, I had high hopes, and at this point all i can say is that Surgeon Simulator is easier to control and manuver than this game.
