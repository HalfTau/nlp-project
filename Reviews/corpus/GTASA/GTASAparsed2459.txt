easily the greatest gta game out there. atmospheric, open map, while still keeping a tightknit feel. the dialogue is memorable, between cutscenes and random pedestrian oneliners. my friends and i, who have all played this game immensely, still refer to obscure quotes from this game, which proves that this game is memorable in even the small aspects.the customization is great. making your own car with cesar, or dressing cj in different outfits. one of my favorite aspects of this game is creating nice outfits for cj. tattoos, clothing, jewelry, vehicles, you name it. you can mold it to how you see fit.the story in this game is one of the best ive ever played through. the twists and turns, how expansive it is. as cliche as it sounds, you never really can guess where itll lead you next. to remain spoilerfree, ill just leave it at that. the story is incredible and you will have a hard time putting the game down.the one singular stain on this game doesnt come until very late in the game, but the flying missions, such as learning to fly, n.o.e., and freefall, are awful. the airplane controls are very, very clunky, and they may make you procrastinate finishing them depending on if you have as hard of a time as i did with them. a very small stain on a perfect game, and it doesnt lessen the games overall quality.this game also has an incredible amount of things to do within free roam. whether youre out driving around and taking scenic pictures of the atmospheric, low poly landscapes, or maybe youre imagining your own story lines, this game wont leave you bored outside of the missions.all in all, to me, this game is EASILY a solid 9.510/10. one of my favorite games of all time, and for good reason. ive played this game for nearly 100 hours on pc, and anywhere between 20003000 on my ps2 way back in the day. i honestly recommend this game, wholeheartedly, as i view it as an essential play for anyone with a steam account.
