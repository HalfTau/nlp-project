Grand Theft Auto San AndreasThis game is one of the greatest Grand Theft Autos to date, coming in at a close second behind the recent Grand Theft Auto V. A gripping story of street life and living in the Hoods, you play as Carl Johnson, grove street gang member. The plotline follows him and his homies Ryder, Big Smoke and Sweet, throughout the country, desert and 3 cities. There are lots of blockbuster main missions and side tasks to complete, along with girlfriends to date who provide some very useful abilities. Drivebys, vehicle stunts, plane hijacking and flying, stealth, shooting, gang wars  you name it this game has it! Gigantic selection of weapons, with RPG elements of leveling  the more you utilise a gun, the more accustomed you become to it, improving accuracy and damage, or even unlocking dual wielding for pistols, uzis, tec9s and more. To add to this, you can build muscle at the gym for more melee damage, or eat till youre obese at fast food restaurants. There is a nice chunk of customisation in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, with plenty of clothes, hats, jewellery and other accessories to personalise your character. Around 30 hours content for the singleplayer story, although there is definitely more for first time players, with many hidden collectibles to find. Incredible assortment of radio station music, even the country channels are good. The graphics are old and it definitely shows, but it shouldnt detract too much from the enjoyment. They are what you would expect from a game released in 2004. None!Overall Score 9.5/10Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is one of my fondest childhood memories. Truly an infallible game for its time and well worth picking up.
