Awesome game, a childhood memory for me and a classic for any gamer out there.But BUGS, BUGS AND MORE BUGS on the PC version is not so good, after a lot of restarts and downgrades and silent patches, i gave up and uninstalled without finishing it.I dont know if i can recommend the PC version to anyone, but this game on consoles i would recommend to everyone. Its unique.
