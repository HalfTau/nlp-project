Khm, only 1 bad thing about this game, lack of cover mechanic, but hey, that is modern game standard. Also, 1 other thing i can think of is every time you fail a mission you have to restart it from the mission starting point, that is kinda, meh..Even then, this game is better than atleast 50 of 2016 games.Edit  7/1/2016Game crashes after you alttab too much and for some reason, mods dont work. Still awesome game, and a good purchase, especially during sales.Edit 18/6/2017After TakeTwo Interactive issued a Cease and Desist order to developers of a modding tool for GTA called OpenIV, I cannot in my right state of mind recommend this game, but yet, I would like to point out this is TakeTwos fault, NOT Rockstars.Rockstar actively supported and promoted modding and certain mods appeared even on their official blog.
