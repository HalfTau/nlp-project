There is nothing quite like soaring over Las Venturas in a Hydra jumpjet to the tune of Billy Idols White Wedding... ah nostalgia.This will always be one of my favourite toys.I havent viewed San Andreas as a game for many years, though it is a very good one by most counts, IF and its a big if you can ignore/tollerate the disgraceful language, sex and drug references.Despite the vulgar reputation of the series, GTASA will always be one of the most prized jewels in my collection for its unmatchable sandbox beauty.This is a must have in my opinion. A true gaming classic.
