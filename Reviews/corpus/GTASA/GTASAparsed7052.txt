I got this game by prepurchasing the GTA V.I cant explain how awesome is to replay this game again. I played alot when I was a child the nonsteam version, multiplayer and so on. Playing now this game ... woke up so many funny moments... I remember when I was 12 years old. I came from school and play gta san andreas till my mother get home...I hope the GTA V will be the same heart game for me !100/10 for this lovely game!
