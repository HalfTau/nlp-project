This is one of my all time favorite games. The freedom of running around in a huge world with so many fun things to do and create your own fun is incredible. I am strongly against altering a game in a way that degrades the experience also without users consent. Several songs were removed without consent of the customers. Imagine if this were any other medium. Imagine if you put your favorite movie into your player and they removed songs from your copy that you purchased. This is something users should not stand for. There needs to be protection for both artists and consumers from this type of treatment. Your artistic creation should remain intact as you intended it to be and the consumer should be confident that the latest knee jerk reaction to some event wont be able to automatically steal or censor your content. Make no mistake, this behavior will continue and only get worse unless we stand up for our rights.
