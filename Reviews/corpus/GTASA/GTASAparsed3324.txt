Probably not my favorite, since I played GTA 3 and Vice City way before this one, and I like those more out of nostalgia?. Obligatory flying missions just suck, the controls are really bad for PC. Still, its a good game, the story is pretty lengthy and you can spend hours just fooling around.Edit Wanted to play it again, then remembered why the fing steam version sucks. You cant play it in 1080p the game crashes, songs were deleted from a few radio stations, the game crashes on dual motiro setup when cars explode, savegames dont work, etc. So if I want to play the game, I have to downgrade. Oh, okay, thanks...you s. Also, thanks Gaben, much love.
