Where should I even start. The large open map, multiple side missions, great story and a wide variety of haracters, the awesome radio stations and funny commentary. I first played this game when I was 12, 8 years later and Im still playing and loving it. May not have the graphics of GTA V but GTA SA has, in its own way solidified itself as one of the greatest games of all time
