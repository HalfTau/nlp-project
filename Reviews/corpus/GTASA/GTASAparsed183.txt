This game is a very big legend, and everyone knows it. But what it bothers me is that people are writing reviews where they say this is the worst version of the game, on steam. That is true, but not entirely. What I mean by that? 1920x1080 support. Many people claim they dont have this resolution in the game. But this aint true, because I tried it and it really is there. And it works fine. Before you write a review, make sure not to lie, there are lots of people who wants to buy this game on steam and play it.
