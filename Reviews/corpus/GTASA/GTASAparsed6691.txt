One of my Personal Favourites of all time GTASA is the successor to GTAVC and GTA III, and persoanly owns both of the previous 2 games asses Not saying theyre bad GTASA has you playing as CJ or Carl Johnson who recently had his mother murdered in a driveby from the ballas in a green Sabre Its the name of one of the cars not a sword. So he comes home for her funeral to find out,is ed up so he stays to cleanup......Honestly the song removals dont matter, its not like they removed the whole soundtrack.In all honesty if you dont have this game, GET IT.......
