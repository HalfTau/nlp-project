ok, So i love the game but there are a few minor problems..... when I drive a car the drive button on my playstation 3 controller is X, isnt it supposed to be R2? I was just wondering when that will be fixed because To me it Ruins the fun of the game, when i tryed to fix it, it kept overighting another control on the settings so. if anything, please respond.But all of that aside, I strongly recommend this game This is money well spent!
