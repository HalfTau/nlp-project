Let me just tell you before I start complaining I LOVE this game. My favorite from the GTA franchise, to be precise, but theres one thing that made me refund the game.First thing I do after launching the game for the first time is adjust the settings. Theres one problem, though. To get a satisfying 60 FPS I must disable frame limiter which I can do without issues. This is where the problem reveals itself. Although the game runs smoothly, when driving a vehicle, it seems as if the brakes are constantly used. After several hours of trying to solve the problem, practically nothing has changed.I will still give it a thumbs up. Theres literally no other reason why I chose to refund.
