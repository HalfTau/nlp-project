This game is really great for anyone who loves GTA games. The gang aspect is really fun and I love how gangster I feel listening to Los Santos Radio while blasting rival gang members in a driveby. If the gameplay doesnt cut it for you, personally I love to just sit there and watch the crazy AI go insane!
