I love me some grand theft auto, but this steam version of this is pretty bad faults with it. The game is great from a story/gameplay standpoint, but many bugs have caused me to dislike my experience so far.First thing I noticed was the controller support in the options, which originally I thought was great, but failed to work properly from the start. You can do few things with a 360 pad and the setup is so asinine, it feels nothing like how it originally played on playstation. You cant move the camera for starters, unless you have a 3rd arm so you can also use the mouse, youll have problems as well.Secondly, the resolutions that are put in there are all outdated, It cannot display 1080p unless mods are used to unpatch the game. This is what I find really silly, in the 1.1 and 1.0 version of the game, 1080p and several other resolutions that were available are now removed in the 3.X version of the game. It would be understandable since it is an old game after all, but they were there originally, why remove them?Finally the framerate. With the framelimiter put in place, the maximum FPS you can get is 24 which is god awful to look at. You can remove the limiter with the simple toggle of an option, BUT when you do, the physics of the game start going ape Cars bounce all over the place and just try swimming in water. Again, theres probably some mods out there that can fix this issue, but I shouldnt have to do that. I shouldnt have to spend hours of my time researching, downloading and installing mods into my game to make it run well.With all that said, if you can stomach playing GTAsa at 720p, 24fps, and no gamepad, this game should work fine.Final score10/10 for the story/gameplay4/10 for the amount of fixing that needs to be done to the game.Maybe a 8/10 with the inclusion of mods.
