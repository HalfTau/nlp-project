Hello everyone. I dont understood why so much people are hating this game? This game is one of the best that I have played. Very challenging missions, cool guns stuff, and the driving schools, even a Las Vegas! I had so much fun on this game  I completed it in a week  , and I dont think that this game is Im not using mods, but I dont need it, because the game is fun without it. If you want to play GTA V, buy it, dont try to mod GTA San Andreas and then say how much this game is Thanks to Rockstar company, I really love this game, and I love chasing Tennpenny in Los Santos which was obessed of riot  Mission the end of the line . Dont stop creating GTA!
