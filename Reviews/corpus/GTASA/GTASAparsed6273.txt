GTA San Andreas is the best game ever, but dont buy it on Steam... The new version removed lots of songs from the game, and it screwed up resolution settings... and seriousely, why do i need to enable frame limiter and play at 26 fps to dive underwater when i could do that in old versions with frame limiter off and 300 fps ??! i spent a lot of time on this game, but the last update destroyed it...
