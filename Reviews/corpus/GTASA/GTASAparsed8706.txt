Pros Unlike GTA3 and VC, this has proper third person shooter mechanics. Immense customization. Hilarious satire. Wellwritten characters, dialogwith James Woods, Samuel L. Jackson and David Cross in roles perfect for them and plot. Great RPG elements, and theyre largely optional. Missions are welldesigned, memorable and fun. Tense without being unbeatable.Cons Graphics are washed out, and when its dark and in a small enclosed areatunnel or alley, it can get straining to look at. Camera too often needs manual adjustment. Flying is still tough and its necessary to complete the game  there is a flight school, but its too restrictive, linear and you have to go through it before you get to fly muchand once you finally do get past the school, you start actually learning and getting a feel for the planes and helicopters.My recommendation If you enjoy the GTA series, you have got to play this.
