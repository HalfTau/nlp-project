The original, San Andreas is my favorite GTA game. It is inexpensive and very replayable, the game has its glitches, but compared to the consoles it is better in every way, altough I am biased and enjoy this game regardless of its flaws and I beleive it has more potential. A remake of this game with modern graphics and sound would be great.
