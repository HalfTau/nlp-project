This game is good, even though it has already aged through the waves of time, it is still a good game, specially if you are looking to play multiplayer.And with this, I advise you to use the Downgrader. Even if you are not playing multiplayer.It fixes many things, you can still mods, and etc.Id have more hours recorded if I wasnt forced to start through 1.0s exe.
