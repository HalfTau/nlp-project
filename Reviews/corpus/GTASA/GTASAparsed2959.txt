One of the best stories in GTAThe real difference between this and Vice City is that this has much more customization. And a more real Open world since Vice City was mostly linear and you couldnt do much when you explore the map.The only problem I have with the new customization in the cars is that, once its abandoned or blown up, its gone forever. So its kind of useless, since you cant take it on missions and the only real use is showboating to the NPCs.This game introduced the aiming mechanic to the GTA series. Where if you hold down one button, you aim, and the other button shoots it, instead of GTA 3 or Vice City where you have to shoot nonstop to aim where you want.Overall, if youre looking for a classic between the good old GTA games then this is the most memorable.Ahhh, San Andreas, home of the Big Smoke memes.
