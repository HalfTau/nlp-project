Its so nostalgic to play this game still the best GTA game of all time in my opinion. The story is flawless and has Big smoke the fat black guy that uses baseball bats to assualt people what a guy. This was more or less my childhood game right here and it still holds that old glory back in 2004 when I played it originally.
