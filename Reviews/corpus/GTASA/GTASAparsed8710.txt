Amazing probably the best GTA game to this date, definitly not the best game graphicly because it was released in early 2005 P but gameplay wise you never run out of things to do, getting 100 completion will by far take you months, and the map is endlessly big with 3 cities Los Angeles, San Fransisco, and Las Vegas, the woods that are filled with myths and creatures, and a desert complete with Area 51 . Overall if you are looking for a fun game get this or GTA 5, I give this game a definite 10/10.
