Easily one of the best games ive ever seen. If youve only just joined the GTA bandwagon make sure you stop off at all the previous titles to see where it all began. A great map with 3 cities and PLENTY inbetween along with good missions and enough to do in free time. Grab it cheap in a sale like I did  I got them all for 8. Have fun
