Grand Theft Auto is best game series ever made for me, i love every single game and i have played so much of them. Grand Auto IV was best game for me but this is legendary too, its hard to believe how Rockstar Games made huge and awesome game like this back in 2004. This game rocks for long time and i will never forget this classic when im older. Everything in this game is perfectly made and finished, if you got bored you can always do some cheats to have fun and tons of mods just adds playing. MTA Multi Theft Auto and SAMP San Andreas Multiplayer mods adds multiplayer to this game and... oh boy, GTA experience just gets bigger whole time!Summary Childhood classic, an example of how to make the perfect game.10/10!
