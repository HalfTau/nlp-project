Its so much fun coming back to this game as an adult. I remember it being the first open world game I played as a child with so many hours of fun just messing around. As an adult now I really wanted to go back and play through the entire story line. The game is still very fun for its time however I do not know how on earth I could have beat this game as a child. The mechanics for the game are so out dated that it makes some of the missions very difficult. Nonetheless, I had a great time playing this game and recommend to any GTA fan.
