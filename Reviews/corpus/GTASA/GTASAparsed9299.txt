Been a fan of San Andreas since it came out.  A very nice and smooth port, ive had no problems with it, with the exception of the intro being blacked out which I fixed by right clicking the gtasa.exe in your steam folder, go into properies,Under the Compatibility tab,  run in compatibilty mode for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Under Settings, only have Disable visual themes and Disable desktop composition checked, and finaly, Under Privliges, check Run as Administrator.  Again just a minor inconvinience to a kickgame..GSF 4 Life!
