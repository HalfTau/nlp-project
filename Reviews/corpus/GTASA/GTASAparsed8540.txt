The last of the GTA games written for PC. If you hate having to put up with the t sluggish controls inflicted on us with the  console to PC ports, this is the GTA for you.Cool storyline with interesting characters, RPG elements with the only GTA stat system, until GTA5 which I have still not played and some truly excellent voice acting by people you WILL recognise, GTASA is arguably the best GTA ever released.9/10
