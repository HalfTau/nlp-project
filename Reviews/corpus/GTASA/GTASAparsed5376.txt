GTA San Andreas is a great game the pc version is pretty bad. Im not saying that because of the update that got rid of modding and some of the songs, or the 2005 graphics, or the gameplay. The only reason I did not like this game is the controls. Doing anything is weird with pc controls and sometimes the controls dont even work. In the menus you can either click or press enter to select things but sometimes it cant make up its mind on whether it wants you to click or not. Besides that, the camera controls suck. Youd figure itd just be moving the mouse right? Well, kinda. Theres two options, one is steering with the mouse which allows you to aim while on foot by just moving the mouse around BUT you have to steer the car with the mouse as well and I couldnt figure out how to move the camera. The option option is not steering with mouse, which allows you to move the camera while in the car but not while on foot.Thats about it, if you can get a controller working with it, then buy it for sure, but otherwise no.
