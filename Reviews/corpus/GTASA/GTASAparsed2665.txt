Grand Theft Auto San Andreas boasts an exceptional soundtrack, a wellwritten story line and a slew of plot twists and other surprises. The dialogue between CJ and his crew is raw but convincing, and some bigname celebrities contribute their vocal talent, including James Woods and George Clinton.Without question, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas isnt for kids because of its graphic violence, sex, and coarse language, but mature fans of this 32 millionunitselling franchise who want to know if this sequel lives up to its hype, the answer is a resounding yes. Few video games pull off everything successfully, but San Andreas does so in spades. Indeed, this maturerated game may be deemed offensive for its depiction of life as a gangbanger, but if taken for what it is  an interactive actionadventure for adult gamers  you wont find a title thats more difficult to put down.
