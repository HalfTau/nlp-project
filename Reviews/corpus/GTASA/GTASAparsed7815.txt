I will now not recommend one of the funnest games ive ever played since it has been updated that removed content like resolutions so now it looks er and it seems to crash constantly now, and my save game doesnt work. Ontop of this they removed 18 songs, which im ok with since I know about copyrights. They added controller support, OK? thats nice, why did you remove other things that didnt need to be done and not add anything else bla bla.Pirate it.
