Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams. He said somehow, some way, its gotta get better than this. Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma, she was just seventeen, There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye. They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so exited. We got just one shot of life, lets take it while were still not afraid. Because life is so brief and time is a thief when youre undecided. And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands. Young hearts be free tonight.
