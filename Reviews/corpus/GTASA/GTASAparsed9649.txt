Ill be honest I like San Andreas a HELL of a lot more than I do GTA IV. There are still some things the Saints Row series does better ability to shoot out of cars with more than a SMG, 360 aiming while in a car, cruise control, gang warfare is better, San Andreas is STILL worth playing. Just dont do any of the gang wars during the first Los Santos chapter. You dont get to keep any progress in it when youre exiled.
