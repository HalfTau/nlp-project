People saying steam version is ruined, no its not. Theres a way to play SAMP look it up, and they removed songs....ok so just added the songs you liked that R removed to user track and bam, ur song is back. And ppl saying that it crashes, um not for me, mabye if ur using  older windows but mine soes not crash. Play the game first before whining on the reviewSince mine works and alot of other ppls works 10/10 best ga game in the series and better then GTA V.
