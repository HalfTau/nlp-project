i played this game back when it came out on ps2, but i just recently replayed it on pc nowi dont like this game as much as i like Vice City, its still a blast though... i just feel it gets far too convoluted about halfway in and forces a lot of really janky bloated systems that just do not feel like they belong in a GTA game. some might say it is the best in the series, but i feel it is nowhere near there, as well on the plot side it changes tone from completely serious to all out crazy far too often to keep me consistently engaged and progressing through. the normal distractions available on the side only serve to muddy that up even moreplay this though, its a great game... but i would recommend vice city or gta4 over this in a heartbeat
