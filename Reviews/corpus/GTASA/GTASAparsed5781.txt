The biggest and longest instalment of the GTA 3D trilogy offers the most complex and serious storyline that spans three cities and a neverending series of optional challenges. But its probably too big for its own good, with so many things to do that it eventually feels empty.GTA San Andreas isGTA game for many, and with good reason unlike any other titles in the franchise, it has a whole miniature state with three cities GTA versions of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas and several towns. These all offer a variety of activities from collectibles to minigames and sidemissions, on top of the already lengthy story.This time you play as a black gangbanger who returns home after several years of selfimposed exile, only to find his old gang reduced to three members, the neighbourhood trashed, and a corrupt cop running half of the city. Just like how Vice City was a nod to the 80s shows like Miami Vice, San Andreas tries to capture the essence of early 90s blaxploitation movies like New Jack City, down to the obscene amount of profanity in every dialogue.The plot is split to several chapters and moves around a huge cast of great characters, but maybe it is a tad too large for its own good. Missions try to be interesting, but eventually start repeating themselves, especially around the third city, where the story loses most of the steam, just like the additional content.The large map also has drawbacks. There are lots of optional things to, but it often feels empty, especially when driving back and forth between the cities. Also, the rampages were removed from the PC version, taking away one of the most crucial elements of this era of GTAs, the random mindless violence.These drawbacks only put a small dent into the shiny finish of the 3D era GTAs, and by all means, San Andreas was the perfect way to say farewell to this game engine and one of the best trilogies of action games.
