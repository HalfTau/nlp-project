pitifully bad. stay away. buy it somewhere else. hell even pirate it. Rockstar ruined their own game, like they love doing. ironically GTAV is also total rubbish and very overhyped, seems like they just hate california.edit the controls are also horrendous, flying is just  and makes no sense, there were better controls in GTAVice City where you couldnt even move the camera in a vehicle lol.
