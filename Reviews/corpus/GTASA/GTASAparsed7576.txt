A FAIR WARNING THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE UPDATE TO THE GAME ON 11/07/2014If there is any definitive proof that Rockstar Games hates PC gaming, this is it.Removing songs, fine, I can understand the music industry has and will always be Besides, I can always have Steam Player on full blast.But to remove resolution capabilities and destroy your save youve worked on for all these years all for XBox 360 controller support is  of the highest caliber. And stealthily, too, I might add.Go back to the times GTA IV was released you think you played that game like a champ on first try? No. You fixed .inis, you downloaded mods... and it took more than four years to kill that monstrosity they attached to it called GFWL.And now GTA V will be released on the PC on January, and with it another DRM that ehem was worked by the original monsters that started it all SecuROM. You really want that jelly on your party?Who am I kidding? Youll buy the game. Youve probably preordered. And youll spend hundreds of hours laughing at what kind of a horrible human being Franklin is ingame. To that, I say Enjoy your cancer.To those who are sensible, though BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR.
