While I recommend this game to pretty much anyone out there, there is a MAJOR problem with the way it installs itself.The game requires DirectX 9 to run, and the installer doesnt install DirectX 9 at all, so youre left with a game you cant run. The DirectX installer offered on Microsofts website says it works on Windows 8, but it actually doesnt.The only workaround Ive found is to install another game which comes packed with DirectX 9 in its installer, like Sid Meiers Civilization V. This way youll get DirectX 9 to work on Windows 8. So, yeah, keep an eye out for that.
