Terrible port, Much buggier than the PS2, looks worse as well, Crashes a lot in the later missions.Negatives out of the way, SA is a gem of its time and holds up pretty well in some areas like story and world size. Also, this is the only GTA I actually went Myth Hunting in, its legitamately fun and nice to do while watching a DaviDuston video.
