Update After the recent update, this port just sank to a new low. Rockstar removed some of the best songs from the game for everyone who owned this game on Steam. 1080p remains broken, vsync remains broken locks the game to 26fps.There is no doubt that San Andreas is a fantastic game and deserves all the praises it got. However, what Rockstar did to the PC version does not do it justice. The San Andreas on Steam is version 3.0 made specifically so that you cant downgrade. It removed lots of contents, is incompatible with most mods, such as the multiplayer mod Multi Theft Auto, and worse of all, does not support 1920 x 1080 resolution. Yes Im serious, it does not support the most common resolution on PC, although version 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 of San Andreas did. Rockstar never bothered to fix such a simple mistake in so many years.Its clear that Rockstar doesnt give two sheits about PC, and you should not support such behavior by buying this abomination. If you want to buy an open world game, there are Saints Row 3/4 and Just Cause 2 with free multiplayer mod. If you really want to play this game, Im sure there are ways to get the better version for free somewhere on the Internet.
