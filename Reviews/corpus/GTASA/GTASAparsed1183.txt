TLDR This is a terrible port pushed out by Rockstar for Steam to grab some cash.When I fired up this Steam version I had a feeling that my memories of enjoying this game must have been faulty, because it is UGLY. It turns out that the Steam version is its own particular version, which is a severe downgrade from the original PC release, which has several updates this version didnt get. The differences have been outlined by several people, like in this one.The game can apparently be modded so it isnt such a bad port, but there are so many other games worth playing, even within this series, so  it.
