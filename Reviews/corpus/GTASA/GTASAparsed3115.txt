You know this is one of the best GTAs because the one thing I liked about V was the enhanced graphics and story. Its difficult, and some scenes made me laugh also, and Im one of those gamers that just likes playing the missions but Im out there free roaming. Most of the cheats are easy to remember. I love the stunt plane. It has great controller mapping, I dont miss the PS2 version at all, its a great installment, and I have played many greats before and this game has aged well it makes you never wanna trade the game in, it never gets boring, I lose track of time. And it has a great story line. This is a must have for GTA fans! It has the best cheat codes, even GTA Vs cheats lack what San Andreas had. So you showed really get this game!
