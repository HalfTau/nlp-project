Its a nice game but keeps crashing for me.When it crashes ctrlaltdel wont help, i have to restart my computerEditStarted to crash less when i changed resolution/graphics, but still does crash.I think i can now recommend it because its actually crashing less now i can play it for many hours without it crashing.Some bugs happen but thats all fine.Its a great game
