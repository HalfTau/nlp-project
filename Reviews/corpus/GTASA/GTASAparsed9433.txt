Pretty good game! The graphics are dated but I mean the game did come out in 2005 I think so its ok that they are dated, but there are also mods you can download that make it look better. The gameplay is dated ,theres no cover system like there is in GTA IV but the game is still pretty good. The only thing I hated was that I had to downgrade my game to a earlier patch just to play the game in 1920x1080. Other than that its good! Also its not that hard to get the patch to fix the resoloution. So if you like games like this then I reccomend it
