Even though it is an oldgame af, its still a lot fun to play, especially for people with lowends such as me. graphics well, what could you expect from 2004, lets just say they fullfill the concept of the game. Hovewer, it has one of the greatest storylines Ive ever seen. You are brought through the hoods, through the drug games, rap culture, through the life of a thief in the country, experience some romance on the side, through the beauty of San fierro, to the high casino game, expensive lives of greedy casino people, over traits, family situations, and lots of other stuff. You can work as a cop, or as a thief. You can harm people, or drive around and transport wounded people to the hospital. Excitement is everywhere, and the sidemissions are pulled off perfectly. There is also a huge amount of cheats you can mess around with. PNot that I would like to promote my channel or anything, but I made a couple of GTA SA glitch vids you may find interesting.
