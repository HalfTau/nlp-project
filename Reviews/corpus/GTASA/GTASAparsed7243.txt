This game is a legend. When I was a kid, I used to play it so much. Actually, we used to. We spent so many unforgettable hours with friends just running around doing fun stuff. What to say? Everebody who wants to call himself a gamer should complete this game at least once. Although it is old, you can still encounter so many running servers, or install uncountable amount of modifications. Graphics are not the best, since it is not the youngest, story is just awesome and it just acts so, so nostalgic. So much memories about this game, if you have not played it yet, do it. It is cheap, it is fun, it is everything youd want..
