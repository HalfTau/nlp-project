Listen, the game is ing incredible, but the Steam version is utter garbage. My game froze about 20 times now after cutscenes for some unknown reason, and most of the radio music is deleted due to issues with copyright. Also, you cant install mods without downloading a ton of dodgylooking 3rd party programs, and even then itll be a miracle if it actually works.
