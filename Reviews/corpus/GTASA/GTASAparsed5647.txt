I guess the reason why Im so connected to this game is the fact, That it reminds me and us of  N.W.A  and Boyz In the Hood  for a game that was made back in 2004, Its great and the storymode is awesome, The guns are very awesome and the modding is really epic and nice too, The whole setting inside of the GTA universe, This has to be the best but the most epic game of its time by sides Vice city, another GTA classic that is most recommending.
