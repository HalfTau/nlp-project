Staggering in ambition, stunning in execution. Not only the best GTA game in my opinion, having played them all but one of those timeless diamonds of gaming that serves as a source of fond memories and nostalgic reminiscing, as well as, you know, raising the bar and setting the benchmark etc. for open world exploration and quest design accompanied by a cast of nuanced characters with engaging and witty writing to boot.Does the Popein the woods?Why you keep asking me that, holmes? I told you, I dunno. Where his holiness does his business is his business.
