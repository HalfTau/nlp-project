This is, in my opinion  and a lot of people will agree  the best Grand Theft Auto game out there. Even still, in 2017  Ill give you five reasons why.1 The game boasts a massive openworld map with a variety of different interiors to visit, along with different geographical features that slightly resemble some parts of the real world as we know them. There are numerous land types within the map, such as the forests in Back O Beyond and Flint County, to the more civilised and dense cities like San Fierro or Los Santos.2 Its so accessible to all users. Seriously. The graphics are so easy on the eye compared to other previous titles, like GTA III and Vice City which had more vibrance and saturation to all the elements. San Andreas on the other hand, has more realisticlooking graphics, and the GUI ingame is much clearer.3 There are so many mods out there, and theres multiplayer! though you have to downgrade 4 The story is a reasonable length, and there are plenty of side missions to get on with alongside completing the main missions. This gives you plenty of gametime, and honestly, you can even do your own thing and still have fun I liked getting on top of random peoples Picadors and crouching whilst gunning down some Vagos  thats always fun.5 The ingame music is nostalgic. Personally, I listen to Bounce FM purely due to memories playing this game as a kid, but the other radio stations are great as well. Theres a lot of tracks featured ingame from wellknown artists like Ice Cube, Guns N Roses, Rod Stewart and even Willie Nelson  needless to say, theres a music station for everyone.Honestly, just get the damn game. Its amazing.10/10.
