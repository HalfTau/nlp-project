Still a fun game despite the odd patches from Rockstar, however it is rather ridiculous the amount of glitches where something as simple as exiting your vehicle or falling down a cliff you now are unable to move or are in an area it wont let you jump out of demanding you restart the game. Rockstar there is a reason for patches and it is to improve games not to skim it down to the barely passable last minute buck for you to make from unsuspecting gamers, it is extremely unfair to all gamers especially the extremely loyal base of pc gamers when many pc games from rockstar have little to no real support so it would be nice if the people were actually listened to we are after all the people paying you not the other way around.
