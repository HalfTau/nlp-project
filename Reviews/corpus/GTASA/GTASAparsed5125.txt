I wont recommend the steam version of this game. I luckily got it with a discount. you CANT install mods, to do so you need to do a hassle and downgrade the game to install mods. If you are going to buy this game on steam and you like to install mods, do not do that, pirate the game or find a copy of it. If R makes a Steam Workshop that would be better, and no, the graphics are still the same. If you are thinking this is the remastered version Mobile version you are wrong. this game doesnt support 1366x768 res, or higher. instead you get a 1280x768, and thats the highest setting to this game. I also noticed that when you put AA Anti Ailiasing the radar will be in a box, but that may be my laptop. If you dont care about mods and res, buy it when theres a discount.
