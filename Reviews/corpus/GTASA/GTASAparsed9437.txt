Granny loves this game. Oh my, I really dont like to hurt the civillians though, but oh thoose gang members can be so rude. I always offer a lift to the gang members of the streets, because I cant have them walking around everywhere on there little legs. But, they always try and kill granny, you see. Now where is their manners? Manners are free you know! They just seem to set a bad example for me, and then I have to go and kill them, accidently of course. I like to think that it was an accident at least. My, my. Lets talk about grannys love of cars now. There is a wide selection for good old granny to choose from, from some smelly dustbin lorrys, like my grandads feet, to super sports cars. Cant be doing with them, back in my day we didnt have those V8... wait thats a different story to tell, granny does like to talk away you see my dear. I personally prefere, a very peaceful, and comfy ride that is the MONSTER TRUCK!! cough I mean an ice cream truck, silly me. My keyboard has a mind of its own these days. I better get going now, grandad wants his tea. See you again sometime, somewhere, hopefully not far away.Ta my dearies, much granny loveGood Old, Gr4ndm4s C00k1n         x xNow, how do I sign off this thing?What does this reccomend button do?Grandad darling, you will have to take a look at this thingy, whats it called, err.... computer.
