i recently strated playing san andreas and ive relized that its much better than the current gta games due to its great campain and addicting freeroam. and most people will say that gta4 is better but no its not san andreas feels a lot more like a true freeroam game and you know who doesnt love a game with a awsome soundtrack and npcs dressed like elvis!
