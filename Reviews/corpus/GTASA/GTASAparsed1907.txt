Due to TakeTwo Interactives recent actions involving threatening legal action against any kind of harmless ingame modifications, I can no longer support any products under their publishing. Though I will still play them because I find them enjoyable, I will only do so to support the original developers, the ones who clearly put their heart and soul into providing countless hours of entertainment, and not TakeTwos gutless and cruel antimodding and anticonsumer stance.
