I loved this game as a PS2 console peasent, I would go home from school hyped about playing this game. Now that I have it on PC, I can have fun with mods and lots of other crazy stuff. Despite the new wave of bad reviews, I still think its worth it especcialy since I got it for 3 bucks. For everyone who is worrying about the removed music and features, you can patch it using SilentPatch and downgrade the ame to 1.0 and tada, you have the game back to its nicer state. All in all, its worth it.
