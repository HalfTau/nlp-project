The update took away many great tracks, introduced game save incompatibilities, has a worse codebase apparently and is an allaround bad experience.I suggest any loyal GTA fan to write a bad review and tag the game on the Steam Store page as downgrader. I did and I will for any further updates to other Steam games so if this trends, people will know where and how to get their games and which updates to avoid.
