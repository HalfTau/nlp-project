The best of the entire grand theft auto series. This game blended the awesome humour of the GTA games with Freeroaming and RPG elements so well that I think it is the BEST GTA ever made. Its value has increased with the advent of the San Andreas Multiplayer SAMP mod. There are so many servers from Racing to RPG. The largest ammount of car mods for a GTA game too. From the newest Lambo the Aventador to Classic Muscle cars. Any car you want you can most likely get.
