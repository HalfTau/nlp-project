One of the best sandbox games ever made if not the best ..GTA SA or Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is by my point of view the best game of the GTA series and probably the best and more fun sandbox Ive had the pleasure of play.About the customizationThe customizatin of everything in this game is awesome, you can custome your cars more than in a lot of games of cars...The story/campaign of the game is so long and pretty atractive and adictive is a very well made story in my opinion.The roleplay is awesome you can level out your weapons to make them perform better, you can level the character stats as well to run further, dive deeper, etc.. you can also learn driving licenses, combat styles. You have terrotories to defend and to attack and conquer and trust me conquer everything will take you a long time but is pretty addictive!. Also you have girlfriends which give you assets by making them love you. And a ton of things you can check over the gameplay.The only thing I would call a con in this game is probable the following things No steam achievements No steam trading cards I would love to have a CJ trading card xD Graphics are kinda old but the game is old, anyways you could take this as a con.Hope I helped you on making you choose if buy or not, rate positively this review!.Thanks!
