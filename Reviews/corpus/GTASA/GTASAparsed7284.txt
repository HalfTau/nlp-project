Nice and Nostalgic, I never get bored of it. Maybe its just me but if feels like they improved the graphics a little.Why everyone hates Rockstar for removing a few songs is a mystery to me, I dont know the reason for why they did it, but the game is still the game so not recommending it because of 12 missing songs is idiocy.I like it.
