Follows a train to shoot som idiots standing onit then get told all you had to was follow the damn train CJmy intial reaction you wanna try it. of course me being failed theis mission 500 times before actually getting it and feeling like an absoulte gangster  only to be greeted by mission passed sign not a YOU PASSED LIFE sign  I love this game and all of its 2004 glory and in my opinion my have better graphics then most games today but this only a opinion. buy this game!
