It might just be nostalgia, but this game to me still represents the best that the GTA series has.Fun cheats, a great plot, and general mayhem were all possible. You could gamble, engage with and exploit women of looser morals, have gang wars and even steal from the military. The characters were creative, innovative, and the story unique. The world felt huge, and you are free to roam around it at your hearts content.A lot of players hold up the map size of games like GTAV as proof its better  but I would contend the opposite. GTASA has an objectively small game map. Yet, it is so much more alive and varied. Im not just saying this based on the XBOX version I played years ago  I have recently played through the whole campaign and its still wonderful.Ill admit the game mechanics themselves have perhaps not aged the best, but this game has variety, its fun, and when the normal conditions of play cease to be as entertaining, the cheats are so much more varied and creative than any later GTA titles.If they gave my GTASA on the new engine with graphical updates, Id drop dough on it very quickly. All it needs are mechanical fixes  the core game was fantastic and I still consider it to genuinely be the best GTA title that has been released.And yes, I did play through that Italian Job knockoff GTAV.
