This is without doubt, in my opinion, the best game of the series. You might argue that GTA IV has much better graphics but the fact is the story isnt as appealing, the driving is worse, and it just isnt as fun as San Andreas.San Andreas also benefits alot from the big ammount of cheats you can use for fun.
