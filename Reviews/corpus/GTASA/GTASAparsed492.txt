Great story, memorable characters, diverse map that still manages to surprise me after 9 years of playing this game. Ive played a lot of GTA games but San Andreas still stands on the top, and I know some of it has to do with nostalgia. With that being said I still think the game has aged very well.One of my favorite things to do is drive around the country side, listening to KDST or KRose and feel completely immersed in the world. The games soundtrack is incredible and Ive probably listened to it more than actual radio stations. Like with other GTA games, San Andreas is filled with cool easter eggs. As a kid I used to go around the map trying to create perfect shots of the scenery with my camera and look for the infamous ghost cars around Flint County, which actually used to spook me. The game just has so much to offer and I could talk about it for hours.Ive loved this game since I was around 10 years old and to this day GTA San Andreas remains my favorite game of all time. 10/10
