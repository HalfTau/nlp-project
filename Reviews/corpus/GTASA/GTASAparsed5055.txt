Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night I can feel my favorite mod, my songs, even my saves.... The game Ive lost, the songs Ive lost, wont stop hurting. Its like theyre all still there, you feel it too dont you? Im the one who got caught up with Rockstar, a company above nations, even the US. And I was the parasite below feeding off Rockstars power. Rockstar just keeps growing, swallowing everything in its path, getting bigger and bigger... Who knows how big now? Anon,  Im going to make them give back our mods. Take back everything that we lost! And I wont rest until we do.This is our new game.  I dont know how long itll take, but well make it bigger. better than before.
