So, this is a negative review for San Andreas, yeah, but hol on, homie, Im no busta.Its Rockstar, they release their old games on Steam, but these fools are damn lazy bs.Steam release features widescreen and gamepad support buuuut I had problems with mouse and frame limiter.You may not encounter mouse issues but default frame limiter is equally terrible for everyone. It must be turned on to prevent some physics bugs, like vehicles constantly braking while accelerate button is not pressed, but it limits framerate on glorious 25 fps and boy it hurts. Whadda ya gonna do? Install unofficial patches and probably downgrade game to original 1.0 release. To see how and why, check ot steam community mod guides I personally recommend this oneSo if the most comfortable setup for playing is nonsteam release with patches, why even bother buying it on Steam?
