I played a lot of this one in PS2 back there and all I can say, is that this is the Best Grand Theft Auto game Ever.....more than GTA IV, more than GTA V, and even GTA onlineFull of funs, full of memories, no need for shark card or whatsoeverThe only lack of its compare to its predecessor is just its graphic and animations, and that can be tolerated since its released in..what...2004? 2005? around that year but its more fun than the othersWell, they said the latest update removed some of its soundtrack, right? Well thats unfortunateBut I relieved none of KRose songs are removed XDall my exes live in texas.... ......I loveee a rainy night, such a beautiful sight...... XDOh and one thing that being a con of this PC version is its bad optimization. I tried to change its configurations and none of them actually called great mostly at screen resolution and controls binding, but its not harmful and still enjoyable though I dont know if anyone also have this issues
