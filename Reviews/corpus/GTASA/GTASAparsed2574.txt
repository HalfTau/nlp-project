It has an interesting story with funny characters and though its quite dated, still the best GTA ever. Theres collectibles, stunt jumps, you can rob people at night, no drowning like in previous titles and pickups across the map ensure you can have fun without using cheats or being forced to save money. There is a multiplayer mod that I personally recommend, MTA Multi Theft Auto for its network stability and simplicity as well as not requiring any overwrites so you can keep single and multiplayer separate! D  I havent even finished it yet, but Im sure Ill have plenty to do after the story. Map is a bit smaller than GTA5s, but still huge.The best thing about older games Anyone can run it easily. or almost anyone... You just need a PC from early 2000s or newer. 90s and older obviously cant. Sadly, GTA 3 and Vice City havent aged so well. I always hated drowning too...I cant really think of any cons, so 9/10. I save 10s for the absolute best games with crazy high replay values. Battlefield 3 and Left 4 Dead 2 are good examples, but its just my opinion.
