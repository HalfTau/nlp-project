This game is truly amazing. The country side is wonderful, Los Santos is wonderful, Las Venturas or whatever is wonderful, and the Ghetto is wonderful. Only bad thing is that unlike other GTA games, it takes like 20 missions before AmmuNation is unlocked, while in others itd be 5 missions.Other than that, this game is amazing, but then again...All CJ had to do was follow the damn train.
