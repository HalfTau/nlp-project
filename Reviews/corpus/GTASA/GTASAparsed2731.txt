This game is one of the best games in existence. Its got everything youd want hugely diverse map, likeable characters, great storyline, graphics kind of hold up even today in a retro feel, but there are mods if you want them better.3 cities to explore this imo is where it beats GTA V which has 1 city. there are even multiplayer mods.and of course, home to this golden piece of writingIll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.
