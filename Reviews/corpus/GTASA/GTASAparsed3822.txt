I just fixed the issue and I LOVE GTA SA after fixing my issue If you wanna know how, then just comment. Ill help, no problem. I remember when I played GTA SA on PS2 until my PS2 was over heated! yes I played it so much I even loved the radio more than anything in the game. Sure the graphics isnt GTA V, but this is the 90s!I wont spoil to much, but I say Play it, enjoy it and love it!
