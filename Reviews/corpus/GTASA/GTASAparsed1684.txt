GTA San Andreas takes me back to my childhood gaming on the PlayStation 2, and oh does this game still not disappoint.  Many reviews explain how Rockstar did not update license agreements on many of the radio track within the game, and people have given negative reviews because of it, or the overwhelming number of negative reviews regarding the GTA V modding community, but let me just remind everyone that this game is a gem.  A gem that has aged finer than Lisa Ann, and you should totally purchase this game on sale.  This game was released like 10 years ago, do not pay 15 for it, but definetly pay 5 for it.  Do not let the reviews saying it does not run on Windows 10 allow you to neglect this masterpiece.  I run windows 10 as my OS, and got it to run after turning DirectPlay on through my settings.  Just google it.  D
