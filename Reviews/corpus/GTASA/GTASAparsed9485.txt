EDIT AS OF NOVEMBER 2014 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM. THERE IS REMOVED MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STATIONS AND OTHER CONTENT!! !This game is pure gold, and a classic. From great graphics to gameplay to music on the radiostations to everything. Hell, what can I say? Everyone has played San Andreas. All I can say, is that you shouldnt buy the Steam version of GTA SA unless youre only buying it for the single player. If get the nonsteam version and downgrade it to 1.0 which is unfortunetly slightly buggier then youre able to use more mods for the gameAs well as using San Andreas Multiplayer SAMP Yes, thats right! You can play multiplayer for san andreas! I highly recommend playing on UIF which is a free roam server and you can spawn almost whatever you want  and go flying at top speed across the entire map! Its great fun.
