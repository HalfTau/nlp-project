This review is based on my experiences playing the game on PS2 and on a totally notpiratedversion on PC when I was like 12 or something.I would argue that this is the best Grand Theft Auto released. Grand Theft Auto V looks great, has a great story, and a decent multiplayer. However, GTA SA tops GTA V in story, characters, unlockables, minigames, locations, music selection radio, and hell, even cheat codes.Overall, Id say give the game a chance. It is a little slow at first, but once you get the ball rolling you cant put it down.
