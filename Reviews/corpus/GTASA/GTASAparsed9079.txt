GRAND THEFT AUTO SAN ANDREAS or as the shortcut gta san andreasyou probebly femilier with the title GRAND THEFT AUTO if its from the controversies of this game or other thing well i wont lie to you, this game have..... well, probebly anything that is illegal  drugs hookers murders and well a long list of other stuff. anyway all of those things cant even get close to the enjoyment of the game,  the game is mybe a bit old almost 10 years old but its still the best open world game for his time and even for today.the game is good for few reasons  first the amazingly HUGE map sometimes i dont belive that the game made 10 years ago! the map is one of the biggest maps you gonna see in your life atleast for an open world game ,  secondly the game have alot and let me repeat that ALOT of things to do. its unbelivble! ,  you can do missions or just buy clothes or do some work out or just do criminal stuff , and if you want to make the game even better,  you can write some cheats.and let me tell you theres WAY more cheats in this game then in any other game and really creative.the game also have some rpg elments so the game is a bit more intresting then avarage open world game.the game have a lot of things to do side missions or just fun even more with cheats and even mods the game never gets boring and that is the reason people still playing it for 10 years without saying the graphics is lame or its too oldbecause actully it makes the game even smoother and enjoyeble with smooth 100200 fps and belive me for a game like this it can make alot of diffrence.IF I HAD TO GIVE THIS GAME A SCORE ITS 9/10GOODbecause the game is fun cheatsfps is highrpg elemntsgood story and a lot of side missionsthe game supports moddelingBADalot of Unnecessary things drugs Alcohol hookers and Uncensored sex Scenesnot so graphical but still NOT FOR KIDSif you cant deal with old/bad for today graphics it may be a problem aspaicly with the fact that the game runs on 1280768 so see it as a warning though i think theres a way to fix it.anyway thanx for reading my review
