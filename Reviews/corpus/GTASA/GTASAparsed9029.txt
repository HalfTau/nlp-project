A pure and simple classical. Way better than GTA IV if you ask me! I cant tell how much time I spent on this fabulous game  I at least spent ten times what Steam is telling  and I never been disapointed.Theres some bugs with the mouse dont working, since the game is hardly compatible with multicores, but its easy to fix just set a single core on it in the Task Manager. Also, a little minus no windowed mod, except by downloading a dll. If you need it, just tell me and Ill give you.Still, the game is totally worth it despite those two defects. Awesome story, nice jokes, plenty of craziness I love it!9/10
