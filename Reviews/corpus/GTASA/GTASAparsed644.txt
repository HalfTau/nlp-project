This game is great, and with a few community patches, it really stands the tests of time. Its got a simple, engaging story, great, ridiculous writing, and lots to do around the cities outside the main missions. A little advice though, dont buy it here, this version In the US is the Steam 3.0 version. it was downgraded, it has mods disabled, its missing content and parts of the soundtrack, and is full of bugs not present in the original release. It is possible to downgrade the game to change it back to the original release if you own it on Steam, it just takes a bit of your patience.
