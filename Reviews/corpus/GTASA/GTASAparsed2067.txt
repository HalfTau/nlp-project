Unpopular opinion here but San Andreas is actually one of my leat favorite GTA games. Thats not to say its bad though. If you a fan of 1990s California gang wars then this game is for you! Tons to do in the state of San Andreas and a fun world to explore, if you can get by the lackluster story and poor controls / gameplay that is. Its a good PC port for those that played on the PS2 back in the day and worth the pick up for sure!
