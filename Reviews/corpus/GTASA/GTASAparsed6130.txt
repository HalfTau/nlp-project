GTA San Andreas is perhaps or is the best in the series. Why you ask? Unlike Vice City a good game as well, San Andreas has a huge world, where you can explore and discover stuff. With over a 100 missions, the game is packed full with content that never gets boring. Yes GTAV has also a huge world but San Andreas introduced it to the infamous series. Well worth getting in your Steam collection.
