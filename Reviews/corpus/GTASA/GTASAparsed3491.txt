Even though Gta 5 has beautfiul graphics, a massive online multiplayer, and enough exploration to fufill any of your nitpicky needs. I still cant shake prefering the pixels of San Andreas. Something about cruising down Los Santos in a overly ridiculous custom lowrider playing 90s jams, with nothing on but tighty whities and a fro feels great. Def survives test of time.
