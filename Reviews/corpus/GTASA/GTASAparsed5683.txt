IMO, this is slightly better and I mean SLIGHTLY better than GTA 5. An actual character upgrade system, better gang wars, a gang recruiting system, a better super kickass soundtrack, more cities, more accessible buildings, funnier characters, more story missions, mods that wont get you banned and NO STUPID SOCIAL CLUB CRAP TO RESTRICT GAMEPLAY. I just find it awesome that an 11 year old game still manages to be a true masterpiece when compared to its successors. Dont get me wrong, I love GTA 5 4 is alright and both 4 and 5 has advantages over San Andreas, but they are slightly edged out by San Andreas in my book. Also, mods. That is all.
