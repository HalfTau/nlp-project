Not the best console port, but decent for its time and one of the best games of the GTA series. Great story, atmosphere and a few enhanced graphical options made just for PC, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is the iconic tale of Carl Johnson as you do stuff in the hood, around the hood and in the city which is pretty much a bigger, slightly cleaner version of the hood! So grab your gat and prepare to shoot gangstars as you hold the gun sideways!Buyer BewareThis console port has control and camera buttons. I dont remember if it didnt work properly with the keyboard/mouse, the gamepad or both, but you will not be able to play properly with one of these pieces of hardware, sadly.
