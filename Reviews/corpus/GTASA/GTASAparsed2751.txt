This game on steam is ed up. I tryed to pass driving svhool 2 hours becouse when I had to do barrel roll in air with car when its upside down it just stops spining. When you drive you release w to stop driveing it presses breaks by it self.There is 1 mission where you have to swim under watter I tryed to swim under watter and I couldnt I looked down and holded space to swim under and I as soon as I was under watter I wnt back to surface that means its impossible to complete that mission. GTA by it self is great but every cracked version is better than buying on steam.
