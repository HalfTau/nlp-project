San Adnreas is an AMAZING, classic game. Its definitely one of the best GTA games ever made. It runs very well on PC unless your PC is PCMasterRace, and you can mod the hell out of it. I had no idea that there was 1st person mode when riding a bike, unless thats new in the steam version? O.o Great game, i got it for free with GTAV but you can usually get it for 5USD. 1000/10 Would decapitate self again.
