This is the real OGBest story and gameplay of any of the GTA games. This is the one that made them blow up to fame.Even though it hasnt been remastered or upgraded to HD its still very playable. Has selection for 1920x1080p and you can tweak the controls from auto aim to free aim. The music brought back so many memories...Worth the buy.Ill update this review if I find any bugs or controller issues.
