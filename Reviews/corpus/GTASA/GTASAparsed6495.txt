Dont listen to these asshat reviews, this game is still great. They barely removed any songs from the game, and you can have a custom radio station anyways. They removed resolutions for monitors that are extremely small and no one owns. There are no glitches in gameplay, and I can play forever without a crash, and I run the bear minimum requirements for this game.
