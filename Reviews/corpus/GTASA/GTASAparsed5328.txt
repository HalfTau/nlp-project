I LOVE THIS GAME  Dont let my hours fool you i just bought this because of nostalgia i actually have A LOT MORE hours on SP and MTAwhich i still occasionaly play but i suggest you to replace the game files with old pirated one after you have downloaded it so that you wont have to deal with Steam versionsbut Im gonna give it a thumps up bcz i love the game but hated what steam did to it but anyways overall i cant recommend it enough D
