honestly one of the best gta games I have ever played if i had to rank games from 1 to 3 3 being not replayable and not interesting without any enhancing like mods and such i would rank 1 San Andreas 2 GTA IV 3 gta v. this game even though it is so old it still gets your attention with beautiful story and dialogue its overall just a masterpiece for rockstar.
