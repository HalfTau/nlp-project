Taking out material that was already paid for was just bad business practice. I can understand if they had to get rid of the songs for new purchases but seriously. Removing content that was already paid for and used is just low. This is obvious that Rockstar does not care about the PC gamer. So I can not recommend GTA SA in its current form. Shame as it is one of the best games ever made.
