Shot at a Cop got one star, the shooting caused a traffic jam in which a civillian ran a second cop over. I got blamed for it, 2 stars and ran off listening to Black and Tans by the Wolfe Tones D 10/10Been playing the heII out of this game, tryin to be a stand up OG baby. People say some recent patch fks the game all up but I have had no troubles minus some light mouse issues that can be fixed with hitting the Esc button a few times. Recived this game I think Friday Night January 2015. This game is top notch.
