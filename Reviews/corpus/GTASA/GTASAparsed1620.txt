Its really hard to recommend this game at its current state. I booted up the game, and I everything was working fine, and I decided to mess around with the resolution, and rebooted the game to see if the words would appear in the correct aspect ratio.Nope, instead the game decided to revert the resolution but not any other setting I entered beforehand and disable any input coming from the mouse, with the exception of scrolling. So enterhigh through the menus so I could play the game for the second time  while at a crappy resolution the first time is when I tried the port to Android about a year ago, while it wasnt so glitchy, it was still hard to control anything with a smaller display, I finally jumped in to explore I could only turn once, and afterwards I could only go in a linear direction. Ending up swimming into a wall, I didnt enjoy it the first time. I decided to reinstall the game at that point.An error occurred while updating Grand Theft Auto San Andreas content file lockedkysSo I decided to give Steam administration abilities and still it didnt solve the issue. Time to search some forums.After I did this, I found that people are having luck after checking for disk errors. Now Im just having bad luck and I have tried getting this game to work for more than a hour now.Ok Im done screaming, oh wait I mean scanning, and finallyNo errors were foundI dont think its luck anymore. I think its just GTA SAs fault now. Verifying the game integrity just results with All files successfully verified even though there is no .exe main file like there was last time. Im just going to move on and purchase GTA IV. Because I want to.P.S. I wasnt done screaming. I was still screaming.
