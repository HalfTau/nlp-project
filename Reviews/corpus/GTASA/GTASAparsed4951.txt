San Andreas is safe to say one of the best GTA games i have ever played right after GTA llli loved playing it on PS2 when i was a kid the game is so nostalgic.The missions are fun the activities are great and the driving is addictive.The atmosphere was mindblowing as well of the graphics which have kinda aged after 11 years...My main problem is that the 3.0 version of GTA SA Steam Release deleted 20 of the in game songs and the worst part is they made the game NON MOD FRIENDLY.when you install a mod such as a skin mod it doesnt work at all neither does CLEO..if they had to change anything why did it have to be the mods?To download the mods i had to downgrade to the 1.0 release 2005 which im not even sure is legal.....Not to mention some of the features they took out of the PC release ...So if i had to rate this game   Original 1.0 release 9.4/10       3.0 Steam release 7.2/10
