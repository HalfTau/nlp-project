The 90s were a special time. The International reputation of the USA was more closely aligned with baseball, basketball Disney and a naughty President than the decidedly militaristic and dark cloak it would come to adopt in the coming century. The internet had not made information instantly accessible and the world therefore felt so much larger, so much more varied and unknowable. NWA, gangsta rap in general and various news stories had suggested the dangers of gangland Los Angeles, among other places, but these things were all distant, almost mythological.Poking above the waves in the late 90s however was a series of topdown crime simulation computer games known as GTA which would eventually bring this entire world of crime right to your TV or computer screens. A catchy title, the first two installments and an expansion or two had the players navigating a city viewed from above, running their little sprite around shooting people, stealing cars, jumping bridges and delivering bombs. Addictive gameplay was given an edge by a high degree of polish, vaguely black humor, outlandish microplots and satisfying  if unrealistic  vehicle gameplay to be enjoyed alongside some hilarious radio channels.When GTA 3 came out at the turn of the century these things were translated more or less directly into a 3D world, meeting with huge success and revolutionising the public concept of exactly how much we would be able to expect from computer games going forward. An entire, full scale city was rendered for us in seamless 3D a short draw distance not being noticed as there was no real precedent to hold the game up against Beyond the graphics, the gameplay was every bit as darkly fun and raunchy as it had been in the 2D games, only this time in full 3D with a distinctive visual style  and of course the car driving was still there, satisfying as ever, with those radio stations becomming a core feature of the game  ah, Lazlow.The exceptional expansion GTA Vice City had come and gone  arguably staking a solid claim to being the best game in the entire series with the quantum leaps the game offered in terms of gameplay and, if less noticably, graphics  and before you knew it a new title had been announced GTA San Andreas.Things were different this time around. Consumer commitment would be tested by a huge change in tone from the white trash eastcoast earlier games to a Gangsta Rapinspired west coast rendition of Los Angeles gang warfare, headlined by an African American protagonist, and radio stations which would be booming out rap classics. Rockstar by now was building a third title for the ageing PS2 system, and the technological bottleneck which meant that the graphics in this game were only separated from Vice City by aesthetic margins  more polygonal detail on cars and most other objects, more vibrant colours, a more evocative set of terrain types  meant that a huge amount of attention was fixed on shoehorning more and more gameplay innovations into the package.Looking back each GTA title released on the PS2 was a quantum leap ahead of previous titles in terms of gameplay. GTA IV would arguably buck this trend  perhaps they ran out of ways to innovate, perhaps the power of the new system was too potent for them to focus on their other obligations  but San Andreas really was a bigger, badder, better game than any previous title. As such this review stands as a solemn assuranceDont let age fool you, San Andreas is a lush, vibrant, jampacked world of crime with halfforgotten gameplay tweaks and additions that will out at you out of the shadows of the past and cause huge grins to break out on your face.You play as Carl Williams? I forget, an African American man returning home from the East Coast to bury his mother and  exactly to what extent this was part of his plans at the outset is unclear  reconnect with his initially grudging former gang bretheren and wrestle control of the San Andreas region from anyone else who might wish to stake some claim to it. Small fish prevail at the start, as a corrupt cop, doubledealing gang member, pathetic music artist hopeful and a few other similar characters have you running the kind of jobs that are best accompanied by NWA or Cypress Hill, but after a highlight of the game has come and gone  an allout gang war in which you are free to dominate an entire city if you can be bothered  you are ejected out the refuse pipe of the starting city and sent scurrying across the redneck alpine regions between the SA towns, ending up in a different town full of different crooks and continuing on your quest for relevance and power.The game is long, the missions varied and often challenging, the vehicles more varied than ever and great fun. The list of characters is endless, and the gigantic environment offers hours upon hours of entertainment even when it is cordoned off into smaller regions at the start.Buy this game! It is guaranteed to be good value no matter the price, and it is a holdover from a time in gaming when things like the console wars persisted and the idea of single companies like EA or UbiSoft holding sway over vast spans of offered products was, while emryonic, merely background noise to the singleplayer offerings being offered for the iconic gaming platforms of the day. Of those offerings, GTA SA is without a doubt in the topmost echelon.
