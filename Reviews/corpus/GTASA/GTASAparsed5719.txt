Amazing and complex storyline. Dynamic and immersive gameplay  you can do just about anything in this game. Or at least all the things you could possibly expect to execute back in the 2000s era of videogames. Remarkable soundtrack. One of the most diversified openworld maps of gaming history despite not being particularly large. The chaotic environment and skyscrappers of Los Santos, the misty and modern feel of San Fierro, the countryside between them and the desert hosting an infamous parody of Area 51 Area 69 in the game and a purchaseable abandoned aistrip where you can take flying lessons. The luxury and casinos of Las Venturas. And theres more to it, waiting for you to explore.Best game ever.
