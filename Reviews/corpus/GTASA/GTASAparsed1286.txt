This game is amazing, god damn, I loved it as a kid and I love it now. Playing this again has given me so many good times, in my opinion this is the most fun and memorable GTA game. Soundtrack isnt as good as Vice Citys, but its still excellent. I miss playing this already and its only been a few months since I finished the game. There are so many good mods that I think Ill definitely replay it some time and have a new experience, but honestly this is one of those games I could play over and over.
