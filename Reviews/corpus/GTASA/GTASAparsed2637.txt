The best GTA, and a classic that belongs in everyones library. Still plays well to this day, and the PC version works well enough.However, the mobile and console versions have had significant graphical upgrades, cloud saving, enhanced controls, you name it.  The phone version looks better than the PC version outofthebox, somehow.  Plus, this game doesnt exactly play nicely with the Steam controller, but standard Xbox controllers seem to work.Still recommending this because its functional, but, come on, guys.  If the original release were v1.0, and the mobile  PS3/360 releases were 2.0, this would be... like, 1.2?
