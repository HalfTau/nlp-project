Loads of people have been saying how its a bad game now. I really cant see anytihng wrong. So the res is a bit stupid but its not going to kill you if you play in it. I am sure they added a custom radio station iswell. Not 100 sure. But if so then thats a really nice ferture they have added. After you change the controlls, mouse and graphics its quite good. All I can say is... Well done Rockstar.
