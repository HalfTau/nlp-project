Let me just start by saying I love Gta San Andreas, I use to play it on the Playstation 2. So I thought I would buy it again for the pc, for nostalgic reasons, but I have to say I was really disappointed by this port.So many problems abound,  With songs being removed, the controls are wack, not being able to save your game, saves getting ruined, bugs galore nothing new for Rockstar Games and theres something off about the textures, I just cant quite put my finger on it.So, in conclusion I cant recommend this game, at least this version anyways if anything, try to find the retail version, Im sure its better than this.
