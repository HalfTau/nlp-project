If you played Gta san andreas just for mods then i think you should AVOID THIS VERSION.The steam version Has alot of bugs involing the game then the original,I dont know if its just me but i do not think it is.I brought the game to put mods On GTA san andreas,but I found out that you cannot put mods on the gameBecause of steam not allowing it.Then i went to Downgrade the game but when i downgrade the game it doesnt work for me.It may work for you but it wouldnt work for me.This is by far the worse GTA san andreas version and I have 3 copys of this gamePS2,XBOX360 and IphoneThe GTA series is a Awsome series specially this masterpice.But steam just ruine it with a bad version.Just get any copy of GTA san andreas for PC except the Steam version.
