I rembember this so good from my childhood, with postits everywhere near my ps2, or when i got a cracked version and modded it to the fullest. Even when i bought it again on disc for pc i played through it.Im sure i got atleast 1000 hours on this game with playthroughs, modding and just roleplaying on single player or the online mod. God knows how many times ive played through this story, but now i bought it on steam aswell and im gonna do it again!100/10, an iconic game in the gaming history in my eyes.
