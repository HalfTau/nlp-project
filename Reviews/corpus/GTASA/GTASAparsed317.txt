I was not interested in games that much but after playing this game on my PC i have become a hardcore PC gamer. How to describe this game? Well it is the best Open world game with RPG elements like customizing character and vehicles. San Andreas is structured similarly to the previous two games in the series. The core gameplay consists of elements of a thirdperson shooter and a driving game, affording the player a large, open world environment. You can do almost everything in this huge map of the game. It is one of the best story  driven game. Though it is not graphically too good but it is nice. Well anyways this game is a gem, gameplay is awesome, story is best, customizing is huge, great open world to drive so many cars. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain cities and content, they are not required as players can complete them at their own leisure.I dont think any gamer have missed this game.
