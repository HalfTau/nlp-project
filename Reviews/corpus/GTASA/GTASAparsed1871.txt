TakeTwo and Rockstar decided it was a brilliant idea to ban modding. Yeah, thanks for shafting people like me for whom modding was a major reason for buying this game in the first place. I mean honestly, its like big corporations are going out of their way to drive consumers away these days. Is our respect not worth anything anymore? If you havent bought this yet, dont bother. If you have bought it, dont bother playing it anytime soon. TakeTwo and Rockstar have officially screwed themselves.Petition to save OpenIVEdit Apparently mods are okay again. I might remove this review if things stick.
