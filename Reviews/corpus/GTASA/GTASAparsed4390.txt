There isnt much to say about this game that everyone else hasnt said already, it was amazing when it was first released and still is due to the great memories, its surprising that an older game like San Andreas still has me interested. This is one of Rockstars finest gems and if you love the Grand Theft Auto series, then you will love this game for sure!
