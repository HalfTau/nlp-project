This GTA isnt Exactly the most impressive of the franchise, but its still a damn good game. It holds a place in my heart along with Vice City as a masterfully made game and i spent countless hours playing this on both my XBOX and PS2 Yes I loved this game so much i bought it for XBOX and PS2. Now GTA V might have the best graphics or gun play, but this game means so much more than that to many people. I still come back to play this game, even though there are all these fancy high tech games. This game is just so good and even if you have GTA V, you should still pay your respects to this masterfully made piece of art.
