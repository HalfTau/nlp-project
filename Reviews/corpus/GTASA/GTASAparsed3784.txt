Got this gameFirst GTA game I have ever playedHated the controls with a passion.Couldnt get used to driving. Failed OG loc mission 5 million times.Asked steam for refundDidnt get itDecided to play it some more because i might as well.Found i could turn off mouse controls steeringTurned off mouse controls steeringLoved the gameLoved the controlsLoved everythingI followed the damn trainPeople can say I didnt know why I followed the trainBut they can never say i didnt follow it.And even though they removed songs, its still a good game.Just because it isnt as good as it once was, doesnt mean it isnt a good game.
