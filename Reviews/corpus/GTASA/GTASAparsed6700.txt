i am blatantly copying this review, because i fully agree. and i am too lazy to type it all out myself. i would like to add that i still have to fix my mouse not working. i still get random crashes. and its getting Fd up to the point where i just want to download it. and not use the steam version. Fu rockstar, and Fu steam for changing the game to the point where it is unplayable.As of the recent patch, Rockstar ruined the game for everyone for literally no reason.The patch, which is MANDATORY to play the game through Steam now, replaced the original game with the garbage HD mobile port that was released on the Xbox 360, whichremoves 18 songsCritical Beatdown, Running Down A Dream, Woman To Woman, You Dropped A Bomb On Me, Yum Yum, Running Away, I Dont Give A fck, Express Yourself, Killing in the Name of, Hellraiser, Ring My Bell, Personal Jesus, Dont Let It Go To Your Head, Express Yourself. Rock Creek Park, Grunt, Soul Power 74 and The Paybackrevokes all mods created for San Andreas on PCdeletes all of your previous save filesremoves 1280x700 resolutionhas various textures missing and things like foilage completely removedThis update does nothing but suggest that no GTA game on Steam is safe from future backstabbing, downgrading, game breaking updates and I am truly ashamed that I gave my money to Rockstar for this game which not only I, but a plethora of fans love to death.This is a cancerous update and I highly recommend you get a physical copy of the game or get a download somewhere else of v1 or v1.1, because this is disgusting coming from Rockstar.If you already own the game on Steam, then immedietely write a bad review for this game and complain to Rockstar Games about this.EDIT As of 26th February, Rockstar still havent said a word about this and have delayed GTA V on PC for the third time to improve their quarterly sales report. They sure seem to care about the consumer.
