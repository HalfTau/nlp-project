10/10Still to this day the best GTA Ive ever played. The radio songs were terrible anyways, so I dont mind them being removed You can add your own anyways. Seriously, just go download all the songs they removed, and with the rest of the songs in the game files, put them on the custom radio station if you care that much. Or do it with better music. Simple.You couldnt mod it anyways beforehand without a custom patch from somewhere online, so the update changes nothing in the modability, and unless youre an UBER HARDCORE GAMER 4K RESOLUTION OR NOTHING, then the resolution should still be perfectly fine.People just want to cry, because thats what people on Steam do.
