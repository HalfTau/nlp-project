Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was a pinnacle of the gaming scene back in 2004. The game had so many more possibilities compared to the previous two 3D universe games, and is a fun experience. A disclaimer to note is that before you play, I would suggest downgrading your game to version 1.0, so you can actually mod the game and get back some graphical features which were oddly removed. Overall, stellar game, and would definately recommend this to people looking for a GTA game that they can run.
