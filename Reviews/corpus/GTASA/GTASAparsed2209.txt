All you have to do, is follow the damn mission markers, CJ.Seriously though its a good game. I used to have it on disk, but then I lost it. At any rate, Ive found its replay value surpasses all the other GTAs. Or maybe thats my nostalgia talking, I dont know. I do like the level of customization, from skinny to fat, every type of clothing you want, and  a larger hair selection than GTA V singleplayer. The missions can be tough sometimes, but most of them are fun. Weapons are satisying enough, and I used to spend my time writing down all the cheats. I still have some memorized, like JumpJet and HESOYAM.10/10 would waste entire weeks until my laptop melted near the last mission so I lost all my progress and then I didnt play it for years again.
