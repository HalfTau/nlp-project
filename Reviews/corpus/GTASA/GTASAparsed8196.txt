San Andreas is probably the best GTA game to this day. While inovation in the series has always been present, with GTA IIIs radical switch to a third person, over the shoulder open world and GTA IVs story/character based gameplay, San Andreas stuck with what made series always enjoyable, gang bangers and guns. CJ is layered like a cake, Big Smoke is better than cuzain Roman and LS representin Lamar combined and Sam Jacksons officer Tenpenny is a despicable antagonist. The world is great and open to mayhem, the soundtrack is full of great songs from Express Yourself to Hellraiser, go out and buy it, even if the graphics arent up to snuff.
