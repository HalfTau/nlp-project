One of my favorite GTA games of all time. Playing it now, you can see just how behind the times it is, but if you havent played this game, you must. If you have played it before, its a fun trip down memory lane. I have said for some time that I wish Rockstar would take the time to remaster these games Vice City, San Andreas and even IV with todays technology, and even though that have not and probably will not, its still one of the better games ever made.
