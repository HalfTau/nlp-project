This game is old but gold.GTA San Andreas is the most sold game in the history of the GTA series. There are a number of good reasons for why this is the case.The first game where you could do whatever you want. Fly airplanes and helicopters. Cars and motorbikes. Tanks. Boats. Even JETPACKS. Unlike some GTAs GTA IV you can even swim under water.You can personalise your style by going to the barbershop. You can even go to the gym to get ripped! D You can learn new fighting skills by practicing boxing in the gym... How long do I keep going? YOU CAN EVEN PLAY ARCADE GAMES IN THE GAME ITSELF. A GAME WITHIN A GAME DOkay, now to the story line. The missions are great and exciting. The characters have distinctive personalities which allows you to bond with them. For example, Big Smoke. He was fat, funny, friendly and generally likeable. There was OG LOC. Funny gansta wannabe. I dont want to spoil the story, you just have to play it to understand.This is truly a golden and original game, especially for the time it was released. The graphics arent as good as GTA IV and V. But you have to understand that its not always about how good the game looks. The story and all the other small details matter more that how good the graphics are. Games these days need to learn from original games like these.
