The game itself is very awesome and has much fans and players even nowdays, but the things are that thatve made it worse in the latest patch.There ARE good side of it it now supports new OS windosw 7, 8.1 are working good.But whats the cost! The main thing ive noticed is realy weird video mode. it now supports only few resolutions and all are not bigger then 1280x768. The next thing ive noticed is a crash from the main manu as you try to go into advanced video settings. this way I cant setup a normal resolution. Some folks also report such stuff like missing songs, textures and so on.The thing is that theyve put a silly port from Xbox 360 into steam instead of the original PC version. This sux much.Upd It is possible to tune a normal resolution with a thirdparty patch
