I loved this game when it relesed on ps2, so i figured its on sale, and my pc can run it my pc isnt built for gaming. The problem i have with it is that the saves keep breaking and I am not sure what it is but that shouldnt be a thing. Will only not recomend untill somehow you or steam figures out a way to fix the save breaks
