Were navigating thought 90s in California, youve came back to San Andreas, because your momma died, and you see involved in serious drug cartel, helping your gang most known as Groove. And then you should make some unique missions. I Really love this game, theres nothing bad to say about it. Its 100/10. Greatest Rockstar Games job.
