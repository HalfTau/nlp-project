Dont waste your money on this game!!!!!Mouse controls doesnt work after the update despite having it selected in the options menu.  It may work for some people, however as of now it doesnt work for me.  Also the resolution has been reduced.  Loosing a few songs is no big deal.  I guess I could plug in my Xbox controler and it will work just fine.  I had a Lodgitech controler that I use for flight sim which worked.
