Pros Excellent storyGreat characters with some hysterical dialogueVery good soundtrack The state of San Andreas is vast and detailed at least for its time, with three fully constructed cities to explore and plenty of small towns and landmarks in the forests and deserts surrounding Los Santos, Las Venturas and San Fierro The controls are good across the board with one exception, discussed below You can have a lot of fun with the games cheat codesCons The airplane controls are terrible the Flight School missions are absolute torture Some music was removed a while ago due to expired licenses, but you can put them back in if you want to by downloading mp3 files of said removed songs and placing them in your User Track Playlist Thanks to Hot Coffee and the resulting controversy, GTA San Andreas is difficult to mod though not impossible The game will sometimes randomly crash in the menus or loading screensConclusion Despite of few flaws, this game is excellent and one of the most important titles in video game history. San Andreas is a musthave.
