This game has probably been the best 10, I have ever spent. Gameplay is Fun, Storyline is kinda cheesy but still awesome. The by now Iconic Phrases, like Big Smokes order, Follow the goddamn train CJ and Its OG Loc homie. Although there are a few graphical glitches the game feels rocksolid and it its very fun and easy to mod.
