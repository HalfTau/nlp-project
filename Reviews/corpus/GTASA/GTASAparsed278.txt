My Review Of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas This Game Is Really Good The Gameplay Amazing But The Tip Is If You Just Bought The Game Then Use This Okay If Your Playing With A Keyborad And Mouse Then Turn Off Steering With Mouse and flying with mouse it really gets better when those to are off the game is open world duh and its full of Cheats and Easter Eggs And Sometimes Bugs There Are Loads Of Missions And Other FunIts Really A Good Game Even Though It Came Out In 2005 It Really Holds Up The Gameplay okay so the gameplay is really good but again turn off Steering With Mouse and flying with mouse Than It Can Make The Game Odd But The On Foot Controlls Is Really Easy And Like Every PC Game Has W A S D To Move And Drive Cars The Camera Okay if you like your sensitivity High Then Skip This Point Okay So The Game Starts You Off With Your sensitivity High And If Your Like Me Then Lower It Down The Overall Its a really good game some bugs here and there not to many though the game is really good on pc i recommend this if You Like Open World Action and Crime And Overall 10/10 Goodbye Everone
