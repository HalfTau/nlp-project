Welp.Ive played this game as a kid. I bought it because I had spare money.ANd I gotta say.Its way better than what I remembered it to be.I can mod it and I can do everything i wish to do.Im currently trying to do a True save.Its gonna be fun and take thousands of hours.Please, for the love of the train, buy this.Just downgrade to 1.0 by the way, otherwise this game will be rendered unplayable for most.
