This is probably my most favorite grand theft auto game.It has every thing, sex, violince, Blacks, Gangs, Guns, Drugs, Beer, ect.But it has some flaws.The glicthes are insane, like I once flew through a building in a plane and lived.But those glicthes are what make this game fun.It also has many easter eggs and secrets.Just get the ing gameMy gaming score 9 drug dealers/10
