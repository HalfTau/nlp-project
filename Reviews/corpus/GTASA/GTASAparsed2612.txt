Updated  20.12.2017.Boy. This game is by far the definitely my favorite GTA , and favorite game of all time. The music, the story, the nostalgia, the.... everything. Game is so perfect, and it has a lot of fun for 10 euros, which is definitely worth of . Its the best one in the series, and i have so many memories on it. Unfortunately, this game shows its age on Windows 10, by having some issues, other than that, it works well without any predefined settings.1 Game crashes on startup often when youre trying to skip the intros. This isnt a big deal, because its not gamebreaking, and game can be started up normally when we ignore this issue.2 Weird textures. Graphics arent bad for 2004 game graphics dont matter to me anyway, but some player textures are weird and they look bad i thought it was my contrast on display, but it was games issue.3 Game hangs sometimes, i know i lost my progress on LS races, and now i have to do it again RIP.4 Crashes sometimes, especially in the missions, but that is a rare case.5 Visible glitches, especially in the Smokes crack palace, where its obviously visible after the game is completed.So, is this game worth buying ? Yes. I get often to rare problems with it, but it 13 year old game, so i dont mind those bugs. Game is worth 10 eur indeed, since it has infinite replay value for me, and im huge GTA fan i own all of them, excluding PSP ones, 1 and 2.. Game is really fun, and i really recommend it to everyone.
