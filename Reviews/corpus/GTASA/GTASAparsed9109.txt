GTA San andreas is without a doubt a fun game, though graphically wise its not going to turn heads it more than makes up for it with sheer fun things to do, if you ever played saints row 2 then you will likely see why it was called the spiritual successor to San andreas.Of course there are a lot of annoying problems with the game itself, mostly bugs like for the fact you mouse wont work after a while even if you play it on compatibility mode and that it tends to freeze up on the occassion when you pause.if it werent for those problems then this game would truly deserve a 10/10 rating for enjoyment.Of course you can find fixes for it, but thats if youre willing to do a little extra work to play.
