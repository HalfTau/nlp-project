OK so i am watching people complain about the latest patch which truly ruins the game. Guys you can still search on Google how to workaround this patch. After some search i managed to bring the game back to its former glory. This game is really good the best GTA title so far ,for classic good old memories and has a great storyline wich is definately worth playing. I used to have a retail version of this game before steam was created P  and had some hundreds of hours playing this game. Overall 20/10 , and trust me you are not gonna ger bored with this game with either playing the story or running around blowing stuff up and killing civilians. Got it on sale for only 1.99 so yep it is 200 worth
