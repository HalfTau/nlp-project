GTASA is a great game for sure, but it has a bit of gloches, that are not so important. Worst thing in this game is the thig, that you cant run it on Windows 10 as easy, as enother games. You have to go to Control Panel  Programs  Programs and Fetures  Turn Windows features on or off top left corner  Legacy Components and turn on DirectPlay, but its worth it, couse u can play one of best games from Rockstart Games. Totaly recomment for every fan of GTA frenchise.
