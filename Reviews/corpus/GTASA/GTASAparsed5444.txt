Not only is this my favorite GTA game, but its also one of my favorite games of all time. Its so unbelievably fun to play, and its all around filled with great content and things that give it a surprising amount of replayability. The game is more complex than other GTA games in a few ways, like the fact that you can build muscle/gain fat/level up certain skills. It also has the same typical GTA charm where you can just cause destruction on massive scales.Best GTA, pretty good port.
