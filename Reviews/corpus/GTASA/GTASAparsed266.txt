Still an amazing classic game. Even though it is somewhat an old game, it is still a mustplay and a musthave for players, new or experienced that enjoys an openworld game with a compelling story. It is the trademark of Rockstar that really lived up to its full potential, and teaching us that good games come and go, but legends are forever. This game is already 13 yearsold and counting, and people still play this masterpiece, due to its replayability. GJ Rockstar.
