youre all gonna hate me for this but beyond the mildly amusing writing and the fact it has one of the better gta soundtracks it feels so clunky and stupid mechanically that its hard as balls to enjoyyes, its old, yes, its dated, i really dont mind either of those things, but its just not that well designed or fun, the shooting is awful, the driving is slightly floaty, and god help you if you combine the two, the missions are frustrating, and while you might say its all about the side content, i feel like thats just an excuse to have terrible main content in so many gamestheres nothing wrong with liking a game just for  around potential, i understand that fully, but wouldnt it be better if it had both a good main game AND a good sandbox game? would you even HAVE to say its about the side content then? i dunno, maybe im weird and most of my actual opinions on games tend to be skewed towards the weird/odd sorts of games total distortion, cosmology of kyoto, pathologic, so on come to mind but i just couldnt get into this one
