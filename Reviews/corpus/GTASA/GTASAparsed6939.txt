Somewhere, someone in Rockstar Studios decided to update their game, nearly ten years after release, to make it ultimately inferior  a worse product. They removed songs, replaced textures, removed details, and generally downgraded it. They decided to take away developers from certain development teams such as the Grand Theft Auto V development team to make this version worse.This is absolutely and completely stupid. I beg of you to not purchase this product, and, if you already own it, to write a poor review for it to inform Rockstar Studios of their mistake so that this version may, possibly, be fixed. I want only the best version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas to be on Steam. This is truly a fantastic game, though this is a poor version.
