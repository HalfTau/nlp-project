Easily my favourite Grand Theft Auto game If not for the nostalgia, for the deep yet quirky story that will have you replaying it for years to come.Right now Im doing my 7th playthrough of the game 1st on PC, going for my 2nd 100 completion. Thoroughly enjoying it and Im even picking up little things I hadnt noticed on previous runs to this day. Couldnt reccomend this higher if you are a fan of the newer games and want to go back to the series roots very good place to start or to people who have never really sat down infront of a GTA game for longer than 6 hours before and want to know what the hype is all about.
