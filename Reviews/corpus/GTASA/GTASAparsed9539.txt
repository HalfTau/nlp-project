This Game is a brilliant game.It has good story,great gameplay even if frustrating at times and is also very complex and long and is very fun to play even if you are just killing hookers and cops. A few of the problems with is some missions can be really hard and/or frustrating and the graphics arent very good but I dont care about graphics.My recommendations is buy it during a sale unless youre a graphics snob or someone who hates sex,violence,profanity etcEdit After 2 yearsScrap that, New Steam patch made this game utternow
