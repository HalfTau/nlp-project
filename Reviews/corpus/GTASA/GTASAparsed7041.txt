Was able to play the game for about 6 hours after installing, but the next day it didnt recognize my mouse any more or something like that. I couldnt look around ingame nor could I click anything! In the menu I was able to move the cursor, but not to click anything. Since this is a PC version I want  ofc  play with mouse and keyboard. Unfortunately this is impossible.What to do in such a case? Search the web, right. But forum/community tips like putting a certain .dll into the games folder didnt work for me.So what to do then? Contact the support, just that easy  halt! Just that easy??? Certainly the most major FAIL of steam! They dont want to take any responsibility for 3rd party games, which I can understand to a certain degree. But you cant even put a ticket on Rockstar support since you have to wait ONE MONTH SIC! until youre able to comment in the forum! To make things even better for users there is no other way to contact them. Oh! Wait, theres a twitter account... I tweeted them and cant be sure my problem will be understood in 140 signs by them... Letz see whats gonna happen there. I also tried to contact the steam support, but they didnt even read my request, they just sent me an automatic email which told me that nothing can be done about that and that thereby my problem is marked as solved.FU steam, rly! You cant treat your customers like this!
