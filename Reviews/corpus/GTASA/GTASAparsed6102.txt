This game is bombproof. Its unassailably perfect and certainly the best game in the franchise. I like the PS2 version a bit better though, because in this version the camera is a bit dodgy, you need to rebind half of your controls and those ers took Killing In The Name by RATM out of the Radio X tracklist. Still a great game.
