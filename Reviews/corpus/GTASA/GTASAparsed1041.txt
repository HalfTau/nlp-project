Nothing beats good ol San Andreas climate.This game was with me throughout most of my childhood.I remember the countless hours spent during rainy days, while noone was outside, which me and my friends would spend on flying around with a Hunter or a Hydra, causing some havoc. Its nice to pay some respect for this title by writing a posirive review, but I dont think that comprehends how much feelings Ive for this game.Nostalgia 4 Life. Definitelly recommended!! !
