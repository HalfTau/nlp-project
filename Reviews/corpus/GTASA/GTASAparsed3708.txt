This game is probably one of my favourite games of all time for its amazing story line, its amount of missons and the outstanding nostalga feel you get when remembering playing this on ps2. Ive already used up about 150 or so hours on this game and just about hitting only halfway from completing the game. I mean, sure the graphics arent as good as most games out now, but if you want a game with an amazing story line and hours, apon hours of gameplay, than this is the game for you.However, the notorious  follow the damn train CJ is definately still as broken as it ever was.100 would recommend.
