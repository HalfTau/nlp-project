, because my mouse / stick stops working ingame for no reason and I have to change the CPU affiliation to make them work... for about 5 minutes.This version is entirely broken. Cant believe I wasted 9 EUR for this.If it wasnt for this crap, it would be a great game, I tried everything I found on the internet.Im on Windows 8.1 Professional 64 bit, if that helps.
