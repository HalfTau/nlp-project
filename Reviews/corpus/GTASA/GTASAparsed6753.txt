Now, before you grab your torches, I love this game, but please hear me out first.Ive played this game for a large number of years ever since it debued on the PS2, and 2 years I picked up this game as part of the Steam Summer Sale 2013. I usually dont play the PC version that much compared to other GTA PC ports, but I recently got back in to it, and Rockstar has to  it up. What do I mean? Well for starters, they recently had an update having new features such as a better resolution and controller support. However, I wouldnt really call the controller support well intergrated, as its very basic, and in my opinion not well optimized since it doesnt work for me. HOWEVER, the biggest problem with this new update, is that it causes the saves to become corrupted, and for some, all of their save files are gone, with no way of getting it back. This is the most t update that Rockstar has ever released, its terrible. Not to mention, they removed 19 songs of this games soundtrack, most likely due to copyright reasons but there is no way of preventing this game from being updated, so hope you didnt have any 100 saves, because now youre left with a  version of GTASA with your saves corrupted. I cannot recommend this port by any means, there is a way to downgrade it, so theres that at least. Please do not buy this port unless you have the option to downgrade it, GTASA is still a great game, even to this day and I would recommend this port any day, if there wasnt that  update to begin with. Rockstar, you disappoint me, you know better than this.
