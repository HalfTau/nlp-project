I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to buy it but I will add a few minor issues that keep happening to me1 Freezes occasionally on a black screen2 Game occasionally spawns random vehicles near me3 Gun battles with enemy gangs spawns a lot of them4 When driving cars it decides to drop through the floor/mapIve only been playing this game less then a couple of days and these are some of the issues I have, but overall its smooth and if you put the graphics to very high it works no problem. If you do decide to play with cheats be careful and make a new save to go back to later. I wish it had muliplayer and more camera views but still one of my favourite gtas to play Rate  9/10
