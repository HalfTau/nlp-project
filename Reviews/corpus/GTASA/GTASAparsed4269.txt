For years this game has been at the heart or Open World gaming community and playing this game on PC for the first time was a whole lot better experiance, and playing it on the Plastation 2 when i was a child was so much fun really love this game! Though if the deveopers were still around i think that maybe some sort of multiplayer mode would be a really nice touch to such an old game! Anyways hope you enjoyed the reveiw guys!
