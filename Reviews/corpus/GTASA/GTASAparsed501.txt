OMG Where To Start on this beautiful game, It is by far 1 of the best GTA Games If Not The best For Its Story Telling Ability And the amount of endless easter eggs there Are In This Game. There Has Never Been A Game Where I Have Stayed Up 72 hours Straight To Be Lost In A Game As San Andreas. I Think I was 5 When I Played This Game I Know Bad Parenting  , And Now Im 15 Almost 16 I Am Honored For this Game To Have Been My  First  Violent Video Game... 10/10
