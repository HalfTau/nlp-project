This game will go down in history as one of Rockstars greatest creations, you can enjoy hours and hours of playtime on this game without having to worry about getting bored as there is always something to do, if it werent for this game i dont think Rockstar would have been able to create GTA 5 and the stunning graphics it has today, playing this game is by far a very fun experience and a throwback to the old GrandTheftAuto series which we all know and love.
