Id like to begin with the problems with this game, they could have updated the graphics a little bit as they have with the console versions. Not only that but the pc controls are very odd to use and you cant change them which becomes annoying, you do however have the option to play with a joypad which is probably a better way to play the game because they didnt optimize it well for pc.Now the good news, mods and multiplayer are fun and great and probably the only reason you got this game again on steam specifically. Multiplayer is fun to play however you need to install seperate software to play it as its not by rockstar.Overall the game is still great from my previous exprerience on a ps2 and ps3 and even iphone, it has a great story and is one of my favourite grand theft autos and is truley a classic. Not only that but it has some of the best cheats in any GTA game in my opinion. Also now with the pc community is what really brings this game to life, with mods and new textures and even multiplayer, so overall if you can look past and get used to the odd controls its a pretty solid game overall.
