When playing this game it brought back many good memories from the past, and has always been a pleasure to play. If anyone knows a site called Multi Theft Auto, I highly recommend it because its multiplayer and allows you to play with your friends on hundreds of servers with a varity of languages, overall the game has a strong base to the story line and keeps anyone with their eyes glued to the screen. Unlike GTA 5, I feel this game was really finished and polished. A game that was ahead of its time is now and forever will be available to the new generation of gameplay. If I had to say what I thought of this game. It would be 11/10. Done and Done
