Growing up as a white kid in a nonwhite neighborhood, I got a lot of bikes stolen from me. I would say over the course of my life Ive had about 1012 bikes stolen. This used to make me really sad, but in GTA San Andreas I got to role play stealing a bike from a white kid and riding off into the sunset with it. I had no idea it was so much fun to steal bikes from white kids. Now that GTA taught this to me Im not sad about all my lost bikes, because I know how much joy stealing them from me brought to other people.
