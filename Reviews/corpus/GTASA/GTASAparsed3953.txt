The game itself is absolutely fantastic, definitely one of my all time favourites. Its a timeless classic that remains fun to this day, and has aged relatively well. I would almost certainly recommend this.However, do not buy the steam version, many iconic songs are missing, and the graphical settings are botched. Preferably get an older version elsewhere, or if you really feel the need to buy the steam version, make sure you downgrade to V1.0.
