Fun game! Keep in mind that, unless you find a way to prevent automatic updates, that this is updated the the 10th aniversery, which removes some music tracks from some radio station. Still fun after all of these years, though! It argurably stands up to even the recent GTAs today with fun gameplay, responsive controls, and an expansive world modeled after California. Reccomended if you need a sandbox with a emotional story, but youre on a budget. If you enjoy this, youll probably enjoy vice city and 3 as well.
