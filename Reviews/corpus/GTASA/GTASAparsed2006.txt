Yes, one of my favorite childhood game.Yes and no at the same time. wait for a sale then buy it. its no worth the full price. Rockstar removed some songs and changed some feature that was available on ps2. But not on pc. i recommend that you downgrade the game patch files.Watch these videos for more info.I didnt make these videosGTA SA  How to Downgrade Steam Version Tutorial  Feat. SpooferJahkGTA SA  Steam Vs Retail version Comparison  Feat. SpooferJahkIf you are in to old gta games this is for youCities to country landscape, there are so much to exploreThe gunfights is easy to understand and hard sometime. There are alot of stuff you have to do to get 100 game.the graphics looks good for being 2005 pc version.Audio and the voice acting is good, the songs is lit if you are using v1.0Story is still awesome even today.The game runs good but dont forget to turn off frame limiter and use like nvidia inspector and lock the fps to 60 for less lags.Not gonna list my specs cuz nearly every pc can run this goodThe mods for gta san andreas is amazing and the dedicated multiplayer SAMP and MTA is alot of fun. i recommend trying it out but beware of downloading viruses from servers. SAMP and MTA has players around 1 mil I could be wrong but that is freaking awesome.There are no checkpoint save or autosave. You must save manually.Good game but some stuff could have been better. But 2005 i cant really complain so much7.8/10
