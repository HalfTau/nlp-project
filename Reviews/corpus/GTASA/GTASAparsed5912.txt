this game has such a great story witch is why its so dissapointing. this is a clunky floaty buggy game with missions doing stuff ahead of its time if you dont know what that means it means that nothing works!!!!! flying driving racing and swiming all suck balls! and that is a slap in the face to fans of the games before it and who are playing san andreas because incase you didnt know grand theft auto is all about swimming shooting driving and racing and flying. now the music is awesome though and fits the setting of the 90s well. but thats about it all the characters are stupid and poorly voice acted and that makes the main one that you play as even worse. CJ will say the N word call people es and harm people witch i normally would have no problem with but in this game its trying to say that it makes you hard core and trust worthy to your gang. guys come on are you for real here when your going the un funny intense rout you cant do this to your game! side attractions are pointless and have you lifting waits with quick time events and you have to do all of this if you are wanting CJ to be able to run for more then 5 seconds. you also have to eat food in this game to keep CJ strong and healthy. this game is like akward mother simulator take care of precious CJ or he turns into a no good fat fake OG its so stupid. this game is not the greatness we have seen in the other games i cant beleave i hate this game so much when i play the others hours a day to kill time in my summer. but i cant beat the game and there is no other fun to be had. the others were like if you did not like the story well go do all this other funn stuff rampaging movie theaters golf and so much more!!! go buy the others there great but this gets a 3 out of ten i give it credit for having an awesome story and for about 4 hours of fun at first. but if you want to see the state of san andreas go play gta V.
