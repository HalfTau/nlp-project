GTA San Andreas is, in my opinion, one of the best gta game ever made and even seeing the game cover brings back so many wonderful memories of playing this masterpiece.This game has an interesting storyline packed with nice voice acting and humour. Trying to help CJ achieve the greatness is very challenging.The reasons why GTA San Andreas is so highly rated are its huge map, nevergetsold game play and fantastic soundtrack. The missions are always new, fresh and non repetitious, thats why it has a great replay value.
