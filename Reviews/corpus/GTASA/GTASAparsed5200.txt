Not going to argue, but such a great game is 70 off for 3.00.And even then, without a sale, its only 15.00.And the best part about this game is that you play as a black dude, and the first thing you do is steal a bike. I dont even ing know anymore.Its also really easy to mod, and the mods you can currently get are very nice to have.It may say I havent played at all this week, but I needed to get a downgraded .exe to run mods, but still payed the 3.00 it was on sale for at the moment.My mods I currently ownFirst PersonA ton of ing car mods that sometimes steal textures from the environment and make everything invisible. So, try to limit yourself to around 5 vehicle mods if you use a lowperformance PC.Underpriced, but..Shhhh, dont tell Gaben. Hell raise the price.11/10  IGN
