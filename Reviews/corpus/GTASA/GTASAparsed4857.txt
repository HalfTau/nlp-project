GTA San Andreas is a great game, but this Steam port is very disappointing A lot of the original tracks featured at the ingame radio are missing No support for full HD resolutions 25fps is the max framerate Bad support for mods No support for old save files.The game is good despite these bugs of course, but still, the 1.0 patch is better.
