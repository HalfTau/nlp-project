Im playing through this game despite how I despise hiphop and gang culture. Its not really that the game glorifies or is critical of the material anyway.. it just reflects on it and lets the player decide, and its not without its humor.But when the main character indulges requests to kill complete strangers because some idiot he doesent even respect asks him to, it comes across as totally inconsistent, makes no sense for the story, and seems dumb. Hopefully that wont be the rest of the missions to the game, which is probably massively long. I bet im 2 done or something, ugh.This is one of the better GTA games of all time. Its dated today.. so i guess you would need to turn the clock back too far to play this one, unless you really want to go back and try it.
