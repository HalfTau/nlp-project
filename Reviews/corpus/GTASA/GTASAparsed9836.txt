What can I say? Beatifull babes, fast car, quick cash and loads and loads of ammo. One to buy 3. Its Grand Theft Auto, GTFO. The game randomly creates traffic around you, even if you watch the road one second and there is nothing there infront of you, try moving the camera around 360, everytime you do that there will be something new waiting there right infront of you out of the blue.. Still.. Pew pew pwnage.
