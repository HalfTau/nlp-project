    Still the best openworld game to date.You play as Carl Johnson, an exgangbanger that moved to Liberty City to live the good life. After years away from his old mates, he goes back to Los Santos to attent to his mothers, only to find himself back into the life he desperately wanted to get away from.Unlike Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, the gameplay hasnt aged at all. Anyone who played IV or V will know what to expect, as it is the basis for every new GTA title. You can climb anything you want, look anywhere you want without the camera bothering you, interact with pedestrians, climb a mountain with a bike and much, much more. Its not about what youdo, its about what youdo.As this is the first 3D openworld game ever to have multiple cities, it leaves a lot to be expected. Fortunately, it does not disappoint. The cities Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas are incredibly huge and detailed, fiddled with minigames, sideactivities and crazy characters to spice up the formula. All accompanied by a large countryside for you toexplore.When you attach all that with an awesome licensed soundtrack that takes cues from dozens of different genres with the voice of Samuel L. Jackson himself, you realize that this is a game like no other. The world that Rockstar created using this engine feels like a living charicature of 90s USA, even if its held back by the games primitive visuals. Its just one of those rare videogames that everyone just needs to experience atleast once in their lifetime. I still find myself in awe from timetotime with the outstanding atmosphere the state of San Andreas provides.
