Im big fan of GTA series since it first part GTA1. My favorite one of them  GTA Vice City PC. I love the style, the city, the music. GTAIV is great too. Im not familar with GTAV yet soon, I guess Ill try Nr5 game on my PCBUT! I cant play GTA San Andreas at all. Everythings wrong with it  controls, music, city design, missions. This game is a trainwreck. Refund, please. 1/10
