Do not buy this game.After fiddling around withfor like an hour trying to just install the game because it kept telling me I need DirectX 9, which I have, I discovered that Rockstar completely removed modding and multiplayer with the new patch. I didnt really care that people were complaining that songs were removed and save files not working since Im buying the game after the patch and a few songs missing sucks but I can live without all that. So now Im going to have to torrent the game so I can play multiplayer since.. Multiplayer simply doesnt work since the new patch, The only reason I bought the game.What the  Rockstar?
