Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a fun single player game where it is taken place in San Andreas in the 90s. Your character is a young aferican american man named Cj who meets up with his old gang and wants to take back what was once theirs! Now in San Andreas you can play missions which is mostly the story to the game, or you can just run around and shoot and steal stuff! You can swim where most of the other GTAs you couldnt. You can also fly airplanes, jets, fighter jets, and not sure but I think helicopters too. Also the this is one of the GTAs where you can pilot a airplanes which is one reason why I bought this game. If you like good story lines or just like to mess around this is so the game for you!
