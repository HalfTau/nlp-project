Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is the legendary game who everyone must play in their life. The Story can be around 4560 to a normal player, and take in all the side quests and collectibles to collect which adds about 2040 hours more. A veteran player like me should finish it in about 23 weeks and doing at the same time the extra activities. However like everygame it has its flaws like some minor glitches and bugs but they dont take away the fun. Overall at this price its a must have game. And always remember, All you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!My Rate 10/10
