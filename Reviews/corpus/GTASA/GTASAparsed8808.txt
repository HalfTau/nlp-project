I absoluetely love this game. It is still my favorite GTA by far, so it has been fun to go on a little nostalgia trip. It feels like it has ported really well to PC for the most part, it still has the same feel and enjoyment of running around doing missions, exploring the city, or just running around causing mayhem. My only issue is that the controls for me do not seem to have ported very well, I have spent a lot of time reconfiguring controls over and even then there were a few controls that felt a little wonky. The first low rider mission is an example of this where it felt a little odd, but with a little reconfiguration I was able to finish the mission and continue enjoying myself. Overall, this was not enough for me to not recommend this game. I would especially recommend it for those who are fans of the series and those who love this particular game in the series.
