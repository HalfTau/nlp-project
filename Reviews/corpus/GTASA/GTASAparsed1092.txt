I had no issues playing this game on my older laptop. I now have a mid range pc and I cant get past the main menu. Everytime I start a new game, it crashes. No idea how to fix it. I have looked at some solutions to this problem however none of them have solved the issue. If/when I find a way to actually play the game, Ill change this review to a recommend.Windows 10Ryzen 5 1400GTX 1060 6GB8GB DDR4 Ram
