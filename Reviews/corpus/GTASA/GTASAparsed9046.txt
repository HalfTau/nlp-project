Hi today im reviewing GTA SAN ANDREAS. I enjoy this game deeply, whether you are messing about or following a story. This game is exccelent! I have played 150 hours and counting of this gorgues game. The cartoony look makes this game stand out from the croud, I know the new GTAs such as GTA VI and GTA V are realistic but that takes messing around out of the eqation.I just love this game I can only give this game  /5 stars PLAY THIS GAME ITS OUT ON PC FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE A  PLAYSTAITION 2 AND AVALIBLE ON STEAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
