This is, without a doubt, one of the very best games Ive ever played. Some games you hear all kinds of praise about, they get 10/10s all across the board and when you play them you end up feeling like youve been scammed, some games are universially considered rubbish and laughed at by all and sundry. GTA San Andreas isnt one of them. Right from the start, from the very first time the police drop you in Balla territory, to the time you hear your combine harvester cut through crazed cultists, to the first time you get behind the pilots cockpit of a Hydra fighter plane, every moment sticks with you.For todays realistic graphics and complex storylines and total linear action and easy save and restart everywhere gamers you kids these days this game will look very dated, but for its time it was an incredible influence and PS2s BEST game without a doubt. On PC, theres all kinds of incredicble mods you can get, which while that may apply to all GTA games some of the best Ive ever seen are on this game. Recomended the online mod and a good console command/trainer.Dont let my small play time fool you Ive been playing this for years on the PS2. Its got to a point where I know San Andreas State more than I know my home city, and most of my music taste comes from GTA white guy who likes underground rap, natch now, Ive explored every nook and cranny of the game, modded it to the extremes and yet here I am, still riding around on vanilla with the radio off just enjoying the drive.For anyone who got this free with their copy of GTA V pre order, and who hasnt played it yet ! I implore that you play this first. No doubt it will fill the time until March, but even then you will keep playing it even after GTA V. Call it nostalgia goggles, call it dated, but dont call it overrated. This is one of the most golden things to come out of gaming, and until GTA V proves me wrong I will still call this Rockstars greatest game.
