GTA San Andreas is one of my favorite GTA games of all time. Following the story of CJ, you will try to make your life in the state of San Andreas, facing many problems along the way. I am a person who loves free roam games, and with the map size of GTA San Andreas, it is definitely an enjoyable experience.
