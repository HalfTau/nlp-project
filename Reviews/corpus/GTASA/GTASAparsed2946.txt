Hi fellow gamers, I have played 2 previous versions of good ol GTA San Andreas V1.0 which was hacked by some rather amatuer hacker trying to hone their craft but failing badly. V2 Australian version which ran pretty well considering the age of the game but then along came Win 10 in all its glory. So after some discussion and consideration we decided to try V3 Steam version and so far it works very well. My only concern or complaint is the controller config but its minor and maybe I havent had enough caffeine this week  Graphics wise it looks better although maybe thats just us grabbing at straws and of course it can only run upto 1920x1080 but that is to be expected given the age of the game.My machine is AMD FX 8350  8 core Win 10 64 bit, 32 Gig RAM, NVidia Titan X 12 gig video RAM Triple 27 Samsung curved screen monitors, Sound Blaster ZxR Pro sound card.so the burning question, Is it worth the money? should I buy it? .. mm thats 2. ok well it is an old game but its like an old photograph. Nice to pull out from time to time and drift back into fond memories before gravity and aging took its toll. My son and grandson got me into this game  a few years ago and we have all completed it 100 a few times and while I love to hate this game  there is something about it that cannot be ignored ...  buy it, do it now, you know you want it!
