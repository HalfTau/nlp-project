My go to game few years back whenever I was bored. Just open up GTA San Andreas and do whatever you want to do. Complete side missions, drive around listening to ingame radio or just have some crazy fun. Graphical style is really quite different, or even one can say dull compared to other GTA games even Vice City which is older.ProsGood and long storySome interesting charactersLots of side activities..... well its GTAHuge area to explore and have fun, both city and country sideImprovement on gameplay mechanics over previous GTA gameConsGraphics seems little dull, even Vice City looks ok years afterwards
