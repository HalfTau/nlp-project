Well, short summaryProsIts GTA San AndreasRuns smooth on highest settingsVery great amount of featuresLots of vehiclesTons of customisation optionsConsCant install modsNo achievement systemHoped for a little remaster, like did on PS3 or mobile portsBut anyways, it has the feel of the original 11 years old PC version of SA.
