I was reading the comments on the game saying that the lates update broke it, and i thought Nahhhhh, could it be thatbad?It is.....i cant play this.....aspect ratio is  framerate is  and i cant event use my  mouse to play it......the cursor appears in the menus but I can just move it, clicking function does not work.This is a worthless product now and if this isnt fixed quickly I think a refund would be in order, seriously, and old game that worked fine along time ago with pcs alot slower is now unplayable because.......well thats a good.Dont buy it, waste of money and time.
