Got it free and its still a waste of money. The steam version is crippled and is missing content. Crashes to desktop frequently and freezes at a black screen during cutscenes. My original retail DVD had none of these issues on my AMD64/Geforce 6200 build back around 2006. Mod support practically non existant with this version.I dont get why they removed songs from the game when they were licensed before. Copyright laws are stupid sometimes.Thankfully if I ever decide to go back to SA again I still have a retail DVD somewhere at home. Buy a second hand copy on eBay, dont waste your money on Steam version. I cannot attest to its compatibility with postXP Windows.
