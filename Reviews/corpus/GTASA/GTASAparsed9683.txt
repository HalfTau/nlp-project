Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a great sanbox game, and in my opinion the best GTA that I have played. It offers a huge amount of freedom and it has many weird missions to keep you entertained when you want to quit exploring. Now there is not much I can say about the game other than its a really fantastic game that still stands today and I bet you can get at least 30 hours on your first run of the game.You might ask if the game is worth the 9.99? Answer Hells to the f!ing yes!
