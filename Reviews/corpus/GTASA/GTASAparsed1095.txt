The Steam Version wich is this one. You cant mod it, makes the game worse there for Rrockstar patched the old way so people waste 15 on a crappy boring version thats the only leagle way to get it now. Its a good game just it would be better if you could mod it though. the only fun thing to mess around with are the cheat codes those get boring after like 2 minutes though and you have to get it through steam now i mean come on Rockstar you ruined the game for everyone.
