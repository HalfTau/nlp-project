Unlocking the desert and Las Venturas is the most magnificant moment in this game. Customizing your vehicle is also bizzare and intresting with all the features that are avaliable. Love the flames on the Slamvan, makes me feel like a badass.The ability to run the groove gang is a feature that is more annoying than fun due to members acting too stupid to even follow your orders.Oh yeah and it made me upset that they removed the song Hellraiser by Ozzy Ousbourne. Hands down my fravorite song from the game!
