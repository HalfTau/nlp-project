Although I really hate the new update, which mainly affected the gameplay with me, since I dont listen to the radio much, I still recommend this game because I still have so much fun playing it. It would have been nice if I had some ing warning, but Im not gonna say that a game is ing horrible because their developer made a mistake. They had to change the music if they wanted to continue to sell the game. They just made the mistake of updating the game for everyone else. Get the  over it. Ive played this game for 148 hours and ill play it for another 148 hours. And then Ill play it for another 148 hours. Its game changing, but not game breaking.
