Bored waiting for GTA V coming to PC? if it even will. Buy this. Best game in the series apart from V. IV is good as well, but apart from better graphics it just doesnt have the variety of landscapes, characters, and missions that this game does. Plus, the soundtrack is awesome and IVs sucked.100/10.
