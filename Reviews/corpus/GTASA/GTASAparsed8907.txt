This is a great game, one of my favorite GTAs actually mostly due to the fact that there are several different areas to the map instead of it all just being in one big city. It also has a decent selection of music from the 90s. I also enjoyed the branching story paths through the missions as well as some of the loose references to certain movies. The graphics have not aged well at all, but that should be expected from any game from this time period. Besides, it is still very vividly colorful and fun to look at even if the poly modles and textures are a bit low res.As much as I love the game though, I cannot recommend purchasing it for PC. I have not really experienced some of the bugginess people have complained about, but that could be due to the fact that I have played this port very little. The lack of controller support kills it for me. I am sure there are some people who may prefer mouse/keyboard, but for this type of game I am sure that most players would prefer the option of a controller without having to go through the hassle of downloading and setting up some 3rd party keymapper. Aside from the lack of controller support, the keymapping setup in game is very overwhelming with all the multiple pages of key commands to bind.Perhaps if you have the patience to toy around with this port for an hour or two you might get it set to your liking, but I would just recommend picking up a console version of this title to save yourself the hassle.
