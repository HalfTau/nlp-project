It does not work. My PC exceeds the recomended specs in every regard. I downloaded the game as a free add on for preordering GTA V for 59.99. Although this has been out for some time, it does not work. I searched the forums and set it to compatability for Windows XP. Now it comes on, but the mouse dont work.I returned to the forums, and several people have had the same problem. Someone has set up a mod to fix it on a third party site, but to open it and then figure out how and where to install the mod I have to purchase another program. This is GARBAGE. How do I get a REFUND? If Steam does not care to or is not able to make this game work which has been on the market for some time now, what confidence do I have that they will have GTA V working?HOW DO I GET A REFUND?? ?
