Ive had this game for PS2 since the release date in 07, and when I got my PS3 and found out that the games are no longer cross compatible, I was heartbroken.When I got this for PC, my favorite childhood game was now back in action for me.Definitely a classic, and a must have for anyone whos played and loved it on a platform console.
