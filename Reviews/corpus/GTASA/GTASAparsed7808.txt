Such a good game,The story is just awesome, the side missions and the gym and sports options make this game one of the best GTAs out there! The graphics arent something special but it doesnt matter its all about that climate that is created while playing, you get attached to CJ the main character and you actually respect Groove Street families and you hate all the folks that harm you, in a level that you just start a war in the whole city killing Them Ballas Fools.
