One of the games i played more in the PS2This is one of those games i can surely say i could play every single day non stop, i dont know what connection i have to this game, either way, its an amazing gameGoing through the Desert riding Freeway listening to some Kdst, or going to the several ghettos in Los Santos or just make a little stop in The Strip in Las VenturasThere is not a single reason why you shouldnt play this game, its fun, it has a great story, amazing gameplay, funny, and so interesting each corner has a new suprise for you, exploration is rewarded by landmarks, weapons, easter eggs and immersionAfter youre completly done with it, the mod community shall give you some more time in San Andreas killing zombies, or just crashing the game itselfA MustOwn10/10dat patch tho, just downgrade
