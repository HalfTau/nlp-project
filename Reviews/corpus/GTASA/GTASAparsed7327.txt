Its the grandady of GTA V.Honestly, if you like anything about the GTA franchise, then you like San andreas. Even today, only GTA V can beat it its gta v with a bit less charm.There are a few issues with it however Flying controls are unbearble, almost complelty uncrollable No autosave an manual save must be done in a safehouse, meaning if the game crashes, you are going to lose a lot of data, as you cant save frequently without massive hassel AI is laughable in parts New update broke mods, so modding isnt as easy anymore backup any files before atemtping, lest you want to reinstallAll in all, definatley worth picking up while waiting for GTA V and youll have some serious fun
