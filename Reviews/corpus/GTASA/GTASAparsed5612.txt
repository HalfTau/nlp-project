Last weekend, I played this game. Heard there was a big patch for the game a few months ago, so I decided to check it out finally. Big mistake. Like half the music is gone. Sure, I could put the tracks back in through the custom radio station, but that alongside other problems make me never want to buy a Rockstar PC game ever again. How can you takeout of something I bought?
