This is my childhood summarised with one video game. Every day, waking up to play this game during holidays and in my free time. This game was released 2004, I was 5 years old. Now, nearly 14 years later, as an adult, this game is still awsome. Rockstar made an absolute gem, top blokes!10/10Would go to Taco Bell again.
