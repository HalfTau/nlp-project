The best game in the series and make no mistake. Its big and varied in its gameworld, its fun, its crazy, it doesnt take itself particularily seriously fitting the gameplay and it basically works well from a technical standpoint, being a decent if still kinda porty port not plagued and bloated by t, DRMrelated or otherwise... with every single of these things being in stark contrast to its followup, GTA 4. If you like open world games with tons of fun content, this is one you have to try. Even if you have an older machine, its no problem. It should work on most computers.
