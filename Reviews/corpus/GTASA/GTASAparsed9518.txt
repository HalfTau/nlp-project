This is a great game where you play as Carl Johnson, a black man who steals bikes as soon as he gets into town. There are many fun things to do, such asStealing bikesKilling peopleGetting killed by white copsCommitting robberiesand much much more!This game will easily keep you seated for about 30 minutes until you get bored and play something thats more fun!I HIGHLY recommend it.
