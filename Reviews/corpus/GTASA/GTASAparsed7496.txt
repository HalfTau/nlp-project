Are you a lunatic? Would you like to be one?If youve answered yes to any of the above questions then GTA San Andreas might be right for you.This game is full of gangbanging, chola craziness, big black men ordering everything off the menu, freebird, compton, grove street. Not to mention skydiving, plane robbing, house burgling, faggio riding, liberty city visiting, heists, casinos, oysters, horseshoes, plantation farming you name it.Is this game right for you? Will you love it? In the words of the wise Big SmokeAll we had to do was follow the damn train  which of course is referring to the philosophical insight that we must all follow the damn train or we will become lost on the wrong side of the tracks.
