I cant play the game. It freezes after trying to leave cjs house where I saved. I literally got past the spray paint mission and saved. Now it wont work. A new game wont work either. Its unmodded. I verified game files. I reinstalled it. I uninstalled it. 0/10  YOU ROCKSTAR! You broke a perfectly good game.
