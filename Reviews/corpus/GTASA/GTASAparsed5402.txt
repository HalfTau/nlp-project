All you had to do was catch the damn train, CJ Big SmokeGrand Theft Auto San Andreas takes the formula of GTA 3 and VC and adds so much to it, that it feels like a brand new gameeven though it runs on the same engine. The game has aged very well for being 11 years old. However Rockstar has made the game quite bad by releasing a terrible patch that barley fixes things and removes some good songs. That said, if you dont care about the songs, mods, etc. you will enjoy what the game offers.
