this game, this game, first off, its so stereotypical that I cant play it, Im so not one of those people whos a racist, and definitely not a social justice warrior, but this game just pisses me off, everyone dresses like they just shopped at a shop for the fattest s on earth, and dont give a and the game is so bleak and depressing that it isnt fun...
