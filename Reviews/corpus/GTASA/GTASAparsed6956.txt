Why you should buy, play and love this game 1It has mechanics better than a lot of open world rpg games today 2 The story is great 3 Its too much fun and you have plenty to do outside the missions 3 You can customize ING EVERYTHING! Aside from the safehouses. But hey, this came out over ten years ago.Why you should dislike Rockstar 1BECAUSE THEY HAVENT MADE AN HD REMASTER OF THE GAME YET. Seriously. Remaster it, expand the map so Los Santos is the same size it is in GTAV along with the rest of the map, profit. 2 BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON THE INTRO WONT PLAY ON NEWER PLATFORMS!!! WHY?! THAT INTRO WAS HALF THE ING GAME!! !
