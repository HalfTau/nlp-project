The game itself has aged badly and the controller setting are a , Im 4.6 hours in and I still have control issues that I cant fix. Which is really strange, seeing as controls were fine on consoles but on PC you cant map the same button to two things. For example Triangle on PS2 has two uses, Enter Vehicle/mount ladder and alt attack and counter, while on PC you can only set it to EnterVehicle/MountLadder or Alt Attack/Counter. As we all know controllers have a lack of buttons and not being able to use the default controls we should have leads to have to not have access to certain buttons meaning for me, if I want to play while lying down I have to get up now and again for less important buttons, a minor issue? Yes but there are others such as the controller aim auto recentering making shooting from cars and bikes near impossible without lockon or mouse control.
