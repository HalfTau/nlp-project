Played this a million years ago and now have it on PC.  Still love the feels from this game and class it as one of the best games ever.Thumbs up if youre reading this in a million years POnly thing it needs is a snap look when driving.  Everything else is coolCould you imagine the hype if CJ gets a New map and missions?  I would pay for that!  Hope the Gods are listening....
