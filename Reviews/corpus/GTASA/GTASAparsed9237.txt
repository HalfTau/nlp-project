What is there to say about San Andreas that hasnt been said already? It took everything that made GTA III and Vice City great games and added in a ton of amazing new features and content. The result is what is widely considered to be the best game in the series.Pros Great story with memorable characters. CJ is one of the best GTA protagonists, Big Smoke is legendary, and the main villain is also voiced by Samuel Jackson. A gigantic map featuring 3 cities, a farmland, a desert, a mountain, and other exciting areas to explore. Radio stations featuring many realworld songs as well as some humorous ingame talk shows/commercials. Plus you can also make your own custom station with your own music. Lots of weapons/items to use, including aand even a jetpack. Lots of fun vehicles to ride including bikes, planes, jets, gokarts, and tons more. Adding to the above point, you can customize cars with features like more acceleration and paint jobs. Many safehouses for you to buy, so you can save your game in most places and store lots of vehicles. Tons of ways to customize CJ, ranging from haircuits and clothing to bodybuilding and stats like sex appeal. Countless amounts of side activities including car/bike/boat racing, horse betting, gang territories, gambling, burglaries, dating, dancing, gym activities, deliveries, and tons more. Very easy to mod and the modding community for this game is huge. Usually very cheap when on sale.Cons The Steam version had to remove a few songs due to licensing issues. The intro movie doesnt show just a black screen but still plays the sound for some reason.The cons are just small nitpicks that dont deter from the overall experience. If you have not played San Andreas before, play it now! It is easily one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.
