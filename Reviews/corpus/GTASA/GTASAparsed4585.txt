I was only nine years old. I loved Grand Theft Auto San Andreas so much, I had it for the original PS2. I pray to Rockstar every night before bed, thanking them for the games I have been given. Rockstar is love I say, Rockstar is life. My dad hears me and calls me a console peasant. I knew he was just jealous. I called him a PC master faget. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. Im crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. Its Gaben. I am so happy. He whispers in my ear, 70 Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. He grabs my wallet with his powerful bribing hands and puts me on my hands and knees. Im ready. I agreed with the Steam terms and conditions. He pilfered my wallet hole. It hurt so much, but I do it for 70 Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. I can feel my wallet emptying as my eyes start to water. I want to please Gaben. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my inventory with his coupons. My dad walks in. Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says, It was worth the weight. Gaben rolls through my window. Gaben is love, Gaben is life.
