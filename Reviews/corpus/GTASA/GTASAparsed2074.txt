2006. The summer of 2006. My family got a new desktop PC so I was finally able to play new games like FIFA 2006 and ofc San Andreas. But for some reason Ive never finished the game. Reached Las Venturas but never knew whats the ending of the whole story. Well I finally finished the game and know how the story ends.But I dont think I should write anything long about San Andreas. Everyone knows this is one of the best GTA game if not the best.One thing tho downgrade the game and use the visual mods. The game will look 100x better better textures, draw distance, proper widescreen support, borderless windowed mode with Steam overlay etc.. And no crashes or glitches!tfw Catalina is not your gf
