probably best game i have ever played..... and thats alot coming from me! if you are a complete dummy...story Cj returns home after 5 years on the east coast in finds the hood that he used to live in grove street ransacked by drug dealers and gang bangers so Cj takes up responsibility for cleaning it up and restoring grove street to what it was when before he had left.this game is so much fun way ahead of its time for 2004 the game is a sandbox which means you can do whatever you want when you want!even when you have conpleted the game there is still sooo much to keep you occupied since there are TONS on cheats to useoverall 10/10 BUY IT RIGHT NOW
