First thing I would like to say, excuse my lack of playtime. Ive played it lots back in the day so..Gameplay The gameplay is very fun and you can almost always find something to do, you could go to clubs, shoot up the streets, go parachuting, drive around, fly around in a ing JETPACK or do the obvious and spawn in a tank.Story The story is beautifully made and there are a lot of missions to go through so youll always be playing a mission. CJs character is very well made and his stories with the people around him make it better.In my experience there has been bugs specifically for PC, sometimes the mouse just doesnt work while in GTA and I cant move the camera at all, which really annoyed me and probably stopped me from playing the game a lot more.Oh and dont forget all the mods you can download!9/10Arguably one of the greatest Grand Theft Auto games made.
