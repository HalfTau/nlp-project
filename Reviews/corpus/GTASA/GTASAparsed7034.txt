Lets get this out of the way the current, non altered state that the game is in is entirely unacceptable. Rockstars decission with the latest patch is very much a slap in the face as well as running contrary to what they did when Vice City found itself in a similar situation expiring music licenses. It is inexcusable and needs to be fixed.That being said, the game in its present state is likely unplayable for a myriad of reason. The recent update is effectivly forcing you to use the same HD version they was released for mobile devices, which gives you texture issues and problems with 1080p resolutions not to mention broken controller and mouse support.To actually play this game, you are now forced to downgrade it to a previous version.The game itself, all current issue aside, is still a classic GTA game for a reason. And if you can get a nonSteam version or just simply downgrade this one, it is worth your time to play. However, I will not recommend buying this game until Rockstar either fixes the things they broke with the latest patch or issues an apology for how this was handled. If this is how they treat an older game, whats to stop them from doing the same with GTA IV or V?EDIT I feel I should clarify, in case someone sees my playtime and calls it into question. I have owned this game on the PS2 for many, many years and have sunk many hours into that version. So yes, I am experienced with this game, but have only recently gotten it for the PC for various reasons mostly my being lazy and it having been gifted to me by a friend who got it from preordering GTAV.
