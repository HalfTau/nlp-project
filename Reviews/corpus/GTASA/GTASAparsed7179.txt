This game is in my opinion one of the best grand theft autos out there today, but dont quote me on that. It puts you in a detroitlike area at the start. Then you go to hillbilly lands and then to the larger type of city. As for the gameplay it can be simple yet fun. In this grand theft auto you can get the army on you nonetheless there are still tanks. The only bad side of the game is it has no multiplayer. Thats my review of the game.FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN CJ!
