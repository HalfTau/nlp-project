Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was a game changer. Although if you play this on Windows 8 or above, you will have to play it with a controller, the game is still addicting. It had amazing graphics at the time and a huge map. Theres no doubt in my mind that you can do a lot in the game, and theres still a lot of missions. So unless you hate violence and felonies, this game is definately recomenedfjdg for you.
