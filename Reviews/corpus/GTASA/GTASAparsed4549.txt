Never could figure out what people like about this game  despite being a fan of every other game in the series. Ive tried it on PC, PS2 and Xbox and quit after only a couple missions every time. Somehow, it shows its age worse than Vice City.And please, dont get me started on the terrible bicycleriding mechanic
