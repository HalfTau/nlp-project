A truly terrific game, probably the most significant Grand Theft Auto of the whole series. This game is, without doubt, one of the best products the gaming industry has produced in this century, and it will guarantee you several hours of fun by discovering how its great storyline unveils or by provoking total unrest in the state of San Andreas with all the weapons and cheats if you wish to use them GTASA has at your disposition.This masterpiece never gets old, and you will never be too late to experience the GTASA experience. Judging everything this game can offer, from its emblematic missions to the ability to destroy everything which gets on your path, I cant do anything but recommend this game.
