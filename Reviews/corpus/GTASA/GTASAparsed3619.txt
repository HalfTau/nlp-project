When people think old school, tetris may come to mind, well. For many people Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a strong choice.The land of drugdealers and gangbangers will see the straight busta CJ, come back to Los Santos. Become rich and kill some fools.If you want nostalgia and a real good blast of a game that at 10 oclock makes you think, oh no where did my afternoon go, I recommend GTASA
