I actually dont write any reviews and especially not bad ones, but this move of Rockstar touched one of my most loved games.I would seriously recommend this game to you, but after the latest update Yeah ... an update after almost 10 years they justit up ...So basically they updated al lot of stuff in the last patch. In my opinion they just removed a ton of stuff like almost 10 of the orignal music, your previous savegames even no luck if you have a backup, It keeps starting a new game, 1080p support and the list goes on...Lucky for me I still got an old CD copy of the game from back in the days with the first version on it. If you are thinking of buying this game... get a used one from eBay or at a used game store, only then its stil worth for your money.
