Love this Game. I already played this on ps2 but got it on pc just because of how much fun it is. I finally played the whole story and was shocked that the ending wast spoiled for me all these years. The moding as well makes this game worth playing for hours. Even to this day, people buy and even torrent this game for what it offers. When gta v comes out, I hope that modding would have all the imagination from san andreas mods to that game. This open world game proves that even if its old, doesnt mean it isnt fun.Edit Due to the Recent Patch, I cant ever feel the same nostalgia as I did. I recommend getting this game by another means than steam. If theres an update that fixes this then I would change it but for now, this is not the same game that I felt.
