GTA SA is one of the best games I have ever played. However, since I love it so much I have created an idol out of it in my life. As a Christian, I am not allowed to play it as I asked myself, would Christ play this game with me? So, I put to death that which I love and deny myself since Christ, when he came down to earth, denied himself to do the will of The Father and died for our sins. I challenge my brothers and sisters in Christ to do the same and follow Christ, our forerunner and saviour. Be strong and deny yourself to do His will and not ours.I know its tough but, when you realize what Christ has done for us and remove yourself deny oneself from the throne of your life and allow Christ to sit there. Only then can we truly serve Him.God bless and Godspeed.
