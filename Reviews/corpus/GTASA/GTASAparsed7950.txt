Other than the audio needs a forced compression click your sound cards Loudness Equalization button, this is a solid game on all fronts, but maybe... too big? Like, starting you out on a bikeno weaponsfor a long first mission of getting chased by Drow Ballers with pistols and uzis is a good way of setting the ghettofab, destitute feeling of the early part of the game. However,  such an ambitious strain on not only skill, but attention span, so early on in the game, makes it seem needlessly pretentious. Overall the game tends to suffer from that sort of overly ambitious and too sharpley anylized approach, typical of a particular sort of hamhanded game design common to the big franchise games for the PS2 in that era. 3/5 stars
