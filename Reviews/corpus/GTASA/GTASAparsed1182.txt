Its goodIts worth the price , im highly recommending to buy this game . Because of the storyline,map,vehicle,and other great stuff , BUT there is some hard missions like og loc,cesar vialpando,learning to flywrong side of track,back to school,etc . Now  if you want to complete the HARD mission you got to have a great SKILL seriously , so yeah this game.... i think is for some Veteran GTA players because of the HARD missions , and i did not finish the game till now ive played like 56 hours like.... that is more than 5 days , of course my SKILL is a..... yup you know it im not a Veteran GTA players i just want to have fun and screw around in this game , but yeah if you cant finish the missions then you just gotta screw around , oh i forgot guys there is some annoying dancing and cars hydraulic missions like seriously annoying now this is the mission called cesar vialpando im gonna show you a tips for the hydraulic , its not using arrow its usses 8 for the front  4 for the left 6 for the right and 2 for the down , now this is really IMPORTANT and if you did not read this hydraulic tips you gonna FAIL the mission so yeah this really IMPORTANT  if the arrow in the game said up its down and if its down its up and so do the vertical one ,now if you heard of the meme called Big Smoke  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO WAS TO FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN CJ!! that is the one that i comlete with cheat the mission called the wrong side of the track its seriously hard its not because your SKILL its because Big Smoke yup BS.... and you did not know why.... its because his aim and hes blaiming you , now for tips is you just got to stay in front of the train and i ahve to us jetpack . now if you open Las Venturas you gotta know the mission called learning to fly it took skill . But yeah that is my criticsm thanks if you read the tips and all the thisng i write....
