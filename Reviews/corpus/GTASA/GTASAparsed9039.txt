Better than 3, Vice City, and 4. Despite its age, San Andreas is an absolute blast to play. The amount of vehicles and side activites is astonishing, the world is carefully crafted, the gun place is nice and tight, and Samuel L Jackson is the motherfing villian.This still holds up, and is certainly a landmark of sandbox gaming.
