The game has always been a masterpiece since the Playstation 2 era. The tone, story, openworld exploration, and fun activities to do in the cities of Los Santos, Las Venturas, and San Fierro are creating memorable moments for gamers, making the atmosphere inside the game is alive instead of repetitive and lifeless citites for most open world games. Unfortunately, there are some minor problems for the PC version of San Andreas like this, e.g. screen tearing when you turn the frame limiter off to get a 60 fps performance and I often find the game stopped working for every 1520 minutes. But overall thye game is very incredible with the setting, unique characters, and most of all, the story. San Andreas is still, after all this time, the best Grand Theft Auto from all the series.
