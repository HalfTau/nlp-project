i will recommend this game because it is very fun and at times so funny that i cry. But it has a major down side.. There have been missions like this in the other GTA games like for example GTA VC that you need to control toy air planes and kill people with that are almost impossible to complete. The flying in the game is horrible ON PC. It is almost impossible to control. i did those missions a few times in the past years i was playing this game, and i only managed to pull those missions off a few times with a pc controller. So looking back... It is a very fun game that takes many hours to beat.. But also has a huge down side that just makes the game pretty much unplayable at a few points in the game towards the end.
