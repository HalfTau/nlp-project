OS X version turns out to be a wine wrapper with annoying bugs and pretty bad crashes, managed to lock up my mac twice now.If you want to use an external display while gaming, press cmd  return to enable windowed mode, otherwise your second monitor will be disabled. Open steam overlay to regain control over your mouse outside the window.Also starts with mouse controls inverted for whatever reason.My advice pirate it and build a less crappy wrapper yourself.
