i like playing GTA games but this just bad first the control does not work sometime espacially on the camera movement making it hard to turn or shoot.Secondly the physics in this sucks.For example i pickup a crate i was glitch in and out of the wall somehow and died.Then for the cars it shake for no reason.Police literally died in a U shape when in water.Swimming in water look like going around 3km/h even with freestyle and in some cases i swim on land when i am beside the river.Plus the collision detection is very bad why becauase the car hit the lightpost even when there is like a space there and once hit the car spin around making me lose the race sometime.There are many more bugs i haven said it yet cause too many to type in but what i hope is rockstar fix at least the controls and car physics.I did not bought this game i got it when i preorder GTA V.But those who planning to get it dont buy it
