Just got this as an extra for preordering GTA V and It is entirely unplayable. It wont allow me to use my mouse at all no matter what I do. Ive looked all over for information to fix it and everything I found seems to no longer work. Also after reading what everyone else has said about the latest patch removing content I cant even bring myself to want to play this. Avoid it like the plague that Rockstar turned it into. Im also seriously debating requesting a refund for my preorder for GTA V. Rockstar seems like they are intent on screwing over the PC fanbase and if they keep doing so they wont have a PC fanbase to rely on. They have probably also lost my support consolewise as well. If you are going to alienate me one way well you just alienated me entirely.
