This game is a great, nostalgic change of pace from the modern day GTA5, hyper realistic video games. This is simple, capturing life in California the best they could at the time. The characters are easy to understand and theres plenty to do here. I played the game when it first came out for the PS2, and the controls do take some getting used to on PC. Love this game, do wish it had controller support though.
