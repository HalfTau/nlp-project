Two bad things are the default 25 FPS cap with frame limiter on and the fact that a considerable number of songs are missing from the radio due to licensing issues.Fortunately, you can increase the FPS cap by turning the limiter off and setting your own cap through something like Nvidia Inspector  and the music can be handled through Custom Radio or downgrade mods which return the radio to its original state so you can enjoy Hellraiser and Killing in The Name on Radio X of course, as well as all the other missing songs.It is also, reportedly, a little unstable. I myself encountered only 2 crashes throughout my playthrough but some people have reported many more! Not sure why. YMMV.Otherwise and unless Ive forgotten something, its the same great game as it was on the PS2 P.S You dontto worry about all the FPS stuff, you could just turn the FL off, though you run the risk of physics issues.
