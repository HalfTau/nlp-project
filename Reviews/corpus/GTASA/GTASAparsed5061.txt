For its time, this game is very impressive  it run great on my currently rubbish PC Intel Pentinum, Intel Graphics, 6GB RAM, Intel Standard Cooling and it runs PERFECTLY. So if i can run it on max setting on a rubbish computer, then you can do so much better. Buy this game, Its almost as good as Grand Theft Auto V.RATES  9.5/10
