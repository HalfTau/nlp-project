, ,  port. Nevermind that I cant play it at my native resolution, but holy god damn, the CONTROLS. Im using a vanilla logitech controller that literally has a nearly mirrored control scheme to the PS2 controller, but I cant configure these controls right. It doesnt even register the Dpad buttons. The default controls are ridiculous. You cant control the camera with your controller, bunny hopping is done with SELECT, and you cant PAUSE.Dont waste your money on this unless you plan to mod it like crazy to try and get it into a playable state with some HD packs thrown in. Get an emulator and play it on that. At least you can actually configure your controls on an emulator.
