Im not even close to completing this game but there is so much nostalgia playing this game on the PS2 and being able to play it again looking the same as it looked back in 2005. I know they they brought out a patch removing songs, mods, cant play on maxed out settings etc. but I still love the game and would recommend this game to anyone who is thinking of picking this upMy Rating 9.6/10
