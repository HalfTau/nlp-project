I recommend it even after the update.This game has some issues but in my case I managed to fix them.One issue was the mouse steering and flying disabled really easily through menusAnother issue was that when the frame limiter was off the game was unplayable due to the cars breaking when the accelerator was released.The frme limiter does something like 25 FPS which is unacceptable on a pc game where youre right on the screen.What fixed it was setting the limiter off and setting the Vsync on for this program on the nvidia panel. runs smoothly and without problems.Another issue was that for a mission the hydralic controls where reversed making the beat game a little difficult.Now for the good.The game world is huge and fun to drive around in.Having not played the song before the radios dont seem to be severely nerfed.The 1080p resolution is there  I was scared that it wouldnt be but I guess it got fixedSince I havent finished the game yet 40 hr into it I dont know the full story but up to now its been a fun ride, plenty of interesting characters and a lot of fun.This game seems to have a huge scope. It takes a little time to get used to it.
