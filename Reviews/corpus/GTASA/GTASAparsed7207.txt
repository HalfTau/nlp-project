DONT BUY THIS game.Everyone said dont buy it.At first i was like omg this ppl are so mean , i dont care about he music i just whant to play the game.Well,,,, u cant.Guess what all this ppl are right !First of all the mouse do not work 9 time of 10.Only way to fix it is to push Escape 15 time so the mouse finalley showNo 3rd person view in car.So mouse totally useless in car.Hotkey totally screw up,I speend like 1 hrs try to have decent control and it still so mess up !No auto aim so IMPOSSIBLE to progress in game since u gonna die evey time there is 3 ppl or more.I paid 60 for the PS2 version its 100 worth it one of the best game ever.I paid 6 for the PC version, its a total peace ofi whould never recommend this game event if it was free to play !Do yourself a favor, trust me and ALL the other comment.The PC version is a totall faild.
