Nothing will ever beat those halcyon days of coming home from school, firing up the crystal Xbox and attempting to stunt fly a Hydra usually badly, do drive bys or perform the biggest jumps possible.No other GTA game has ever made me want to replay it as many times as SA has. For some reason I cant put my finger on, it stands as the best of the series. It has the best missions, the best soundtrack, and the best sandbox world. It is packed full of content that is enjoyable and functional, and at no point does it feel like content has been shoehorned in to add gameplay time.For some reason Rockstar doesnt maintain their old releases on Steam well, and it shows here. Unexplained crashes, good old blackscreens and simply failing to load all rear their head. There are also a number of music tracks missing Although I suspect this might be due to licensing issues. It doesnt detract too much, just make sure to save often.I cant think of any old game that I would recommend anyone to play if they havent already. You wont be disappointed, even if the only thing you can remember from the game is Big Smokes Cluckin Bell Order. Ill have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.
