This is the best GTA game in my eyes. It offers 3 different cities and a huge outland map. The soundtrack is awesome, the characters are really well written and the story is great. The only problem this game has, are the controlls for planes and stuff like that. If you do the missions with those, you chould have a gamepad, or you might just want to kill yourself, because these things are nearly uncontrollable without.
