This is a legendary game. Belongs to the game allstar.GTA San Andreas is a game worth buying. It has the world that cant compete with that of GTA Vs in size, that is, but there are 3 separate cities which are pretty big, with different people, with different gangs, with different, unwritten rules.The soundtrack is great, because you might find a radio channel with the genre of your liking.I have heard of the patch that removed a piece of the original soundtrack. It also made all prepatch saves obsolete. Just because a wild patch appeared it doesnt mean that this game is suddenly crap. But the save ruining is pretty serious for those pretty far in the game. Also it completely removed 1080p support for no reason at all. Personally, this patch doesnt make me angry, not even a bit. Hell, I think the 1080p removal even fits the game, because I think there were no 1080p monitors in every household back in 2005.Despite the patch, this game is a 7/10.Openworld, no worries with the timeSoundtrack varietyCar customization, didnt happen in later GTAs until GTA V3 cities gives the player a better choice to live inModifiableThe patch added controller support for PCThe patch ruined prepatch saves, hopefully another patch is released to patch the patch that broke prepatch saves ay man, I heard you like patches...At the start, you have to be in Los Santos, no possibility to go to San Fierro or Las Venturas before progressingThe patch also broke all mod supportThe patch removed 1080p support
