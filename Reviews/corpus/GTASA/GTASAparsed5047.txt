I really enjoy this game, Ive spent about 15 hours when my WiFi was down. And I keep on playing this game. I definitley recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a good time, and enjoy the original Los Santos, and all of the other cities in the game. I love how you can really customise your character, CJ / Carl Johnson for those of you who dont know. by either working out, lifting weights, eating a lot of food, etc. as well as the fact that you can run gangs, and just have a refreshing experience from the newer Grand Theft Auto games. I cant wait to  see what else this game has in store, I havent even gotten close to beating it yet!
