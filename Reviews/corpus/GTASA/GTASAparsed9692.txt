I played all GTA from III to EFLC and Im sure that San Andreas is the best part of this series and one of the best games ever. Graphic isnt good. Optimalization doesnt work very well but atmosphere, world, characters and many other things makes this game doesnt allow to go away from itself. World is very very big, there are dozens of villages, 3 very big cities, forests, mountains, deserts and canyon. Player can do many things for example swimming, upgrading cars, steal, going to gym and learn new martial arts. We can develop main character called CJ, change his clothes, hairdo and and join into gang wars.This game offers a lot of fun. Every solid player should have this one of the best video game ever.
