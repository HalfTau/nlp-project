So yeah, this Steam version is really bad. I cant mod the damn game, so I cant play SAMP if i wanted to because its not supported due to this stupid mandatory update. 18 songs have been removed, most of the resolution support is gone, and save files are deleted. Whats funny is that they finally decided to update the game after 10 YEARS! I have an old CD copy of the game and guess what? Has everything they took away from us. I got my money back and Im just using my old copy of the game in which is still in perfect condition. Dont buy this game on Steam, either find a copy on Ebay, or pirate the damn thing because this version is not worth it.
