Novermber 7th EDIT A forced idiotic update deleted 18 really great songs that belonged to the game like beer belongs in my hand. Youre better off pirating it.Original Everyone I know had played this, even girls!!! I think this 2004s masterpiece still offers the longest and the best story in gaming. Huge city and lots of fun stuff to do while you have complete freedom, finished it like a milion times. I finished GTA4 only once, just sayin I rate it with the full amount, oh the memories. 10/10
