Reviewing my review. Decided to play some San Andreas the other day and was surprised to find my game broken. Wont even bother restarting.Normally, Id never condone stealing, but anyone that wants to play this game, PIRATE THE  OUT OF IT. Torrent the preupdate game and we can all abandon the Steam version. Send Rockstar a message that we will NOT accept them taking OUR game from us. This was the best GTA game once. Way to go, Rockstar.
