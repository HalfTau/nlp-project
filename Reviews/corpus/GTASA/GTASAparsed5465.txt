Better to install the HOODLUM version than this.For my the camera is buggyDidnt check if sounds are removedDidnt check if any textures are gone.On first mission, the police car was lagging like hell.Still this game will be the best and It will be once more again if they fix it.I play Multi Theft Auto by the way, making films custom storylines.I want to do 5000 hours on GTASA Thats my point, no matter what.
