One of the games that I spent hundreds of hours with  either in the single and multiplayer.I cant leave here a negative note,despite the Steam version being a crap. When I downloaded the game it turned out its castrated comparing to the box version,because of outdated licenses and I had a lot of technical problems on Windows 10.Fortunately there is still a big community around the game working on it.The solutions found on the Internet can make it back working like in 2005,with the same radio sations and same amout of fun,just with a more nostalgy  .
