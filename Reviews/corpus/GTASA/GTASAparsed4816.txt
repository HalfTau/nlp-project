The game is really awesome, the story is, I cant even find words to be close to how good it is, the graphics are really decent, its no GTA V but its one of the best GTA games, if not THE best one jetpacks. I dont mind Rockstar removing songs since I hear its from their license that expired for some songs but I liked to feel like a real ngga while listening to Radio LS. The mouse has some problems sometimes, but its playable.10/10 would follow trains again, because it seems that thats what real gangstas did in 92. Oh, and I passed Wrong side of the tracks on the first try and Zeros missions are NOT THAT HARD! THUG LIFE!! !
