ProsConsAll those stuff in a 2004 game, what a MASTERPIECE.This game has a WTF vibe, that makes it Awesome and Comic. You see the Protagonist literary rising from theand going to the top of the world, but back off to help his hood.I dont know if its the best game of this franchise, certally my prefered though.SCORE 10/10
