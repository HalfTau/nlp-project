When you want to strip back all the pretty graphics and BS multiplayer headaches that plague modern videogames, theres nothing quite like turning back the clock and cracking out San Andreas. Best GTA title in my opinion. Strong, storydriven and engaging. Sure it has its little bugs and sure it doesnt look as polished and refined as modern art masterpieces, but when it comes down to it, SA will always have a place in my heart 3
