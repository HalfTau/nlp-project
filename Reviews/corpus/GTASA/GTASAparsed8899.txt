This is by far one of my favourite games of all time and is a very enjoyable expierence. The first time I played it was on the Playstation and was again very enjoyable but when I played it on PC it was a very different game the controls where so different and the audio was a bit laggy and had a few glithes but overall still a brilliant game very worth the money.
