Culturally appropriate to the lifestyle potrayed in the game. Its an older game so graphics dont come to mind, but the mindset behind the plot and personality this game has is ahead of its time. This set the boundaries for all games taking place in a crime, poverty riddled city area for the next decade. Fun game covered in an undeniably hilarious sense of personality and humor. Definetly worth the price and time of day
