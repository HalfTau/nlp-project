Best game ever!Best GTA,Rockstar cant make any better GTA than this!The story is awsome,you camt be bored while playing this game!The whole thing that you are a gangster against the other gangsters and the corrupt cops is perfect!I play the game since 2005,and I love it! I was a little kid when I started to play this 56 years old,butI played the other GTAs before I started to play them when I was 3 years old,they were good as well,but not as good as San Andreas!I really hate GTA IV, becouse I really dont like it!GTA V is a really good GTA,because it is about San Andreas,but San Andreas is still better for me!I really recommend it,I also recommend to use some mods if you want!I play it now too but not the Steam version,becouse of the update what is a downdate,becouse they tried to make itbad! Thats why I like the boxed version,but I have the PS2 version too,so this is not a big problem!GROVESTR4LIFE
