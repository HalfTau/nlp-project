Before I start prasing this game like an African Christian Choir praising Jesus, I have to say something very important.Theversion of this game isnt the same as the normal ones you can buy else where, its a hybird of PC and the moble version, because of this many mods do not work properly, and you require to downgrade your game, search online on how to do just that, I would give links myself, but steam might have a fit at me for doing so.Anyhow...San Andreas for me is the greatest GTA game to ever exist, yes its an old game, yes the graphics are dated, yes the physics are pretty bad like the lack of Ragdolls, but the game is more then just a game, its a whole experience that needs to be played by any GTA fan.Some of the best characters in the whole franchise are in this game, from the Meme King Big Smoke, to Ryder, to Sweet, to Officer Tenpenny, to Madd Dogg and easily to my favourite GTA and one of my favoruite gaming protagonists, mothering Carl Johnson.Seriously this game is full of memorable characters, even the most minor ones like Carls girlfriends will stick into your head due to their memorable lines, and for... other reasons involving coffee.Introduced some of the best mechanics in the whole franchise, which some were sadly lost in GTA IV, but returned in GTA V, these include Modding Cars, Haircuts, detailed character customization and eating food to regain health.However exclusive to San Andreas is Carls Muscle and Fat meters which make him change appearence depending on which one is the highest, and it even includes some exclusve voicelines! Seriously play as Fat CJ and try not to laugh, its impossible!There is also weapon skills which improve how you perform with certain weapons, the biggest ones is with some SMGs, the normal pistol and the Sawnoff Shotgun, where if you increase their levels enough, YOU CAN DUALWIELD THEM! HOW COOL IS THAT? It makes you feel like a total badass and you become so much more powerful.A fantastic story which I wont spoil, the reasoning of CJ returning to San Andreas abroad is really sad and you want to help him succeed.One of the best cities in gaming, it squishes Vice City when it comes to detail, it crunchs Liberty City when it comes to sheer size, and it even beats HD Los Santos in GTA V due to having more things to do inside the city, I mean yea HD Los Santos is bigger, but the varation of land scapes is very lacking since theres only pretty much Beach, city and then desert for 90 of the map, while San Andreas includes all 3 of them, but also has forests, mountain ranges, casino areas and just much much more, hell you can even learn whole new fighting styles like Karate!Honestly this map has been fantastic to play on since day 1 and I can still play on it for years to come.Like I said the steam version isnt the same as a retail one, so use a downgrader to use mods.Speaking of the steam version, its locked at 25 FPS, exceeding that will brake the game sadly, however the older versions didnt have this issue.Also some songs have been removed due to expired contracts, however they remain in the older versions.Some missions can cause newer players trouble, like the infamous Train mission and RC missions... which I had no issue on both myself when I started but hey to each their own.Best GTA overall, it stands against the test of time with pride and is easily an unforgetable experience that everyone needs to try.So good infact, San Andreas still gets about 1 Million players to this day.
