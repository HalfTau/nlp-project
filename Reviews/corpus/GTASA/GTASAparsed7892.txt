Ive always stayed away from the 3D generation of Grand Theft AutoGTA III, GTA VC, and GTA SA for PC because you could only use the keyboard controls which are horrid. However because of the community on Steam I found an easy way to be able to use my Xbox 360 controller. Because of that, the game works perfectly now. As for the game itself this has always been my all time favorite GTA title, wayyyy better than GTA V. This was the height of the series. The amount of stuff you can do in this game is mind boggling with so much gameplay that is diverse and different. The story is very good as well, following the journey of Carl Johnson as he avenges his family and works to take control of the streets across three sprawling cities and vast wilderness between them. Highly recommended as well as the controller modification that I mentioned earlier.
