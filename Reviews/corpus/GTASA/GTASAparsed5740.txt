I love this game so much. Ive spent more time playing this than i have gta 5. I love the 3 cities idea and they still were able tohave a country area of the map. Even though the map is smaller than gta5 it feels like its bigger. This is a straight game for thugs 9/10. I gave the game a nine out of ten because theres one thing i wish there was and thats more npcs and cars i feel like i keep on seeing the same npcs. Ahh it doesnt matter still a great retro game.
