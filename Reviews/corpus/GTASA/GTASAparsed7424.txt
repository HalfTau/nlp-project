Since Rockstar simply has removed a lot of content and stopped fixing this game its completely clear that this game is abandoned and that we who own the game are left with the computer version of Pripyat, Chernobyl and a 9,99 euro big hole in our wallets, this game is abandoned by rockstar wich is a shame and is full of crashes and removed content, until rockstar has fixed the problems wich I dont think they will do do not buy this game.
