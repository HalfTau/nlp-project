BUY IT! Thats pretty much all to say, BUY IT! This is one of my favourite Grand Theft Autos next to 5. There is humour, the charecters are VERY likable, and I STILL havent beat the game! For 15 dollars, this game will last you weeks, and itll keep you entertained the whole way through it. 10/10 if i were to rate it.
