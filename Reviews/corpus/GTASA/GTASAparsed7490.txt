Bought a sportscar. Some time later the car dealer broke into my garage, stole it and replaced it by a wreck.Such a thing cannot happen?Well, it is exactly what Rockstar and Steam did with this game, with their patch from November 2014 they totally ruined my experience with this game full HD resolution1920 x 1080 was removed edit this was fixed meanwhile somehow parts of the gfx must have been removed, overally it looks much more dull now mouse/eyboard controls are totally messed up edit with a little work, the original controls can be restored parts of the soundtrack were removed, many songs are just gone nowI will not buy any game from Rockstar anymore, including GTA V, until this has been fixed.I will think twice before buying any game from Steam again, as long games I buy here can be reduced into an unplayable mess later!
