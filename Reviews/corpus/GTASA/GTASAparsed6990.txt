I bought GTA 5 and got this free as a bonus. I played it once and now it wont start again. Im reading on the rockstar site that its happening to lots of people and they are  working on a solution but those posts were last year. Steam wont do anything so I guess im screwed. Dont get screwed , dont buy this on steam.
