one of the greatest games of all time.besides Halo 2, when i was coming home from school this was the game i was playing when i told my teacher my dog ate my homework... i just threw it away..but this game brought so much fun and i never got bored, its so great to relive it again on steam. sure there is now GTA5 or IV but Cmon this is a classic!
