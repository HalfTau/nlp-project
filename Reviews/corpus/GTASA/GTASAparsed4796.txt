This game is great fun, and of course a classic that cant be put down, but there a few things worth going overThe flying missions are absolutely one of the most painful experiences ive had with any missions in any game.If youve come from GTA V this game is very different controlswise and is much more unpolished.A few bad controls, as it is a game made for console, so the pc port controls can be difficult flying.Those are the only bad points of this game. It is a highly fun, well developed and epic game. I could list so many good things about it but Id be writing a essay. This game is the best of its era.
