Oh My God. I played this game for the first time almost 11 years ago. This was one of the best games of its time. I purchased this recently and I can say this is still one of the best games created by Rockstar. A trip down the memory lane, feeling highly nostalgic while playing this. To be honest, this one is better than GTA 4, hands down.Although there are some issues like Sometimes mouse/pointer freezes. I tried modding, game didnt register mouse at all..I cant do anything. Sometimes audio lags.BUT, these are bound to happen as the software was made for Win XP and NOT Windows 10, so there will be some compatibility issues. Rockstar should launch a remastered version for win 10.That time they scripted the game such that CJ can roam portland area in Liberty City but couldnt implement in the game because of limited size of the PS2 DVD. They can include that in the remastered version, just saying.
