This game is a definite must have I loved Gta 3 and Vice City but this is taking the GTA series on a whole new level honestly one of the best GTA games I have played. It has things such as respect weapons skills stamina muscle fat strength and sex appeal each one alters gameplay like whenever you get your weapon skill to a high level you can dual wield SMGs and have better accuracy with weapons and things of that sort. It has a great open world and a great story line but if that is not enough for you to buy it right now then also cheats are back but with new and more fun there are also mods from other websites so if youre feeling like just messing around and having a good time then you should for sure get GTA San Andreas I would rate it at 10/10
