If youre considering buying this game, please read this first paragraph firstThis game is great,but before you think about buying it,get it on rockstar games website,ive spent atleast a few days playing this game but it says ive only played for an hour because long story short,i had to do ALOT of modding to make this game the way i wanted it and that includes renaming and taking the gta san andreas file out of steamapps.tldr itll be way easier to mod off the bat and it wont be crashing as much if you get it off of rockstar games website,trust me.Now,onto my review.If you dont have time to read,go down to pros and cons and tldr for the gameIdk where to start,the gameplay is fun,the story is good,not the best ever but a good story,there is alot of activites and things you can do in the game. The map is large and has alot of places to explore. You can work out, gain fat and lose it and gain muscle and lose it aswell, recruit gang members and go do some drive bys.This game is a great game for modding, but i will say modding is never easy when it comes to installing the ones like superhero mods and stuff like that. The mods you can get come in a HUGE variety from superhero mods,anime mods like dbz mods to little mods like changing textures,showing up food in cjs hand when he eats,and alot more. My only complaint is one of my fav mods is in russian and is a HUGE pain to try and make it to english.tldrThe base game itself is alot of fun and with mods it becomes alot better,i would recommend. I also recommend using a controller unless your really good on pc controls.Pros and consProsGreat story and gameplay.Lots of things to do and explore,large map.Cheap,affordable priceYou dont need a titan of a computer to run the gameOverall worth my time and i would totally reccomendAlso,great modsConsNo multiplayer BUT this can be achieved with modsDespite me saying it had an affordable cheap price for such a good game,i think 15 is a tad bit much but if you see this game on sale, GET IT.Graphics not too amazing but can get 10x better with mods and just downgradingOverall,id say this is a MUST have for any fan of gta series and is just a really great game with a great storyline, and lots of things to do.10/10
