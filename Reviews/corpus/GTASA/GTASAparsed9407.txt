This is a game that gave you one of the biggest maps of its time and said, go crazy. Whatever you want to do, its waiting for you out there. The whole game is based around a foolproof gaming formula called fun. Many games miss the point of being fun while instead trying to push the current generation of hardware to its limits. The simplicity and badassery this game has is unrivaled Saints Row The Third comes close, but lacks both the atmosphere and a true feeling of freedom. Once you tack on some mods to this including ones that allow mutliplayer, you have a winner. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a LEGENDARY game for its time and even to this day. Many future games will try to capture the same feel of it but in the end, nothing will ever top San Andreas, the true sandbox game. 100/100
