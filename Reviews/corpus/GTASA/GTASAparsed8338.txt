San Andreas is by far my favorite GTA map. Playing it straight through without cheats is very fun, playing it WTIH cheats is very fun, messing around killing people WITH cheats is very VERY fun.Some people may be turned off by the graphics and Id understand that, but its all about the gameplay.Theres a free mod you can get to play online, Multi Theft Auto, and I highly recommend it.Samuel L. Jackson is also in this.
