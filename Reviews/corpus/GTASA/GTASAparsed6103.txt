GTA San Andreas, is one of my favorite games of all time. I really think together rockstar and whoever else, really made this game the best out of previous GTA games. There is so much you can do in it! I mean literally, you want to take a swim? Go to the beach, you want to fly, go to the airport. I mean everything is there and I am just completely impressed with the game altogether. Even though this is an old game, and the graphics are poor, it is still very much enjoyable and the story line is so amazing.
