I bought this on Xbox Live as an Arcade title a few years ago. Obviously was robbed of my money. I prefer Vice City. Obviously thats just an opinion. I think San Andreas lacks the atmosphere. In this game, you cant ride a Pizza Delivery Vespa dressed in a hawaiian shirt, running over hookers on rollerskates, listening to 99 Luftballons. / I recommend Vice City.Edit Dont do reviews when its Steam Summer Sale OClock.
