I would give this a thumbs up for all its content, and everything this game is. Surely, I wouldhowever, this game has frustrated me to no ends with missions like N.O.E. Rockstar shouldnt just consider changing the physics of airplanes in this game, but SHOULD. Said physics were poorly implemented into said game, and have caused more than just a few players other than myself a living hell. Other than N.O.E, missions like, Freefall are almost impossible to finish due to the nature of how quickly one must turn the rudders of a dodo plane to catch up with the jet in question. A dodowas used to catch up with a JET? All you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!  Smoke. The amount of thought put into those missions mustve been minimal, because it is POSSIBLEbutHARD. Im still attempting to finish, Freefall, as I make up this review. HAVE AT ME GTA FANBOYS, BECAUSE ID LOVE TO SEE HOW YOU COULD DEFEND THOSE TWO MISSIONSAND OTHERWISE! Did I forget to mention the mission labeled, Lowrider?
