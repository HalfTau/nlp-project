Grand Theft Auto is a great game! May not have the best graphics, physics and controls. But its a lot of fun. Either you like to do the story Which is pretty good as well or you can just mess around, shooting cops and whatever else you can find. Or even be a cab driver!But you can also download fun mods and other things!Me and my friends are playing SAMP San Andreas Multiplayer together, that is tons of fun! A modOverall, this game is great, still worth the 10 euros I spent on it.
