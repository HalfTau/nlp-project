I would definetly recommend this game! Everyone would go for the newer GTAs but this is the real deal it is soo much fun. Also a tip is to complete the firefighter and ambulance missions first by going into fire truck and ambulance. They are easy and get you fast cash. This game has everything gta 4 has. It is not terribly large game in disk space but its bigger than gta 4 and takes less time to download and its cheaperSpiralinP.S Please reply i want to see you reviews
