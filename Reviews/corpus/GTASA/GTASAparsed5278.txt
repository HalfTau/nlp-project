While San Andreas in itself is a good game, I cannot recommend the Steam version of the game due to the update they released over a year or so ago now.Reasons being Game is alot more unstable, crashes more than GTA IV. Mouse will randomly not work for no reason i.e. not being able to move the camera being a crucial thing in the game. Along with that I cant use weapons when the mouse doesnt work and the default keybinds in this version are horrendous. Lack of 16 by 9 resolutions, though I seem to have 1280x720 and 1600x900 resolutions. No intro video, not a game breaking thing but why remove it from the newer version I have no idea. Some music removed from the game. This is unstandable due to licensing issues, again nothing game breaking, although it is for me as sometimes entering cars will make the game crashBefore the update the game ran perfectly fine, if you really want to get this game, try and pick up a retail copy second hand somewhere, that way, it is optional to have updates on the game. Thank Steam for removing the option to not update games. Did I forget to mention this is a mobile port?
