I am going to review this game as of 2014 standerds. Missions are repetative and boring and the game drags on far too long. The world is farily empty out side of the citys which really dont have much going on either, there is a few exceptions but for the most part boring flat locations. The games graphics have not aged well at all either. Just wait for GTA 5, its far better in every way and I know Ill get hate by all the people with their nostalgia glasses strapped to their face still living in  this games past glory, but this game as of 2014 really shows its age.
