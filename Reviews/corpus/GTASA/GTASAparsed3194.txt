This is by far the best GTA game Ive played I havent played V yet, but I have all the others. This truly is an open world to explore, freeform and cause mayhem in once youve unlocked the 3 areas. What makes it so special is that theres so much to do, and pretty much all of it is fun. Even painting your gang tags is fun because you will end up on a gang rivals turf which invariably means a fight/run for it/police chase.On top of that you have probably the best game script ever written, and voice acted perfectly by some lesser known actors you may just have heard of such as Samual L. Jackson, Chris Penn, IceT, Henry Fonda and James Woods  they all got their big breaks in to Hollywood thanks to this game. Maybe... All of the characters are great, but I have to say I think Mike Toreno James Woods, and the psychotic Catalina Cynthia Farrell steal the show.It may look dated now, but dont let that fool you. The gameplay itself has never been equalled before or since in a 3rd person action game.Learn to fly, Carl...
