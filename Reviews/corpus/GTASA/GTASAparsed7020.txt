The thing I love most about Rockstar is that the beginning of Gta V, you play as Franklin Clinton, and your first objective is to steal a car. Now in this game, you play as Carl Johnson, and the first objective is to steal a bike. But I got to pretend to be black for awhile, so this game gets a thumbs up for me.
