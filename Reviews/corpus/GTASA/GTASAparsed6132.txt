How can I say?This game still probably the best GTA game ever to be released, I played it too many hours in PS2 then tried PC version and found it even better, smooth, with a huge map for it time, many guns, many amazing characters, amazing plot, amazing skilling method with bars, excellent customization, it was the first GTA that put some steering difficulties in vehicles that sounds more realistic even still being totally arcady, it required more skills than other GTAs before it.This game is such a masterpiece, I definitely recommend it.
