So if you were to count my San Andreas Multiplayer Mod SAMP i would have easily clocked over 4,000 hours. needless to say, I enjoy this game a lot. Like, 4,000 hours a lot. Thats a lot of hours. Thats about 1/2 of a year, or 24 weeks. Both of those are great feats not only for myself, but my country. Murica 10/10
