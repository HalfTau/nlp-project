Playing this game again after almost 7 years and perhaps, firstcopy of GTA SA that I purchased. What blew my mind were the radio stations and character voice they were nonexistent save for few lines from Big Smoke and Ryder in pirated versions of GTA SA. This game gonna be good. low rider mission. I am again stuck in that mission. Time to search for save files on the internet
