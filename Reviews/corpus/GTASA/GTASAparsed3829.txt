I used to play this when it first came out on Xbox and PS2 and had a lot of fun and the old GTA pack was on sale so I decided to purchase it no bring back some good memories. I wound up getting pretty far in the game but got too lazy to finish it. Its still fun, I havent tried the mods but I hear theyre pretty good. Sadly this game doesnt have workshop support. Theres only one GTA with a better campaign than this one and in my opinion thats GTA IV. I dont regret purchasing this, however I do regret purchasing the pack as I never play the other included games.EDIT I finally decided to finish the story. The story has enough drama, action, and comedic relief to keep you going. You really start to feel for the characters towards the end of the game. The final mission is as expected however the events leading up to it were not what I expected. I completed the game without dying once, not because its easy but because everytime I died I loaded my game so I wouldnt have to repurchase my weapons. The story is better than that of GTA V and in my opinion both games of the Red Dead series. I would rate the story probably a 9/10. In total you can probably finish the game in around 15ish hours of gameplay. I have much more than that from starting the story over a bunch a while back. I would recommend this game to anybody, especially if it is on sale. The game does however crash from time to time and when in water it is required that you use the frame limiter Just another example that RockStar is. A controller would also help for the flying missions, however I did them just fine without one.
