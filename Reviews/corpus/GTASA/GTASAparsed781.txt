Okay, Grand Theft Auto is not a series for children. Given some of the content, its not suited for all adults either, but GTA San Andreas is definitely the best of the three titles originally released on the PlayStation 2.Not only do you have a comparatively huge world to play in, with more secrets and easter eggs than an egghunt at the Pentagon, but the story and fun factor are phenomenal. Just... welp, its Grand Theft Auto, expect tanker trucks full of blood, enough bullets fired to destroy Mars and so many ludicrously outrageous things happening without that aspect being noted that youll wish it was longer.The downsides? Rockstar abandoned the game, basically. You need to download several mod packs before you can play it with a controller or run it on a modern system without horrible graphical glitches. Also, some songs have been cut due to expiring licenses. Fixable, but still... /
