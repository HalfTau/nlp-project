Despite the time played on Steam, I have played enough of San Andreas on the Xbox 360 to know that this version is worse. While there may have been a similar update for the 360 version, I was fortunate enough to finish the game and log in around a couple hundred hours beforehand. This version is the poor ios port, and this travesty shows quite evidently on a computer. This update was forced upon users as a MANDATORY update, and as a result, many others and I would say that we feel abused. Through the molestation of one of the finest games in history, this has been one of the largest abuses of Steam customers by a tyrannical, money hungry Rockstar Games. DO NOT BUY THIS GIANT MIDDLE FINGER TO ALL GRAND THEFT AUTO FANS!As for Rockstar Games and Steam, the people at Rockstar should be ashamed of defecating upon their loyal fans who made the effort to not pirate the game and the folks at Valve should be ashamed of condoning this abuse. We all deserve some level of compensation for our time and money wasted, in addition to a public apology.P.S. all of you whose heads  are too far up your nostalgic asses to see that everyone has been wronged by what Rockstar ahs done to us. off with your  positive reviews of this game that only describe your childhood memories. all of you principle lackingeaters who ignore what despicable companies like Rockstar do so that you can continue to hide in your infantile caves of nostalgia. And most importantly,  YOU ROCKSTAR GAMES! EAT   OFF AND DIE! MAY YOUR  COMPANY BLESS THE GAMING COMMUNITY BY FALLING APART AND NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN TO HAUNT US IN ANY OTHER FORM! YOU!
