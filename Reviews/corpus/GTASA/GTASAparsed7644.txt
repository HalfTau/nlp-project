The game is great. Been playing it since 2007 Had the retail copy... But the last new update completely ruined the game...Edit The update makes V1.0 crash more Lets face it. 80 of the people play SAMP/MTA if not more. This is a great example why there should be a downgrade/no updates option on steam. The pirated version/Retail is better I dont encourage Pirating but if you bought the game, there shouldnt be any guilt
