Not the best GTA out there. Its kinda hard when you are born afterVice City and before GTA 4, that its hard to be anything else than a shadow in the series!Welcome to the hood ! its all that you have to know!This game came with some good featured that i liked a lot but it is nothing fancy at all, actualy it could have been forgotten and it wouldnt change that much the gap between Vice City and GTA 4.This is still a must for any GTA player who dont play with Xbox controllers. The GTA bundles come in special now and then so I suggest everyone to own it on their library, as it is a big part of the Video games industries even tough it as been a shadow, its still show the evolution in the series.
