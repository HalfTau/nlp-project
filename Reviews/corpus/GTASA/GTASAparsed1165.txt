Old but gold as they say, I loved it as a kid and I love it now and I always will love this game. Playing this has given me so many good times and replaying this game lets me relive those good times and memories.For me this game is the G.O.A.T. for the GTA series.If you havent played this game yet, then you just have to follow the damn train, CJ, and start today!
