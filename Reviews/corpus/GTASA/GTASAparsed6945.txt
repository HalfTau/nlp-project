gta san andreas. home. before rockstar ed everything up.I have played 0.4 hours on steam, but I had the ps2 version, which I loved, but it sadly, is no longer with us, as my dog got to it.I spent the 0.4 hours I have played trying to fix the mouse, as whenever it feels like it, the game decides nope, you arent gonna move your mouse. have fun cycling.I wouldnt reccomend on steam, but GET IT ON PS2 OR SOMETHING! it is more fun than gta, mods, glitches and hacks make it brilliant as well. and if you dont have a ps2, get a physical copy of it for PC
