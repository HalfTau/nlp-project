9/10The shooting controls all work perfectly, and though I have found the melee combat a little difficult at times its by no means bad. The plot isnt super deep or anything but its GTA and thats how its meant to be and the characters are pretty cool. The main fun of this game however comes from just messing around, so do yourself a favour, buy this game, parachute off a sky scraper, bomb your enemy gangs with a fighter plane and have fun doing it.
