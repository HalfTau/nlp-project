Okay so I know there are ALOT of recently bad reviews for this game, and if you didnt already know, its mainly due to the games latest update removing a couple of songs, ability to add mods, rempved some resoloution and wide screen settings etc.Dont let this stop you from buying the game!Their are tutorials on youtube showing you how to downgrade from steams last update, to earlier versions. This allows you to add mods and fix the latest downgrades.And if youre not intrested in mods or a couple of removed songs etc, then great, id still recomend purchasing the game.
