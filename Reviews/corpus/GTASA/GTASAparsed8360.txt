Dispite this games age it still holds up as one of the best open world games created. A cast of wonderful characters. An incredible soundtrack. A level of freedom that many games can only dream of. Last but by no means least a catalogue of cheats for the days where flying an RV of the top of a mountian is all you want. If only the AI wasnt so useless in thoes critical missions, but meh.
