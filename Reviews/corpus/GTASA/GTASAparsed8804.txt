Note if you havent played this on any platform you clearly dont know what gta is all about.It is the best gta even after gta 5.It has fun and hard missions, it has a huge map and of course you have infinity possibillities what you are gonna do in it.One thing i dont like about it is that i need to do so many missions to unlock every thing in it like the map, the shops and guns.but that doesnt matter because you have mods and cheats wich can make it fun even after you completed it.It will definitly make you rage once or more after losing some missions a couple times and makes you scream yeahh when you complete it after failing those missions.But if you are a person that keeps nagging about the graphics being outdated then you better need to play something else but in my opinion it is a obvious 10/10
