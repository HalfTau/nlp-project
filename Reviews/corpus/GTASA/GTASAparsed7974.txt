Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.. come on, do I even need to review this? This game takes you on a journey of a young adult by the name of Carl Johnson who receives news of his mothers passing and as a result he goes on to find the person who did this.Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, for its time, is a phenominal game. While I did play this during my younger years, I dont think Im looking at it with nostalgic goggles.Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is packed full of content, features and things to do. Many of which are not even found in newer titles such as Grand Theft Auto V. The world is rich in life, variety and constrast between areas. Again, who wouldve imagined such a gaming world back in 2004? I certainly didnt, and I was peeing myself seeing Halflife 2.I dont know what more to say, this game is what it is.. thats why I questioned myself why did I need to review it, its simply amazing. Everyone needs to try this game.
