The original version of San Andreas was one of my favorite games to play long time ago. Now not anymore. Why? Rockstar screwed it up by replacing the original verison with iOS port,,, Seriously what... Why? So stupid.The port version is absolutely terrible. Lacking graphics options. Modding abilities are removed! Yes, removed... A lot of great music got taken out. It looks more cartoony than before. It does not feel San Andreas anymore. Extremely disappointing.At least I still have an original PS2 copy of San Andreas and thanks god for the AMAZING Grand Theft Auto V port... Now that GTA V version is the best version out there over all other console versions. Dont buy this game ever. Go buy GTA V instead.Original San Andreas version 9 out of 10Now 5 out of 10
