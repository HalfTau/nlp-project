Im not happy with this! I havnt had a single fun moment since i started this game! First off, the graphics is the worst in the series, it looks older than GTA3 which doesnt make sense! Its very cartoonish like south park and the textures are straight up ugly! I dont like the hood, gangster theme either since everybody talks like they didnt even past first grade. I would rather kill myself than hang out with these people irl. The music makes me drop everything im doing just to shut off because its awful and the driving is not as good as previous GTA, i spin around like im on ice for some reason. Its also the hardest GTA in the series too with lots of frustrating missions. Im pretty sure this game wasnt meant for PC because it has very low quality compared to previous games which is a shame!
