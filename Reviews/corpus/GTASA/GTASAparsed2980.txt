I like playing Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas because its have a large map and i think this it the most large area than other Grand Theft Auto series... Of course what i like from this game is the gameplay like our real life... You can do some criminals, dating with your girlfriends, playing some mini games, etc... I think thats all my reviews for this game and i hope you enjoy this game...
