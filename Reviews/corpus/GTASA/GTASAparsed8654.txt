San Andreas is the only Grand Theft Auto Ive completed so far. At this point it is pretty old and may be hard to look at considering the graphics we see today. However, if you see this game especially if its on sale, it would not be a bad purchase. The gameplay is good and open world games in general are just awesome. It is also the newest GTA game on steam I believe besides GTA 4 which requires a fix if you try to play it.
