A Must have! An Old Game but still a LegendThe atmosphere and the type of Gameplay is one of that things you will never see again in another game. Not only that it is one of the grandtheftautogameseries it is a journey into the 20th century of Americas Southern region Westcoast where the Drugs and the Mafia are at home. Las Vegas as Las Venturas, Los Angeles as Los Santos and San Francisco as San Fierro. A CarDriveEngine like its better than in some new games and endless possibilities leave other games look old. Often problems with Mouse and compatibility but to handle. You will never see a game with this execution. I really recommend it.
