Another sorryport by Rockstar.Its missing 17 songs, game either runs at 25 FPS, or wonky physics at 60 FPS, has no option for 1080p, button prompts are still listed as keybindings even when you enable the joypad, it is not moddable, has no SA MP, I could go on.Youre better off pirating this game.I only play it because ive downgraded it to the right version, but its not really worth the trouble. And im only recommending it because the game itself is still there, just with aton of tiny  ups and goofs.Nostalgia aside, this is one of the best games of all time. Lots of map variety, lot of missions, lot of RPG stats, the characters are interesting and diverse, you know the deal.
