While I enjoyed Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, I found it to be indistinct from other games in the franchise. The gameplay remained strong and overly interesting but was largely the same from game to game. The missions have a tendency to all bleed into one without enough distinct features which distinguish them apart from each other and it seemed at times that all any developer would have to do to make a new mission would be to cut and paste the objectives from the missions before it. The story also feels indistinct at times. The motivation of each Grand Theft Auto hero is essentially the same to control all crime in the city and exact revenge on those whom opposed the protagonist and have little depth to them. Consequently, I was never really playing the game for the story which, I suppose, says a lot about the quality of the gameplay which the Grand Theft Auto series has considering the time I spent playing it.The violence and sexual content is obviously a concern for anybody who is concerned about the effect that it might pose on the impressionable, but this is the reason there are game rating systems, and consequentlly anybody reading this review will have to determine what their level of acceptance is concerning such adult content for themselves.A minor complaint I have about San Andreas is that the controls can be difficult to use on a computer. Flying certain types of aircraft was frustrating and I suspect that it was much easier to play on a console.Overly, I recommend the game, but if youre looking for an entirely new and distinct experience in gameplay from other Grand Theft Auto games, you will be disappointed.
