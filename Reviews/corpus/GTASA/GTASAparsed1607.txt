GTA San Andreas was the first GTA game to shift the focus from organized crime to gang criminality and also introduced a completely new main protagonist who was received differently by people based on how good they were able to relate to the whole gang setting.Sand Andreas also revolutionized the GTA franchise to some degree with roleplaying elements, meaning your character was able to work out or get fat by junk food which took basically hours of grinding buttonmash minigames to max out all stats which could in turn incrementally degrade if they werent used for a long time. This was received in quite a mixed manner and the fact that Rockstar decided to abandon those RPG elements shows that they were a new but not necessarily good design decision back then.On other ends San Andreas also did a lot of things right, for example the addition of the bicycle as well as the different kinds of usable air vehicles planes, jets, helicopters were new, just as completely new and crazy missions with never seen before design, save for maybe the infamous train mission that everyone hated.All things considered San Andreas might divide some GTS fans into those who really enjoyed it and those who thought it to be a somewhat unwanted cousin of the main series. Personally I can more than recommend San Andreas.
