My ONLY gripe is that Steam isnt supporting the multiplayer mod for this game, that aside I beat this game on PS2, AND PC so I can review it okay... If you ever wanted to play out an NWA video, or if you think TuPac is a God... then youre gonna LOVE this version of GTA. Theres nonrap/rb radio stations in the game, but even being white, having them  on somehow feels wrong... needless to say I play this game when I wanna explore My inner ghettoself. The game has minigames like Basketball, and pool, and all the normal GTA stuff, the in game video games are even somewhat cool on here, casinos too to gamble in, theres a lot to do on this... I felt compelled to write this review for this reason... I have a GOOD gaming PC with Win7... but My cruddy, cheap, walmart PC Im on now with Win8.1 wont run Most decent PC games from as far back as Y2k... it not only runs this game which I got free for buying GTA5, I already owned tthe DVD, but it runs this game VERY well in the games highest settings minus AA... so if youve got a crap PC maybe wanna explore the MP mod outside Steam, AND like Afro American Urban culture/music then this game wont disapoint you in any way unless you dont wanna be a black dude that looks like DJ Jazzy Jeff
