Much like Vice City was to GTAIII, San Andreas improves on Vice City in every way.  New story, new characters, new settings, a hell of a lot of new vehicles, a playable world that is easily twice the size of Vice City, and much more.  The addition of RPGlike character stats is a change that is debatably good or bad, but San Andreas is probably the pinnacle of what GTA was always supposed to represent before the engine went superrealistic in GTA IV, and critics started getting paid to give stellar reviews.
