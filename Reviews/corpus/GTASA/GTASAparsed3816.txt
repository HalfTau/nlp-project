This game is a classic Grand Theft Auto and it has a great storyline. It has many customization features that the other GTAs dont have. Its graphics arent as good as the newer ones, but were good for its generation of games. The gameplay overall is great and I reccomend it to anyone who loves the Grand Theft Auto series. One thing that you cant do though is flip your car over, wich is a bit annoying when you are driving on a mission.
