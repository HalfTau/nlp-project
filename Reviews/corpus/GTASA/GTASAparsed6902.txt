The game itself is a classic, but this version is absolutely terrible. The mouse completely fails to work ingame unless you alttab after starting the game, open Task Manager, rightclick the GTA San Andreas process, and set the CPU affinity to a single CPU and users have to learn this information themselves if they want to play the game they purchased. This has to be done every time the game is started. The mouse still tends to break randomly after setting the CPU affinity sometimes alttabbing temporarily fixes it, but sometimes restarting the game is required.Theres also a graphics setting called Frame limiter. If this is turned on, the game is limited to 25 FPS, which is nearly unplayable for a PC game. If its off, the FPS is unlimited, but apparently having it off can cause all sorts of bugs because the game uses frames as a way to measure time in the game.Furthermore, the game doesnt save the mouse sensitivity setting it must be reconfigured every time the game is started.Finally, the game has terrible performance on a GTX 660M draw distance can be maximized, but turning up visual effects or AA causes the framerate to drop to sub20 FPS. Its absolutely unacceptable but perfectly in line with Rockstars loweffort PC ports for a PS2era game to run this poorly on a computer that can max out Far Cry.Im glad I got this game for free. If I had paid 15 for this, I would feel very shortchanged.
