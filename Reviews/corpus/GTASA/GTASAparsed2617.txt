Awesome game. Graphics are pretty nice and gameplay is highly addictive. Map is huge, so there will always be something to do while playing the game. Amazing characters and storyline, great cars and weapons, plus a lot of side missions makes you play the game for hours and still love it. Only problem I have with the game is driving mechanics, that needs getting used to, but other than that I have no problems with the game.
