A game that was ruined by bad updates that totally ed the graphics and play. I know that it was out of rockstars control but having the licensed music removed was a huge bummer too.This combined with the CaD on OpenIV means I would suggest anyone interested to be very skeptical when purchasing this game or any game published by Take2  which includes all Rockstar games.
