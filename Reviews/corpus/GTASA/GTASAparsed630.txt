GTA San Andreas is still a legend worth playing. It has aged quite a bit of course, but that shouldnt stop anyone. Story is now more cinematic than in previous GTA titles and while its still not on the level of GTA IV or V, its definitely something you can get interested in. But I think everyone will agree with me when I say that what makes this game truly special is freedom of doing whatever you want. Completing missions, stealing cars, racing, performing stunts, shooting gangsters, being chased by police, exploring the world or just doing crazy stuff all over the place. Thats the fun and thats the reason why I love this game so much. Just pure fun and joy, nothing more.9/10
