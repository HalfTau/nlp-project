GTA San Andreas is a great game but this steam PC port is terrible. Firstly, if you want a good San Andreas vanilla experience, Id reccomend the Xbox 360, PS3 and mobile remastered editions as the game is more clear, more detailed and less clunky. If you are getting it on PC for mods, DO NOT get the steam version. This version disables mods. If you do want mods youll need to go on dodgy virus prone websites to download illegal pirated files from the non steam version of the game in order to use mods. Most of these downloads to it have been taken down. If you want GTA San Andreas on PC, then get the nonsteam version. I requested for a refund and got my money back. 2/10.
