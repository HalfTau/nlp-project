From the genial minds of Rockstar Games, San Andreas is a title perhaps familar with the vast majority of gamers, and to good reason San Andreas is considered the greatest of the GTA Grand Theft Auto games by many fans and newcomers alike! The graphics are nothing special, but this means little when the gameplay is as excellent as it is here, and the voice acting is top quality with the likes of such greats as Samuel L. Jackson. I definitely recommend this.
