More cars, bikes, planes, helicopters and boats and even a hovercraft then any previous GTA title plus the sheer size and longevity of San Andreas mean this just has be a part of any self gamers collection. Theres a mindboggling amount of stuff to do. PC owners definitely will fare better than their console counterparts. The bugs that plagued the console versions all seem to be fixed in the PC version. The soundtrack is inspired, with a heavy emphasis on late8s/early 90s rap and alternative rock. The keyboard and mouse controls are a little wonky. Takes time to get usto the mouse free look. Its easier with a gamepad but overall, its a good game and still works on a modern computer unlike GTA IV. The mod community is also active, you can get some nice HD textures to give the game a graphical update. Its a game with atmosphere and style, and should keep anyone busy for months.
