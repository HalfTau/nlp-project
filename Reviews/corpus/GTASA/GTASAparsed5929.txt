Buy the game if you never played sa,but dont buy the game if you want to mod.rockstar is kinda like nintendo, they were both legends 10 years ago. but now both do shadylike this. Basically the game is unmoddable after some patch. so basically rockstar is a gangsta robbing our music and mods. look at me im from the hood and steal songs all day,so rockstar thought it was cool and steal our music and mods too.i only recomend this game for some nostagic or first time player but even then you are limited with the songs removed. wont be long untill all the songs are repalced with royalty free music. you i have steam music so get on my level rockstar
