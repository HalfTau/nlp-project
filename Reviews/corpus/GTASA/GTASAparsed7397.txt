B.S move Rockstar I have always been your customer even buying crap like pool table for the 360 . Thanks for showing us the paying customers that if you buy something you dont own it or deserve to. B.S like this needs to change as it is belived that if one pays for something they own it complete. In my opinion to sell something then to take something out its wrong and is and should not ever have happened. Furthermore the industry is so money hungry its sick and its sad to see how everything now can be striped and taken from you even though you payed for it. Its theft in my opinion.
