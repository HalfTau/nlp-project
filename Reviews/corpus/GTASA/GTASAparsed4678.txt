All this time, years and years after being released onto this world, San Andreas has remained one of the best GTA games ever to be made. Compared to the present ones, yeah, it lacks graphics, thats the only flaw it really has.So, you are a black man  Not being racist here  And your life is just... awful, care to make it better? This game is all about it, making someones life better. You start has a lowlife gangbanging balla killing machine.. and at the end? The exact same thing, but rich, the whole city is at your feet.In my opinion, this game makes me feel great, riding bikes on the desert at extremely high speeds, jumping off a plane without a parachute, hearing Cjs remarkable comments everytime.. pure comedy.Besides, having a mature and dark story, if you are willing to hear it, the surreal experience makes you feel part of it.This game is old, hell yeah it is, but so is your mom.. and you still love her dont you? Thats what i fell, it has everything GTA V has, except great graphics and online gameplay. You can steal houses here, buy ridiculously expensive massions, make great cars Racing Ones, participate in lowrider events, races... or even, just parking your car somewhere, doesnt matter where really, and listen to the music this game has..  adding your own to the gameAt the end of the day, to me, this game beats GTA V  100/0 No doubts.
