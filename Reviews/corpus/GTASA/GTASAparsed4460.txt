It surprised me that I still had fun with this game in 2016.By this point in the GTA games, Rockstar had ironed out a lot of the annoying features and lack of features that characterized III and Vice City for me. The gameplay feels pretty good in regards to the driving and shooting which youll be doing most of the time. The world is massive and there are places youll never have to go but are still cool to visit. The story doesnt seem as good as Vice Citys but its definitely better than IIIs. The soundtrack is still amazing to me and the time period makes for cool continuity nods to the previous games. Even the cheats are improved with stuff like super punch and better flying cars.Pick this game up if you had a good time with it in the past.
