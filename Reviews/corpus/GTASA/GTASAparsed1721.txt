Love it, finally completed it 100 after nearly 120 hours i think. There is so much to do with side missions and exploration which really makes this game amazing. Even though its quite old now I still think its my favourite GTA  I have payed them all . Simply because the map, story and gameplay was fantastic. If you really enjoy the game there is still alot of San Andreas online and plenty of mods available for fun. I would recommend not modding or cheating etc until you complete it the first time though!Even after completing the game you can still explore and drive around. Mod cars and compete in races etc so if you want to there is still many hours of fun to have.
