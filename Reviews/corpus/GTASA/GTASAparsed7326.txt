I would easily recomend this game to any fans of any of the grand theft auto games, simply because it is one of the best in the series. I played the game on Playstation 2 A long time ago and it was one of the first games i paid full price for because i liked playing it that much, though i dont have much playtime due to playing other games way too much it is still insanely fun singlepayer, and even more fun when you start adding mods. 7/10 due to most recent update that removed a lot of the good songs, and corrupted saves for a lot of people.
