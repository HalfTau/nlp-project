So I picked this game up in a trade for a  game I did not want, and decided to play it since I have never played a 3D GTA before. And I have to say, GTA San Andreas is awesome. From what I found, this steam version is a censored version, but great nonetheless. Even on my potato, I get enough FPS to be able to play it, and the world is awesome, as are the ground and water vehicles riding bicycles straight up mountains D.  The story, at least as far as I have gotten, is good.My biggest gripe however, are the planes and helicopters. Controlling them is no easy task, and you are forced to fly both to continue the story, which is where I am currently stuck. The aerial vehicles make me want to kill myself.Update   I collaborated with a friend and he steered the plane while I controlled the acceleration and rudder and managed to make that work. Pretty gay experience though.
