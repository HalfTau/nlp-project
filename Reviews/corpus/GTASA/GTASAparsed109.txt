I swear to ing god, this is the hardest game I have ever even attempted to get to work. Modding this ing thing was a waste of my ing time... No documentation or very little on how to do anything, and the game does not want to work with anything. And I swear, theres no point. EVEN IF you get it to work, it will randomly decide to crash. If you are going to mod, first thing, downgrade your game, or nothing will work... took me 4 reinstalls before i was told to. Not worth it.But now that we are past that, Its clearly on my top 10 best games ever. No only good story and good gameplay...Must buy.
