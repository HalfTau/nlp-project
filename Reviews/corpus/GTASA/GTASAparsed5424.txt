Normally, I would recommend this game because i like it a lot, not only of grand theft auto franchise but also of other releases of rockstar. But this version of the steam has to many bugs, which I did not get to fix any of them and thei were not supposed to exist within the game I know because I play the Playstation 2 version. The bugs that occur more frequently are black screen from the menu, screen blinking in the game, loading screen locked even after the game has been loaded you can hear the ambient sounds in the background, save corrupted, etc. Buy this game just brought me a headache, and besides all this I do not get my refund, since I spent more than 3 hours trying to fix the bugs. I got to the point of using a downgrader in the game to install mods that may solve no forward. Anyway I do not advise buying this game on steam because of the massive amount of bugs present in this PC version, Im downloading now ISO PS2 version that I will try to emulate the PCSX2.
