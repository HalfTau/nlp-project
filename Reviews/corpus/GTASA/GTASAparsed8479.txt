How am I suppose to play this game if 90 of the time Im sitting in the car waiting until the current song finishes? Them nearby gangsters are probably like Whats he doing in the middle of the road? Is he mad dogging us? Is he comtemplating life? Did he just get an epiphany of his OG lifestyle and is thinking about going to art school? Why is he wearing socks with sandals? How can we see that hes wearing socks with sandals if hes in his car? Why are we, a gang in the corner of a burger joint, questioning this man enjoying some tunes in his ride?Then the gangsters walked away in silence and became philosophers.But dat music tho.
