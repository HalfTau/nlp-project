A good game for jacking cars and shooting people. Some of the missions are fun, some are duds. The buttons arent labeled properly for PC controllers and you cant restart missions from the main menu but considering the games age, this is forgivable. Also, Id like to note that the radio in this game is amazing. Id recommend this game to someone who has played the more recent GTA games and is looking for something more or someone who just wants to steal cars and enter cheat codes to make them fly.
