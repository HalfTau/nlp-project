An amazing game destroyed by dishonest actions from the publisher.GTA SA was a great game, but this version in particular is a bad choice.You are better off searching for a disk version.Rockstar has updated the game for steam, which actually removes content 18 songs, removes mod support and widescreen resolution support FullHD.The game also suffers some weird performance and crashing issues because of the songs removed.On the whole, not worth a buy.
