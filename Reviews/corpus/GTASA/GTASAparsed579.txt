Listed play time is limited to just the Steam version. Ive had about a weeks worth of gameplay on the original PC version years ago.Arguably my favorite GTA game. Probably the best storyline of all the GTA games Ive played, definitely the best aesthetic. Voice acting is fantastic, and the music selection for the radio stations is, while not on the level of GTA III, still pretty dang funky. Gameplay is incredibly expansive for its time, and there are tons upon tons of side missions and easter eggs to be found.The Steam version is a pretty fine port, I gotta say. Plays like a dream, just as I remember over eight years ago.Definitely recommend getting this.
