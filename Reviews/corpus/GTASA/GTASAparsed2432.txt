Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is by far one of the greatest GTA games of all time! Dont let the graphics fool you, this has a great antagonist, an amazing storyline, hilarious characters Im looking at you big smoke! D and just an overall great feel to the game. I remember playing this when i was a kid and it was on the PS2, it was so good, and to be able to come back to this game after all these years is amazing, If your new to the series, Id 110 recommend either buying this game or Vice City. Dont bother with GTA V, now dont get me wrong, GTA V is great and its your choice, but San Andreas is just amazing in every single way and you can do a lot more in San Andreas than you can in GTA V.
