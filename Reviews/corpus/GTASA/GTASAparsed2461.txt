This game is besides its sometimes nearlymissions a piece of art. The setting is great, a nice storyline with a shocking plot twist, good mission design and the characters make this game so good as youve probably heard before.But its the most unstable, incompatible game for PC I ever ran into. Sometimes it crashes right a the beginning, intro movies arent shown, game crashes sometimes just because of pineapples I guess, I dont know anybody NOT having problems with the PC version of the game. I had to reinstall it 5 times so far, my 50 savegame which took me over 40 hours got deleted once. If you have no patience whatsoever, I dont recommend this game.
