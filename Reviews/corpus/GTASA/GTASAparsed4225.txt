This was one of the first games Ive ever played on the PC. Coming back to it with a sense of nostalgia and nothing but fun memories of killing hookers and ing about for hours on end, I was a bit worried the game would not live up to my expectations.Perhaps when an individual is presented with a game series, they will always cherish their first game, despite there being flaws, with other better titles out there, similar to my view of Twilight Princess in the Zelda series, despite it drawing many plot elements from Ocarina of Time. I had a blast replaying this game as an adult.The graphics, while primitive today, looked very nice 11 years ago, and can easily be made to look better with the numerous mods out there. The explorable zones are HUGE, allowing hours of dicking around before coming back to the main missions. This also  grants me my favorite past time in this game, which is dressing up as a black cowboy, and riding a motorbike on the desert highway at midnight listening to KRose, with my favorite host MaryBeth Maybell and her husbandkilling fetish. The story is just interesting enough that it motivates you to advance further into the plot.Halfway through the game, it presented a fairly huge challenge, which at first seemed like a flaw of the game, because up until that point in the game, all you drove were cars. You had to learn how to pilot a single engine stunt plane and perform complex manuevers through rings similar to Superman 64. Little did I realize the grind to become a better pilot opened up a new avenue of gameplay, as I soon found myself hooked to piloting planes and flying across the countryside, and covering distances in very short periods of time that I would otherwise have to spend tens of minutes on the ground navigating through the complex snakelike roads while minding all the incoming traffic. The combat is obviously the worst aspect of the game, but I was having such a blast playing this game that I just didnt really mind it.Looking at the game today, I would probably rate this game a 6/10, but it certainly aged well and was a marvel for its time.
