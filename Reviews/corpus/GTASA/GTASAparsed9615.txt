Now this is the story all about howMy life got flipped, turned upside downAnd Id like to take a minute just sit right thereIll tell you how I became the prince of a town called San AndreasIn west Liberty City born and raisedOn the playground where I spent most of my daysChilling out, maxing, relaxing all coolAnd all shooting some bball outside of the schoolWhen a couple of guys, they were up to no goodStarted making trouble in my neighbourhoodI got in one little fight and my mom got scaredAnd said Youre moving with your auntie and uncle in San AndreasI whistled for a cab and when it came near theLicense plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirrorIf anything I could say that this cab was rareBut I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to San An!I pulled up to a house about seven or eightAnd I yelled to the cabby Yo, homes smell you later!Looked at my kingdom I was finally thereTo sit on my throne as Fresh Prince of San An
