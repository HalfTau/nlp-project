The game that pretty much defined my early childhood. This is absolutely great and a classic game every PC gamer should own! Unfortunately, I have some bad news and good news. Firstly, this Steam version is not particularly great  it misses SAMP  the multiplayer mode of which I made countless friends! Also, some songs have been removed, You can find out which songs have been removed hereThankfully you can add all of these songs again in the customizable radio station. My honest advise to you is that you follow a guide on the internet and legally downgrade this game to an earlier version, preferably versions in the v1.x range x stands for random number/s. Also, some game physics are broken such as the car physics and overall driving which is downright numb when framerate is manually unlocked when you remove frame limiter. The game is otherwise capped at 25fps which is awful to say the least. However, that can easily be fixed with a downgrade in the version and a mod to patch the physics for 60fps usage. It all takes a while though, but it is all worth it in the end.Of course this is a fantastic and hilarious game in its own right, even though it is aging now. I would give this Steam version or any unmodded version a 7/10 because of technically glaring issues and a fixed version a 9/10.Getting it on Steam is a safe bet, but the best way to enjoy this game is to simply buy a retail copy as the downgrading process is not necessary.
