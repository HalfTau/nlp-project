This is a very fun and addicting game. Probably my favorite GTA game in the whole series. I encourage anyone to buy it and play it. Also I dont know why everyone else is fussing about the new update. Yeah I realize that there is about 18 of the songs missing. But Dont you all realize that you can put any songs that you want to listen too in the game. All you have to do is go to search programs and files, then type in GTA SA User files, then click on User Tracks, then copy and paste your own music to the User tracks folder. Next you start up the game and then when the main menu comes up you click on options, then click on audio setep, then click on user track options, then click scan user tracks, and then you finally have your own personal radio station with your own music and a much better variety of music to listen too. Plus you can skip through music and commercials as well that you dont want to listen too. So to me that is a better deal in the long run. Besides the 18 songs missing the game runs perfectly.
