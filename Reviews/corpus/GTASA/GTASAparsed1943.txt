The only reason i purchased this for a couple of years ago, was become of the song called America  Horse with no name and the so many memories my childhood and friends this game me feel. I loved the game, its one of the few my heart doesnt just forget so easy.Its one of the few ones i still remember from my childhood. I love this game. It might be a little violent, but its just too sweet to trash away or not possibly try. I might not have any hours on steam. But the thousands of hours i spent on my PS2 on this game cant be described enough trough a simple review.Thank you Grand Theft Auto Sand Andreas.Score 9/10.
