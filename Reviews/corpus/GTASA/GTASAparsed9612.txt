With GTA 3 blowing everyones socks off, Vice City improving on a proven formula, and San Andreas capping off the series, you cant go wrong with either of the 3. My personal favourite is SA, just because it feels like the series reached as high as it could at that time. Theres plenty to do, plenty to see, and all of it is fun. Cant go wrong with either of them
