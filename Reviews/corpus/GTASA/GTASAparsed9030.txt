Even if the Grand Theft Auto series has always been good, this was one of the best games in the series. In many peoples opinion it was better than GTA IV. Although it wasnt perfect, the sheer size of San Andreas was something that could not be denied. It had country sides and even the city of Los Santos. This was R Rockstars best game until GTA V.Even thought GTA SA is old I still enjoy playing it and its still  great game. The story is great and the openworld is fun too. I highly recommend it.its better than minecraft
