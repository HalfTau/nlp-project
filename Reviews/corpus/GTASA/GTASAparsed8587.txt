I may get a severe amount of hatred for this, but whatever. Ahem THIS GAME IS MUCH BETTER ON CONSOLES! I cannot STAND the controls and how limited the resolution is on certain computers. The mouse control is buggy as hell. The wanted level is a btch to get rid of, and EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS A CRIME. Not to say this game isnt bad. It does have its ups, but I do recommend GTA 1  Vice City. THis is where the series got Gritty and Realistic Not to mention the graphics are AWFUL for its time. If you do want to get it, get the Xbox version. its way better.
