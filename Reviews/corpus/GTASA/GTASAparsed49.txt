Before raging at my review, please read this. No, I wont complain about Rockstar Games removing songs from the game.A while ago I bought this game on steam because I really enjoyed playing it on my PS2 but sadly it stopped working, so I decided to buy the steam version. It worked really well, I enjoyed it and had a lot of fun replaying this game and reliving great memories of this game. Two days ago I decided to start a new game, and everything was going well. Then two days later... my game is ed up. It literally looks like Im on ing acid. If you dont know what I mean, watch thisIf someone can help me fix this bug Ill be very grateful. Thanks for reading.EDIT Ive also tried reinstalling the game and it still doesnt work.
