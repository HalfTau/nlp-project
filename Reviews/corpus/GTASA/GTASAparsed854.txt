Regardless of what GTASA games youve played in the past, if GTASA hasnt been one you ticked off the list it needs to be. While the steam version of the game has some minor issues, 169 support is slightly stretched, graphics worse than PS2 version, and some features being missing, it is still a joy to play. Would highly recommend downgrading the version however
