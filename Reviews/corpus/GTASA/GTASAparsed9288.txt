I have a long and storied history with Rockstar and the GTA series.After all, GTA Vice City was the first MRated game I ever bought, at the prime age of 12. Thanks EB Games!GTA San Andreas was a ing game changer that had literally anything you could ever think of in the game. I mean, cmon Area 69, Jetpacks, MULTIPLAYER, dildoes in the showers of the police department showers. It was the blueprint of which Saints Row the Third said, Lets try THAT! before eventually saying,  it to logic and, Hello to mindless fun.The difference between those two though, is that San Andreas had a compelling and believeable story. Compared to Saints Row the Third, I mean. But I guess even Shaq Fu has a believeable story compared to Saints Row 3.All the same though, I have nothing but fond memories of this masterpiece and Ive been replaying it to get me even more hyped up for the series return to the title city in GTAV.That being said, Ive been replaying it on PS2, because the computer version of San Andreas is the worst ing insult to this series that Ive ever seen. It just..... really needs to be played with a controller in hand. Ive never gotten hand cramps quite like the ones Ive gotten playing this ported piece of garbage.So dust of your PS2s that I already know you have, dust of your copy of GTA San Andreas that I also know you have because youre not lame as hell, and play it there.Um, that wasnt a suggestion.
