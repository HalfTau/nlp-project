Retroactive patch removed 18 songs, including some of my favorites.Also broke 1080p and 169 support.The 1015 year song licenses of San Andreas costed anywhere between 5,000 and 30,000. GTA 5 has made billions alone, surely they could spare 100,000500,000 on keeping one of their masterpieces alive, or just let it remain what it is abandonware.Buy somewhere else, preferrably retail.
