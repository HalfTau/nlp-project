Jesus Christ, it only took 58 hours to beat this game. One of the greatest games of all time, and for a very generous price. You will definetly play your moneys worth. I reccomend you have a USB controller for the missions N.O.E, Learning to Fly, and Freefall as they are nearly impossible with keyboard.
