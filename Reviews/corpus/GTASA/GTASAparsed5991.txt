When I first had this game, I had pretty much no clue what to do. But then again I was pretty stupid. That was the nostalgic Xbox vs Gamecube kind of day where you were either playing like Smash Brothers Melee or Halo 2 all day long. But you know, they have great games such as this one where the graphics can make this game silly or very stupid at times, even both. It warmed my heart to see this on the summer sale because its a pure classic to me. My game broke when I was younger and it really made me angry and sad. Because how this game changed my life changed it way differently from the other games.
