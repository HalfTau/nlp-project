I bought this game a few days ago for my new laptop and i was really exited. I started the game and everything was working just fine. I played for a bit and went offline and when I went back to the game all of a sudden my mouse stopped working. I couldnt click in the main menu anymore but i could eventually move my pointer around. When I then started the game and was in my house, the mouse wouldnt move. I hung around in the settings menu and tried to fix, I made myself admin of the game and tried to change the games properties. But nothing worked. Sometimes the mouse worked just fine and sometimes it didnt at all. I would have really loved the game if it worked properly because I played it on the ps2 a long time ago for a long time. But with those mouse issues i cant recommend the game purchase for anyone because you can just get very frustrated and with a nonworking mouse ingame/ the mouse works perfectly in any other game the game is just unplayable. So be aware!
