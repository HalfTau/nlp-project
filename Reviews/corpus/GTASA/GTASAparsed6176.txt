very fun i would reccomend it.I love the game play and  the characters they all feel like they are real life people and it feels like you are cj you are riding the bicycle you are punching the random guy minding his own business you are driving into the river you are hanging out in cjs house. For an old GTA Game it is very fun.also could be fun with samp
