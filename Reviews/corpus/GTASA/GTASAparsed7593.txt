GTA SA is one of the best games i ever played but clearly just on Ps2.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM.1. Bad optimalization  game is crashing and shuttering without reason.2. Music from original game is gone.3. Control are really fu up  game is unplayable without Xbox 360 controler.4. Graphics are more ugly than on PS2 and even on a god damn mobile phone.Another classic game as worse version just on Steam, just for MONEEEEEY!Good for me I still got my Ps2 copy and I just hope Rock wouldnt come to my house to steal my game.Ps2  10/10PC  8/10Steam  5/10
