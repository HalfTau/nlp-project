I played this game on the ps2 as a kid, and it was my first introduction to the GTA series. What I can tell you about this game is it has some annoyingmissions. Flying School is the most frustrating mission, its more annoying than than a splinter shoved into the insides of your an us and then being hounded on by an  at work whose breath smells like like a slug having orgy with a dung beetle that got aids from living inside Betty Whites bung hole.Despite the annoyances this game has some great memorable characters. On the ps2 i would have had probably well over 500hrs from exploring the entire map and completing every single challenges and side mission. This game has  of content. 8.7/10
