Personal Review 9/10This is the best GTA for PC yet. Until GTA V comes out i will keep saying this.Ive completed this game, 100, but not on Steam, as i bought it in CD.The Graphics were amazing by the time this got out and the gameplay and storyline still are great to this day. One of the best games ever made.
