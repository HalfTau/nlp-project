I would rate this a good rating ,but and this is a big BUT. there are multiple glitches ,but one stands out. When you do the mission Cesar Vialpando and you go to the lowrider show and compete you can never win because if you press down or up and you do it right on time then it will count it wrong and ive tried so many times but the same results and i never win and it pisses me off cause i cant continue in the story. This is my favorite game of all time and this is my first time playing it on pc and ive enjoyed it until i got to this point. ROCKSTAR FIX PLEASE!! !
