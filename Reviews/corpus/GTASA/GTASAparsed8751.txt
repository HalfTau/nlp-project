Alright this was a great game but i dont think its all its cracked up to be. Sure, the map was a lot bigger than the previous installments, but it just didnt feel like a grand theft auto to me. EVERY other grand theft auto to me feels good, and it makes you look like a highly respectible gangster. But in San Andreas youre just a street thug. I also felt that the map was huge and amazing but they should have made the city bigger and not so much unneccesary country side. Dont get me wrong this is a great game, but it just doesnt feel like a grand theft auto game. I had hours of fun with it on the ps2 but once i grew up a little i got it on my new pc and it just wasnt as great as i rememer it. I highly recommend gta3 and/or vice city. All three of these game are good, but 3 and vc are the true grand theft auto games. If you are looking for a true grand theft auto game i would not recommend this. And if you are going to get it, dont get it for pc. It sucks. But if youre looking for just a fun ganster game to play with friends i guess i would recommend it. get it for ps2 though.
