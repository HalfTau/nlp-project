Train jokes aside, this is one game that has aged damn well. Aside from some graphical faults, glitches and minor gameplay nitpicks in comparison to newer GTAs, I still find it incredibly fun to play. Fair warning though, you may have to enable framelock in order to avoid some strange bugs that occur on newer PCs. Dont worry, youll get used to it.And if you cant get used to it, get over it, this game is like 12 years old, it certainly didnt have 60fps at the time.
