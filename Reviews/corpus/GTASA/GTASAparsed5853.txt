GTA San Andreas is without a doubt one of the best games ever made. The game might be over a decade old but its aged rather well.The game has beautifully rendered environments that still look good today to my eye. Theres tons of things to do in the vast landscape of San Andreas like go to the gym, eat in a restaurant, risk all your money at the casino, escape the police, SWAT and even the army for hundreds of miles, fight in gang wars, get a girlfriend, be a vigilanti, drive the ambulance, a plane, a boat or wreck havoc with a vast arsenal of weaponry, only to name a few. Theres also a great soundtrack and a brilliant story. The characters all have a very interesting personality, the plot is very well written, and chances are you will get hooked just after a few missions. And to top it all off, the game has hilarious cheats, and the huge modding community will provide you with countless extra hours of enjoyment. Whats not to like?The PC port and the recent updates might cause some grudge but a lot of the problems are fixable by modding.I wasnt even into GTA before buying SA, its arguably the best one in the series and I recommend it to anyone who likes some good old fashioned free roaming action!
