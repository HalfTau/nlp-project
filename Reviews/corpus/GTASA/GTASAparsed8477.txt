Graphics eleven times better. They look HD and have a new feature that shows great shadow effects and the music is a lot better quality then the PS2 version. The game play is amazing and fun same as its ever been. But there is one problem.. YOU CAN NOT MOD IT. If you have Windows 8,7,64,XP and any other you can not mod it at all tryst me i have tryed to many times. if you want to mod it buy a disc version or a NON Steam version. But apart from that still a Fantastic! game.Modding This Version e.g Steam Version is SUPER COMPLEX. Please buy only if you wanna play story mode. You can mod the game but its painful to do trust me D i did it.THE BEST GTA EVER!
