What an insane classic game, GTA San Andreas takes place in 1992 San Andreas Los Santos, Las Ventures, San Fierro, Flint Country, and Bone Country which is now known as Blain Country in GTA 5 which San Andrea sis based on Califronia, Las Ventures is based on Las Vegas which isnt even in California but whatever, and others which are pretty well known so Im done explaining the locations. Wait, one more thing the locations are all bordered up due to a storm or some stupid excuse to not explore the entire map at the beginning of the game which I guess they knew you were going to, they eventally all are taken down and the player is allowed to explore the game as the main story unfolds. Anywany CJ Carl Johnson leaves Liberty City which he stayed at for six years to Los Santos and on the way to Grove Street while taking a Taxi, he is pulled over by our main villian, Officer Frank Tenpenny Voiced by Samuel Jackson with the help of Officer Eddie Pulaski I dont know his actor infact I only know Samuel Jackson voiced Tenpenny and James Woods voiced that bussiness guy that is also in the main story but Im not getting into that and Officer Jimmy Hernandez. If you seen The Introduction which is set before teh events of GTA San Andreas and after the evnets of GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories though nly GTA Vice City is refrenced with Ken Rosenberg appearing and he main villian Sonny from GTA Vice City who spolier alert, one more time. SPOILER ALERT SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH SO YOU ARENT SPOILED ABOUT THE END OF GTA VICE CITY, anyway who was killed by Tommy Vercetti at the end of GTA Vice City and his death is mentioned in GTA San Andreass introduction and on a billboard in GTA Liberty City Stories which a documentary is said to be made about his death. Woah, I need to start talking about the game, a little more about the story and I go on about the gameplay and some other stuff.Anyway Officer Tenpenny arrests CJ as he is a corrupt cop along with Officer Pulaski, but, Officer Jimmy Hernandez isnt a corrupt cop and later on it is revealed, also spoiler alert yeah I cant talk about this game without talking about the story to much, anyway, it is revealed Jimmy alerts the higher ups and Officer Frank Tenpenny and Officer Eddie Pulaski are caught which leads to alot of story and stuff and Jimmy is killed by Eddie after trying to save CJ, CJ kills Eddie right afterwards, and Frank s killed by really himself after crashing a Fire Engine off a bridge. Jesus Christ Im done with the story Im sorry, great story really great but Im talking about gameplay now.GTA San Andreas focuses on Cars, Boats, and Helicopters like GTA 3 and GTA Vice City did before but this time GTA San Andreas includes airplanes I know the Dodo was in GTA 3 but that was it and was a pain in theto control in the first place so just calm down. Also, you could swim in this game for the first time unlike GTA 3 and GTA Vice City where it appears Claude and Tommy skipped swimming classes back in school, luckily swimming was Carls favority class and we can even dive down which isnt as good as GTA 5 looks but hey it was Rockstars first try and they did an okay job, pratice makes perfect which GTA 5 isnt perfect but come on it is probably the best Rockstar game out there.Also the cheats in GTA San Andreas are so good, well, more funny then good I guess but still cool. I wasnt able to play mutiplayer which I am planning on playing soon, looks interesting. Anway, GTA San Andreas is a great game, classic, with all those myths and legends which I was planning on talking about but I think I am going in this too much. I would instantly give GTA San Andreas a recommendation no questiosn asked.
