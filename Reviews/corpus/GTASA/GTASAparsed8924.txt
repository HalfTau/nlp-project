This game has so much to keep you entertainted, from killing cops to spray painting walls and parachuting out of jet planes. Along with all the fun it gives you it also has an amazing story to the game. The only bad thing about this game are the graphics but that is understandable becuase this game was made years ago. I can easily say that this is one of my favorite games of all time. I havent played it much on the PC but iv beat the game multiple times on other gaming platforms. I cant wait to beat it again here on the PC. If you have never played this game make sure you do becuase your missing out. Definitely a 10/10 for the great gameplay and story.
