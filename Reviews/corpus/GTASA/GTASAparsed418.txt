Played this game since I was 9 and what I really felt about this game now , is nostalgic . The classic , the best  the old but gold Grand Theft Auto . Played the old much older series since young before San Andreas and It really does remind me something . I didnt really experiance the whole fun . But today  11 years later  Finally , Im back .If you guys didnt know and hated this series then you should change your mind because the way I see it , its way different than the way you see it and I know but these Grand Theft Auto series is the masterpiece . From wherever this series is been made , to 2017 where the much more High Def games is being created . But this Grand Theft Auto game , of all the games including Grand Theft Auto 5 , this game is much better .
