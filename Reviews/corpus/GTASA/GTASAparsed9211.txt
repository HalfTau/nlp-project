One of my favourite games of all time, this world you are put in is incredibly vast, takes hours to explore and is full of shooting dudes, stealth missions, flying planes and choppers, driving cars, bikes and motorcycles, shooting pool, swimming, melee combat, eating burgers, listening to the radio, spraying tags all over town, customzing your character to the max, getting hidden collectibles, and just so much stuff to do. The story is quite long and immersive, and its overally just fun. I played through this a couple of times actually. Was great each time.
