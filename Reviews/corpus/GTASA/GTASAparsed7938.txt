Ahhhh, the classic Grand Theft Auto Series, so many good memories of this game, from younge and old... this game was a staple of the GTA series often said to be the BEST GTA in the whole series. So let me go over the Pros and Cons.Pros LONG Story MANY hours will go into this game and most will not be Regretted. The Game has a HUUUUUUUGE map to explore, and find the oh so many secrets. The Customization of your character is almost infinite, with so MANY different variaties to choose from you could deck out your character as much as youd like.SO many cars to choose from, including Bicycles and and Motorcycles, most cars able to be customized and outfitted.Your character can learn different fighting styles as he travles, making him versatile in brawls.You can Swim, HOLY CRAP a Grown man who can swim.You can recruit grang members into a posse, and do drive bys or have massive gun fights.You can claim territory and have massive gang wars with the 3 other Opposing gangs.SO MANY weapons to pick from, including Assualt Rifles, SMGs, Pistols.Many shop interirors and building interiors to check out and see.Many Secret Interiors and other Secrets around the world, for you to explore and find.Its made by Rockstar I mean COME on Rockstar games is BADLag is nonexsistant.Nice Musical pieces on all Radio Stations, and a few Radio Talkshows have some funny dialogue.The game isnt too easy or too hard, some missions being SUPER easy, while some will be a challenge.ConsGraphics are not exactly the best.Controls on PC can be confusing Especially for thoese of Us who played it on PS2The save feature in this game, is annoying. You have to drive ALL the way back to a home you own JUST to save.The Music and Speech in the game, can often feel repetitive and just plain boring.Missions have NO checkpoints, so if you die YOU have to do that mission ALL over again.Modding is hard to do in this game.Would I recommend this game? Yes, I would infact id recommend it to anyone whos already played the game, or IS completely new to Rockstar Games, or the GTA franchise. The game is overall one of the few games I play, that dont require mods to BE fun or MORE fun.
