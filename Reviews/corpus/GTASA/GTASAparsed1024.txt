Ill have 2 numba 9s, a numba 9 large, a numba 6 with extra dip, a numba 7, 2 numba 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.  Big Smoke 1992Anyways, this is my favorite GTA game, but dont be fooled by my game hours, I have played this game downgraded.This game is better than GTA V in terms of gameplay, characters, story, setting, and radio. That is, if you ignore graphics.You can however download graphical mods to not make this game as ugly as it appears to be.In conclusion, this is better than GTA V if you put enough time modifying the game.
