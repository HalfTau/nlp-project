it could just be me but the game gets bugged on the 14th mission, you need to sneak into a house and steal the weapon crates from the house but when i pick up the crate cj flings himself and dies, making me have to restart the mission from the beggining and the hospital confiscating my weapons. Luckily i managed to get a refund but if youre getting this game i just recommend getting it on console
