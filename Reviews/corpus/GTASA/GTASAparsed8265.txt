This is a good game and one of my favourite Rockstar classics, but I cannot recommend this game on Steam. Classic Rockstar game! Storyline Terrible port, it happens regular that Im driving / doing a mission and suddenly the car stops,.. And I have to press another button to drive,.. Making certain missions very hard to finish,..Unless they fix these minor issues, I cannot recommend the Steam version.
