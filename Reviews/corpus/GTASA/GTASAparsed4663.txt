This game is just awesome. It makes me remember good old times and the NPCs are so dumb, its funny. Like all the GTAs, the protagonist has C4, an RPG, a Miniuzi, an AK47 and all that stuff in his pants. Of course, CJ the protagonist is black so he gets arrested when the game starts and he eats fried chicken all the time!
