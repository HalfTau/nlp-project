The pc version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is, well, okay to say the least. Its not a trainwreck like the shoddy pc port of Vice City, but it is not a near masterpiece like the ps2 version of San Andreas. Its middle of the road for me. The reasons behind why I prefer the ps2 version of San Andreas are as follows. The pc version has some game breaking bugs here and there. Its playable, yes, but the bugs and glitches that you have to work around to avoid or fix cripple the experience a bit, not to an insane degree, but they are irritating, like a fly buzzing around your ear, a baby crying or finding a bug in your food. This review is based off of my experience with the game, so the problems you encounter may vary. Such bugs/glitches that I had to put up with/endure were the game crashing every now and then which makes saving your game alot a nessecity, or face anger/rage, swimming underwater was impossible, certain items would cause the game to crash upon using them, various audio files were missing, some texures were missing, some graphical errors here and there, framerate issues and more that I probably forgot because meh. I would recommend this game because, if you lower your standards and are okay with dealing with the things that I told you about or other bugs/glitches that you may find yourself then this game would be okay for you, but understand that the ps2 version is far superior as you would be free of all of the nonsensical bugs/glitches and you could listen to the radio with all of its music stilll within the game. So, to digress, the pc version is tolerable, the ps2 version is near perfect despite a graphical downgrade. Oh, and I have no idea what the ps3 version is like so I guess its a mystery! D
