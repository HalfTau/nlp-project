My friend says this is the best of the series, and while I think Vice City has the slight edge, San Andreas is a very fun game.  By todays bleeding edge standards the graphics may be a little dated, and the acting is a little over the top, but the gameplay is rock solid.If youve never played an open world adventure game, give this a try.  Its far cheaper than the newest incarnation GTA V and while it may be missing a few bells and whistles, itll remain a returnto classic.
