This is an awesome game in itself. However, this is one of the few times that the PC version is not exactly the best. This version can be very, very glitchy. I dont recommend using cheats on it, because that can mess up your game if your not careful. The controls can also be a problem, and you may want to configure with them. I do not have too big a problem with flight. If you have the console versions, dont feel obligated to buy this version. If you do, just be careful.The game is very fun, and the overworld is amazing. However, there are some very tedious missions, and buying a console version wont fix that.All these problems really cancel out with what is great with this game.
