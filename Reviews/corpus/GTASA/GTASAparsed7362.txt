Thank goodness they updated this broken classic!No longer will we be troubled with video option menus cluttered by obscure resolutions that nobody uses like 1920x1080 or anything in 1610!. Replay your favorite game in glorious 2 generations ago consolevisiontm featuring random glitches and missing textures! Swoon at now sort of supports the XBox 360 pad, kinda functionality! The newly revamped soundtrack has even been slimmed down by 18  or so songs making it much sleeker and streamlined!Do you frequently shake with impotent rage knowing that some people like playing this game with mods? Well shake no more! All mods are dead!Play it again for the first time, your old saves are no good! This is the definitive version! Buy it! Make alternate accounts and buy it for them too!
