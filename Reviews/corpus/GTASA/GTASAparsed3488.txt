GTA San Andreas its a game I always find myself coming back to.It has a good story, solid controls and the characters are very likeble.Its a game that if you have already beaten you can come back in a year and relive all those great experiences once more...Also all wehad to do was follow the damn train cj will haunt my dreams forever TT.
