gta san andreas is a very very good game due to its story, content, and some memorable characters. i played gta san andreas on the ps2 when i was 10 or 13. the reason why i put a thumbs down on the game is because it doesnt really work. whenever i play the mouse sometimes doesnt respond, it sometimes crashes or freezes on random, and this one level mountain cloud boys after the cutscenes finish CJ just stands on the sidewalk when i press A,S,D,W to move even when he doesnt, which means im stuck and cant progress through the story. for many GTA fanboys who say well dont play the game then if it doesnt work or get a better pc you should realize that you sound rediculous.editon december 2016 when i made a new profile to start all over again with the story, the mission i was stuck on somehow works, so i guess you have to make a profile first and make another new one to make it work.
