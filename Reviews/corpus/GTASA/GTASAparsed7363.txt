In October San Andreas became 10 years old. I replayed it because of nostalgia and I was shockingly surprised to see that a big part of its soundtrack was removed 18 songs  11 of the total number of songs if my information is correct. And I felt it while progressing through the game. Towards the end I was flipping radio channels to get a song I havent heard that much and it was becoming increasingly difficult to do so.Even though I enjoyed it, I cant recommend it. Not like this. This recent patch which did more damage than improvements the game crashed a few times for me but usually it ran ok.If you want an old school GTA game, get Vice City. It has better mission structure and a better world SA has a bigger world and a better setting for a GTA game but it doesnt use it as well as Vice City did.
