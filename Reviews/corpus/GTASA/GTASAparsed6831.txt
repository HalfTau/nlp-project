Recent patch literally destroys and ruins this game on Steam. Original soundtack is gone, save files mysteriously disappear, and the resolution is wrecked.Do not buy this game. I repeat, DO NOT buy this now unstable game on Steam. Buy an original hardcopy free of mandatory online updates.I wish Steam had ratings for their games because this one is sinking faster than Activisions profit margins. Truly a tragedy.
