Even though nowadays this has been aged for its time, it was and is a revolution. This game is great fun, being able to do different activities all around the map, or just driving off cliffs and using cheats if thats what you wanna do. The pc version can run on pretty cruddy computers, so its good fun even if you dont have a big gaming rig.
