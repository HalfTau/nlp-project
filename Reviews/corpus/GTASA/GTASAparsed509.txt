My hours on this game are not at all an accurate representation of how much Ive played it  I played it for hours and hours before I had the Steam version. I was not of a GTA age when it came out, but this was the game that kickstarted my GTA passion. I think I chose this one specifically because of the rave reviews for it all over the internet. And they were damn right!I love this game so much and it is extremely replayable. You can customise CJ  make him wear clothes, make him fat, make him thin, give him tattoos, change his hairstyle. And the attention to detail is incredible. If your CJ is fat and you take money from a pedestrian, he will say things like, Thisll help keep my belly full! Similarly, you can customise cars, buy houses, do side missions... It is full of content and could easily compete alongside HD universe games when you ignore the graphics.I can say with confidence, this could easily be the best GTA game ever made  better than GTA V  if it were kept exactly the same but with HD graphics and improved vehicle handling. It seems to have a lot more content than GTA IV e.g. planes, jetpack, environments, vehicle customisation.The GTA games I have played the most are SA, IV and V and I like them all a lot, but I usually go V  SA  IV. In my opinion, the three games win in different areasStory IVContent SAProtagonist IVVehicles VGameplay VWorld ignoring graphics SAWeapons VMusic/Radio VActivities IV lets go bowling!Minigames e.g. arcade games SAEating/Dating SACharacter Customisation SAVehicle Customisation SA  VProperty SA  V you cant buy houses in V, but you can buy businessesAnd remember,
