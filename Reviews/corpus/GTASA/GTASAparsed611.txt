Best part of the GTA series in my opinion. I personally like the RPGSystem which requires you to train and use your abilities in order to get better, as well as the Arcadestyle game system which was given up in the later parts of the series in favor of realism.All over, the best part of the GTA III series, can keep me amused for hours and hours...
