Grand Theft Auto San Andreas still holds a very special place in my heart even after all these years and multiple entries in the franchise.Rockstar really outdid themselves on this game. even though you could say that about most Rockstar games.The world is big and ambitious, and even has more things to do and see than most open world games does today.While the map is nothing compared to lets say Grand Theft Auto V in size, since the game features 3 large cities and plenty of small towns, forest areas, mountains, and deserts the world feels massive. Its one of the few games where I can just hop into a vehicle and drive just for the sake of exploring and not get bored. Nearly 150 hours on Steam alone And Ive previously played on the Original Xbox, Playstation 2  Playstation 3 and I still feel like theres more to explore and see, and during my recent playthrough I found locations and secrets I didnt even know were in the game.The soundtrack is on point, that feeling of driving from one city to another and then all the sudden a song like Hold the line goes on and it instantly makes my day better.It is pretty clear however that I have a strong nostalic feeling towards the game, but looking at the game and trying to put those feelings aside the game does hold up to this day. well, maybe not the graphics but there are plenty of mods to fix that.A big open world, a huge variety of weapons and different types of vehicles, a great storyline about following trains, betrayal, and brotherhood really makes San Andreas a timeless classic.
