This game is in my opinion still one of the great games that has ever been created and I would love to see it getting a remake like TES V Skyrim is supposed to receive in the near future.Gameplaywise it sure has its flaws like some weird physics its an old game so.. duh. But all in all I would recommend it to everyone searching for a good old sandbox shooter. Or people who wanna do some crazy stuff since this is probably the game with the most cheats and the weirdest ones Ive seen to date.The only negatives I could see in this version are Low Rider challanges seem to have reversed vertical controlls Means The arrow on the screen tells you to press up but you have to press downThe most annoying thing for me is not the games fault, Because its the censorship. As a German I have to deal with the probably most annoying censorship worldwide. I dont even care about heads not exploding when you shoot them with a sniper rifle or not being able to beat up corpses Why do people actually wanna do that anyways? What bugs me is that they removed the money drops when killing people. I see that they are trying to prevent people maybe thinking If I kill some stranger on the road I get rewarded! but damn.
