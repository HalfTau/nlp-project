I always played this game on PS2 but I love the PC controls a lot more. Look, do not play this game on PS2 anymore because the graphics and lighting compared to this pc port are so damn washed out, I just cant believe it. This game is a classic and if you want a good written story with good voice acting than, you would like this as well. The only bad side to this game is the default controls. They are just terrible and hard to get used to. Totally change the controls as fast as you can. Its kind of disappointing that most people wont go out and get a 10 year old and just buy the newest GTA, but you dont know what youre missing out on. Graphics might be really dated but the story will never be. If youre a retro kind of guy like me, then you should reconsider your next buy.
