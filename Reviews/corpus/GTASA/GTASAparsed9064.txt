An Amazing game. Both on a technical at least for its time level, and on a gameplay level. Its a huge world, and entire state, with 3 large cities and 12 small towns. It always feels fresh, and the random events caused by the AI are just sweet. I poured at least 30 hours on the Xbox Live Arcade version, and I never even left the first city. Its pretty much the best PS2 gen GTA there is.
