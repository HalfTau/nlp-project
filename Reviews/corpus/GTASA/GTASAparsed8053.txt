Extremely good game, expands on the established norms in the GTA 3D world and exception story with very likable and believable characters. Lengthy story will keep you hooked and preoccupied for at least 30 hours, and another 20 hours exploring San Andreas and accomplishing side missions and quests. Story is bar none probably one of the best so far in the GTA Series, second to maybe the HD Universe. Old and new characters alike are involved in this journey of one man trying to restablish his ties with his family, but along the way get caught up in a much more bigger plot. The only drawback and downfall of this game is the relatively large empty areas some cities have contained, as the playing field is very large, but has very little to offer in terms of size and it seemingly feels like the areas could have been more condensed with more focus on one area rather than expanding out with little to see. 8.7/10
