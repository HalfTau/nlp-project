I love this game so much. It is such a great game, but... the thing is i grew up with this game...I dont remember how old the game was when i first came across it, but i think it was a year old at that point. But that is the only thing i dont remember about this game.I remember CJI remember Grove StreetI remember those heated days in Los Santos and every locationI remember the beautiful Countryside and all its wonders and every spotI remember the Radio StationsI remember all those myths of Bigfoot and LeatherfaceI remember the ghost cars in Back O BeyondI remember the classic Mount ChiliadI remember it allI remember Grand Theft Auto San Andreas...So should you buy this game? In my opinion, YES.I cant promise you the same love for it as ive had and many others, but i sure as hell hope you do.
