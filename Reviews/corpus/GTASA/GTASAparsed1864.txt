GTASA is a great game, loved it back on the ps2 and the original xbox but this steam version is just a pile of buggy my game freezes randomly when the game loads the world if i leave a house or building. very annoying if you havent saved for a while there are also alot of other bugs, just look them up.. DONT buy this!! get a cracked or retail version of the game and enjoy but spend the 10 euros/dollars on something else. Appearantly they also made modding GTA illegal which is nice.GG Rockstar.
