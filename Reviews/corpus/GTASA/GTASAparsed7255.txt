Phenomenal openworld sandbox. Great gameplay with a variety of missions and things to do, an excellent story that knows when to be serious and when to be funny, and a phenomenal radio setlist that really captures the feel of the early 90s.However, youre better off pirating it or playing it on a PS2 emulator because of the patch Rockstar put in that removed a bunch of songs from the ingame radio they took out Killing in the Name and Hellraiser, would not buy, removed resolution options, and broke everybodys saves. Or you could just buy it on steam and download the unofficial patch that fixes the the game and the stuff Rockstar removed, but that would mean giving them money.
