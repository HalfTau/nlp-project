Great game.Terrible controls.No Acheivements.They should either add controller support and community bonuses or make this a free game.I was able to make it through the game, but the controls for vehicles especially planes and drones make the game almost unplayable.Anyone looking to get some nostalgia from this game should skip the steam version and get a ps2 or an emulator and save yourself the frustration.
