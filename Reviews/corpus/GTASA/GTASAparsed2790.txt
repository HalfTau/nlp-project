Although Im a bigger fan of Vice City this game is pretty good too. Theyve added some new features that really enhanced the game. I finished it a couple of times back in 2005, and it was pretty enjoyable except for the last mission which was pretty frustrating . It was also fun to know that Officer Tenpenny was voiced by Samuel L. Jackson.All and all a good classic open world actionadventure game that you should try, especially when you played one of the other GTA games.
