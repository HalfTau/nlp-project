9/10  definitely would reccommend.It is the most complete GTA to date. No, its not the best looking that would be GTA V, and no, its not the best that would be Vice City.It does, however, include the most amount of things for the least amount of resource requirements for 2016 games and it has an extensive and quite funny story.Things I love about San Andreas Three cities as opposed to one, each with its unique feel skies, dialogues, people, cars, weathers, wealth, etc A large amount of different cars A few nice planes and helicopters Driving, Motorcycle, Boat and Flying schools A few of the best missions ever in GTA Area 51s jetpack, for example Lots of minigames dancing, pool, car hydraulic dancing, basketball, races, casino, etcYes, GTA V is much better, but after beating it I didnt feel a need to come back and keep playing it. San Andreas, however, I played it for years between 2006 and 2013, when I finally bought it from Steam and clocked another 110 hours.Lots of collectibles and side missions to feel rewarded.And you can always feel the adrenaline of escaping your known cities or returning to Los Santos if you have been kicked out already. Even at the endgame you can hunt for the largest plane I wont tell you where it is and attempt to escape Area 51s airspace alive.The biggest upside is that you can own more than 6 cars with your character, unlike GTA V. And you can safely store them into a garage, unlike GTA IV.One of my alltime favourites, although it looks like crap, even for its age.
