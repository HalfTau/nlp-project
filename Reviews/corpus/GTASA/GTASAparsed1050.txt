Back when I was young this surely was one of my favorite games.Im playing it again now and its even better simply because there is so muchto do in this game, and to find out, its unbelievable.But really Im just here to tell you that the steam version is crap and you should buy the disc version in a store somewhere or just crack the game.Im just playing it right now because I have a save game installed and Im gonna finish the game again.
