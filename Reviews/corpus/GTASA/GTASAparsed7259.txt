I can only title this game as art, altough the graphics are outdated, and the steam version has a big pile of issues, such as all cars being dirty and music missing. I went to mod some things as they should be, and now have a beautiful, perfect San Andreas experience A thrilling story about a ghetto gangster working his way to the top. It is satisfying, fun and full off comedic and loveable characters. The story has a good balance between serious movie like scenes, and comedic moments.The soundtrack is untouchable, and the car handling, altough outdated is still fun. My biggest complaint is the rather dull gun play. San Andreas itself, is a gorgeous map, and it still amazes me how big it seems to be.With a solid 69 hours in the non modded game, which was my first play trough, I can reccomend this on a sale.Modding is easy, once you did it is worth it, youll have a okay looking game that is alot of fun.Once you completed it, you can explore all the fun mods from a big variety of websites, or even head for a multiplayer mod. there is 2 services. So, quickly summed up Buy this game, and forever fall in love. One of Rockstars their finest pieces of work.
