GTA San Andreas was no doubt one of the best games for its time, and even today i still play it on the Xbox 360. I understand the lack of graphics comeing from a console to PC, but ever since a mandatory update came out almost half of the songs where taken out of the game, and for me i thought San Andreas had the best music out of the GTA franchise. But im still ok with the now lack of music but now the controlls are glitches, i cant turn and look where im going and there is no way to fix it. I still have hope that Rockstar Games will restore this once loved game.4/10
