I love this game! Even today the game looks good. Much better than GTA IV or even GTA V.  In my opinion C.J will always be the best GTA protagonist and Big Smoke the best GTA side kick. It is one of my favorite games of all time. If any open world game could be called a classic this would be it,10/10
