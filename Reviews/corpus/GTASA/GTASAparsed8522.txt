This game may be old but it is still probably the best GTA around on PC due to its giant open world full of action, s, guns, cars and gangs. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas by far beats Grand Theft Auto 5 in my opinion as GTA San Andreas is still entertaining many people on this very day! This game works brilliantly on Windows 7 and there is always something new to do on the game. It never gets old! I have not even comleted it yet and Im only on about the 11th mission and decided to do some free roaming. The story is also fantastic and is a longer story than Grand Theft Auto V! The only downside to it wich is also due to the fact that this game is old, it doesnt allow you to use the RT, LT and DPad on the Xbox 360 controller. However the rest of the game is completely reccomended by me.
