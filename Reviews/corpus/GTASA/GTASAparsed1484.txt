To this day, its proabably one of my favorite games of all time. During the mid 2000s this was my favorite game for the Ps2.I never got bored of it. Sadly the pc port is absolutely terrible. At least for the latest realeases of the game. Thankfully you can downgrade the game so that it can be moddable. Enough with the technical t, now its time for the honest review.In my opinion this game is better than GTA V. The reason i say that is because when you ahve too musch realism in a sandbox game, it makes the game to slow. GTA San Andreas has more cheats than GTA V. WHY? ?, arent the newer games suppose to surpass anything they had inj the previous titles. The main protagonist in this game has a reason to explore San Andreas. There are many memorable characters in this game. Such as Big Smoke. He has 2 quotes that i can never forget.They areAll you had to do is follow the damn train CJand Ill have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.The mods make this game even more funner, and you dont need to pay for any of them either, unlike GTA V sadly.In conclusion, this is always going to be a memorable game to me. Maybe its because i played it alot om my PS2 or maybe  because its better than GTA V.FInal Verdict 10/10
