With more bugs than a gddamn anthill, and characters about as deep as a postrain puddle, this game does NOT fail to disappoint! Sure, the gameplay is kinda nice, but the story, characters, graphics, bugs, glitches, and of course, extremely annoyingly dumb AI... it sure does make for one mediocre game. 3.7/10
