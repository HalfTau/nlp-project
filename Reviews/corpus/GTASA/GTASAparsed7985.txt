I have mixed feelings about this game. One on hand, I had a blast, on the otherhand, I stopped playing the game due to a few fatal and poor gameplay decisions by Rockstar. The car handling and mechanics are fine, although depending on the car they can become very crappy especially in nicer cars which spin out anytime you try to turn them. The flying controls are attrocious, almost undoable with a keyboard, the worst flying controls Ive ever seen in a video game. Worst, you are FORCED to do the flying school missions, and worst, the game lacks controller support so its impossible to play the game with a controller which could help flying siginficantly. This game is a pretty poor port all around, locked at 30fps unlocking it screws with the physics the draw distance is incredibly low, cars spawn a block away from you. The keyboard controls suck and require rebinding to get them playable. The default mouse settings are unplayable, you need to set the fly with mouse and drive with mouse and invert mouse all to off, otherwise the mouse wont work at all.The story is fine, the missions for the most part are fun and engaging, but the games controls lack polish and Rockstars instance on forcing you to do everything flying, racing, swimming, ect gets in the way of having fun as some of what Rockstar has in the game isnt very fun, and will make you want to rage quit.Can I reccomend this game? No, sadly. Ive enjoyed my 40 hours in San Andreas, but I will forever look back on the game with a sour taste due to the incompitence and ignorance of Rockstar.
