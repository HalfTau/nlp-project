its a good game dont get me wrong but1. you have to downgrade the game and that takes a LOT OF WORK2. theres no steam workshop probably because this is an old game and you have to download mods from a website and risk getting a virus3. the game has a TERRIBLE resolution scale so you have to go to the options and hope to get the right one4. some songs are deleted thats where downgrading the game comesbut the games still fun to play though
