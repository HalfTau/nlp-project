There are no spoilers in this review.Ignore all reviews about OpenIV or TakeTwo. They all have literally nothing to do with this game  people are just angry that they shut down a modding tool used for GTA4 and GTA5, but not GTASA. They are completely irrelevant.If youre a fan of openworld sandboxes, I cant recommend this game enough  especially this game has a special place in your heart from being a kid.After five years on the east coast, its time to go home. Play as Carl CJ Johnson, the brother of Sweet, the leader of Grove Street Families, a dying gang set in Los Santos. With his gang dying and his mother killed by the Ballas, the sworn enemies of the Grove, CJ has to return home to set things right. But things get out of hand fast when hes picked up from the airport by three crooked cops, known as C.R.A.S.H., who used to pick on CJ before he left and made him do their dirty work for him. They frame him for the murder of an officer Pendelbury, a fine man I might add. In return for not arresting CJ for the murder, CJ now works for C.R.A.S.H. and must bend to their every whim.In late 2014, Rockstar had to pull many songs from the game in order to avoid licensing issues, since the game was about to hit its 10th birthday. Additionally, the Steam version has many bugs that the retail physical disc edition had fixed with an official downloadable patch. Because of this, its recommended to either downgrade Google for San Andreas downgrader to convert the Steam version into the retail version, or purchase a physical disc copy from something like eBay or Amazon. Both these solutions will restore all the removed content that the Steam version is missing.
