If you want to take a trip down memory lane in the GTA series, I highly recommend getting this game. I recieved it free with a purchase of GTAV and have loved every minute of it since I started it up. It takes you back to the days in the life of CJ Carl Johnson, and the fight of the gang families. Definitely worth buying for PC if you loved it back when it fist arrived.
