What can I say that hasnt been said? Its Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. One of the most legendary, historic games in existence. It takes all of the beloved features of the GTA franchise and spices it up, adding loads of customization to your character CJ and all the cars you can find on the street. The atmosphere is even better, set in an early 1990s Los Santos obviously based off of Los Angeles. The graphics can look a little pixelated in todays age, which is understandable, seeing as how this game is about a decade old now. Still a classic. Still highly recommended. 10/10
