This is more of a rant than a review, but I am really upset about this and I am sure many people relate to me on this due to Rockstars history of PortingThis port has graduated into a ing mess. Unfit for modern systems.I spent the last three days attempting to get this game to work on my Gaming Laptop only for me to realize how broken it is. I wont talk about the changes from the PS2 aesthetically. There are mods for that and that is a subjective topic anyways.No, i would like to talk about how the first setting for antialiasing brings my laptop that can run Fallout 4 on Max settings to its knees. I got to Whetstone 4 years ago on a  PC with 1 GB of RAM, Pentium 4 and an Intel 82865G GPU. Then I beat it on the same thing, except with an extra GB of RAM and a Core 2 Duo.So why is this game nighunplayable on my GTX 960M GPU!? Its not that im running too new of a PC, that doesnt stop everyone, I got every essential improvement I needed. SIlent Patch, everything, but even with AA off, sure I get a solid 30 FPS, but the tiniest bti of activity on my screen has unresolvable stuttering problems!I didnt even get into the removed songs and features, along with all the work you need to do to get this game into a POSSIBLY playable state. I personally have terrible internet, downloading a 1.3 GB downgrader is annoying. After all this t, I decided to just get the PS2 version, and if possible, I recommend you do too. Hey, you cant get those pretty mods and graphical stuff...But at least its playable, and has the San Andreas Ive grown to know and love. Grove4life!
