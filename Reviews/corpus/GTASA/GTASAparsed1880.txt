One of the best games ever made.But the steam version is really bad. Steam version is  3.0 which added a lot of new bugs and glitches previously fixed in 2.0 .Also you cant play SAMP or any other online modsAlso they constantly remove songs from the game when the copyright expires.Also its harder to mod the game.Also not good for speedrunningOverall, if you have a 1 or 2 hours time to fix the game car color bugs, complete radio songs etc. before you can fully enjoy it go ahead. But if not, i strongly recommend not buying this game, as Rockstar doesnt care about its consumers.
