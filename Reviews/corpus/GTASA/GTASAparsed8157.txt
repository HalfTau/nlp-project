This game makes GTA V looks like it was made before GTA IV. GTA San Andreas is the only game were you can drive one certain vehicle Trains. The game may have outdated graphics but it has a great storyline and ending that makes you wonder if GTA San Andreas 2 might come out after GTA V. I recommend you to buy this game and get the multiplayer mods. This game is 10/10.
