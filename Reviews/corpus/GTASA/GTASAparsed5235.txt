GTA San Andreas. I remember when I heard 1st time about it, and thought whats so cool about being a gangsta , stealing cars and shooting at random people?. Then I pirated it to see for myself, whats that GTA game is. And I swear to my grandmas life, I know San Andreas better than the city I live since my birth and this will be over 21 years now. Sure, R totally ruined Steam version with its licensebullsht patches, but GTA modding community is one of strongest and didnt give up and let GTASA hurt too much. And this game really worths all the effort you need to put to make it right.
