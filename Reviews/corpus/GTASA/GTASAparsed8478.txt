I used to recommend this game for all and call it a 10/10 but now since rockstar released this PATCH,the game is not 1080p supported anymore they removed 18 songs from the game and it has the weird looking graphics from the mobile version I just cant have anybody play this game from steam. Please do not waste 20 on the version 3.0 from steam get it somewhere else. My final score for this game now with these patches is a 5/10
