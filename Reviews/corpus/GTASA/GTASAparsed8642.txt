Simply put, the best Grand Theft Auto game in the series. Over THIRTY HOURS of story missions, side missions and acitivities, races, three cities to explore, go to club, the gym, get a new haircut, whatever!Seriously, I wouldve happily payed full price for this 10 but it was on sale so I got it for 2.50!GET THIS GAME! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!
