Do not buy this copy of game! Not worth it after the latest madatory update. God!!! I dont understand why? Why R destroyed this such a great game of my childhood! Stutter, glitch, bug! If not because this game is a freely item after buying GTA V, I will never ever buy it! Too shame that Steam only offer GTA V with San Andreas only, while R warehouse offer all free choice of R games. Well, what can I do?Until R release update that reverse this junk to the original one, better you get it by retail, or PIRTE IT!!
