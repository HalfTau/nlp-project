Damn man. Big smoke and all them traitors dont know Grove Street for life. Bust a cap in some purples and cholos and them asians. I mean Im asian but this game definitely made me want to become a gangster. Just like in all the news stories that are based on fact and truth. Side note, I think Truth did drugs. All and all, good game with all them es. This game will teach you how to be a real player and be a hitman. Graphics were intense. The fire and smoke just destroyed my system. You can fly with them aeroplanes and ride them motorbicycles. cash yo. So much SWAG. SWAG. BALLIN.
