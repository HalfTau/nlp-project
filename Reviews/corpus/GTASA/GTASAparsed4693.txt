This game was a classic of its time and still is to this day.San Andreas made the giant leap to open up open world to its fullest potential, with a great story line and great gameplay.SA made you feel a connection with all the characters, whether that be Sweet and Cesar or Big Smoke and Ryder. No matter what happened you always felt close to them in the game.Bearing in mind all of the uniqe missions in it ranging from Police raids or working for the triads.This game also brought a new aspect to a lot of games today, that being custimization. I know it wasnt a massive part of the game but you could practically make CJ unique giving him his own personal look. I myself made him rock Grove Street green.Overall Rockstar did an amazing job simulating the early 90s with the drug wars and cocaine days along with the large amount of gangs.I highly recommend this game to people who love a good story and enjoy exploration and good character development.If I have to rate this game I would give it a 10.Hope this was helpful to people interested.
