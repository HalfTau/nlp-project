This isnt a real review, just a reminder Rockstar in the last patch removed content from the game, even from people who already bought it. Just by the songs they were removed I think its enough to not have the same experience. 1080p deleted, glitches, mod support broken, save files prepatch dont work anymore.Consider looking into the PS2, Original Xbox or retail physical version of the game. Avoid Steam version. Yeah, hurts to say that.
