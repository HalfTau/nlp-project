I am not really a huge fan of GTA, even though I have thoroughly played a lot of them. With San Andreas, however, I have to say I unexpectedly enjoyed it a lot. The characters are definitely the highlight. They  especially the main character  grow and change, which is crucial to good storytelling. They range from ambitious underdog gangster to oblivious hippie to blind Asian casino owner to nerdy RC enthusiast to corrupt policeman villain voiced by Samuel L Jackson. The story branches off into unexpected turns, and does it with flair. Even the final mission proved to be more thoughtprovoking than I thought, for the villain who was once the protagonists best friend ends up destroying himself by living it up at the top and betraying those who trust him. Isnt this what the protagonist does as well? Moreover, while many missions prove to be a bit frustrating, they still provide a good challenge, and you can still strategize a bit. Buying properties is almost a joke since youll spend way more money on other properties that basically let you do the same thing save and change your clothes. I have yet to thoroughly play IV and V, but this is by far my favorite GTA game so far in terms of story.
