I only picked this game up recently but I can see how so many people say this is the greatest GTA game. Some even say better than GTA V. While I dont think its better than GTA V Because dated graphics and the driving  shooting controls are not great I do think its better than every other GTA game apart from V. The story is quite solid and the characters are memorable enough...And am I the only one that makes the character naked on every single GTA game I play? Probably am...Also CJ with max sex appeal and in boxers? DAYUM THAT BULGE. Its huge  But anyways. This game is great and I am also having loads of fun with the mod MTA or Multi Theft Auto for it.Final Score9/10
