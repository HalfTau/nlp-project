Ive played this game for over 13 years and Ive enjoyed every single bit and still do.The game never failed to amaze me everytime Ive pressed the start game button, I was always excited to play this game.This is the best Grand Theft Auto Ive played, ofcourse the others are great too. But this one is the best of the best.The story is great. Different missions with great dialogue, each mission is different theres no same mission.10/10The characters are just amazing, fun and great, especially the great Big Smoke. ofcourse theres other fun characters like Ryder.Gameplay is just greatreally good and easy handling.vehicles, motorcycles and helicopters/jets have amazing handling. the helicopters are alittle hard to control and easy to crash with. Jets on the other hand are semihard if youre going really fast.9/10Weapons are weapons.theres so much to choose. from a pistol to a rocket launcher, granades and bombs.10/10Theres alot of other things you can do aswell, like do collectables, side missions ambulance missions and others., sprays and many more.Theres so much that I can say, but I think this is enough for you to know that its worth the money for this masterpiece.Overall  11/10
