Just to start this off, I am never going to stop loving this game. Ive played this for years and it simply never gets boring. Whether your doing the missions or simply want to run old people over in a monster truck, you just wont get bored.This is probably the best sandbox game out there, even topping GTA 4 in my opinion. The detail that has been put into this game, where even eating effects your weight and going to the Gym effects your muscle, this game hasnt gone wrong anywhere.If you want to live a similar life to yours but want to get rid of the consequences of allll the bad stuff, then this is the game for you.
