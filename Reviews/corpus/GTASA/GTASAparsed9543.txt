In my opinion the best GTA game. Although the PC version has some issues and for some inane reason can only go up to 1680x1020 resolution, it is still worth the experience. A whole state to explore full of three huge cities Based off of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas along with a vast countryside. The storyline itself is very much enjoyable as it tells the story of an aspiring gang and our ghetto characters rise to the top, through legit means. The entire atmosphere of the game is just superb. The soundtrack, the dialogue, the characters, everything is just superb in a sandbox game. For PC it gets an 8/10 because of the issues it has but overall the game itself is one of my few 10/10s.
