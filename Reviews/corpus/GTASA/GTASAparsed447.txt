This is a must play.Almost everything about this game is great, but if I had to pick a favourite thing I would choose the dialogue  the funny .I am a little bit disappointed that there isnt really much to do after youve beat the game.And I absolutely hate the flying mechanic.If you can buy this game for 2,50 like I did, its a very good investment.
