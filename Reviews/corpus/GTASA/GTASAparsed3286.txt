This is simply one of the best GTA games. Soundtrack, gameplay, atmosphere of 90s Los Angeles  its all there. If you are new to Grand Theft Auto series, then I totally recommend you to take this game best to do it while it is on sale with the other GTA games. Even by modernday standards, it is still great.
