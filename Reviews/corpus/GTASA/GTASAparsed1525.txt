Graphics 5/10 Steam VersionSteam version did good improving the graphics, however there are some mods that could still make it better.Gameplay 8/10In GTA San Andreas, you can freeroam and do whatever the hell you want. Its fun raising chaos in this game, and I could spend hours and hours killing cops and enemy gang members. There are so many things you can do in this game. You can gamble and and get in debt, fly planes, jets, gunships, drive luxury sports cars, tanks, and monster trunks, making this fun to play with your imagination. Fortunately, mods are also allowed for this game, making it even more fun.One problem with the steam version is that completing vigilante missions doesnt improve your armor, however that can also be fixed by mods.Sound 7/10Voice acting is okay, and weapon sounds are alright. The radio stations in this game also feature greatest music hits from the 70s90s in all most music genres like Rap, HipHop, and classical rock. Although if you dont want to listen to old hits, you can still put your own music in.Story 6/10Has a long story and campaign, but I still wasnt very attached to it, or any of the characters. I was a little attached to Wuzzi though, but that might be because Im also Asian lol.Overall 7/10Its an old game but still has a very good gameplay. It has a long story and campaign, and allows mods. You can spend hours and hours just screwing around in this game. Recommended and worth its 14.99 price.
