I dont understand why the removed and censored this game. I still love it though. Story is best in the series IMO. Train mission reallyme off. ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN, CJ! I dont know why he screamed at me. He had a prettypistol. I could of capped those guys if I had aim, maybe instead of screaming at me, he shouldve invested in something other than the BB gun he had. Hes very rude. Games good, Settings arenow, if you can get other that instead of making it look like a broom shoved up your then youll enjoy it. There will be a fix soon hopefully.
