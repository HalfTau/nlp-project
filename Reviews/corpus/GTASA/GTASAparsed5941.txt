First of all , I would like to say that this game is a triple AAA clasic!One of the classic games that everyone should have the opportunity to play !But lets get this review organizedGraphics  65/100To evaluate the grapics you have to keep on mind that this game is , effectivelly , a game from 2004, so you cannot be expecting to be tremendously beautyfull, it is beautyfull if you compare it to the other games from this especific generation.But one thing I have to admit, I love those beaches! Los Santos 3Sounds 75/100Oh gosh , how I love to get in a car and live again those 90s musics . One of the things that I did not like about it , is a recent update that took some of my joys off. Copying one guy  Rockstar you a busta! Story98/100.PERFECT STORY ! In this game you can live the life of Carl Johnson  C.J that came back to his city to assist to his mother funeral. As he gots here , he realizes that his gangsta crew was weak and dying and the others crew like the Ballas were getting better and bigger.He knew that he cannot turn his face around and ignore his familly , so he does a couple things to help the crew. He feels part of the team again and starts to live the thing again. You will be CJ that will try to seek the truth about his mothers death and will try to raise once again the glory of the Groove Street gang.Gameplay 80/100You have 3 citys  Los Santos , San Fierro , Las Venturas , and 2 country  zones , the Desert one , and the mountain one .Thats enough ! You have 10000000 things to do!In the end i consider that this game evaluation is 80/100 because it is an analyze from 2015, if this was an analyze from 2004 I would give without any doubt 99/100
