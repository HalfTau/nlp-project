Truly a delightful piece of sandbox/open world game, such a shame that its content was limited by the times disc space but it still holds up to this date, the gameplay on foot and on vehicle is incredibly well done, maybe not the best constructed story but it sure has a lot of charm to it, all the characters have their unique personalities which evolve through the game, it has really fun mechanics, vehicles and weapons, the mayority of glitches only happen if you want to trigger them, it exemplifies the 90s almost perfectly, has a lot of playtime even if you dont want to get to 100 game completion, the map is MASSIVE 3 cities, rural areas and desert, and most important of all, it gives you complete freedom to do almost anything.Would Recommend 9/10 Cult Game.
