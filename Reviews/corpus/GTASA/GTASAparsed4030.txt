Pretty horrific graphics when you look back on it now, but this was the most fun Ive had playing GTA. The newer games are fun, but this was a huge time sink for me. I go back to it every 34 years and my friends dont hear from me, my parents think Ive joined a cult and my employer has sacked and replaced me. This game is ruin your life good.
