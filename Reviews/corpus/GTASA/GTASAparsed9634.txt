7/10. Its a lot better than IV, its basically still your GTA game at heart, but they added more basis on the character freedom. Its miles ahead of 4, but like 4 it falls flat on its face with the pc port. And sadly, it does an even worse job of it. Besides needing a large amount of work to get even the mouse to work, let alone widescreen resolution, the game does the worst job with flying Ive ever seen. Imagine toggling the throttle with W and S, while tilting the plane/helicopter/jet with the arrow keys, while using the mouse to turn the camera and shoot. Sound awkward yet? Try flying 90mph between hills while using all three at once. For a game made with people who have three hands a small audience, I agree the game does have a few fun moments. But dont expect to be able to get far into the story with the broken controls. Its worth a look if youre a fan, but get this on a console if possible.
