GTA San Andreas is my most FAVORITE GTA game in the series. This is the most open environment GTA game ever, there is so much to explore and many easter eggs to find. San Andreas is based on California and Nevada, it features Los Angeles,San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Youll see everything from small towns,cities,mountains, and even Area 51. This GTA game has the most customization out of all of the games. You can give CJ a haircut,some tattoos,a variety of clothes including miscs, and pimp out your car. This was the first GTA game that allowed you to swim and climb up buildings and it even had some RPG elements to it. What ever you do your stats will increase, the more you use a gun the stats will increase and driving vehicle,swimming,etc. GTA SA follows Carl Johnson C.J. returning to Los Santos after spending five years living in Liberty City when his brother Sean Sweet Johnson calls to inform him of their mothers murder. Carl returns to his former home on Grove Street and reunites with Sweet as well as fellow members of his old gang Ryder and Big Smoke. Working with the others to reestablish the GSF, Carl gradually restores the gang to power, driving off the rival Ballas and Vagos gangs.
