I would definately recommend this for the retail a.k.a CD version.. BUT THIS! Rockstar why did you update not really up more like downgrade a game thats 10 years old and mess it up.. Songs have been taken out , the game crashes after 10 minute of playing , savegames no longer works with the new version.. Ripoff .. not a real game . I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS ON STEAM! DONT DO IT! Buy the cd versoin instead  its still the same as the game used to be.
