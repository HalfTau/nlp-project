I really like this game. Theres so much stuff to do and even still Im discovering new things. The main story and the characters are well written according to traditional standards.Ive seen people complain that its sort of unforgiving since you have to redo the whole mission if you die, but if youre having lots of trouble, try doing some side activities. Along with some rewards, you learn the geography of the city which at least makes me feel a lot more attached to the virtual location.There are also lots of cars and weapons to drive aroung and the RPG stats. At first I felt like they didnt change much, but I can definitely feel a difference between the max driving and minimal driving skill.The game is locked to 25fps. You can turn off the frame limiter in the options, but because parts of the game use the framerate to time the scripts that make the game function, things go either slowmo or too fast. Vice City has similar problems, but as an example the fountains in the game emit more particles when the framelimiter is turned off, which seems to indicate that the timing on the emitter is using the framerate instead of x per second/minute or other measures.It does have gamepad support. If you want to play with the mouse and keyboard, there might be issues with the mouse suddenly not working. This can be fixed by downloading a file called DINPUT8.DLL and putting it in your San Andreas folder where the .exe is.You may also come across a bug where the game crashes instantly after an explosion happens. This can be fixed by running the game in Windows XP Service Pack 3 compatibility mode.
