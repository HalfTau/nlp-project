Hands down, the BEST Grand Theft Auto game I have played. The ability to modify most of the ingame cars, and buying property, while at the same time allowing you to customize your character to your liking, will give the best experience for any RPG player. Sure, some things may have been cut from the game with the recent update, but still, you can play all the other incredible features that still are present. While the story line may have lesser heists than the current GTA V boasts, the missions will give you quite the run for your money. There is no multiplayer function, though some other websites may provide the ability to do so. The map is large, allowing for a lot of free roam after the main storyline is complete. The continents however, will only be unlocked after several missions into the game. Overall, this is a near perfect game for any solo players that enjoy RPGs. I highly recommend this game to everybody. Hope this review was useful.
