Hi and welcome to a honest Review.I first played this Game when i was 8 on the Ps2 and it was great. Years later i bought it on the Steam Sale for 3,50 Eur, in 2017.The Story is great, the World is very big and Controlls are good. Theres even tuning. People interact with u depending on your Car or Clothes and u can go to train and learn other Fighting Styles. This Game is from 2005 so pretty much anything can run it. I really like the Game, but here is why i cant recommend it in this State on Steam anymore.The Version u get from Steam is the Worst u can get. Soundtracks got removed, a lot of Bugs that are patched in other Versions of the Game are in again and it doesnt even work properly. When startet, u will be thought that at least Dx9 is required, so u will have to activate Legacy Components in Windows. There are Guides with People that are glad to help to restore the Game to its best Version, wich was a big amount of Trouble for me. Do only buy this Game if u want to Downgrade it. Otherwise crack it or use your old Cd Version if u have one. Its really a Shame how Roclstar has left this Game.
