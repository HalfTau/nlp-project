This is possibly my favorite game ever, if not its in the top 5 easily. This game has so much variety, from races to shooting missions to stealth missions. I have probably completed this game 6 or 7 times which for me in very unusual, there is an active modding community online which adds much more to the game if the vanilla experience isnt enough for you. Everyone should complete this game at least once in my opinion, there arent enough games like this.
