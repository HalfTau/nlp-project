I have always loved this game and have been playing it since I was in middle school I am a fourth year college student, however I was greatly disappointed with how it plays.  Im not sure if it is through Steam or just because of PC, but the mouse does not work with the game, which makes steering and movement with the camera very difficult.  Even using controllers with the game didnt help the gameplay.  While I would strongly recommend this game, I do not recommend it being purchased through Steam.
