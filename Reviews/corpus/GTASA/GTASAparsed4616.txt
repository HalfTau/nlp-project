Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a very good open world game. But current generation computers cannot handle this game too well, might sound weird to some people. But with newer computers there are so many bugs its almost unplayable. But a few tweaks later it can easily be fixed. When it comes to the gameplay itself, it has a good story but like I said current generation games are just so much better so it ruins the game, but its an awesome classic game you should for sure try out! 6.5/10
