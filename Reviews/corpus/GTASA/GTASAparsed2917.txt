Carl Jhonson is still my hero in the GTA franchise. Its always great to run the game and just hear the original theme song.... Only reason why I bought it. San Andreas is still an amazing addition to the series, would recommend playing all the GTAs if you are wanting to get into it. First GTA to allow swimming, first to allow body mass gain, and sex appeal. Fking Geniusies.
