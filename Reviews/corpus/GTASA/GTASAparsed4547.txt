I just started playing GTA games in the past two years. I played the GTA games in order of their release date, going from GTA III to GTA V. I must say, even with all of the pros for GTA V, GTA San Andreas is much better than GTA V. Yes, the graphics are outdated, and yes, the map size is commparativly small, but I still find myself going back to play San Andreas just to free roam much more than V.Furthermore, the only GTA game that has a better story mode than San Andreas is GTA IV. For those of you wondering GTA V has a commparativly horrible story mode. For instance, whe I had to kill Big Smoke, I had a lot of internal conflict. I didnt want to kill him, but he was an , so when I had to kill him, I almost couldnt bring myself to do it. There are many instances where this type of confict or something similar occurs, making this games storyline one of the best GTA storyline son existance.No, Im not a nostalgic filled GTA San Andreas fan and no, I do not think GTA V is the best GTA game in existance. On the chance that I am starting to sound like Sammyclassicsonicfan, play some of the classic GTA games, including IV, and then reconsider your opinion on both San Andreas AND V.
