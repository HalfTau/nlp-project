This game is my 2nd favorite GTA, right below GTA V which in my opinion is the series best game.The game has so much to do from just going on crazy rampages to gambling at the casino, its kind of crazy.GTA San Andreas can run on pretty much anything. Its capped at 25 I think... FPS but you can uncap it in the options section.Graphics are nice for the time, as well. Has quite a good selection of options, you can make your draw distance pretty far or close, which is nice because I used to run this game on a total crappy laptop. Plenty of more options.The story is pretty cliche but good, basically, CJ is the main character and his mother was murdered. He came back to Los Santos to find who killed her. I wont say anything else because I want you to play through the game yourself, but you can watch a playthrough on YouTube if you want to know more.Game is simply awesome.Radio stations are nice, I like the Reggae station the most but Los Santos Radio or whatever the rap one is called is great too.Overall, its a great game and I highly recommend it.
