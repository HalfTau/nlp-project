This game is pretty boring. Not what you would expect from a Gta game. Car physics suck, especially when u flip ur car over and it blows up for no reason failed so many missions because of that crap, and the flying controls are god awful for PC.The game is fun for the first part, but starts to get really boring and repetative when you reach the angel pine missions Catalina. From then on, the game is not worth playing. The killing sprees arent as good, the gang shoot outs when invading ballas territory, is... ok but defending is repetative and boring.My advice is, buy the game when its on sale, speed past the first part when you finish sweets and big smokes mission dont bother with Ryder, and then get a refund. But make sure you only have 2 hours in the game, so you can get the refund. smh.Maccers humour saves the game a bit.But the game goes down hill, when you have to follow the croupier. So disgusting
