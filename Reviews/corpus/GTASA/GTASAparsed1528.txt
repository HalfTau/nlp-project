GTA San Andreas for people who want to play GTA V but have a toaster as a computerBut for real, this game is one of the best ever made. The story is gripping, the characters are all unique and great in their own ways, the environment is astounding for a game its age. This game also brings back many memories as to when I played this game when I was only 8 years old. Yes, I played GTA when I was 8. No my parents did not know about this but hey, Im a normal person now, video game violence has nothing to do with real life violence. Just sayin.10/10
