Fantastic game and still holds up today. Huge map, lots of things to do. Wacky characters and more pop culture references you can shake a stick at.My only problem with this particular release is that Rockstar have done nothing to modernise the game and simply rereleased the PC port from over 10 years ago. Make sure you lock the framerate, and take time out to properly bind controls as this game was a preXInput release. Mouse controls are a bit janky as theres no lockon mechanism and the mouse seems to have steps when aiming making it much harder than the controller. A few more options to prevent the model and texture popin would have been nice too.
