I Hate The Memes And The Community Of This Game. But This Game Is AMAZING One of the best games ever made. Well At least in my opinion. The Steam Version is kind of broken. So You Have To Down Grade The Game. Then You Can Download Mods And Fix The game. / The Steam version is very bad but not when you Down Grade And Get Mods For It, I recommended getting this game on PS2, PS4 And Orginal Xbox If You Dont Want To Deal With Downloading Mods And Stuff. My Score Rating 10/10 Must Own. Story Is Great, Gameplay Is Great, Rpg Elements Is Great, Map Is Great, And Etc. Not Going To Talk About Anything Else Because That Would Take To Long. I Got A Game To Play Damnit!
