What can I say about this game? One of my first GTA... and one of my favorites. I will always love this game. Great story and a very large world in 2005 it was cool and a lot of opportunities and freedom of action. Lots of interesting and not missions, as well as many other interesting places. I could continue to describe this game... but better to play it and rate it. Thank you RockStar for this wonderful game.
