I would definitely recommend this game. For something that came out in 2005, its still a really good game. The story is good, and it actually has people still playing the game daily  especially with the multiplayer mods roaming around. The roleplay servers on the mods are about the only ones you can go to if you want to play a RP set in the 21st century.So yes, I recommend it. Its a really nice game. If you get bored with the singleplayer, install SAMP or something. You hopefully wont regret it.
