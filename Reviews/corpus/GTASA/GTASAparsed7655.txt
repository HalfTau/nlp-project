San Andreas is one of my alltime favorite games, and for very good reason. Its a fantastic entry to the series, with enough content to keep you occupied for weeks. Thats not even including the highly populated and still, very much alive multiplayer mod SAMP and the plethora of other mods you can obtain for this amazing game.However, since Rockstar is so hellbent on ruining the PC users experience, I cant recommend the Steam release of this game. The latest patch has removed a number 18, to be specific of key songs from the once fantastic soundtrack. There is still no 1080p support. Previous save files will no longer work and you will more than likely crash if you are playing this game with a dualmonitor set up. Although despite these downgrades, at least they were kind enough to implement very basic Xinput support, so you can play it with a controller. Woo.Rockstar has all the right to do this. The removal of once available songs makes sense due to copyright reasons. You cant exactly sell your product when it contains content you no longer have the license to use, let alone monetize. But when the game is deliberately patched to take away content that users have already paid for, and to hinder the experience once again, youre just hurting your PC fanbase. Which, I suppose is nothing new if youve played any PC release of Grand Theft Auto postGTA3.The best way to enjoy this game is to purchase a retail copy. Itll probably be cheaper, itll look good on your shelf, you can mod it by default all you want, and you wont have any of your content patched out without warning. With that said. Dont bother buying any other GTA games on Steam either. If theyve already removed content in one title, then expect it again in the future from other installments of the franchise when licenses inevitably expire, or can no longer be obtained.TLDR Great game but ruined by Rockstars anticonsumer attitude. Go buy it elsewhere for the full experience.
