GTA.          ,          .The game was released August 20, 2004. Until now, this game is interesting to many people because of its graphics, gameplay pleases many. We can argue that GTA San Andreas is already old, but she still let all the new additions, fashion, programs, cheats. Specifically for this version of GTA were vypuschiny two different online client naturally from thirdparty developers. Online this game is huge it can be played on the DM servers and build their real life. Very much like Clint sump. What can you say about the world included in GTA San Andreas?  I can only say one thing, he is not big but not small. For us, there are three mediumsized cities, more than 10 villages.I commend this part of the game in its development capabilities, you can buy a house of which more than 20, you can tune almost all the traffic is present in the game. You can dress your character from more than 100 different clothes. Nakochat can fill his belly or bigmakami. Can be Alphonse or meet with a girl.Work in the game is also present normal amount, starting with the police, firemen, ambulance, taxi, truck drivers. These works are the additional income the same as raced since finishing racing bicycles and penalties. You can razvist stamina your character izvuchit martial arts of the three species. Bleed skill weapons  which by the way the game is also a stable number.Mission of the game and of course a lot, but each one is unique and they are tightened. I can even say with certainty that this review will be useless and not fully open to opreleeniya this part of the GTA. But I just think that there is in the world of modern man, who at least once did not play this wonderful game.
