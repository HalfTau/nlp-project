This is the most nostalgiainducing game for me. Also one of the best games Ive ever played. Ive replayed this countless of times on the nonSteam version, and now on the Steam version.The most recent GTA SA update is quite disappointing because several songs were removed from the game due to license expiration. The update also made my game buggy mouse not working but can be easily fixed with a dll.10penny/10
