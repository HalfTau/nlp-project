Since the update, Im never playing this game EVER again. Very bad move Rockstar. They should have just removed the game off of steam and let existing license holders keep it in their library like they did with Vice City. I hope someone, somewhere has a petition to get this game removed from Steam now because its just an utter disgrace to the whole Grand Theft Auto series.
