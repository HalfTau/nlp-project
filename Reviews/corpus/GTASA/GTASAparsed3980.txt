I fondly remember playing this game behind closed doors and hiding it from my parents. The sprawling open world, taking over the city, all of the different cars to collect and store in the big four car garage in San Fiero if you played the game, you know, everything! It was fun revisiting the game and remembering the wonder I felt when I first played it. One of the great games of the 0009 decade.
