Once upon a time, this was fun PC port of a landmark console title.Then November 7, 2014 Black Friday came.Rockstar patched all the life out of the title, effectively replacing the PC version with a port of the mobile version. With that, even users who had purchased the game long ago are now stuck with an even poorer port of the game, fewer songs in the games soundtrack, and paltry graphics/resolution options.Rockstar has perfectly exploited and demonstrated all of the real and perceived flaws of a digital distribution platform. And they wonder why people might opt to pirate games still?
