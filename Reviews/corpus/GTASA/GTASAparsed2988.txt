I used to play GTA SA all the time back in the day on my friends PS2, and then again when I got it for my orginal Xbox. So for me, on top of everything great about this game, theres a little nostalgia mixed in as well. How does it stack up as a GTA game? Best ever. Why? Well compared to GTA 5, which is a great game by the way, it has many more detailed upgradesand even downgrades, like obesity for your charater to level up abd aesthtic customation is on par with games released today. It also has a variety of story and side missions that are also on par with GTA 5, and some honestly being a hell of a lot more fun and unique. It has a pretty big array of weapons to choose from, all with skill levels for each gun type. As for vehicles...for the time of realease it was impressive, now compared to newer titles it feels lackingno suprise here though. Along with the vehicles, the customization is there, but seems like a last minute thrown in feature that really is only worth it if youre trying to throw some cash away. The map feels still very big today, and with new areas opening as you progress through the story, it really feels ever exspansive at times. However, what really makes this game amazing, and one of Rockstars best works, is the story and progression, and the characters and their development. If you havent played this game youre in for a ride. How the charaters build of each others morals and decisions, really makes this story play out like a movie. And somehow makes you feel family with these gangster friends, and see that it really isnt all about drugs, money, and kills. I think the story is really the only factor that makes GTA SA better than GTA 5, that alone is saying a lot. GTA 5 is amazing the story is astounding and all in all I really have no issues with the game, I love it. However, once you play SA youll understand why it is usually hailed king, because its never a dull moment. Its a must own. So if you havent yet, try it out.
