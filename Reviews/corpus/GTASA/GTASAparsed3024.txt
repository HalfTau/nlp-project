This is a great game, the greatest of the series in my opinion. The game is Amazing even if the graphics are a little aged. The game has a huge map to traverse any way you wish, along with a good amount of weaponry to play with, a large number of cars that you can customize, and much more in this amazing, classic masterpiece.
