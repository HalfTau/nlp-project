The first time I played this game was on the Playstation 2, I found it to be a beautiful game. Having completed it multiple times and purchasing numerous times I can highly recomend this game to all open world gamers knowing that they will have an enjoyable experience. This game is much better than Grand Theft Auto V in my opinion and it is such a shame that Grand Theft Auto V did not implement the many aspects of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,  Hopefully one day a remaster of this game will be released.My Rating 10/10 This short review is for the PS2 version of the game, as I have only played the Steam version for a short amount of time.
