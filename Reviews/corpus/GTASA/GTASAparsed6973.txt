Hmm, depends what you mean by reccomend, as to what my answer would be.Firstly, I got this as a free D/L with GTA V preorder so, it was free. However, I had the nonsteam retail disk version a few years back, so thought it would be fun to relive the old days, before GTA V came out.The game is crappy now. It is poorly optimised, most of the songs I remember are gone, and the resolution is very low, even on its highest settings. I thought this was perculiar, as the resolution was great, when I first got the game in 2010/2011. Having done some research, I found out that R patched the game, to the point where it was essentially a port of the MOBILE game. This dissapointed me greatly.In conclusion, no, I dont reccomend this. If you got it free with GTA V, its okay, because its free. However, dont buy this on its own.Really, my honest opinion is, if you want to play this game, torrent it. This gives you the genuine experience of what the game was intended to be upon release. However, if you dont want to break the law, GTA V is my answer.
