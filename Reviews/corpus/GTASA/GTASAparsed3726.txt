So.... my thoughts on gta sa.Its a great gme for the time period it was made in.It had the best graphics in gaming history  Even gta V is worse Kappa. I have played it so much that i lost track of it  Played the disc version b4 buying it in steam. The only mission thats bugging me is the mission where you have to chase a private jet with a fing dodo, jet is a fast plane but a freaking dodo is as slow as a caddy. I tried searching for a savegame file what had already passsed this mission, but nooo, all the savegame files that i found didt work on my steam version.The story itself is great and all, but i wish the steam version would let me play SAMP and MTA.All i can say is ill give it a 9/10 for the minor bugs and cons..
