This PC port is the absolute worst. Whoever created this needs to pull their heads out of their rears. I can make a game on Microsoft Powerpoint that runs better than this. I got it free with the prepurchase of GTA V, but in no way shape or form is this worth the trouble. It runs flawlessly on ps2, but this is absolute garbage on PC. Save yourself the time and money and dont even buy it, unless its for ps2 or xbox.
