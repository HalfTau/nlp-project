This is a ground breaking release that I own on PS2 and PC. It increased the scale of the previous GTA games and introduced addictive RPG game mechanics into the series. Samuel L Jackson as officer Tenpenny is some of the best celeb casting in a video game ever. This is a game that precedes the dumbing down of AAA gaming, where the mass market was encouraged to enjoy a complex and sometimes difficult title.Sadly, I cant recommend the game in its current state. Rockstar has decided to gimp the soundtrack by removing several important songs that contributed to the atmosphere while roaming open world. This would be a hard sell even if they only did this to new customers, but in my case they have removed songs that were once in the game that I paid for. The situation is unacceptable. It underpins the ridiculousness of license agreements, when they make a title worse for all the paying customers, while leaving those who download the title illegaly with the experience as it was originally intended.
