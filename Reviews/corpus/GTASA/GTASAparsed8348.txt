Carl Johnson has returned to San Andreas, but it is a bit more buggy than he had remembered.Mirrors that exposed CJs jaw and made his jeans look transparent or when ever he enters some buildings half the road disappears and the fact that punching a hooker so hard that her breasts flew right   behind her neck.Whilst being chased by an officer, CJ climbed over a short fence, but the cop had such a hard time getting over the fence because he was still playing his running animation infront of the fence instead of climbing over it like a normal human being would do.Until then there has never been a mystrey as big as the CJs Mom murder in GTA SA.GOOD GAME PLAY IT.
