I got attracted by this game thanks to the fame of Grand theft Auto serie. I played it for a fair amount of time. Unfortunately I cannot suggest this game. The game offer many nice missions and a good gameplay but there are mission that are just too hard to pass and these missions are the ones that ruin the entire game, for instance there are few mission where you have to complete a car race, one of them, the one in the countryside is particularly hard, without cheat its pretty much impossible to pass, there are the missions of Zero that are useless and extremely difficult, you need to control game models but the controls are extremely difficult there is a mission that require you to learn to pilot an airplane, to properly control the plane you have to MASTER around 9 buttons, this is extremely frustratingOn the other side there are nice things. The music of this game is amazing. I liked the gang war and many other missions, but again, there are these few bad missions that ruin the entire game and they cannot be skipped.Its a real pity, the story is also interesting.
