A great game... when its not updated to be crap. I love this game to death, but after they removed all my favorite songs from the soundtrack, which is just a load of..Seriously, which asshat thought this was a good idea? I paid good money for this game, why are you taking it away from me? If anything, they should be ADDING things to this game...For the lazy Dont buy it the way it is, just get it... some other way. Seriously Rockstar.
