Greatest game of its time, so much fun and lots of stuff to do including, failing at your mission and raging because you have to restart from the beggining, lifting weights, running, more running, boxing, shooting, more shooting, more shooting, customizing your car, crying because you have 28 left, and dying and losing all your weapons. A fun game to rage at and break your computer.
