An utterly fantastic game. After a couple patches to get the right resolution and fix a rare colour issue, and you have one of the best gaming experiences yet. The driving feels great, gunplay is fun and dynamic, and RPG systems make the game even deeper. CJs voice actor is spot on, despite being heard the background of a phone call yelling at a NES and having no previous voice acting. CJ is completely customizable, but also requires some maintainence. You have to keep yourself fed and excercized to sprint longer and punch harder, but by the end of the game you are a complete badass.
