The game is a great classic gta. I personally love this game. Ive figured out how to install mods on steam but not cleo. Downgrading and working with the steam files is tough, Ive spent hours on research and file moving, downloads, etc. for this game. If anyone figures out on installing cleo without the game crashes half way through loading please contact my account. But this game is awesome
