So i bought the game, and it works for the first 2 times.Doesnt work ever since. Bad port glad i got it on the Holiday sale. Gameplay You get what you expect from a video game that was made for the early xBox and Ps2. Its textures arent great, but it works. Shaders could do a great deal to the quality of the game.If you enter a cutscene, you dont get a warning to skip it, you just jump straight to the gameplay. Thats a flaw on my part, considering im missing out on the plot, and not going to YouTube and looking at some guy playing until the next cutscene.spawned  a tank, cop tried to hijack it5/10 for ballsofsteel cops
