Could you top this series? Youre damn right you can, with another one! GTASA, in my opinion is one of my favorite ones on the PC platforms. This is literally the only place where you can shoot a hooker and steal a car with the chances of getting caught being slim to none. Though the graphics lack, which I feel Im being too demanding with, the storyline is real, playing along with the characters well. If you want a game thats squeaky clean, as in no violence, no explicit language, or sexual themes, then this entire series isnt for you! Good news? If you love a game that involves decisionmaking and running from the law, this will be your pick!
