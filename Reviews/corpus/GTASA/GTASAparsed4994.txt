Such a great game. It may not have multiplayer but its always fun with mods.  I can play it on the iest laptop I own  which has Intel Celeron because it needs low end specs which I love considering I dont have a gaming rig yet I use my brothers i3 laptop to play some modern games like League of Legends. I can do that with GTA III and Vice City. The story is good and that is why I love the franchise. The gameplay, the story, and of course mods. If you want to have fun with GTA mods, play this and older titles, its a lot of fun.
