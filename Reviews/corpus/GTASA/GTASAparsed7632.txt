Easily among my favorite games of all time. If you can get a PS2, original Xbox, or PC DVD version of this game, dont even hesitate to pick it up. However, due to a recent patch that introduced game breaking bugs and removed a bunch of iconic radio tracks from the game, I cannot recommend this version of the game at this time.
