If youre a fan of open world games, or just running over people and stealing their stuff, this is a great game for you.A single playthrough is about 40 hours or so depending on whether or not you like to do much exploring or not which you should.Personally I feel that the game has aged fairly well, maybe not graphically but then again it is a 10 year old game. Its also probably the most fully featured Grand Theft Auto game with GTA V coming closer to this then IV did. with player and vehicle customization being quite diverse and some light RPG elements such as gaining/losing weight, strength, running speed, stealth, and swimming abilities.Overall if you enjoy the Grand Theft Auto series, games like it, or just feel like youre a black man stuck in a white persons body, then you should very much enjoy visiting San Andreas, whether its your first time or coming back again.
