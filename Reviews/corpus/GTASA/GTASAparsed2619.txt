Many People keep saying this game is bad and the physics are bad, but for gods sake, PEOPLE, STOP COMPLAINING! THIS WAS A GAME FROM THE 90s! Its really comparable to slightly below standards for games published today, but, it was made in the 90s, so graphics were top notch then, and the gamelay was some of the best of the gta series.Rating 9/10Only problem CANT FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN or beat the lowrider challenge easily.
