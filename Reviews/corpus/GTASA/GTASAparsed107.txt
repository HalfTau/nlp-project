I recommend this game, however after watching a video before I progressed further into the steam version I downgraded to 1.0 version with some mods added to it so I could escape some problems I would possibly have in the future. Only buy it so you can have a legit copy you can both downgrade and mod with. Anyways, its an amazing game.
