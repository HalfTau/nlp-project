This game is simply put excellent. You play as Cj who returns to los santos after receiving the news of his mothers death only to be dragged into the gang life he once left. The whole atmosphere of this game feels like a 1990s rap music video. It captures 90s California perfectly. The music is excellent and covers vast variety of genres, its as good as vice citys soundtrack. The sound design in general in this game is solid for its age. The gameplay is vastly improved compared to its predecessors. With added rpg elements and improved combat. This game is one of the most ambitious games I have ever seen. The map is massive and varied with 3 individual cities within San Andreas which represent Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Its absolutely massive and feels bigger then its sequels and a lot of other open world games. The map is also filled with plenty of fun side quests and activities. Im surprised they even managed to get a game like this to run on a ps2. The campaign is great and extremely varied. Its still fun to this day to explore the world of San Andreas. If you are a fan of the GTA series or are looking to get into it this game is a great place to start.
