All you had to do, was follow the damn train, CJ!Big Smoke, GTA San AndreasIn the first 2 weeks, i racked up 35 hours. 2.5 hours a day, including a lot of missing homework in school. This game is possibly one of the greatest PS2 games i have ever played, and to play it today, around 79 years later, is astounding. GTA San Andreas is amazing, without any DLC to make it better. Is even better because there is no DLC so its a one time purchase with no other add ons. Ive heard of mods for this game, however i think to myself, is that necessary? to get things to make the experience better? No. No it is not necessary, so do yourself a pleasure, and buy this game, as there is at least a weeks worth of gameplay to it, and there is enough things/ side activites that you can do if you get bored. Buy this Game, and all will be revealed as to how god tier it is.Btw, ive recently read that people are salty about gta 5 and they are taking it out on this game. GTASA was not published by Two Take or the other one. Made and published by Rockstar, and this game still has modding capabilities, but i cant mod this game for and its not an online game so yeh
