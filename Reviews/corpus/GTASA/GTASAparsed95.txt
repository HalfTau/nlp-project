Good game, terrible port. Has too many issues, i.e. my gamepad doesnt work properly and the game crashes randomly. Yes, I stopped TabletInputService so my game stopped crashing at gameplay already but still crashes at loading moments. Not recommended to buy, Id download it ilegally due to the issues before mentioned.
