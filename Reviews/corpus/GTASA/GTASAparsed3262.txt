A truly grand masterpiece. I remember the days when me and my brother used to sit in our shared bedroom, taking turns playing this game on our old PS2 though, usually, I would just watch him play it. So, then, roughly nine to ten years after I did this originally, here I am, with my own copy of the game now thanks to a friend of mine, thanks if youre reading this, for a nostalgia trip.And its just like I remember it.Fun as hell, funny as hell, and, chances are, itll decrease my grades.This game was one of the first thirdperson Grand Theft Auto titles, and you think itd show, but Id say that if the graphics are set to very high, this looks somewhat better than a new release, though that may be my nostalgia blinding me. And, the best part yet, it doesnt have over half of its story locked behind multiplayer. Im looking at you, GTA V.On the topic of multiplayer, be honest. How many people play MultiTheft Auto, or SAMP, or something along those lines? Dont be shy to admit it, because everyone does. Statistics show that, in fact, over a million people take part in San Andreas multiplayer shenanigans per month. Thats nothing compared to its big, slightly more braindamaged brother, but its still amazing.Overall, this game was great to play again, especially when my brain could function and I got most of the jokes.I give this game a number nine large out of a number six with extra dip.10/10
