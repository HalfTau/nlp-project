If I was allowed this as a kid, I would have said something like, Game of my childhood or PS2 memories relieved or maybe even I literally coughed up a lung when I saw this on steam. but I didnt get this game as a kid, but that void was filled with Simpsons Hit  Run. But now that Ive played it 10 years later, Im a bit late with my conversations about it that should have happened in the playground at primary school and not in high school. But as a game it is an amazing experience only a few things bother me, like the way you are thrown from your bike when you hit a lamp post, the way the characters mouths down move doesnt bother as much because it was made in 04 and the lack of a Steam Workshop. Great game. 10/10. Best substitute for GTA V on PC.
