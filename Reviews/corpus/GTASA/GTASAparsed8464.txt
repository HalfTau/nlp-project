7080 hours of content, took me 5 years to beat playing off and on. Its a great game, my only real complaint is the lack of a postgame. The ending was satisfying, but it didnt have a postgame like Vice City did!Alot of people said this game was hard and nearly impossible to clear without hceat codes, but I didnt use a single cheat code to complete it. It was very underwhelming in terms of difficulty but still enjoyable. I suggest playing with a gamepad like I did.
