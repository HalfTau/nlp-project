The funnest of the series 3 GTAs i.e. GTA III, GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas. Vice City remains my favorite for purely nostalgic reasons. This remains the funnest one. At times challenging, as this franchise can be but the hard work it has you go through genuinely makes you a better, and more skilled player. Playing this is almost a rightofpassage to calling yourself a gamer. Instant classic.
