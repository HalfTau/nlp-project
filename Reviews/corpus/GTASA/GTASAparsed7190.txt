 Rockstar. First they released an update for the game which removed a lot of really good songs from the games radio stations, so the selection of music you have the option to listen to in the game is very limited now compared to what it once was. They also ed up and made modding the game a major pain in the And then they released an update which corrupted all of the save files. I completed 21 missions of the campaign, and when I loaded my game again, I had to start from mission 1, the very beginning. Son of a  man. Ive said it before and Ill say it again, you a straight buster Rockstar
