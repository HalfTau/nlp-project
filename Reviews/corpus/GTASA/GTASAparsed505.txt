Brilliant, but I recommend downgrading and adding some of the bug fix mods like SilentPatch.I finished the game in 28 hours of gameplay, and loved it the whole time. None of the missions were too difficult, but at the same time were difficult enough to provide a challenge.I would seriously recommend picking up this game escpecially when it goes on sale for only 3.49.
