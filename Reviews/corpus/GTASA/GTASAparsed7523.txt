This game used to be one of my favorite games ever. I have bought it multiple times in fact. Rock Star has now ruined this game with the recent patch which completely breaks the game in every way. Only low resolution options now, missing music tracks, mouse driven vehicles by default, the list goes on. Just save your money and buy a box copy if you still can. This version isnt worth your time.
