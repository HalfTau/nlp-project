I bought this game recently. Ive been a fan of the gta franchise, and decided to take a chance and buy san andreas. I regreted it almost instantly. The camera makes it hard to see, and the graphics and pretty bad. If you want a game like this that is actually good I would recomend mafia II. I couldnt even get past the first mission it was to confusing. 4/10 would not play again.
