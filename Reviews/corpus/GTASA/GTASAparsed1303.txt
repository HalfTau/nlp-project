Grove Street. Home. At least it was before I ed everything up.Well, guess whos back? Carl Johnson!1992, Los Santos.After the death of his mother, Carl Johnson CJ, returns home after leaving the drugridden, gang warrampant life of San Andreas. Shortly after arrival, he is apprehended by a group of corrupt cops who frame him for a murder, slander his name even further, and send him on a warpath of revenge, betrayal, and a true test of being a family man.This game is awesome. GTA V cant even hold a candle to how amazing this game is. I first got the chance to play this game when I was about 12 years old, and it definitely changed my views on the gaming industry, as I easily played over 2000 hours of this game growing up before GTA IV came around. This game is fantastic.Pros Characters, motives, freemode mechanics, flying, driving, boating, biking, offmission jobs, car modding, car importing, gambling, girlfriends, clothing, eating, exercising, racing, triathlons, vehicle schools, music, courier jobs, mayhem, murder you get the idea. If you name it, this game has got it. Every one of these is perfect in arguably every way. Additionally, being a 13 year old game this October, its graphics still hold up pretty well.Cons None!10/10 game without a question. Hours of fun things to do, great amount of playtime and if you get bored with missions going on a rampage is always a blast!Have fun!
