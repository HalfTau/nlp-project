yes this version has some problems and cut out some of the music but it is by no means unplayeble, or at least in my experience. If you still have an origional XBOX or PS2 at home youre better off buying it on those consoles unless you want to mod it, but if you havent this version will do just fine. in my opinion this still is the best GTA and the best 6th generation game out there and maybe even the best game ever or at the very least a very close second. If you want the PC version before the patch and with all the music DONT get it on steam. there are plenty of copies out there and you can probably get V2.0 or even lower which is better if you want to mod it for less money than the steam version.
