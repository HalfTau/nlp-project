GTA San Andreas was an awsome game but the new update ruined it!It used to work fine but now when i try to enter the game it crashes and I have no idea why.They also removed 17 songs and one of the things I loved about SA was driving my car and enjoying the music.I hope Rockstar Games will realise what a terrible mistake theyve done and they will fix it ,although I doubt it.
