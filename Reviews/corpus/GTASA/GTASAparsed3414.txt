I remember 7 year old me walking into a dingy computer room. A washed out sign read above the doorway GameZone, if I recall correctly. It was a tight 6x6 space, a dimming light above several desks, there were maybe 6 or 7 computers. Cigarette smoke rising in the air, flattened coke cans on the floor. Smelly teens with a face full of pimples and grease in their hair, children of all ages, gathered all around the fat CRT monitors, playing,and then there was....For 0.50 and hour you could have this game all to yourself. And we didnt even do the missions! We just rode around on motorcycles, sped up in cars and had massive shootouts with the police. And the cheats... Oh, all the glorious cheats! Everyone knew them HESOYAM, OHDUDE, BUFFMEUP, UZUMYMW... A single kid paid the price, but 10 kids played the game together in harmony. Sharing cheats and showing off hacks and tricks.
