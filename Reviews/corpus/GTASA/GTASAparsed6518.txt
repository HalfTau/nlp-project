Ignore my Steam playtime, Ive been playing this game since almost day one on the PS2 and Original XBox and its the best Grand Theft Auto and one of the best games ever.The graphics are dated but when you remember its from 2004 and the PS2 and realize all thats going on screen it, from its rime, it can still hold up.  The game is huge as well giving you the entire stae of San Andreas to explore, which is the biggest map in Grand Theft Auto history if I remember right.  Gameplay is similar to other games in the series though its the most refined in my opinion.Just be warned the game is somewhat buggy on PC and modern systems though its by no means unplayable.Oh, and keep looking for Bigfoot.  I BELIEVE!
