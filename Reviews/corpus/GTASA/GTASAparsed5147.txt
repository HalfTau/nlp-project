I really wanted to play this game. But i had to refund if due to the controlles and sometimes the mouse wont even work. I tried connecting my controller but it didnt work. Please reply if you have a fix to this problem though. In otherwords if you can handle the controlls or have a compatible controller buy the game, if you dont then id say wait until there is a fix.
