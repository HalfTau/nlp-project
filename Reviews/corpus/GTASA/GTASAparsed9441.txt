What can I say about this game? Well this is my favorite Grand Theft Auto title, I owned this game on Original Xbox, PS2, Xbox 360 and PC.  Yep.. I love it so much. On PC you can even play this game online, I spent over 100 hours on roleplay server, have amazing memories of this game, regular edition and with mods on PC, if you do not own this game yet I have to ask WHY??? The atmosphere is interesting, the storyline is interesting apart from few bits I did not like a whole lot, the freedom this game offers is great as well. I replayed the story most likely 3 times, enjoyed it every time Maybe I am bit crazy when it comes to San AndreasPS. I will admit that I am a Rockstar fanboy so my opinion on their game is a bit biased but in all honesty only game Rockstar made that I played almost all of them played that I did not enjoy is Vice City Stories, simply didnt get into the story as I got tired of my PS2 days so never finished it.  Not saying it was bad, would like to see it on PC but whatever.To finish the review I will state something, GET GTA SAN ANDREAS, play trough it, either downgrade then steam version or back it up and play SAMP. If you did not enjoy San Andreas as much as me please let me know why.
