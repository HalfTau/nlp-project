Pretty good trip down memory lane if you buy it on sale or in a bundle for those who played it in the past. Solid soundtrack with the possibility to add your own. Great story except Badlands. Visuals feel a bit dated but what do you expect from a game this old? If you dont feel any nostalgia towards this game I dont recommend it though. Especially if youve played the more recent titles. The gameplay is very stiff and the steam build is very unstable. Lots of frustrating crashes and mini games that are very laggy lowriders for example, If you really want to get into this game I would recommend watching a couple of speedruns of the game before they show a lot of the game without the spoilers.
