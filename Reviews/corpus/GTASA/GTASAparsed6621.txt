First i just wanna say thisFOR FFS GUYS STOP GIVING THIS GAME NOT RECOMENDED BECAUSE OF ROCKSTARS NEW PATCH THAT SCREWS UP SAVEGAMES,REMOVES 18 SONGS AND RESOLUTION OPTIONS YOU CAN JUST DOWNGRADE TO PATCH 1.0ok now lets talk about the gameStoryCarl Johnson CJ left Los Santos and traveled to Liberty City, 5 years later Carls brother Sean Johnson Sweet calls him to tell him to come home after their mother was killed in a driveby shooting. When Carl arrives he is then greeted by 2 police officers known by the names of Frank Tenpenny And Eddie Pulaski.thats all i will say about thembut Carl realizes that thier gang Grove Street has fallen apart since he left cos the other gang Ballas have taken it all, and i mean they pretty much have nothing.So now its up to Carl and his friends to take back Los Santos!!!!!!!! !So the story might seem a bit boring or just not interesting but thats because i dont want to spoil it for you PresentationThis game looks pretty damn good but ive seen better looking games from 2004 or 2005 such as, Metal Gear Solid 3,uhhh other games? i cant really think of any games from that time,but the lighting is nice the models are nice aswell but some textures are just terrible just look at the weapons. But maybe that has to do with the game being and openworld sandbox and to have insane graphics at that environment would just be too much for the game?The only thing i really HATE about the graphics are the effing shadows they are just so bright it makes no sense at all.GameplayThis gameplay is absouletly awesome and its a Huge improvement over Vice City you can now crouch and walk with a weapon, aim by right clicking, Svim, ride bicycles, fly jets, parachute, date girls, f the girls you just dated, hit people with , be black,aim your gun sideways, dual weild, respond to people dissing you or greeting you, say the n word,learn new fighting moves, work out to increase your stamina, workout to increase your strength, be hungry, puke,gain weight, loose weight AND SO MUCH MORE.what im trying to say is this game is filled with stuff to do and it plays nice and smooth no delay when turning like in Vice City and its just great funFinal Thoughtsi have to say the map for San Andreas is just Awesome i love Los SantosLos Angelas I love San FierroSan Francisco I love the country parts of both places, love the desert of Nevada, I love Las VenturasLas Vegas.Also Carl Johnson is just the funniest coolest character ever just listen to these qoutesInfact all the characters are awesome they are just well made.In Conclusionthis game here is just amazing in every single way possiblethe soundtrack is awesome fitting and catchythe gameplay is smooth fun and responsivethe story is great and deep sort of deepnot reallythe game looks really goodit hasnt  dated at all in gamepalyGET IT NOWWWWWWWWWWi rate it 10/10 i think this game is just perferct i have nothing bad to say about it apart from the presentationbut i do recomend you downgrade to version 1.0 to have all the songs back and stuffand then i recomend to get silents patch and asi loader, and widescreen fixyou can get it all hereOh yeah there is also multiplayer its a mod its called san andreas multiplayer or SAMPand also 10/1010/1010/1010/10
