Best game ever made and that is a fact, not a statement. Not really in terms of story or gameplay, both are okay, but the little things that can happen at any point. Ive played this game ever since it first came out, and Im still finding things that make me laugh to tears.The PC version isnt a flawless port, but the ability to use mods is a nice plus. Also, the ability to create your own radio station is cool too.I know that it might seem as if it has little to offer in comparison to the newer games, but San Andreas is made for all time.
