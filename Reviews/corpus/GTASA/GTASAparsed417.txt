After many attempts of beating this game, it always managed to corrupt my save game files. The PC port to this game does not do the actual game any justice however as far as gameplay goes it could be said to be the best entry in the GTA universe. I recommend PC users backup their game files regularly or you might be in for a sorry surprise. This was an amazing story and stayed entertaining all the way through and through.
