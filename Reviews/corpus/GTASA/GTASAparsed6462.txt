I love this game. Esspecially with all of the mods. I know that people say that the graphics are worse on PC, but for me it is a different art style. Personally, I think that these graphics make the game superbly gorgeous and great to look at with the help of the 60 FPS. Everybody knows how good the gameplay of a GTA game is, so I wont dive into that.
