THE GREATEST GRAND THEFT AUTO GAME OF ALL TIME. HANDS DOWN.The first game in the franchise that i played, and the best too. Best map, best story, best characters, best weapons, most variety other than GTA micro transaction Online, best soundtrack, best side missions, and best overall atmosphere of any GTA game to date. I would pay big money for a sequel to this materpiece!10/10 would buy 2 number nines, a number nine large. A number six with extra dip. A number seven. Two number fortyfives, one with cheese, and a large soda again.
