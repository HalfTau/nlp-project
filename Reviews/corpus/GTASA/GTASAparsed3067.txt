Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a Phenominal Game that came out in 2004 for PS2 and in 2005 for PC and Xbox. It added so much to the series including a huge map with 3 Big Cities, Countryside and Dessert, A massive selction of clothing to customize the main character, there are casinos which are usable, there are many side races to finish, you can customize a host of diffrent vehicles. Unlike the previous games Rockstar Games had added RPG elements that effect the overall build of the main character making it possible to make him strong, fat, skinny, overwieght and other inbertween sizes and this feature still has yet to return as it was only in this game. You can now fly planes from a simple stunt plane to a airliner and afew more boats have been added. There are many side activities to do which reward you greatly like, Vigilante, Firefighter, Ambulance and afew others. And it has a great story tho Vice City may be better its stil pretty good.Five years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas... a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption. Where film stars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers. Now, its the early 90s. Carls got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streetsIf i have one thing negative about this game it would have to be this version o the game, The Steam Version doesnt have mod support and many songs have been taken out for copyright reasons. Some PCs the game may not work on aswell, Either way its still a fantastic game to pick up and if your able to get past the graphics its a fun game.
