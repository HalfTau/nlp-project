At the time of writing I have beaten this game twice and am on my way towards 100 completion. I played it in two styles, my first play through involved steamrolling through the main story until I beat the game and the other beating a mission here and there and when I get bored of it doing some extra activities whether it be side missions or self imposed challenges.I can safely say that the second way of playing is a far better way to go about it, as it spaces out some of what can be considered filler which is put in the game e.g. flight school, accumulating money etc and makes it far more enjoyable.Playing it the first way is not fun, you will become frustrated and by the end feel you wasted your time as the more difficult and unfair missions and the lack of reward at the end will annoy you to no end.Just wanted to put this up here not so much as a review but as a warning that in order to enjoy this caution should be taken to the approach used in beating it as I made the mistake of being fatigued by the end of my first play through but through giving it a second chance it has been much more enjoyable.
