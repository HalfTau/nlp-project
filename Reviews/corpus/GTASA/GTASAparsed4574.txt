GTA San Andreas.. A game that opened up a lot of enjoyable and memorable moments. I remember being by the coast and a blonde woman in roller skates flying past me saying Im so thick that I canquot, I cried away at this for quite a while and never forgot it. This game exposed what was supposed to be the life of a drug dealer and the struggles that came for Carl Johnson. Playing this on the PS2 was great simply because I would have one of my friends play with me, the coop was a great idea which I loved after playing this alone which would get pretty boring. The missions were very fun and exciting moments of rage were present very frequently when I failed.
