I may not have much time played on the pc, but i played alot of this game on ps2 when it came out. This is the best gta. I know alot of people have had problems with the game through steam, i have not had any of these problems. Im running windows 8, which is the main reason im writing this. So people know it does work on windows 8 for me without any problems. I would advise researching what others with windows 8 have to say to see if anyone else has had problems. The main downside for me is the pc controls are not very good for instance riding a bike you have to spam w to move fast which makes turning very frustrating. The first mission i failed a bunch of times because i couldnt get the hang of the bike. Would recommend using a program to bind keys to a controller to make things easier if you have that option. I love the story of this game its a little over the top but thats what makes it so great. GTA 4 went with a more realistic story which was great, but it just didnt leave the impression on me this game did. Still think its one of the best games ever made and in my opion the best game of its generation. If you havent played this game i would say its a must for any gamer.
