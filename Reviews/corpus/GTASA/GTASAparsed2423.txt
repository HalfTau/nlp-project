Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is one of my favorite games. But the only way I was able to properly enjoy it was through mods. I started to play the game a few years ago and stopped soon after, I found the mechanics of the game outdated and drivebys a really big problem. Not to mention that there was some scaling problems which hindered the experience.A few years after I stopped playing it, I saw it in my steam library, and then I decided to look through the guides of the game. I recently came off modding Skyrim and wanted another game that I could play for hundreds of hours. I heard that this game had a pretty good modding scene. So I installed the game and began to mod. Soon after, I realized that many of my little problems, could be fixed by modding. Then I marathoned the game, and loved it.People have mentioned that to properly enjoy Goldeneye, you have to mod it for keyboard and mouse. But after that it  becomes a very competent game. I can say that Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was way ahead of its time in so many aspects, but some of the factors that way it down, can be fixed with mods.Verdict Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a classic, but in order to get the most out of it, you have to mod it.
