Thanks Rockstar for continually ruining what was once great content.Shame on you. Shame on you all.Between this, the horrid destruction of GTA IVs modding ability its GFWL its Rockstar club and x64 playablity, and now the sad state of their tripple dipping on GTAV Ive lost all faith in Rockstar to put out a quality product.
