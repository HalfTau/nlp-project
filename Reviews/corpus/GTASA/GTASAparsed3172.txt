Hey, You! You! Me? YES YOU! Have you been looking for a game to make the game of the 21st Century? Um, Yes! I almost got shot by Bob the Builder looking for one of those kinds of games! Well, Look no further! A low, low price of 7, for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas! I thought it was called GTA 5. Yea, but im to lazy to go get another steam card, so just stick with this game. Its just GTA 5 with bad graphics and a bigger map. but graphics dont matter when you have a Minigun to shoot people with Which this game includes! Wowie, My search across the Galaxy is over! I better call Gabe Newell!
