Take Two killed OpenIV mod because apparently modding a game somehow violates their rights.I cannot in good conscience recommend any Take Two Owners of Rockstar Games and 2k Games published games to anybody.I hope losing customers was worth what ever you gained from destroying a mod and threatening the makers with legal action.
