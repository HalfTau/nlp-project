I always had an awesome time playing San Andreas on Xbox. IMO, its the best GTA title overall so far You really cant go wrong here. Theres just so much to explore and discover, plus San Andreas possesses personality unmatchable compared to many freeroaming, sandboxtype games. Im looking very foward to visiting this chaotic world once again, especially on PC Thank you, Rockstar  Steam. Highly recommended!
