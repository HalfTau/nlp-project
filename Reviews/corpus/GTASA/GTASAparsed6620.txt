Where GTA V focused on storytelling and immersion, GTASA focused on /fun/, and it shows more and more as time goes on..I enjoy the immersion of V going to a movie, smoking a bong, watching TV, but I think the game would have been.. more of a game??.. if that content was scrapped in favor of elements you /actually/ interact with, in some way..Where GTA V gives you a hollow mystery thats so mysterious that it /might/ be about a jetpack, SA just /gives you a jetpack/  This More mature, more serious, ingenious storytelling!! angle that Rockstar adopted after San Andreas left a gaping void in the fabric of the gaming universe, and then Saints Row was born. Or Saints Row flourished, at least, because of the general lack of honest /fun/ in the newer GTA entries, anyway..SO! SANNY ANNY! Go find you a lawnmower and bust the nitro cheat on it! Go to the top of that supertall building with the parachute on top, cheatspawn a fourwheeler and ride it all the way down to the ground! Go abuse the RC Baron for some miniaturized stuntflying! Get fat as hell and attempt to run! Do a crosscountry wheelie! Sell ice cream! Accidentally fall off of a steep coastal area into the ocean and spend a whole day swimming back to land!! Enjoy not owning a smartphone! Take over a hood in the hood from some hoods while wearing a hood! Read the word hood til it makes no sense!Bias and potential rosetinted glasses aside, GTASA is loaded with goodies, has fine controls, and still has an active modding and modded multiplayer community..
