Despite all the negative reviews this game is getting because of the new update, this game isnt too bad. It still isnt worth buying because you cant change the display resolution of the game, etc. but it isnt as bad as some people are portraying it to be. Its a little of a downgrade because Im so used to playing GTAIV graphics arent as nice, etc., but its still a nice game for Sandbox/Open World/GTA fans. I can actually see myself playing this game for hours and hours now, despite all the new update has changed or ruined, as some others may put it.However, I really hope that Steam releases a new update to fix all of the issues that other players and I have experienced. Initially, I felt that I made a terrible investment. I still kind of feel its a bad investment in its current state. In its current state, I would give this game a 2.5/5. Once the issues have been resolved, I would definitely give this game a full 5/5.EDIT Over 100 hours of gameplay later, I would give this game a full 5/5 hands down! Theres a fix for the screen resolution issue dont remember where I found it or what it is, but you can find it pretty easily on the web. Once the fix is made, this game is great! D Still like GTAIV a lot better though, even if it requires a lot of fixing up on the Steam Platform.
