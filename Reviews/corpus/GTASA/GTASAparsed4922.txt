This is a game that I used to play with my little brother back then on PS2 almost 5 years ago. It was really fun, we played multiplayer all the time without even progressing throughout the main story.Last month, I bought this game because its on sale, in mission to finish the whole GTA San Andreas story, because I only played it halfway.I saw many people complaining about the removal of mods, etc. For me, I quite enjoy the game without mods, and I really enjoy the gameplay.If you want to buy it and enjoy the originality of the game without mods etc, I recommend this game.PS  I use cheats though, sadly Im used to that LOL
