Oh, San Andreas. Honestly the best GTA ever, with a map and story so large it would take any person a least 30 hours to just run the story. It has loads of minigames that actually feel integral to the game, not just tacked on for the sake of content. It was the first GTA to have a deep vehicle customization, but none of this instantly recall your car after you wreck it nonsense. Its not without its flaws, but it is so deep rooted in nostolgia that I can only reccomend this game immensely.Also works well on new systems, runs fine on Windows 7, FX 8350, and a GTX 960.If you dont have it already, do yourself a favor this winter and replay this PS2 masterpiece, you wont regret it.
