A really fun and exciting game to play anytime. You play as Carl Johnson CJ in a gangsters life, going through alot of hardships and problems. After 5 years in liberty city, you find out about the death of your mother, so you decide to head back to your home, Grove Street.I have spent many hours or so flying jets and helicopters, exploring and traversing the land of San Andreas, building and maxxing out my players stats, and so on.Over all, I would give this game a 810 AT LEAST.This game will always be in my heart, And I cant recommend it enough.Just remmember to follow the damn train.
