GTA San Anreas is one of those games which marked the childhood of most people, along with Vice City. Many years have passed and I unfortunately do not see that many changes to how the game handles. Lets first talk about the issues this game hasI could go on with the bad stuff, lets have a look at the good sides of itYea... as you can see the game has a lot of issues as it is, buying it on its own is not a good idea. The best thing you can do is keep an eye out for bundles or discounts and grab it there. For the current price tag im looking at, no, dont buy it
