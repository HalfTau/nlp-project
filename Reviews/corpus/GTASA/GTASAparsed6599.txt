I rated this game using a very sophisticated points system.0Not GTA San Andreas  10GTA San AndreasI am proud to report that this game scores 10/10Because its freakin GTA SAN ANDREAS dude!! !PS PLEASE NOTE THAT WITH THE MOST RECENT UPDATE FOR THIS GAME THEY HAVE TAKEN OUT SOME OF THE MUSIC DUE TO LICENSING ISSUES. SO IF THAT BOTHERS YOU MAYBE DONT BUY? HONESTLY I PERSONALLY DONT GIVE A I GOT THIS GAME FOR LIKE 2 AND IF I REEEEALLY NEED TO LISTEN TO A CERTAIN SONG ILL JUST PLAY IT ON ING WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU FIND THE IDEA OF HAVING SOME OF THE MUSIC REMOVED TO BE OFFPUTTING I RECCOMMEND THAT YOU DONT ING BUY IT! MAYBE LOOK FOR AN OLDER XBOX OR PS2 DISC COPY OR AN OLDER PC COPY? OR MAYBE GET WITH THE ING TIMES AND BUY A COPY OF GTA 5 ALREADY?! P
