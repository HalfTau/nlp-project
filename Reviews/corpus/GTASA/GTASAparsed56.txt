When I was a child, I was not allowed to play Mrated games, so the Grand Theft Auto series passed me by. Years later, in my adolescence and my adulthood, I was finally able to experience this series starting with GTA 2 and GTA San Andreas. GTA 2 was interesting, but my playthrough of GTA San Andreas was the most fun Ive had with a video game in a long time. The game is set in the early 1990s and is based on the street gang rivalries of the west coast of America from that generation.
