the steam version is rubbishwhy well you have to tweak the game to get it to run.and when you finish tweak the game after an hour you quit and the next day you try to start it up and the game stops and dosent start such a great game with such a bad port but if you what to play a remasterd tweaked version buy it on your ipad trust me.
