My favorite game of all time. First a little back story of mine.. My first GTA was VC, then 4, 3, and then 5. I played little SA in between of me playing those. I never really dedicated myself to this game as I did to the others. 2016 arrives and I pick it up from Steam and start a playthrough. Holyit was so good. Well Im gonna list some pros and cons and some facts..Main Locations in GTA San AndreasLos Santos Los AngelesLas Venturas Las VegasSan Fierro San FransiscoNevada DesertForestsMountainsPROS You get to freely fly aircrafts, unlike GTA IV Much better gameplay than GTA 3 and VC The story is amazing You can swim, unlike GTA 3, VC Driving phsycics are blessed by the gods RPG Factors Gain muscle, stamina, sex appeal, etc A lot of guns! Such as the AK47, SPAS12, RPG, Grenades, MP5, Uzis or MAC10s, Desert Eagle, and more. Six stars instead of five like in GTA V The infamous memes Big Smokes order, WRONG HOUSE FOOL, etc You can beat peds with long, purple ... Dont ing lie, we all have done it... Great modding community......... Hot Coffee Barbershops Chose your haircuts! Theres a multiplayer mod You can drive cars, trucks, buses, dirt bikes, motorcycles, bicycles, planes, jets, boats, tanks, and more! There is an Area 69 Based off of Area 51 Gambling!!! HUUUGGEEE MAP!! Bigger than GTA IVs Liberty City! Not quite sure aboit GTA V though.. Bigfoot? Awesome cheat codes!CONS I wish this game had more of a customizable video settings, instead of it just being low, medium, high, and very high I hate it if you die in a mission you have to do everything all over again.. Even the drive there too The swimming mechanics are clunky.. Hard to control and maintain underwaterI really could go for aGrand Theft Auto San Andreas 2
