My first ever GTA game. Every time I am recollecting it I remember these good old times riding through San Andreas, shooting cops from a flying tank, doing missions and listening to awesome music. I LOVE THIS GAME! interesting story lots of cheats and weapons to use lots of vehicles huge map to explore freedom of gameplay awesome music sometimes cops are just too irritating all I had to do was follow the damn trainGroveStreet4EVER
