It took me around 65 hours to complete this game in 100. This is a classic everyone should play at least once. Big world, a lot of things to do, cool characters, this game is just AWESOME. The only downside is the meh port, youll want to spend a hour or two modding this game before playing. But seriously though, get this game, especially if its on sale.
