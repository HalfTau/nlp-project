My personal favorite of the PS2 Grand Theft Autos  an absolutely massive world, tons of things to do throughout the entire environment, a decent story spanning three entire cities, wonderful music....this game has it all. I cant recommend this game enough.The one mark against it that I would give the PC version is that it does not have any 169 screen resolutions by default  youll have to do some modding yourself in order to get it to work in the appropriate resolution which is extremely disappointing. But aside from that minor technical issue, an absolutely wonderful game, and a musthave for any person looking to build their game collection.
