Having played and finished GTA San Andreas on PS2 I bought this to relive the game and possibly try out some mods,after Rockstars update from last year though, the game has gotten incredibly hard to enjoy.What seemed like a nice upgrade, adding Xboxcontroller support for example, ended up ruining the game with plenty of technical issues, such as, but not limited toYes, its the same GTA San Andreas you used to enjoy, with the great voice acting, but since it has such an array of technical issues I can simply not recommend this.If youd like to enjoy GTA San Andreas on PC, try to find a discversion.Theyre easier to mod and seem to work fine.
