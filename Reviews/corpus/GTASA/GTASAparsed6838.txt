A few months ago I checked this page to see how much it would be to buy the game. I see a ton of negative reviews saying how the game has been ruined by a recent update to the HD version of the game that was made for mobiles and ported over to consoles later. I see them all complaining about songs not being on the radio and a few complaining about it crashing 10 minutes into playing. Although it sucks that they took out NWAs Express Yourself with the 18 songs and it crashing when I tried to change something in the graphics settings, I havent had any other problems. Its still San Andreas. A pain of a game that doesnt let you aim at an enemy uless your character is facing them and the game that pings you off to the moon when you hit a lamp post fast enough.Although when I was doing the low rider dance bit I failed twice because I inverted my right stick Yaxis and it inverted the hydraulics Xaxis too so I had to change it back.
