I love this game. I played through the story three times over the years and might even go for another playthrough in the future. Comparing GTA SA to the previous GTA games ignoring any later GTA it is the best in my opinion. It has all the things you like GTA for. Bicycles, motorbikes, cars, trucks, lorries, planes, helicopter, parachutes, missions, side missions, side activities, many different weapons, stunts, you name it.If you like any earlier or later GTA, you will love GTA SA, too.Also it costs less than 10, with sales even as low as 3,49. There is nothing you can do wrong with this purchase.
