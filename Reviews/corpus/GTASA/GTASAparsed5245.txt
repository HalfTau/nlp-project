The best game that was made by Rockstar, in my opinion, many would disagree. Ive completed this game so many times and memorised a lot of things missions, spawn points of guns, car locations, the whole map, lots of dialogue, etc. To be fair, this game never gets old, nor does it get repetetive and its always fun to replay it.Magnum opus/10.
