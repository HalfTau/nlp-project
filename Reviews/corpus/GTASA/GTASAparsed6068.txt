I bought this game on sale because of the nostalgia and a low, low price. now I understand why it had a low price. its because after all this time the game didnt hold up very well. I didnt remember the graphic and the gameplay being so  but back then my standards werent as high as today. if they remastered it I would buy it in a hearthbeat because the game was awesome when I first played on the PS2 but now its just memories.not even worth the 2
