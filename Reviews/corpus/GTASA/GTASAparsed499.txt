utter trash version of a great gamebug ridden, including fun bugs like your mouse sensetivity setting resets every single time you start the game up, crashing to desktop randomly, segments in missions in which your character will freeze up and refuse to do anything resulting in having to reload, the DDR style minigames controls being reversed  laggingavoid, download this game by other means
