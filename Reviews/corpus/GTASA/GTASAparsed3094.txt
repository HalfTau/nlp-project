A very amazing classic game. Very good story, you can do so many different things and the humour is also very good. I quite laughed sometimes. The graphic is old and you might be annoyed at the beginning, but get used to it by time and later you dont even notice it anymore.The only negative aspect I could find is that you have to activate the frame limiter, so that the game limits on 30 FPS, otherwise some driving or swimming physics wont work.All in all it is a very recommendable game and a must have for fans of the GTA series.
