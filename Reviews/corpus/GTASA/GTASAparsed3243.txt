No matter how crappy the graphics is, or how low detailed the environment is, when it comes to open world, this is one amon the top three gams I recommend. This game has got a great storyline, a vast terrain that needs to be explored, mini games within the existing missions and lots more. GTA San Andreas was actually one of the first open world game I had played which has since been one of my favourites. Carl Johnson is my hero and I was really sad about Big Sweet. I love this game a lot and this is one that I have played many times over and over again without get bored.
