Absolutely great game......before the recent patch that removed songs, broke saved games, made mods incompatible, limits available resolutions and so on. I would be even willing to let removing of the songs slide since its the music industry that screws everybody there, but why mess around where it is not needed? This is a mobile version now, so you might as well buy it on iOS or Android if thats enough for you.For the PC I recommend getting it cough elsewhere cough with all the original songs and moddability intact. You can use SAAC and / or Pinnacle game profiler to map gamepads to work better with the game than you can with this newly released abomination.Thanks Rockstar!By the way, my playtime on Steam copy is so low because Ive used downgraded exe for mods. My real playtime since latest install is about 80 hours. I also have owned this game on the original Xbox and have bought it on iOS just to support Rockstar.
