This game is fantastic. Although the graphics are a bit outdated, the gameplay is great. The animations for the characters and objects are smooth and flowing. The fire from the flamethrower can be spread on the ground. There are so many things to do, and if you feel like it, activate some cheats, and wreck havok on all of Los Santos with all the weapons you need  all the mods you could ever want. Its also the only GTA game where you can control cranes and trains at any time you want. This game was one of the greatest on PS2 in 2004, and I still think it holds that title. Its kinda like a demake of GTA 5 from my perspective.If you see a copy of this game, go get it and play it! You will have loads of fun!
