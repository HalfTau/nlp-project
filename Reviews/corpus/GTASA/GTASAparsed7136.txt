San Andreas, the BEST installment in the GTA series in my opinion. This game, introducing swiming, the pinnacle of graphics at its time, proper large maps, more air activities than its predecesors Vice City and III, and many more features. All of your favorite music playing on the games wide array of raido stations while you feel the real sence of spped this game gives you as the sides of your screen blur as you whiz past the games 3 giant lands. all holding the form of real life cities. Los Santos being Los Angeles, San Fierro being San Francisco, and Las  Venturas being Las Vegas. All setin the state San Andreas, named after the fault in California. If you havent bought this game, get it. I got it less than a year ago and already have put 350 hours into it. We all know this game from the PS2, with its PS2 graphics, but with is running better than games on the PS3 on my computer anyways, it adds to my love of this game now more than ever.
