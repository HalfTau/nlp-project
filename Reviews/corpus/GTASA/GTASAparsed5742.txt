Legendary game! Still fun to play after 10 years. The amount of content this game has is simply amazing and no other GTA game can compare. The big modding community also made plenty of interesting stuff that might be worth checking out.MTA SA is also the most polished MP client Ive ever seen. Feels almost native.
