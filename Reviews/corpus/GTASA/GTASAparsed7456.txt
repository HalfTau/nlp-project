Since the recent mandatory and unanonced update, the game no longer support my controller, so I just cant play it.I was told by friends that that update also remove a lot of song and crash a lot, but I cant confirm this, since I cant even play the game the way I used to play it for months without any problem before that update.DONT BUY THIS. you should acquire a retail version anyway you can, at least itll work
