This game has been said by some people as one of the greatest games ever, and it does show. This game offers an amazing story of betrayal. The shooting can be a little hard at first but later you will be able to adapt to it. There are also plenty of times this game can be funny too, espically characters you meet later. Graphics are pretty good for the time. Gameplay is very fun and each mission is usually very unique. My huge problems with the game are its lack of a checkpoint system in the missions and the fact that you lose your weapons when you die, and when flying the plane its pretty hard too. Overall GTA San Andreas is one of the best in the GTA series and propably one of the best games ever.
