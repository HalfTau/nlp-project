So someone must of fixed this game! cause it was unplayable but Ive recently finished it.And damn was it a fun experience, there was alot of pull my hair out forget this crap moments but with NO CHEATS. I finished this byatch. GTA is a great franchise. unfortunately some idiots take it too seriously and use it to disparage games as violent pieces of trash... Ironicaly I remember alot of political statements throughout the story and characters. showing that GTA is what you make of it. GTA can be a violent crime story of scarface proportions. OR Its the story of a young man trying to get out of the ghetto and seeking vengance, while being used by crooked police and the secret service for nefarious reasons.GTA san andreas showed the blurred lines between good and evil. with a deep story of brotherhood, poverty and the system out of control.Or its just a game about killing cops and stealing cars.depends on how much attention you put into it, considering how many times i saw the same cut scenes. I thought it was a great game.GROVE STREET FO LYFE BYATCHES
