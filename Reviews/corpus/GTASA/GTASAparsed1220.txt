GTASan Andreas is the seventh game in the grand theft auto series originally re revolves around Carl CJ Johnson who returns from Liberty City to attend his mothers funeral who was gunned down during a driveby by a rival gang. CJ quickly realise the Grove Street family doesnt have the same control over the city as when he left. To make matters worse a corrupt group of the police called the C.R.A.S.H unit is clamping down on the citys gang problem by utilising illegal methods such as threatening to pin the murder of a police officer on CJ unless he helps them covering up their illicit activities and remove anyone who is going to let the public know what theyre up to. A much deeper conspiracy is soon brought to light which involves members of the grove street gang.This game is a blast from the past, originally released for the playstation in October 2004 with subsequent releases it finally found its way onto steam in November 2014. The game is pretty much the same as I remember it from the PS2, some graphical improvements are made here and there, but its nothing ground breaking really, it still looks like it hasnt aged well.Modding is a very interesting aspect of the pc version of the game, however for most mods to work youll need to downgrade the game to version 1.0 which I struggled to get working for some odd reason and even when I finally managed to get it working the game would crash on me at random. I should mention though that most people seem to be able to downgrade and mod this game with no issues, so Im guessing Im the exception and not the norm here.To be honest unless you care immensely about either modding or the missing sound tracks theres really no reason to downgrade at allAll in all the game it self it great, however the amount of problems I faced when trying to mod this game dragged it down quite a bit, dont get me wrong its still a game Id recommend however I cannot in good consience recommend it at full price, but next time it goes on sale it may be worth picking up
