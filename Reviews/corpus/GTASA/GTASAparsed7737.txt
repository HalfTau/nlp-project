Ive never finished this game, but damn have I wanted to.This game is probably the longest base game Ive never actually finished. Granted, I probably would have finished it if my laptop hadnt crashed, therefore destroying all my game, and making me have to restart from the beginning again.But Im actually glad that happened. Because this game is so damn good it deserves two playthroughs, hell it probably deserves five. Its definitely the long cherished gem of the GTA series for a reason, whilst the much heralded GTA IV might beat it on gameplay depth, GTA San Andreas sure as hell beats it on everything else.
