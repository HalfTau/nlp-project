really fun game the graphics are not the greatest but their not terrible great physics great story even though this game might be old and you guys are mostly in to gta 5 this game will still make your day and its not a hard to run game so you can get adecent amount of frames on it hightest if you have a high end pc could be over  100 fps low end c with low settings you could get about 60 fps so yeah i definetly recommend this game to people that want to have fun and that hav e a low end pc
