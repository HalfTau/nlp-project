This is the best GTA game ever in the series for me. I have played GTA V on the PS3 and PS4 and GTA V comes a very close 2nd to SA. GTA SA is all about the 90s gangsters,drugs,gunsin a video game though and being a 90s kid it brings back many memories back too. Its amazing how well done the characters are from the likes of the voice acting to acting to even visualseven for an old game. The story line is briliant too, it just keeps you coming back for more. The gameplay mechanics and graphics surely will seem old but you will still be able to have great fun. The only shameful thing with the PC version is with the updates that have removed certain stuff such as songs but you can easily use community mods to work around them. Do not be put off buying this game because of the removal of stuff because there is a work around! You can also get a really cheap disc copy from Amazon which will be the original game from day one. As ICE CUBE would saychickity get the game yo self before you wreck yo self. Grove Street awaits you my z.
