This was my Fav game as a child and still to this day can spend hours playingBut back in Nov 2014 Rockstar Upgraded every ones copy, and long behold they broke theout of itThey added in higher graphics along with texture quality but in this process they broke the in game. Cj is all choppy and splits while you move, this makes the game unplayable. they also removed 16 or so songs and the ability to mod making fixing the game impossibleThanks Rockstar, next time take me out for dinner and wine and dine me before you bend me over andmy Youth
