I used to like this game. I got it after my girlfriend recommended it to me and had a blast, up until this one mission where youre forced to fly an airplane through loops. Since the air controls in the PC version are worse than Satan I had to stop playing the game after the 20th attempt at that damned mission. Still, up until that point I could see why everyone called it one of the best games ever.But now... Now Rocks gone and made the controls even worse somehow, along with song removals, a terrible graphics update which is amazing considering the games 10 years old. Yes, they made the graphics look worse than the PS2 era!, save corruption, the removal of 1080p, and glitches everywhere.I mean, I was going to start over soon and try my luck with the airplane crud again, but now Ill never get the opportunity, not without grinding to get back to that point.You know what the worst part about this is? Ive been waiting to play GTA V for months. I never looked up anything on it,  no cutscenes, no reviews, nada, so I would be completely surprised by the huge world it had to offer. Now, with the t Rocks pulled here? Nuh uh. I was going to snatch it up the second it had even a minor sale on Steam. Now? I dont think Im even gonna pick it up. I dont want to risk buying it and then have them ruining the game for Steam users like they did here. I think Ill just go get Assassins Creed Rogue when that comes out on Steam.
