DID NOT FINISHThis game is good but unless youre blinded by nostalgia, this game is not worth your money as the later GTA games are far superior in every way. This game has many of the same pros and cons as GTA III does but does look a lot nicer and has in my opinion a far superior story.8/15  GTA V is out soon... be patient... unless you have nostalgia goggles unlike myself
