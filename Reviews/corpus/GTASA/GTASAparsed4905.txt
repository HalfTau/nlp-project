im writing this review as being a nonGTA fan that was playing GTA SA as his first intorduction to the seriesit is said that good games are games that are infinite or take a long time to beat , grand theft auto is a good example , because it takes an average of 80 hours to beat the game , meanwhile , once beating it  , youll conclude that you have completed only like half of the game , which means that you still have more secrets and stuff to do .for an old game , GTA san andreas is a good sandbox game , it includes some nice soundtracks , and has a nice long story.you have your weapons , your vehicules , your fellas .....your city that you can freely control not freely 100 which is sad kinda p  .if you ever feel alone , you can tweak the game to make it let you play the multiplayer mode which is actif massivly.10/10
