I just learned about the bogus patch. I had a good time playing it when it first came out, but I dont own a PS2 anymore, so I bought this for a little nostalgia now and then. Now Ill have to end up pirating a game I have purchased no less than three times, including when I had to replace a scratched disc.Poor form, Rockstar
