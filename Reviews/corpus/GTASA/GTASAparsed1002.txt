An amazing feat for the time, and a gamechanging accomplishment for consoles and the PC alike. Theres no end to the amount of fun you can have with San Andreas. The campaign is great and very replayable, but the fun never ends with mods. Theres even a mod to play the game online. Two, actually. San Andreas Multiplayer SAMP and Multi Theft Auto MTA. The online community for San Andreas is so much better than GTA Vs. There are many online gamemodes like racing, deathmatch, and roleplay. The community is mature and kind to new players. The game as a whole is great, and I definitely recommend to any open world fan.
