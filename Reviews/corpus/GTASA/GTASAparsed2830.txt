Having played this game to death years ago, I thought I would get it again for a bit of nostalgia. Firstly, the graphics have aged really badly, if you have been playing GTA V you will see how much graphics have evolved in the last decade. However by far the worst thing about this game are the controls due to its console origins no doubt. The controls are terrible for shooting and driving and it makes what could be enjoyable missions a very frustrating experience and much harder than they need to be. I would say the controls are moderately better than VC but a million times worse than GTA V. I guess the game is unlikely to be updated any more so I guess I have to live with that.All that aside, it is good to fire this classic up again after so long and despite the aged graphics and terrible controls, it is still a really enjoyable game and I would still recommend it despite its flaws.Edit since playing a good few hours I have discovered that this version has issues with stability. I have had several crashes to desktop, which were extremely frustrating after completing horrible missions only to have the game crash before I could save my progress. Music has been severely cut too. It is a good game but I recommend it with some reservations
