While everyone wants to hate on this game simply because of the fact that Open IV was shut down, I will say that Im downvoting this for both that and something else. The only thing that keeps this game playable is mods. Learn from this game, Take Two and Rockstar. Mods can be one of the only things to make a game have lasting value. Now please apply this to GTA 4 and GTA 5.EDIT Open IV is back! This game has many high quality mods, in addition to a great story and setting. The AI can be annoying especially during the train mission, the graphics aged poorly, and the cars can be very floaty.
