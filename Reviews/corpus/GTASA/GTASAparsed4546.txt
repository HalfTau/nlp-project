My first M rated game when I was but a wee lad. My dads girlfriend bought this for me out of the eye of him, and I loved it. I played it, but never beat it.Fast foward 7 years. I wanted to get my old Playstation 2 down and play some of my old games for nostalgia.Its broken.Im determined to play San Andreas again.My birthday rolls around, I pick this up. So far Ive binged 3 hours and its just as fantastic as I remember it. Map is actually a lot smaller than my younger mind remembers it, but its still fun nonetheless.Followthedamntrain/10
