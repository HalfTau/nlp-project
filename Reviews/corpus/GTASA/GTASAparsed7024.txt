Resolution looks like sht. No gamepad support which is weird because I could have sworn using my Xbox controller back in the day to play this game. The keyboard controls are fcking garbage. I remember this game being good, but it isnt anymore. The version on the Windows app store is better than this.EditI figured out my controller was plugged into my usb 3.0 slot and that was the problem, or at least I think it was. When I went back to start a new game it crashed. Im done with this.
