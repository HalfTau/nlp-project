San Andreas has reinterpreted the freedom in PC gaming. Player got to interact with huge world filled with secrets and minimissions. He was allow to ride, swim or fly everywhere he wants, do whatever he wants in any order he wants unlike any other game at that time. Another thing that is distinct in San Andreas is story, filled with memorable dialogs and characters which are mostly based on 80s and 90s popculture. All that is accompanied with one of the greatest soundtrack any game ever had.
