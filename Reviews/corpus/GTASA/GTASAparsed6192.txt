What can i Say? Ive loved the first few released GTA, so this one got to be the best, brings back memories when i first played it, Cool customization of clothings, workout ur character to being super buff. And not to mention being a GANGSTA. Take over territories . Has tons of mission, Cool and good game, even until now i still play it once in awhile.highly recommend.
