Im a fan of GTA3 and GTAVC and I really wanted to like this game, but its just so bad.I was shocked how a game that came so much later than GTA3 and GTAVC can be uglier than both of them and slower too.This game clearly wasnt meant for PC. The controls are horrible and aiming a weapon is nearly impossible.I cant believe how bad this one is because everything was fine in the previous games!cons ugly as hell slow as hell shooting is broken driving feels worse that everproscouldnt find any
