Terrible since the last patch as of 11/2014. Ignore the mostly positive reviews  they are almost entirely from before the gamewrecking patch. Most of the reviews for the game today are rightly negative.The patch basically breaks functionality and removes things that were there and/or working fine before. Songs have been pulled from the soundtrack. Certain standard 16x9 resolution options are no longer available. See the other negative reviews for other problems.It is appalling that a Company would break functionality to any game after users have paid for it, to say nothing of wrecking an old classic after leaving it intact for years. Just because the EULA allows them to do so doesnt make it proper or ethical.
