Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a great game itself, its my favorite Grand Theft Auto after Vice City.Having played Grand Theft Auto San Andreas version 1.0, I must say, the 3.0 Steam Version is real bad.Sex scenes are censored, well yeah, I dont care about seeing pixels fuing themselves, its just a game so why removing it then? If a kid wants to masturbate to it then thats his problem.The mods, oh damn, that.You know how Rockstar hate mods? Well, they do hate mods, the 3.0 Steam version should not be played with mods so youll have to downgrade to 1.0.The mobile HD textures, oh man, please, Its ugly, its hurting my eyes, 80s and 90s games had better graphics for Christs sake, what the heck is that, a downgrade? So youre telling me, that I have to downgrade the game to upgrade it? That doesnt make sense at all, come on Rockstar.Oh and they removed some songs from the radio, I must say, I mostly use the custom radio but the music was pretty good in San Andreas unlike GTA V so why not listening to it? But hey wait, they removed some songs.The same crap happened with Vice City before, we paid for that game so we paid for that music too so cant you not be a bunch of pathetic  and let us keep our stuff?Damn developers these days I swear.The game itself on version 1.0 deserves 9/10 but after all what they did to it it deserve a 3/10.The game is uglier, songs were removed from the game even for those who bought the game way before, mods are unplayable on this version and there are many other problems.Im still recommending this game because you can always downgrade it to an older version if you want so thats that.
