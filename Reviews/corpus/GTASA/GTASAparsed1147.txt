This was quite simply the GREATEST game ever when it was released.  It was bigger, more complex and deeper than anything Id ever played.Now it it no longer new.  So, how does it stand the test of time?Very well.  It is still one of my alltime favorites!  The cast is still great.  The gameplay is familiar but still good.  The graphics are very good  considering its age.  And it runs well on systems with less than stellar specs  Intel chipset 2.4 ghz  integrated graphics.When it does crash and they all do crash, it is quick and painless to restart the game unsaved game progress not withstanding.  This happens infrequently though.A great game  the BEST of the GTA series  that I can unreservedly recomend.9.9/10
