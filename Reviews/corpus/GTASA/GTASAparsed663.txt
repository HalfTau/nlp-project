Its the first GTA game I ever played and I was like 8 years old or something. And from that I fell in love with GTA series. I have played the storyline like 6 times and I still love to play this game. You can mess with cheats and such, redo the storyline and  follow the god damn train over and over again, capture gang territories, go out with gfs and do so many things together and to explore the whole map and find secrets and Easter eggs and I can assure you people that it never gets old and you want to play over and over again. And I think it is the best GTA game ever created. I really recommend it.
