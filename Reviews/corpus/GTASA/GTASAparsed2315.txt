The game consistently freezes if I try to go past a certain point on the map Songs were taken out because of an expired contract. Excuse me? I didnt rent this game, I bought it. You cant take content away that I paid for Missions are long as hell with no checkpoints so if you screw up 90 of your way through a mission you have to do it all over, again and again, and againIts sad, really. I can see why people love this game so much. It just needs a bit more polish and the content returned to it to live up to its full potential
