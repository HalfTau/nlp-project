The good old GTA SA, which was a superb game back  in the day, is totally unplayable now.It lacks proper support for any OS after XP I dunno Vista... never tried on it, but everything from 7 anyway.Mouse support sucks even if this is manageable with proper use of the steam overlay, and the game itself got a  of bugs and glitches.Its a shame to see such a marvelous old game torn to pieces due to totally lack of support.Unless you have an old rig with Windows XP SP3 any other OS older are not supported by steam so this is your only chouce  up and running spare the cash for this game its unplayable, sadly.Edit let me be clear I own both a recent rig, with an i7 3770K, 16GB DDR3, 1080Ti and Windows 10 Pro on a 2560x1440p144hz Display and an old rig, with a Phenom 9950, 4B DDR2, 9600 GT and Windows XP SP3 on a 1280x72060hz Display. Playing on the recent one is so frustratring due to bug and glitches that makes CJ die or mission failed without any reason, while on the old rig these problems do not exists Im enjoing the game on the latter, but I cannot reccomand a game that do not work properly on modern system, even if its so cool as it is GTA SA.
