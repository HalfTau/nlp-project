The game itself is alright but one thing that pisses me off in all of these GTA games is the camera. Unlike in other games like Smite where you use the mouse to look everywhere, in this game you cannot look or move in certain ways. I was never informed of this and purchased the games because of all of the hype and how it reminded me of True Crime Streets of LA. I unfortunately cannot refund or find a solution to my problems so, save yourself. Dont listen to the hype and go spend your money on Outlast and Whistleblower. Both are much better games in comparison.
