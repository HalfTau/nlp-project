My favorite game of all time, running on a PC, with high quality graphics. If you dont have the joystick then it takes a little while to get used to using the analouge WASD controls, but anyone whos played this game will catch on fast. I recommend this game for its gameplay, story, and freeplay. This is the best Grand Theft Auto. No contest. Some of the missions can be difficult, especially with keyboard controls, but I recomend this game to anyone, and I recommend Steam keeps it in their library until the end of time. Have fun. Theres even an app to bring the cheats up on your phone now, so you can enter them any time you want during gameplay. Cheers.
