NOTE Im reviewing this game while using a legal downgrader to 1.0. This changes from the steam version which sucks to the good, old one. The first version, that was on hardcopies, etc. The game as it is without a downgrader is a ruined game which deleted 18 of great songs and many other content YOU PAID FOR. If it wasnt for the downgrader id not recommend it. Now, to the review.Old, but gold. Simply the best.You all know of this game, if not, you were born too early. Its one of the BEST open world games EVER. The story is great, map is huge, there is MYTHS and LEGENDS and EASTER EGGS everywhere. The mod community is the BIGGEST in the world. Songs are GREAT. The whole soundtrack is perfect. There is an unofficial multiplayer mod San Andreas Multi Player which is better than GTA Online. I just wanna confirm this game is great. If you didnt hear of it before which would mean youre kinda left out a bit just try it. 10/10.
