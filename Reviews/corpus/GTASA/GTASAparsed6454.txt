My favourite game of all time, many memories playing it on the PS2 and later on on the PC.Single player has a  of content, good soundtrack, memorable characters and very fun missions and progressing system. A very complete game that is now obviously outdated.Multiplayer is extremely fun, even without friends to play with. Lots of people on multiplayer servers even 10 years later.10/10 for me, a classic.
