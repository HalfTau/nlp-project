Well, my story begins here. GTA San Andreas! It was my first GTA Ive played for real. GTA I and II wasnt very interesting for me, after i got that on my first Xbox Console I couldnt stop playing it. Story was great, characters was great everything what you wished for been develop since few first GTA games, also it was a first GTA where i started my online gaming i met a lot of amazing people because of SAMP D I recommend that game to everyone!
