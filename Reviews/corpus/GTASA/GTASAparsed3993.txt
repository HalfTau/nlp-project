Absolutely the best game in the series. Its a classic. Despite the graphics and the lack of multiplayer which can be fixed with mods, this game never fails to entertain me. I have way more than 0.9 hours on this game, steam glitched out. Great game. Id say its the best game of its time and then some. It was the best game available until grand theft auto 4 came out. Incredible game, great difficulty, entertaining, and AMAZING modding capability! I recommend this to anyone with a few bucks to spare. Get it on a sale.
