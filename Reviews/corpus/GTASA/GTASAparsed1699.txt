This is a great version of the game to play as long as you use the downgrader to take it back to the first version to fix some issues and add missing music. You can also add all sorts of other little fixes to the game too. One of my favorites is that they will map all of the onscreen control prompts to what they are on a xbox controller. Definitely recommended if you are thinking about giving San Andreas another go, or havent even played it.
