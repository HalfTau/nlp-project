San Andreas in my opinion is the highlight of the series, The game itself was huge, and the story I very good also, it had so many vehicals and so much room to explore. Even I havnt seen the whole place yet, plus many myths invloving the game, like ghost cars, bigfoot, ect. always fun. along with a great weapon selection and other things, one of the best things i can think of about it is No Map Loading Screens D which is surprising due to how huge it is.
