I dont know why my hours were erased, but I had 176 hours on record before.I absolutely love this game. The cheat codes are fun as hell, the story was great, there was a reason to fly place to place, and modding is quick and easy. I highly recommend this game along with the multiplayer mod. Lastly, it actually runs compared to GTA IV.
