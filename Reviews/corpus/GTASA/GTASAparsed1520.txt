I grew up playing this game on my PS2. I bought again on my PC, I was still not dissapointed. This game, in my opinion, differs from other GTAs. This one had told a story about emotion, gang violence, police brutality/corruption, etc. Carl Johnson is just a character you can never hate or forget. I give this game a 10/10.
