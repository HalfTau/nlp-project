Back when the game first came out for PlayStation 2 I quickly fell in love with it, it felt so revolutionary.. the amount of freedom and the variety of content completely blew my teenage mind. I remember waking up early in the morning booting up my console and spend entire weekends alone and with friends, just messing around, using cheats, and myth hunting on the local multiplayer.So a few years later when I first bought a computer, I repurchased this game to reminisce the good old days, that was when I discovered modding for the very first time, I remember spending countless hours a day just fiddling with the game files, so it felt like a completely new experience every time I played.Ever since then, Ive beat the storyline a total of 22 times on both platforms, and Ive been playing this game for almost 10 years now... I dont think I will ever experience something like this in my lifetime ever again.This game will forever be remembered by me as.
