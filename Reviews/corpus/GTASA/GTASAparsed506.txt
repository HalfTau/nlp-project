The game run just fine, but there some problems with it. I run it on Win10. First it has a hard time to keep my settings, the resolution drop down 600x800 sometimes not in game fortunately, just when lauch the game .Second I have to lower the mouse senstivity every single time when I start the game, but I dont know why. And last if you want good for yourself, the first thing you must do is to swap the num8 and num2 buttons in the vehicle controls, after countless attempt to finish the lowrider mission with Ceasar, I realise the game confuse on the two, up is down and down is up...I love this game, I played the sht out of it as a kid on ps2 and pc too, its a gem after this many years, so besides this few problem I give it a 9/10.
