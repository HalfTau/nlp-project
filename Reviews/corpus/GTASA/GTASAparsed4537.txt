GTA San Andreas is my favorite in the series. This has memorable and interesting story, vast state to explore, and a fully customizable protagonist. But out of all, I love the user track player feature the most. Nothing beats the fun of driving carelessly while listening to your favorite song.Comparing to the other title in the series, this game offer the most replayability. While having slightly lower quality in textures, it makes up for its outstanding gameplay. You can do a lot of activities while not in mission. Be it swimming, participating in a illegal car race, gambling, clubbing, many more! And like in Vice City, you can do business in the game. Eventually lead you to a much thicker wallet.10/10 Masterpiece
