Best GTA game ever.Despite the flashy graphics and stunning realism of later titles, GTA SA still has a special place in my heart as the game that broke all sorts of barriers and made gaming fun. Missions are wide and varied. Side missions are exceptional, not at all tedious cough GTA4 cough and extras like ambulance, police, tagging turf, owning territory, working out, eating, dating etc... all add to the experience. Something that cough GTA 4 severely lacked, but something that is pivotal to ensuring the player gets invested in the game.Graphics are decent for its time, music is mixed and varied. But GTA SA doesnt win me with that its all in the gameplay.Overall 10/10 Must own, must buy, must steal, must break in, must help Ryder, must pop those Ballas.
