Classic GTA with interesting characters and a massive city to explore! The story is great and easy to follow, but the farmland area outside of Vinewood Hollywood is barren and not fun to explore. If youre a fan of dank memes, this game features the infamous scene about Big Smokes order, follow that train and many more. However, it is a clear console port main menu is fidgety, sometimes the game unrecognizes my mouse and even crashes on occasion. WARNING save frequently! San Andreas has a save corruption issue and will fail to load your previous save files.
