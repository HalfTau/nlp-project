Okay. This game takes the cake.There is an incredible amount of work that R has put in this game.The GhettoThe AtmosphereTorrenos missions.While there are 100 story missions, the game still manages to keep focussed unlike a game that came later with 3 protagonists and 69 missions.This is a true classic that stands the test of time!
