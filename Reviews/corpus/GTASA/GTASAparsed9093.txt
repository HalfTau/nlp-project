Ah, the oldschool legendary GTA game. Well, the graphics isnt that great, considering this is an old game released in 2003, I think, but that makes this game has a small size. It has the biggest map in the entire GTA series until GTA V was released. It still, I think, has the longest and the best story of all the GTA games. I forgot how many times Ive completed this game in my good old fat PS2.The story takes up like 100 hours, maybe even 200. But it is really great though, that what makes this game got such good ratings. You will find I dont know if this some sort of spoiler or not Killing, Murdering, Destruction, Mayhem, and Betrayal.The Controls in this game arent great though, theres no autoaim system. Sure its for PC, and many Shooter games for PC have no autoaim system, but its very hard to aim in this game. I dont know if its just me, or there are any others experiencing difficulties in aiming in this game. Maybe just because the crosshair. The crosshair is REALLY BIG and as far as I know, theres no way to change it.
