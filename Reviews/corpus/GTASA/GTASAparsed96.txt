Does it have bad graphics compared to GTA V? YesDoes the game have a very annoying mission with a train? YesIs this a good game? No, GTA SA is a godlike game that I grew up playing, and I still pick it up ever so often. The singleplayer champain offers you a buttload of fun, and a story with characters that dont seem unrealistic.You can do like me and run the champain two or more times  1 Time without cheats, and a second time with as many cheats as possible.Quick tip If cutscenes bore you, just spawn in a few vehicles, and I promise the scene will get more intresting But back to the game!You play CJ Carl Johnson, thru out the game youll complete different tasks  Everything from small and big robberies, to starting gang wars and saving somewhat innocent people. Or just shoot them, that works too. The game offers you a huge amount of costumizations, and if you get bored of playing alone, there also exist the GTA SAMP Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  Multiplayer which is a mod you can install to join big sessions with a very active community.GTA SA is for the gamer who wants a GTA game where the multiplayer isnt about grinding for money, and where the singleplayer champain is replayable without ever really losing the fun in the missions Especially Wrong Side Of The Tracks  Thats the easiest, and funniest mission in the game
