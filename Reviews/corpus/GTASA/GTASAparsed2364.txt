Classic and good game. Really recommend it cause its fun, somewhat challenging  depending on your preference , and allinall a great way to remind yourself of what you used to play. For those who didnt played this as a kid, might as well play it to see what it was like before GTA V. I dunno, this is my personal opinion about this game I really do enjoy it. 10/10 from me.
