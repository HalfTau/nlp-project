A while ago, I would have recommended this game as one of the greates GTA titles of all time.This is no longer the case.With the new update, all Rockstar managed to do was remove content, break parts of the game, and remove essential components for playing the game on a modern PC.18 songs removed due to licensing issues I can understand, but its really dumb considering how many people paid for that169 and 54 resolutions are GONEMany, many game breaking bugs, such as the inability to use the mouse to aim or move the cameraEither go find a new retail copy of the game IRL, or torrent one. Otherwise youre going to have a bad time.I feel ashamed for ever giving Rockstar my money, now knowing that theyll pull all sorts of Im uninstalling all of my Rockstar games, and will never purchase another Rockstar product as long as they keep mistreating a major part of their audience in favor of underpowered, obsolete, lockeddown babysitting machines.
