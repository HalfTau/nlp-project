One of the best GTA games ever made along with VC! Ive played this game since 2006, so when I was a very little kid and I still play it even today. I completed the main storyline about 4 times.The storyline is simply amazing, it keeps you going, its very easy to mod youll need to downgrade your game to v1 version, unlimited character customization, unlimited freeroam, alot of fun minigames, tons of fun cheat codes, unofficial multiplayer mods SAMP/MTA with many gamemodes which are still popular even today!The graphics may of course be dated, but keep in mind, this is a 2004 game and graphics dont really matter when you have everything else.However there are few bugs in this game if you play it on modern PCs, most of them can be fixed by turning on Frame Limiter and installing Silents patch, Id also recommend Widescreen patches if you want to play true widescreen.Otherwise this game is just pure art. There are even more things than Ive mentioned, but thats the main things I wanted to say! You wont regret playing this game at all.Thank you for one of my most childhood memories, Rockstar.
