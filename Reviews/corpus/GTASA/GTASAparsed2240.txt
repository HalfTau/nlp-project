GTA San Andreas is an absolute classic. It has a great story, characters, hundreds of different vehicles to drive, mod support  a really active community, a huge map to explore with many memorable locations and incredibly well designed and varied missions.I used to play it in my old computer which couldnt run it very well lol and it also gave me my very first multiplayer experience with a mod called SAMP. As a child, i thought this was the best game ever.14.99 is a great price for this game and i recommend it to everyone who loves the open world genre.As i preordered GTA V, i got SA for free on Steam yay! and i was able to easily fix almost all the problems that the PC port had with some mods, such as lack of widescreen support and script bugs.Also a big thanks for all the modding community
