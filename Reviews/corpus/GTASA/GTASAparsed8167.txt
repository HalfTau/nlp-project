One of the best games I have every played! I love the location the characters, Well, not ALL of them, but Ill get on that later and the vehicles! I think this was an outstanding achievment for 2004. But, this is not my favorite GTA, that prize goes to Grand Theft Auto Five. I hear you thinking Its the same location! well its not. It might be in Los Santos, but when I purchased the game this past monday On the XBox 360 I took out the map of the game in the box, and To my displeasure I did not see San Fierro or Las Venturas on the map. But overall, I like it better that GTA SA for four reasons, 1, More likable characters, I personally did not like CJ all to much in GTA SA, to me, he got annoying, really fast, and I have not played to much of GTA VC, so I can not make a judgement on Tommy. 2, The vehicles, they hadle much more realisticly that SA, and also show more realistic damage that SA. Where when you get hit in the side all the doors on that side take as much damages so as they look like thay have been hit by a hand grenade 3, The weapons, that feel more realistic Well except for the silencers that things some some major BS and the the addons make them weapons near perfection to me. and finally 4, I love the story in GTA SA, but GTA Vs story steal the show for me. Play them both and you will understand. But still for all of its flaws, GTA SA is one of the best games I have played. If you can, get both this and GTA V, because they are both amazing. I hope this helped you in making a desicion! D
