This Game greatly reminds me of the Fantastic Nostalgic Memories wheni was 5 years old on the PS2.It has always been my favorite game ever since!! And Im STILL Wating for a part 2 of this Game!!! It is Super Fun. especially if you downgrade to 1.0 and get Multiplayer and mods for single player.10/10
