TO ALL WHO ARE HAVING MOUSE ISSUES WITH THIS GAME1. Run the game.2. Start Task Manager CtrlAltDelete.3. Highlight the game then right click.4. Click Go To Process.should take you to the Processes page with GTA already highlighted5. Right click the game and click on Set Affinity.6. Then its going to ask you Which Processors Are Allowed To Run?.with the options to check on or offAll ProcessorsCPU 0CPU 1CPU 2CPU 37. Check All Processors off and only check on one CPU, doesnt matter which one, but I always just go with the first one CPU 0.8. Click OK when chosen, close the Task Manager and click back on the game and all should be well.9. None of this will work if the game isnt already running before you open the Task Manager.Note This is the fix for Windows XP, Vista  7, I do not own 8, but I would assume its very similar, if not.. theres always YouTube lolother than that bullst and the fact that they took off some of the best songs in the game, its still absolutely amazing to now own this on Steam, memories dog, memories
