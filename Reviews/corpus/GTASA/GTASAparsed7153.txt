This was the GTA that gave you more customization options than any previous GTA game. To this day, its still one of the most customizable GTA games out there. A great story, a great world, lots of fun when youre free roaming too. Working out, pigging out on food, dating your girlfriends, whatever floats your boat, which can also go as far outside of San Andreas as you want it to. This game is packed with an endless amount of things to do outside of missions.
