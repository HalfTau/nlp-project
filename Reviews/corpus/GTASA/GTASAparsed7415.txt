Im for now setting my review to negative. I dont think it is right to remove lots of features during an update without bringing in new updates.  Sure, they might be legally allowed to but a lot of people are displeased with it. Ive heard things about a secret update and I certainly hope that is happening, because thatll make me recommend the game again. For now theres one recommendation which is to pirate it. At the moment pirates simply have more features than people who paid for the game.On top of that GTA SA keeps crashing constantly now when entering a vehicle because of Rockstar not even removing the radio stations properly. fckrockstar
