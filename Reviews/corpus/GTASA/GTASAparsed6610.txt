Overall, the game is okay but, there are some flaws. The ghaphics arent very good. The game takes up 3.8 gigabytes and it took over three hours to download. I have recently realized that you can buy the game on the Windows Store for only 8 dollars. Personally, i dont think this game is worth 15. But the missions are fun and exciting.
