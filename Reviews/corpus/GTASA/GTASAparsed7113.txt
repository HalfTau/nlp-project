This one is almost playable apart from Vice City and GTA IV. Until mouse stops responding and you cant doafter. Then you realise Blewstar did it again, doesnt care a  about thier product.The only thing that was good about whole bundle sale is that wasnt that costly. Now you know the reason. Every game in a bundle just screams we just want your sweet sweet monies!
