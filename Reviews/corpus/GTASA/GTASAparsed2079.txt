Well in short over the years Ive purchased this game 4 different times over different platforms only because this is one of my favorite games of all time. One of my favorite things about GTA games is the cars and how they name them or choose what cars to put in which game and this has my favorite video game car of all time the original Slamvan when i first saw it as a 12 year old it captivated me because its one of the more rare vehicles you can find. Since GTA doesnt use real cars they just blend cars together to make one essentially. Someday i will bring the Slamvan into the real world and ive been inspired to do so by one game GTA SA. buy it. love it. drive the slamvan.
