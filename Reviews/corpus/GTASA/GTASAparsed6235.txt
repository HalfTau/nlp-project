This is a really good classic game. I dont see why everyone is giving this thumbs down just because R took some songs away? This, by far, has the best story out of all the grand theft autos. Obviously the graphics are not on par with Grand theft auto V but boy is this game good. It has allot of customization when it comes to cars and clothes, also tattoos, hairstyles, body weight, muscle, sex appeal and more! Everything about this game is so nostalgic but i would highly recommend using a controller as it makes game play much more enjoyable, especially flying! This game has one of the best maps in any game i have ever played! There is always a place you have never been even if you have been playing since 2005. The story is solid and quite long but most of anybodys time playing this will be driving down the highway listening to krose. One other great thing about this game is that you can install hydraulics in almost any car. Anyway i absolutely recommend  this game as it is just a must buy for any gamer!
