What is there not to love about GTA San Andreas? Well, probably a lot of things if you are a critical gamer, but it still holds up today. Bought this for a few bucks about a year ago, mostly for old times sake. Now Im finding myself playing it every once in a while even though I have almost all newer games in the franchise. Its just that fun.
