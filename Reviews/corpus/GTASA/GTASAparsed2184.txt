This game was my teenhood. Released in 2004 and went into high school in 2005. This and Canis Canem Edit were the only two games I ever played and I swear my mates wanted to kill me because I never shut up about either of them.This is classic GTA, when you could have fun without feeling like youre in a real world.With the graphics, we made use of what we had back then and honestly, nobody gave aanyway.
