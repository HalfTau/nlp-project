I have been sharing games on steam with my brother, and soon enough I came across this game in his library. I instantly fell in love with this game, the feeling of driving and the city reminds me of the Midnight Club franchise, which is also produced by rockstar. I like the oldschool Ps2 feel and the freedom you have in this game, which is unlike any other GTA game Ive played/bought.The downside I have is only the AA Anti Aliasing. The game is filled with jags and I hate jags. In reality though, the game was produced in 2004, so its not that major.I reccomend this game to people who dont have faint hearts.
