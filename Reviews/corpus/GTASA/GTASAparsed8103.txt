Until this game comes out with a mod support version, its too much pain to go through if you want to play on a XB controller. And then at that no mods????? That was a huge mistake for a vastly growing community. Still at that though, it is the classic San Andrea. I want to rate this game a lot higher, but until we as a community have all mod and controller support with down grades.. Id rate the V3 50 out of 100.
