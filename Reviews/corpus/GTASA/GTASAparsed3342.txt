This is far the best Grand Theft Auto game from the series. Some may say that Vice City is the best but everyone has their prefferences. Anyway, this game is really good, and I recommand it to everyone who loves the series, but instead of buying it from Steam, try to buy it from somewhere else because GTA SA Steam edition has a lot of content cut, and you cant mod it using cleo3. But if you wish to buy it from here just to have it in your games collection, like I did, go ahead. The Steam edition can be fixed anyway with some patches from the internet.
