GTA Sanandreas is a great game. one of the best in my opinion, the graphics may not be the best but they were still ible to krank up the 1080 P support for this port. the game runs and plays exactly the same as i remember, and those memorys i will never forget. Rockstar definitly went all out on this game and it will go down in history to be a classic and not to mention one of my all time favorite games 10/10
