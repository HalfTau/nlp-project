If it workd on my computer id be awsome lol but it doesnt  i like the game and i wanted to play it again but i dont feel like playing it on my ps2 but it seems like thats the best thing to do if i wonna play it at all. i like the sales that are on steam but when i cant even play the games i buy it kinda feel like i mite be better off buying it on the original system insted of even trying to play it on my pc.
