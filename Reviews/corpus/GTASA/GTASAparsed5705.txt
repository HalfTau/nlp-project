This game was my childhood even though I had the fortune of playing it when I was grow enough to understand it. I literally learned english its not my native language with it, and the first run was SO good. For that time the map was huge and fun to explore, the interactions seemed to be infinite and gameplay/storyline a continuous surprise and no videogame in my past as a gamer felf so ALIVE as the world of GTA SA. As a kid, this game left me enamoured with the american west coast, the 90s, and their music despite being based in a fictional universe. Maybe now, with the eyes of an adult person and after 11 years from its first release I see this game less deep than before, as the plot isnt really a masterpiece and the game certanly doesnt give the same sensation of freedom a modern and well made free roaming game would give.However, those good memories and sensations are still there including the trill of looking for Bigfoot in game, even though it was revealed to be a hoax xD , and they truly make me think this was the best GTA ever made. So even if the graphics/cutscenes are not comparable to a modern product, I HIGHLY recomend it, I believe it can still give you those things.
