How dare Rockstar remove songs from a game you already purchased before they lost the rights to it. I can maybe have let it slide if they removed the songs from any copies bought after the date in which the rights were lost but no they will just take it from anyone that has a digital copy. And this is whats messed up with the digital only world we have made for ourselves. We have waived our rights of ownership for the convenience of downloading. We no longer purchase games, we rent them and can have them taken from us or modified at any point of time. Can we do anything about this? Well no because when downloading these games you are agreeing to a bunch of legal nonsense that pretty much says we are screwing you over and there is nothing you can do about it. The best part is the consumers of digital games dont get a break anywhere, digital games cost the same as a hard copy, you cant let a friend borrow it, you cant trade it or sell it to a gamestop and on top of all that if they want to remove a bunch of content from the game in the future they have every right too. What do we get? We get Fed in our A for the luxury of downloading something instead of going to a store and just buying it off the shelf. I have fallen for this con many times myself and after dealing with stuff like this I am no longer a consumer of digital goods. Thanks Rockstar, Steam, Microsoft, Ubisoft, EA and the rest of you, you all suck.
