This is one of my alltime favorite games, easily in my top 3. But the recent patch a few months back ruined this game on Steam and Rockstar have been utterly unrepentant about it and have done nothing to fix their egregious mistake. I have no choice but to boycott them and their games and I suggest others do the same. Theyve proven that they cant be trusted and are undeserving of our money and respect.
