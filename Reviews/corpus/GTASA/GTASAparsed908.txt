This game was amazing back in the day, that being said, its aged.... and definitely not well. Unless youre willing to go back to clunky controll styles for the sake of nostalgia, dont bother trust me I used to love the game but its just not worth it folks. If youre able to get past that though I will say this was what the future of GTA should have been the stat system definitely made the game more enjoyable IMO.
