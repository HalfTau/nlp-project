Compared to Vice City and Grand Theft Auto III before it, the map of San Andreas is huge. You play as Carl Johnson, the first black protagonist in the acclaimed Rockstar series returning home to Los Santos swamped with gang culture and corrupt officials watching his every move. You can customize your character greatly by getting a range of hairstyles, tattoos and clothing from various stores. Another interesting and addictive feature is the ability to work out or just keep eating meals and watch your character become obese! You can train up your stamina, muscle, lung capacity, driving skill, bike skill, boat skill, flying skill, weapon skill... you name it. Also, for the first time in the historic Rockstar series, San Andreas is the first game where you can swim so thankfully no more drowning in shallow swimming pools were looking at you Tommy VercettiOn top of the main storyline, you have various collectibles to acquire, odd jobs, side missions, schools, collecting cars, gun range challenges... among more! San Andreas was the final game in the classic GTA trilogy and it concluded said trilogy with aplomb. Simply a must play game. Open sandbox gaming has rarely been this fun!
