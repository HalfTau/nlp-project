Very good game!  Made in 2004 and still going strong!Now before GTA V comes out to PC, I will say that this is the best GTA game I have played since GTA IV.  I thought it was going to be crap because the game was made long ago and didnt have awsum gwafics!, but man I feel stupid.  GTA SA is just months away from being 10 years old and it still is a good game.Not counting graphics at 2014s standards...PositivesGood Storyline involving alot of gangster culture.Awesome open world atmosphere.Vareity of vehicles and awesome and unusual NOT TF2 weapons.Active modding community.Very active multiplayer community. Mod needed.Vareity of activities to do after story. Im looking at you Mafia II.Hate any of your girlfriends?  You can kill them and they wont come back!Side missions with certain vehicles.Add music to the User Track Player radio station. AND NO ANNOYING COMMERCIALS!NegitivesDifficult to mod without downgrading to a lower patch. damn Hot Coffee incident!No ragdoll phyisics. Did they exsist in 2004?And if you dont like the graphics, there are simple mods.Final rating 9.4 out of 10This game is legendary!  No GTA collection is complete without it!
