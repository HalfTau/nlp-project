THEY REMOVED SONGS THAT ANYONE GOING TO BUY THE GAME WOULD BE GETTING ANYWAY BECAUSE NEW COPIES ARE THE REASON THEY HAD TO REMOVE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE!0/10!PIRATE THISOkay jokes aside, not very cool of them to remove a few songs, but something that people should be able to live with. This game is not ruined just because a few songs were removed, so try to ignore those people. This game is Grand Theft Auto, what more needs to be said? From a gameplay aspect, same as the others games, do what you want, kill some hos and have a good time.
