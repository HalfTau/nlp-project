As other reviews have stated, I would have recomended this game several weeks ago. I got it on a steam sale for 1.99 and it was one of the best deals Ive gotten for such a great game. However tar and Steam have literally broken this game. In order to even accept saves from previous versions, a mod must be downloaded if they werent deleted when you started the game. They also removed 17 songs from the radio stations.Things such as this prove to be the fly in the ointment of autoupdated games. Sadly, I must agree with the conesnsus pirate this game or buy a physical copy so that you may enjoy the game as originally intended.
