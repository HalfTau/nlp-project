In my top 3 games of all time, but the recent patch kind of killed it for me. The visuals downgraded and for some reason, my gun smoke isnt grayish/white like it usually was, it is now green like the spraypaint mist while use the spraypaint. The Soundtrack was altered and tracks were removed but those songs technically could just be added back into the game with the custom radio station, but still, Rockstar, GO EAT A SAC OF BABYDIKS.Buy a hardcopy or torrent it at your own risk, because I give this game a 10/10, best GTA ive ever played, and that probably will never change.OH YEAH, ROCKSTAR ALSO RELEASED THE REMASTERED VERSION WITH MUCH BETTER GRAPHICS ON THE XBOX360..GRAPHICS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THE ONES BEFORE AND AFTER THE UPDATE. CONSOLE GRAPHICS GET BETTER FOR THE GAME, WHILE THE  PC GRAPHICS GET IER..ROCKSTAR HAS REALLY OUTDOUCHED THEMSELVES
