Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.The best classic of the grand theft auto series, no doubt.I have played almost all other games of the serie, except for GTA I and GTA II. And I still think this game is the best.Disclaimer I have played a lot in PS2, and I just bought it to PC. That is why i have 0 hours. 9.3/10
