San Andreas, this would have to be one of the most beloved games in the series. It doesnt lag for me at all, the game is great, and would make it even better is if the steam community made a multiplayer mod. Probably happened for all I know, I much rather get it in PC than in ps2 or xbox, even though I have it for all, the graphics are better and I guarantee no lag.
