I bought this game to count my hours as i go through 100ing it, I still have the disk from when i first bought it for PC before i had steam and it still runs as if it was never updated with that patch a lot of the negative reviews are. If you can get passed the patch rockstar added, its an amazing game with one of the largest maps of all gta games. So yes 10/10 would play over and over till i have over 100000000 hours in it.
