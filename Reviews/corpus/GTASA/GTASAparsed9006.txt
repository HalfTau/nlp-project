This was the best GTA when it first came out on the PS2, completely blew away the previous games although, vice city is almost as good. San Andreas is still the best one for me.Maybe its the era of this game that hits me. It has the best radio selection of songs to date adding to the 90s magic of the games world, artists such as L7, Billy Idol, Rage against the machine, Stone Temple Pilots... The station KJah West also has some great reggae hits. Even the pop / hiphop songs are of good taste. Enjoyable music that fits the era makes a GTA game come to life in ways you cant recreate with other types of games.As for the gameplay, Its what youd expect from a GTA game... LOTS OF FUN, and certainly alot to do. If youve not had the chance to play this yet, whether you were too young at the time of its release, or simply missed out... id highly reccomend playing it no matter your tastes. The game has something for everyone. Although, youll need a sense of humour to get through any GTA game without having to phone complaints to the rockstar helpline!
