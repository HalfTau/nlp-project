WARNING THIS HAS SPOILERS, THEY ARE ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION AND THE WEAPONS, ALSO I TALK ABOUT A CERTAIN VEHICLE YOU GET IN THE GAME LATER. ALSO THIS IS FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD, SO SOME INFORMATION MAY BE INCORRECT, FINALLY I TALK ABOUT AN INAPPROPRIATE THING, THIS IS YOUR WARNINGThis game is SUCH a great game, while the graphics do seem a bit lackluster considering it came out in like 2004, if you compare it to HalfLife 2. Also some of the controlls are hard to learn on the PC. Also diving and swimming under water is a problem, i still dont know how to do it, but it is important for a mission of the game luckily i still beat it by climbing on a rock and jumping to a rock in the direction I had to go Name of mission is Amphibious Assualt, you also need a decent lung capacity skill to actually start the mission, to train that you need to dive underwater alot and it takes a decent ammount of time, also the rock I was talking about is where you jump down but you have to look behind you down there to see it, its like right behind you, also there are various glitches and you should save your game alot, like getting killed by a bush or standing on a car and dieing. Ok enough of that let me go into details. I probably took about 30 hours to complete it, 30 HOURS, for a 15 Game thats really good, and while the game frustrates me at times it still is a great game. I cant really talk about the story very much cause of spoilers and stuff and I skipped through A LOT of the cutscenes cause im impatient. Heres the introduction, you are CJ Carl Johnson a gangster who was part of the Grove Street Families GSF whose older brother, Sweet, is the leader of. CJ left San Andreas after his younger brother was killed and went to Liberty City and had a decent life with crime. But when his mother was killed in a driveby its time for Carl to come home.
