Played this game at least 1000 hours on SAMP servers. My only real complaint is about the port and not the actual game, this game simply runs like sht. Though Im getting 90 FPS the game should definatly run better and thats without mods. The audio is fked too, so I had to delete some radio music so when I get into a car the game wont crash.
