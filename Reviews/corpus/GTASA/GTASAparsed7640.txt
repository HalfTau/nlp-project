You know I like this game. It was the first game I bought for the PS2 back when you could still buy M17 games without an ID, and the first game I bought from the Steam client. The latest patch completely ruins it. Im deleting the Steam version off of my computer and getting a different version now. Yes, I recommend this game. But not this latest version. You done ed up, RockStar. First you go and do in around with GTA5 still waiting on those heists, then exclusivewith the PC and NextGen versions GTA5 again, and now with this update. Is it really that expensive to license a few ing songs?  it, Im done. Good bye people! Some random guy has spoken!Tldr, FAWK DIS UPDATE.
