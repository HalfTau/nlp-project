Dont be fooled by the low amount of hours I have on this I originally played over a trillion hours on this game on my PS2 back in the day.Now, GTA SA is in my humble opinion the BEST GTA game in the series.. It was just right....Great storyGreat mapGreat gameplayGreat music in stereoGreat gunplayEPIC CHEATS Come on... ANY GTA player who played this game will tell you they googled some cheats for this and started playing with flying cars and no police and and inifinite ammo with cars that basically DESTORY other cars upon BARELY touching them XDGreat graphics For the time ofcourse... around 10 years... looks good to meOverall I played this game soooooooo much and I just love it. Buy it. Love it. and play the crap out of it untill GTA 5 Hits us soon on the PC D10/10 Grove street 4 life dawgsP.S BALLAS SUX
