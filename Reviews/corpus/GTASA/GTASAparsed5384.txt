This game was MY game growing up as a child...seems odd. But this seriously was my most played game as a child, Its open world amused me and everything seemed to fantastic. As soon as i found out that this game was available on the steam market i didnt hesitate to snatch it up. Even now going playing on it just brings back so many memories, like longcheat codes...THE DREAM! Seriously everything about this game is great considering its 10 years old! If youve only ever played the newer GTAs then your missing out. This is where  in my eyes  they really opened up. Adding features like modding your car, id spend hours making my cars look to just how i want them. Although you might find it hard to play due to the graphics are so bad its like watching paint dry, remembeer that its 10 years old! and even better than a lot of games produced to this day! Youre missing out if you dont buy it, seriously.
