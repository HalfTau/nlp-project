This game was great, the last update ruined it in a lot of ways, the frame limiter turned off causes game breaking bugs, and with the limiter on the game looks horrible. They removed songs from a game i already bought, which seems very wrong to me. The last update supposedly gave us a different version from a mobile port or something, i dont really care. I had a great review for this game before the update trashed it. Whether it is Rockstar or Valve or Steam who is to blame i dont know, but this issue has brought up the scary idea of publishers going back and removing liscensed content from games in your library. beyond that fear, the console versions of gta san andreas got full HD versions, PC did not, it will not play in true 1080 and is overall much worse. I fear the success of console games has made developers stop valueing their pc customers.Terrible treatment of fans and customers.
