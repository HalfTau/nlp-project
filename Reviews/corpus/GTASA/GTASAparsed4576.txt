An undying classic which will stay strong for decades to come.Cheap, fun, memorable and overall just flawless. The soundtrack is purely brilliant and the characters are awesome, voiced by big name actors and musicians. Whoever decided to pick Samuel L. Jackson as a corrupt police officer is a genius.A MUST IF YOURE INTO MODDING!
