This is one of the most terrible PC ports I have ever seen. I really thought it would be better since its in version 3.0, but no. The controls are insanely messed up you cant even pause the game with an Xbox 360 controller, or give commands to followers, or MANY other features, even though it started as a console game AND has an Xbox 360 port. The antialiasing only goes to a pathetic 3, there is no 169 aspect ratio resolution, so dont expect to be playing this thing at anything above 900p.Further, its buggy as all hell. When it boots on my PC there is no Rockstar logo, or intro. The sound is playing, but there is just a black screen. How did they get away with this? The game doesnt even seem to be finished on PC and its been years. Dont waste your money on this game if you expect to be able to play with a controller, or at a decent resolution/aspect ratio.
