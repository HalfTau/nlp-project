In my opinion, the greatest game ever made.Have been playing it since 04, know most of the dialogues and the easiest ways to complete the missions, but I cant not play it over and over again.This version Steam version has some bugs, but most of them are easily solved and dont really affect your gameplay.You should buy it if you want to have a guaranteed good time!10/10
