Well not much to say about this game anymore after the update.Read below why you should not buy it anymore.BEFORE THE UPDATE Vanilla GTA Mod support where no problem. i could actaully add my things to the game without it crashed at loading Well all the best songs where there. I enjoyed this game so freaking much.AFTER THE UPDATE The game cant even load when you run it the first time and has sat everything on fullest i need to play this game in the lowest res now, untill the first mission is done and has been saved, then i can change graphics Songs need the game cant load half my mods anymore. If you are like me that needs to run Oblivion and SRT 3 this game is not for you on steam the Exe file doesnt allow major changes or multiple exes for each mod, this makes it impossible for me to test the new Uboats i made and several planes as they somehow now uses more memory than the steam version allows ive given up trying to find some fixes for this game oh yeah and the mouse keeps disabeling itself now, so you got to go to the main menu use the mouse a bit and then get back into the game.I love GTA SA and have more than about 500 hours of gameplay and even more testing mods i make. but the steam version dont work correctly. in the off steam version, dont include my steam game time, that is only the hours the game spent crashing and causing problems
