Almost finished a mission...Decided too steal a cops motorcycle..Got Busted and restarted the mission.20/10In all seriousness I played this game on the original Xbox when I was younger, it just felt right too buy it on steam during the steam sale for 3. This game is TOTALLY worth more than the 3 I spent for the game, there is a huge modding community inwhich you can just download many mods once you get tired of the game or if you just wanna play multiplayer. Thank you Rockstar for releasing this game, I would pay again.
