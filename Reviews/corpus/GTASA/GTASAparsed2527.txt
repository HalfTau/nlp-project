One advice for gamers with modern PCs Turn on Force VSync and Tripple Buffering with Frame Limiter Off in your graphic card settings and then it will work greatly with 60 fps.A lot of vehicles Cars, Trucks, Bikes, Planes, etc.... and one of the best open world made this game in my opinion to best game of Rockstar.You are able to go into missions or just drive around and make a lot of trouble A specific aspect was that the developers took care about a lot of details in the play set. That made GTA San Andreas unique.
