I think its safe to say this is arguably the greatest game ever created. Obviously other games might have contributed more, but this game contributed a lot to games we play now 11 years later. Its the most fun Ive ever had playing 1 game for endless hours, aside from MOBAs. Only bad thing is the game wasnt really designed for PC so it has a few problems, like the hydraulics cant be controlled quite right. Other than that its a grade A fun game.
