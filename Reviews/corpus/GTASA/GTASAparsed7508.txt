I loveddd this game to death, and it still remains one of my favorite games if not my favorite GTA. Its one of the first games I sunk over 100 hours into, and even more so with the many user mods released over the last decade or so, including two multiplayer ones and the CLEO mods. I figured Id grab it on Steam a couple years back for convenience instead of continuing to use my scratched up disc copy. But a recent major patch for this game actually strips away content rather than add any. It has removed 1920x1080 support, 17 songs from the great soundtrack most likely because of expired royalty/copyright, and replaces most of original menu/HUD with the mobile version similar to the recent Android/iOS releases of this game. You can find the full list of changes elsewhere.I only wrote this as a warning to any friends who may not be aware of this recent change and add a negative review to that column on the Steam store page. Im fully aware how old/irrelevant this game may be at the time of this review.
