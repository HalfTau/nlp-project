BEST GRAND THEFT AUTO EVER! Yeah, sure, 5 has fancy graphics. It would be nothing without the amazing prowess of San Andreas that warranted a return to the city of Los Santos. Its still my favourite gam of all time, at least in the open world type of game. I highly recommend it to everyone who is able to buy, and even for those who cant, BUY IT ANYWAY.
