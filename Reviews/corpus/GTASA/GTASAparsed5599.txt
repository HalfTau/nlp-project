San? In my Andreas? Yes, GTA San Andreas, the timeless game that really set the base for every open world game after it. Apparently the Steam version has some content removed, but I dont really care that much, Ill go play my PS2 if I want the original. If youve never played it before youre probably too young to do it now, but otherwise definitely worth it. The game actually gets pretty hard due to bad pc controls, but if you have a controller you can fix that. Love this game,
