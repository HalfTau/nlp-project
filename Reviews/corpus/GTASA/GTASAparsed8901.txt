Despite minor flaws, this is by far the most enjoyable game in the GTA series, and will eat well over 100 hours of your time.Its like 5 games in one part RPG, part adventure, part action, part racer and part sim. And it does it just as well as the best games in any of those genres...One of the best games ever released on any system.
