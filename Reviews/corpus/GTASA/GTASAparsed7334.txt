Dont get me wrong this is a great game, but holy ! Never in my whole life have I played a game that has crashed this much! Even with the patches and fixes Ive downloaded, I still have a crap ton of problems. Id recommended this game 100 it is by far my favourite gta game, but in this state it would probably be better if you brought the mobile version of the game considering thats a lot more stable.Edit After constant crash after crash I some how managed to get through the game... Man was it worth it, its as good as I remember it. This is hands down one of the best open world games Ive ever played would recommended if you dont get constant crashes like me.
