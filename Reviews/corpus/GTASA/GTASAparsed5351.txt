Its a good game but Rockstar needs to keep in check with their games. Currently it wont start. Even if I delete that file named gtasa.set I was really looking foward to playing a childhood game but now it wont even work. I cant really do anything about it because Steam support sucks and I cant get a hold of rockstar...
