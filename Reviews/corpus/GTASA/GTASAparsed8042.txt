GTA SA is probably the pinnacle of the GTA gaming experience. Still one of the best sandboxes in my mind. The world is so open, and interesting, and there is no comparison. A brilliant game! Excellent graphics for the time, and filled with so many things to do, you probably will eventually find yourself going nuts because it will engulf you and all your time!
