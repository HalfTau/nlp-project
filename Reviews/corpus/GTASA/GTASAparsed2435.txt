While the PC port does need some tweaking to get things running smoothly, It shouldnt discount the fact San Andreas is an amazing game. Sure in some areas it hasnt aged all to well but to put it in perspective, San Andreas was the GTA V of the PS2 era. The story is also pretty good in my opinion, Unlike GTA III and Vice Citys more mafiaesq stories, San Andreas puts you in the role of one of the most beloved gangbangers Carl Johnson. After returning from Liberty City, Carl is reunited with old friends and enemies as he tries to get revenge on the people responsible for the death of his mother in a driveby shooting. With 100 story missions traveling across the entire state of San Andreas, Theres no doubt itll keep you busy for quite some time. The soundtrack is great too, Sure the Steam version is lacking some of the songs from the original release, Granted it isnt really Rockstars fault licensing ran out, Its still a bummer. As for issues with San Andreas running smoothly, I suggest getting Silents Asi loader and Silents patch. The patch fixes numerous graphical and gameplay bugs such as framelimiter be locked at 25 FPS and various fixing lighting and shader issues. Overall, Give San Andreas as shot, Its fairly cheap and is loaded with all sorts of stuff to do. Also the modding community is incredibly strong still so paying 15 is a fair trade off for what youre getting.
