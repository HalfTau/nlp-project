Ok. This game is absolutely amazing in every way possible. I just wanted to get this out of the way right hereHere are the specs of my PCProcessor Intel PentiumCPU B980  2.40GHzRAM 4GBOperating System Windows 10Type 64bit operating system x64based processorGraphics Card Intel HD GraphicsAnd guess what? Im getting over 100FPS! This game is well optimized, and has a great story. There is so much you can do on the PC version that you cant do on the PS2/XB versions. Amazing mod support, great story, great gameplay, and good graphics and frame rate for a terrible PC like mine! Even though Im running the game at low graphics, you cant even tell a difference.The games story is very long, but its so openworld, that it feels like San Andreas is just as big as the GTA V version of Los Santos. I also noticed that this game along with a couple other GTA games has gore in it, which makes it a little more graphic. Im totally ok with it too, just thought Id bring it up.The gameplay mechanics are a little different than the PS2/XB versions of the game. Theres no auto aim on PC unless if you play with the controller mod, but PC gaming is really advanced and I understand why they dont have auto aim for mice. Itll be really easy to get a shot with auto aim if your playing on PC. I also know that the PC version is missing a cheat code from the console version, and there are a few changes to the environment, because the console version and the PC version are not exactly the same either. Its alright though.Ill give this a 9/10, and here is my list of PROS and CONS on the PC versionPROSGreat mod supportGreat storyGreat gameplayGreat performance/optimizationOPEN WORLD BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that should go under gameplayAnd it actually works on bad PCs!CONSMissing cheat codeEnviromental changes between PC and consoleSlight gameplay mechanic changesBad controller support you have to use the controller mod to have good controller supportNo intro at the beginning of the game for me at least, I dont know about other peopleWell, this is my review for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on the PC. I love it, and Id play it any day.
