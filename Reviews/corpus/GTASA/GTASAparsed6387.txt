This is probably my alltime favorite game very atmospheric, great writing, large world to explore, wellcurated/narrated radio stations, and generally a lot of fun. I much prefer this to GTA IV, which looks better, but just feels kind of generic and has horrendous, sluggish controls. San Andreas isnt perfect  theres a mission or two thatll have you pulling your hair out  but it really pulls you into its world. If you can get it for a good price, snap it up.
