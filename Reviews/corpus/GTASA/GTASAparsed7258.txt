I got this and about 4 other GTA games in a bundle. Much like its predecessors, it looks like poop, the gameplay is awful, and it looks like poop. Did I already say that? Even the map, which is usually the main merit of GTA games, is mediocre at best. It is before my time, but so was GTAIV and I loved that. Story is also terrible. The only reason to get this one would be if it had sentimental value to you.
