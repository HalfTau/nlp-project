as you can see I have not played it that long, It is the worst pc port I have ever tryed to play. the controls are royally screwed the pc controls are ok until you try to drive somthing and half the buttons on both an xbox360 and dualshock controler will not work you cant it wont let me bind most the controls and only one anolag stick worksI recommend getting a cracked verision of the game I hear the controls actually work on the cracked version.
