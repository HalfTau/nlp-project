Best game Ive ever played. I mean the multiplayer version of this game SAMP which is best game. I discovered it in early 2010 and never stopped playing it since that happend. This game is much better than GTA Online Yes, I played GTA ONLINE more than 120 hours and this game is still better because you have much more things to do Jobs, bussiness, roleplay, stunt, DM etc. I recommend it to everyone.
