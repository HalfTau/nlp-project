port thats locked to a very cinematic 26 FPS, graphics are inferior to console versionlights dont animate at nighttime, missing soundtrack, very few options for visual settings, CJ is still a busta, while there is 360 pad support, the game doesnt list the buttons as so and instead says junk like JOY 114 instead of B, X, A, and Y button etc., the game was actually good before the Rockstar patch, This is the kind of rockstar likes to do on purpose and for that I will not be purchasing GTA V if things like this continue with their games, not even being GTASA saves this game from being trash
