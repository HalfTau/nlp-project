Nostalgia on a level all its own. This is THE perfect GTA. Everything about the story actually captured me. It has it all Love, Devotion, Honor, Betrayal, Anger, Depression, Acceptence. The memorable voice overs of a full on all star cast. Some of the best damn music to ever have been writen, played on radio stations with script work that I actually still quote to this day. This is what GTA in any form, should have been and always should be.I gave it a nomination that I call No School, Like Old School, because lets face it. This is it!. Remember that day you first got that game you wanted to play when you were a kid, during a time that life just didnt get you down. You grab you favorite drink and snack, grab a friend or sibling and played that game to death. To me this is that game. Of the fun times.. the better times... the good ol days. for you 5, 10, 15, hell even 20 years ago, that one game that got you, and holds you. that old school game. Theres just No School, Like Old School!
