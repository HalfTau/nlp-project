I know everyone is mad about the lost music, and I was too, but to be honest, for the ease of having it on steam, and the fun of playing it again, Im glad I bought it. Great game, still with most of the great music. Just load up Killing in the Name Of on your music player, and enjoy this classic, and remember, no autosave! D
