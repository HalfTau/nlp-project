San Andreas is without a doubt the best of the GTA series to date. It is a superlative title that carries vastly more content than GTA IV. While it lacks the polished graphics of the latter, it is a far more complete experience that will keep you coming back long after you have completed the campaign.HIGHLY recommended. This is one of the best games of the 2000s.
