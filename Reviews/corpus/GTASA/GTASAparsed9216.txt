This is when the GTA franchise starts to become what its most famous for. Again, great voice talent and characters SAMUEL L. JACKSON, MAN!! !, a vast variety of vehicles, lots of stuff to do, a HUGE environment to explore, and infinitely more customization available than the previous games. I go back and forth on whether I like this one or Vice City more, but based on gameplay and sheer open worldliness San Andreas triumphs in every way. A must have.
