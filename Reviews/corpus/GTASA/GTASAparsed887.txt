Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Is a great game in the game series we know as GTA! Great characters, great graphics for that time and a storyline that is both amazing as it is funny. Besides the storyline there is so much other stuff to do. The possibilities are almost endless and you can play this game for many many hours.Would recommend this game to people that love to just walk around, do anything but follow the main storyline and want to randomly kill people
