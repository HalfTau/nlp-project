Was a great game, then I downloaded Windows 10 and everything is messed up. The entire screen is super pixleated and in all of the wrong colors mainly green and looks like doubled vision. It is now a headache to even look at the screen. Non of the files have been tampered with so it wouldnt be that.  If anyone else has had this problem pls help, thanks.
