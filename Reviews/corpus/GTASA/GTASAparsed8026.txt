Definately the worst port of a game Ive ever seen, Rockstar doesnt know anything about PC gaming.Terrible Controls You jump with left shift, and run with space.Incredible amounts of crashing Save often, otherwise,  you.The game looks terrible now Too high a resolution makes it look terribad.If you can get around these problems, the games alot of damn fun, I mean, obviously right? Its San ing Andreas.I suggest buying this game for the Xbox Original, and the PS2. As Modding is basically impossible. So, theres no benefits to this game other than using a trainer to  around, or to get around broken porting.But I cant really blame Rockstar, they dont know anything about PC gaming, and Im glad they at LEAST made the attempt to bring the game to PC rather than make it an exclusive, but  man, its 2014, why is this game STILL having problems with crashing.Whatever, I still reccomend it, but if it persists to crash at pure random its going to be a NOPE.
