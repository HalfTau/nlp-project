After hours of gameplay, Im saying that NO you should not buy this game!Heres some reason.Rockstar completly abandonned this game,I dont care about the 12 or so song that got removed but they know that the game have A LOT of issue and still no fix since Vanilla version.Those who speedrun this game must be some god or something like that,the game is random with surprise which is cool.But the BUGS the GLITCHES are going to get you insane,I tried to finish this game without cheats I got to the second last mission,then boom ceaser cant move and any other gang member too. I had to pickup ceaser in a car and make the gang everywhere cheats.... I cant stand this game anymore.Theres this thing some people call boostocops,spacecops. Which in resume say that Cops AI is Dumb but way too  that you can get busted if you drive your car and bam a police car spawn over your head,BUSTED.I died more than 15 times byyyyy jumping! Hell yea!play this game for fun,not for the story.Oh did I say that you cant beat all mission at 60fps, what do you mean? You cant swim,you cant drive,you cant fly proprely if the frame limiter is off and some mission LITTERALY DESPAWN the ones that you need to protect!100 Bug freePsI know this game isnT made for Windows 7... Im going to gta 4 right after gta san.Buy this on ps2 or xbox!
