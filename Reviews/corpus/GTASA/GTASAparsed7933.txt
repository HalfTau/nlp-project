well, I thought my last review was I dont feel I gave this game enough justice. plus it was me trying to autistically express my feelings on this game like a 5 year oldok, what do I actually think of this game? One of the best Ive ever played. I wish I had played this on the PS2 when it was still pretty popular, but atleast Im playing it now.I recommend this game atleast.
