This is for the 3.0 version of the game. The 1.0 and 2.0 versions of the game are still great.The 3.0 product is a mess and crashes far too frequently. In the games current state I cannot recommend purchasing this until Rockstar patches out the bugs which seems unlikely now with how much time theyre pushing in getting GTA5 rolled out.
