Once again GTA changes the timeline to the 90s. If GTA III and Vice City were about the conflicts of the mafia  then San Andreas is about gang wars.Once again it gives us great music, a great atmosphere... Every GTA game has it, and this one is no different. San Andreas howerer, has the largest mapeven larger then GTA IV I think from the entire series which speaks about the scale of things to do in it!If you like how the America of the 90s sounds to you, then you should definitely check it out if you havent already. Best weapon against bad mood.
