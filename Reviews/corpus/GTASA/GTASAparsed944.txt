The most cancerous shooting system, dull characters, average plot, the only thing thats good here is driving. Yet, i still somehow grew way too  close to just turning it on, hopping into a modded jester or uranus  , turning on my youtube playlist and just driving around. There is some magic to it.you have to enable DirectPlay in system settings to actually run it on Win10
