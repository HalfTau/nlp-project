Firstly I had a few issues trying to get this game to run.I combed the internet for a solution and tried many different things but the game just kept crashing. Finally I found a forum post that said dont run it in compatability mode just tick run as administrator and it worked lol. Simple but effective.There is a lot to do in san andreas. If you are a completionist like me you will get plenty of hours of gameplay out of it though not many of the side activities are worth while in my opinion. One thing i will say after playing for so long the short track list on the radio can become a real pain to hear the same tracks over and over.As for the story im not a big fan. The story is very slow and doesnt really take off till you get to las venturas. I also dont think CJ is as interesting a main charachter as Tommy but that is just my opinion.The world of san andreas is huge. Maybe too big. It can be a pain in theto travel long distances on the road but once you get to fly its not so bad I guess.I expereicned a fair few glitches during my time playing but nothing game breaking or annoying really. Most of it was pretty funny actually like planes dropping out of the sky or trucks driving on top of each other.Im sure by now everyone knows what san andreas is like. Its a GTA game and if your looking for some sandbox action in a boys in the hood meets casino setting then give it a blast.
