GTA San Andreas 3.0 or should I say Steam Version no longer supports modding. As we know, GTA series wont have such a lasting popularity if not for the modding community that keeps the game alive including GTA San Andreas.You need to downgrade your copy to version 1.0 to be able to install mods. Dont worry about the graphical downgrade as visual mods exist to improve your experience ingame.So far, I have only been messing around with the mods and set aside the storyline. Im stuck in completing the High Stakes Low Rider mission due to the lack of controller, so I recommend you to have one when you play.
