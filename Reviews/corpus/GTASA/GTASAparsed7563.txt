After the Update, this game is not worth buying now.its unacceptable to even think about doing something like this. Removing classic songs from the game? I can maybe understand a little due to copyright but still, the music was what made my long driving in Gta San Andreas worthwhile, and they took out 18 songs 18!!!.They also deleted all my saved files which included one where i was more than halfway through the game, it took forever now i have to start all over with 18 songs cut out. The only thing worthwile from this patch is that now it supports Xbox 360 controllers, thats it. other than that its abyssmal. Now i have to replay all of GTA San Andreas on a dumbed down version. Great.
