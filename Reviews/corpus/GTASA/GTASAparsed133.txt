Best GTA ever!Good Graphics  Rockstar Games working for more realistic games. But GTA series, stories are not realistic. Lots of people expecting incredible graphics,mechanics like real life. Man, pls.Incredible storyRadios, very good choices.Car mechanics are good,but the traffic is very bad. Theres lots of bugs in last update, 1.3Ryder was a good man. Its a fault dear Rockstar.Thousands of people still playing MTA, but Rockstar Games dont support it.Btw  They can work on GTASA Remastered thing as like as CoD4MW. That would be better.
