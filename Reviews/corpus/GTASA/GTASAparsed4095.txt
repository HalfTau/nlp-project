GTA San Andreas takes place in the State of San Andreas, composed of 3 main cities Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas and other smaller onesit takes place in the year of 1992, and we play as Carl Johnson, aka CJ, a Gangster that returns to Los Santos after the murder of his mother. MASSIVE open world for the time, and it still feels big today Varied locations, like the 3 different big cities, countrysides, desert, beaches, mountains. Great graphics for the time looks a bit dated now, but tolerable Great gameplay for the time Big selection of cars, Motorcycles, bikes, boats, Planes, Helicopters and even a Jetpack! Good arcade driving physics The story mode is very big, with many fun missions and memorable characters Though IMO the story itself is not that great, but its still good Great, varied selection of weapons The GTA game with the most side missions and stuff to do yet. Parachuting was introduced to the series for the first time Swimming got introduced to the series for the first time Vehicle customization was introduced some cars, like lowriders and tuners, have more options than most RPG elements added, like Stamina improvement, fat/muscular system, multiple fighting styles, independent weapon skill, driving/riding/flying skill and schools for each, etc. Massive character customization, besides the clothes, that can be changed independently stuff like hats, chains, watches, bandanas, jackets, shorts, pants, etc. , we can change the Haircut, beard, add tattoos, get fat, skinny, muscular, and everything in between. Great soundtrack, as expected from a GTA The Dust is my favorite radio station, but most of them are great HUGE mod community Collectables, there are SO MANY of them only matters if you want 100 completion and dont like collectables Gets stretched visuals on widescreens To fix this I recommend the widescreen Patch by ThirteenAG The Gangsta style can get a bit annoying, or fun, its a matter of taste. Im not really into thisI also recommend the silent patch, by silent, that fix many bugs of the gameOne of the best games the favorite of many and the one that introduced me to the series, part of my childhood, even better than V in some ways, Completely recommended!
