Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.For once, rockstar has done something I really cant approve of. This was such a good game back in the day.Unfortunately, the butchered sound track and updates have made me upset that I foolishly bought this game.Constantly thinking about the good ol times? Back when CJ roamed the streets of San Andreas with his GS bros?Killing pedestrians, getting five stars and hiding in your unkillable zone somewhere in the city, lot of fun right?Yeah, it was. Now, after buying this game I realized to most likely irrelevent things most people already know.One, the graphics back then were shotty at best, how did I think that this was high quality back in the day?Ultimately I cant say this enough,Rockstar
