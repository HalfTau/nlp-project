This is pure 90s nirvana. The level of accuracy in terms of theme, design, clothes, surroundings, language, etc, this is as close to real 90s gang warfare as you can get. The graphics are sub average, there are lots of glitches, and the controls are not so well. But that enables you to run it on anything you want. If GTA5 based on this game, you know its legit.
