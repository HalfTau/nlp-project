Over the years since playing this game on the Playstation 2 and running a pirateversion during the fall of 2011, I have always found myself craving this game from time to time. Now, I finally have a legitimate copy that I can always go back to.This game was far ahead of its time when it was released and it remains to be one of the best if not the best games out there despite the backwards graphics. There is so much to do that it just never gets dull.You want to live on the country side? Done. You want to live by the beach? Done. You want to play dress up? Done. Then there is the big one... Steal cars? Done!I have spent many hours taking my lifes frustrations out on the artificial people in this game as I didnt have to deal with any legal consequences. This game was like an extension of my real life and allowed me to vicariously live fantasies that were otherwise impossible for me.Looking for a game with great playability and longevity? Look no further.
