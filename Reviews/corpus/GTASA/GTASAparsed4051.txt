Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has to be one of my favorite games of all time. After beating it for the third time now, it never seems to get old. What DID get old really quick was how they messed up the PC update for this port. At random times it would crash, and it even crashed on the last cutscene of the game! God DAMN that made me mad.The game runs likeat max settings, so what you need to do to make it run better is to change the Visual FX to Low and the Draw distance to a 4 or lower found in settings under advanced. After you do that, the game runs like a dream. And dont worry about the graphics quality going down, as far as I can tell it doesnt affect it. Besides that, the game will run fine.Every single mission in this game is like 10 times easier than their console counterparts because of the ability to use the mouse to shoot and having all the controls in one place. Missions that took me hours or days to complete Supply Lines from Zero, took me a couple of tries to do and I beat it. Amazing.Even with all the crashes and stupid updates, the game is still fantastic. Dont be discouraged by all the other bad reviews you see in the review section, all theyre ing about is the last update Rockstar made to it. If this game is on sale, or even full price, you MUST buy this game, no ifs, ands or buts about it.
