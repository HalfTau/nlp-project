Great game, a true classic for those into their thirdperson open world games.BE WARNED I bought this game with double to 10x the performance on the minimum specs and I get huge stutters and low FPS for some reason or another, so I highly suggest being careful if you do decide to buy this game. Ill look into my issue soon enough.
