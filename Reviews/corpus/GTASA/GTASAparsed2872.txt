I do not recommend the steam version. The steam version is impossible to mod not an exaggeration its actually impossible and you have to downgrade the game to mod it, and to get most of the soundtrack back. Oh, and the steam version is really buggy.I downgraded and now I cant play the steam version, but its now a non steam game, so dont base this review on my hours.This video will show you how to downgrade your game from 3.0 to 1.0
