Yeah, thanks Valve, and thanks Rockstar, for saving me money next February. I was going to buy Grand Theft Auto V on the PC, more than likely using Steam, more than likely at full/fool price,  but if you are pulling this completely idiotic, nonsensical, stupid, backwards, meshugenah, daft, silly and completely foolish garbage on a game I already bought and paid for, one of my favourite alltime games ever, you can forget about it.Break the resolution all you want, thats fine. I dont run with the original Steam version of the gtasv.exe because I live in the second decade of the twenty first century and high resolution, 1080p gaming is what Im used to, and theres a warez app for that. But removing all those songs? Because Rockstar is too flat out lazy to pay the license fees on them? There are no words for that that arent obscene in four languages.Game updates are meant to make games better. Not worse. You bloody idiots.
