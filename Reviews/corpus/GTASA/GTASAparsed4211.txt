Man, GTA San Andreas has been one of my favorite games of all time. Next to the remake of Doom, this game has a very coherent story, charismatic characters, an excellent abundance of weapons and vehicles that are thrown at your disposal, and a beautiful atmosphere to play around in. After playing IV and V, this is still the best GTA for me if the game isnt broken, dont fix it.
