When I ran the game for the first time I had an issue with the driving mechanic, I went into settings and turned some settings on and off, and when I ran the game it crashed. Since then it hasnt worked, Ive tried turning the PC on and off, reinstalling it, EVERYTHING. The game just wont start.Gonna leave a no on if I recommend it, but from all Ive seen it looks pretty great.
