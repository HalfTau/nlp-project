San Andreas is shocking, not necessarily because of its typically contentious subject matter though theres plenty in it to rub those of a conservative disposition the wrong way but because of the sheer scale of the experience... Is it really the best game ever made? Quite possibly, yes.Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a game hailed as being one of the most revolutionary games every made, and for good reason. This game allows players to go and do whatever they feel like. Buying new safe houses, causing havoc, playing poker, get tattoos, and a whole lot more. Open world exploration mixed with a variety of ways to create unrest is just in the palms of your hands when you first step into the game. This game deserves to be on the top of many players lists when they think of the games that changed the game industry, and it deserves to be one of the best games ever made, along with HalfLife and all the others. This game is one of the best games Ive had fun with, and I think youd have some fun with it too.Rating 10/10
