Thanks a lot, Rockstar.You had a great game and now youve ruined it. You cant just switch a good version of the game with the mobile one and say its okay. Where are my 169 resolutions? Where are my songs? I payed for that, you s.Im not buying your  games anymore.Dont buy this This version is not feature complete.Play it on PS2, or find the good version through other means.
