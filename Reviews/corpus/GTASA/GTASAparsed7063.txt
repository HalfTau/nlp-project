See Edit below...This isnt the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas i know from 2005!Dont BUY this GAME, waste of money, Rockstar updated it to a crap ported version of the mobileandroid version to the steam.And with that, the game is full of bugs, glitches and is unplayable, i cant even pass the first mission because of the mouse bug.And because of this update, they removed 18 songs from the original version, including, ozzy, james brown, bob marley and many others!Go play retail or the pirated version instead, and for those who won a copy of this crap port from androids by Buying the preorder of Grand Theft Auto V, just hide this game on your library and write a review saying that you hated this version!My review is 0/10.DONT BUY THIS GAME!EDIT After days of searching the web and trying to solve the unplayable problem, i found that after downgrading the game and with the silentpatch, my game was playable againremoved songs was back, like it was before that ridiculous rockstar patch, and i was able to use mods, so, i can finally enjoy what San Andres has to offer, but it was way too difficult too find the good balance between making the game work and the mods.My second review with the current statedowngraded and silentpatch is 8/10.
