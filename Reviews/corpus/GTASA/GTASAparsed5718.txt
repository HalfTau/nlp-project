This is definitely one of the best GTAs of all time. The story and characters are amazing. However, this game does lack in graphics and some features autosave, cant reload guns must fire entire clip, no true 169 aspect ratio support, 30FPS lock with 14ms delay, etc. There are tons of little issues as mentioned before. One might say, there are mods that fix that, and they would be entirely correct. However, the version on Steam you get is unnmoddable, and if you downgrade to V1 the only version that works with mods, it will crash often. Another thing that gets on my nerves is that saves from one version are incompatible with another, so you cant switch between an unmodded and modded GTAs.So, in conclusion, the game itself is great, but how Rockstar made this game is just truly awful. Id recommend this game for those who want to play a classic and can put up with bad ports.
