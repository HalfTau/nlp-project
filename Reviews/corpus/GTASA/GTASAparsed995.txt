Typically, this is not the kind of game Id choose to play. But for nostalgia sake saw my cousin playing it decades ago and a bit curiosity, I decided to buy and try it for myself.Best purchase ever.Fun missions, hours and hours of compelling gameplay  story, I barely realized I played this games for 12 hours straight in my weekend! The characters are also really colorful and memorable the crazy hyperbolic world of gangsters and criminal underworld is new for me yet it was so refreshing.Ive recently finished this game, and I still have some side missions and things to do for 100 completion. Will take my sweet time to do it while leisurely wandering around the cities.Grove 4 Life!
