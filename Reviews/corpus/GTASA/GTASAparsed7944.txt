Now who can forget what was at launch labelled as the greatest game for the consoles of the generation? PlayStation 2 and id imagine, the Xbox. Not sure what much there is to say here as a Its probably been covered in another review, or b you already know it.All you need to know is that for me the game has not had any major malfunctions and seems to be working.
