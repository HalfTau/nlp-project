I underdstand Im trying to run an old game on new hardware but this game is unplayable, it constantly crashes because of random things, Ive tried multiple fixxes included deleting files, and downloaded a few mods that are supposed to fix some issues, and Ive also tried to use some official patches, nothing worked, if you have an old pc kicking around get it, but other than that it may be unplayable.
