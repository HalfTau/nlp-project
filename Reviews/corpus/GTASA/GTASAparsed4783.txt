One of my most played games of all time but definetly not perfect. Saying I know this game like the back of my hand is an understatement I know this game like its my best friend. This game although not perfect has some serious pros and some serious cons. First on the pros side their are a couple upsides. First the game world is vibrant and reactive and makes you feel like the one in control. Second the car custominzation is deep and varied allowing you to make some seriously neat whips. Third and finally this was the first gta game that offered pure freedom and every aspect which gives it a touch of charm. Moving on to the cons. First of all the missions although varied are either incredibly diffcult or extremly easy making the diffculty spike uneven. Second the game has aged terribly and thats not a understatement this game has some seriously murky textures and the game world is shrouded in fog at points. Finally and in conclusion this game has terrible side missions that even the most seasoned of gta players wouldnt want to particpate in. In conclusion this game is worth a buy if you want to play it casually or do little to no missions but if youre in it for the long haul youll quickly start to get bored of the story lines and its diffculty spiking missions.
