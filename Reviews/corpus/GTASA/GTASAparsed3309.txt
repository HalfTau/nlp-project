Beyond a few technical issues that cna be solved by taking a visit to the PC Gaming Wiki, I dont think there is anything negative about this game I can say. Yes the game isnt graphically impressive, even in comparison to other games from 2004/5, it is, in my opinion, the best game produced by Rockstar. Combine the already great game with thousands of mods built over the years and the Multi Theft Auto a multiplayer mod then are hundreds of hours of fun to be had playing a game that runs on a potato.
