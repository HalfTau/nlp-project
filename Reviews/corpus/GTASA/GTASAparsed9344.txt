Really good, and probably the best of the series. My only gripesZeros RC missions theyre optional but I really wanted to complete them and it was a painFlight school this halted my progress in the game for a long time...At some point you need to increase your swimming level to receive a story mission, and there was pretty much no reason to swim at all up to this point in the game. Increasing your swimming level consists of going into some water for a bit. Nothing interesting about it.
