Let me begin by stating that I am a gangsta G in real life and this game doesnt accurately portray the lifestyle I lead, dog. Never in my gangbanging adventures have I ever encountered a ragtag band of rapscallions adoring green attire to represent their crew. I must confess I found myself draw to the plight of Carl and his endearing quest of truth and retribution, but dat sucka cnt weld a gun lol busta need 2 go bak 2 gang school nomsayin
