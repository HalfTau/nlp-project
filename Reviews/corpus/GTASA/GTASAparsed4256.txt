uuuugh what a dissapointment. when i was about 8 years old, i begged my dad for this game. The first gta game i played was vice city. I then did some research for other gta games. i saw gta sa and begged for it. i got it and played it to death. then when i was a older i bought a computer. downloded steam, and bought this game. The game that R released is not the original game. Some of there music lincences expired which made them have to remove 18 songs. I love this game......but its not the same as the ps2 version. but still enjoyble. I still do reccomend this game for pc, ps2,ps3,xbox,xbox 360,android, and ios. GET THIS GAME
