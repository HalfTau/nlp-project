This game was and still is the When I got this on the PS2, I played it all the time. I still cant believe I never got bored of it after about 2 years of it being almost the only game I played. The newer GTAs came out and they were pretty sweet with the insane graphics, but it didnt feel like GTA anymore. It lost the whole, how would you say, Grand feel to it. Sure you could still jack cars as the title states, but it just lost its touch after San Andreas. No GTA can top this one in its gameplay value. This is a classic that many overlook because of its graphics. I say fck graphics, its about gameplay.On a sort of related noteOne of the reasons I made this reviewPositive Reviews Based on funny moments and all round enjoyment.Negative Reviews Based on an update.Some people just dont know the difference between a review of an entire game and btching about a single update.Get a downgrader kiddos and quite whining.
