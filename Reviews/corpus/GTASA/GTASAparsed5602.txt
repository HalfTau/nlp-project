I spent my high school years playing this game series. This is, in my opinion, only barely nudged out by GTA V. GTA IV had nothing on this. Great story, great graphics for the time, gameplay was solid, extremely fun, and highly rewarding.For some reason, this version isnt good. It crashed when I died. Im pretty disappointed.
