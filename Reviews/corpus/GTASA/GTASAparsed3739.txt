This game is my childhood right here. I remember being like 9 years old thinking I was a straight savage playing an adult game. Ive beat the whole game on a lot of the systems such as PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360 and of course, the PC version. I definitely recommend this GTA  SA if youve never played it before.
