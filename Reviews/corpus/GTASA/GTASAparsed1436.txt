This game was the one of the best on my 500 hour playtime on the PS2 and it still is today. Thought I could try playing a GTA game on PC and it is a different feel to it using mouse and keyboard. It took me a while to learn the controls but I got it down. Playing this game at the highest graphics settings the game looks pretty decent, but wont get that constant 60FPS. Just 2530FPS, but Im not complaining. Im happy I get to play this game again.
