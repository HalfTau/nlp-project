hours and hours of this on the PS2Fave radio station was KRose ONE STEP FORWARD AND TWO STEP BACK! QUEEN OF HEARTS! DEAR JOHN! when this game first came out 8 year old me didnt think it would be any good because of the negro and me not really ever knowing a black person irl before back then i just thought they looked weird and coming from vice city and gta3 i was used to a normal looking guy with a standard hair cut. buuttt then i played this game and WOW fire spreads, fast food, more cars, THE FREKKING COUNTRY SIDE!? A DESERT! ?vice city massively upped my expectations in what video games could offer, then san andreas came around and done the same again.i find the game a little unplayable/boring now becasue of the spoils of modern games, but ill never forget young me pretending to be a real pardon my french ni gger gangster
