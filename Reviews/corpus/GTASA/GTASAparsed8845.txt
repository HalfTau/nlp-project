Tis game really enables the user to engage in a realistic environment full of life and people to blast on. I had played this game with zero expectations and had been astonished at how well and how real it feels to ninja fools. I can easily say that this is the best game released in 2014. Best of all, I dont even have a computer monitor or TV to play on, but thats ok! This game supports 2 cardboard boxes held together with chewing gum with an astonishing resolution of 0x0. Buy this game unless you a busta.
