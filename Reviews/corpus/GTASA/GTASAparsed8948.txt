The best GTA game ever made, yes, no matter how fantastic GTA5 is, it wouldnt exist if it wasnt for this game.This game set the standard that we all came to expect from Rockstar, GTA5 was their realisation of that after the poor reception they got for GTA4, even though that was kinda fun but not as fun as this game.If youve never played this game before, where have you been all these years?Get it, play it, love it. Thats all I need to say.
