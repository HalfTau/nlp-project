Personally one of my favorite games EVER! It has a great story mode definetly the best out of all the gtas I havnt played 5 yet. It has one of the most satisfying endings for a game. And overall, its a great game... So go buy it!P.S. The MiniGun helped me beat the final boss in under 4 seconds... Just a tip.
