This game is very old now but its still 1 of the most fun games Ive played in a while even when you complete it there is soooooo much to do like little missions or activitys.Only down sides to this game would be the fact that you lose your guns after death, stupid npcs following you and kind of spoiler  that at a point in the story line you cant do everything you used to be able to.The story line is pretty good its the familiar to other rockstar games and is 1 of my favourite types.
