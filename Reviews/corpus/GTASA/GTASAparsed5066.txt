Bought this in the steam sale as a bit of nostalgia. Had this on the PS2 and its an amazing game, the game play is fun, the music is great and the characters are probably the best in the series not sure about GTA V. Game starts and plays fine no issues so far.The game obviously is a little dated graphically but everything else makes up for that, defo worth it for that little trip down memory lane
