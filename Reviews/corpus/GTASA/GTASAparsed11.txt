One of my all time favourites. The game has aged really really well, the graphics are just fine and mods make it look super nice! Great story, I personally love it. However, if you are looking forward to getting it I advise you downgrade the game so that you can use mods and stuff. This game is going to be remembered for a long long time. 10/10, Ive already played it, just wanted the Steam version.
