i would definitely recommend this game if there wasnt these issues. before it broke altogether, sometimes i couldnt move the camera. when i tried to install it on another PC it says im missing some audio input.dll thing. i dont remember what it exactly was. and downloading took from 215PM to 1136PM. which is ridiculous because the PC is 10X stronger than my laptop. upon further investigation i needed some DirectX thing reinstalled. i looked it up everywhere and the only place to download it was. but we all know thats not legit. after about 2 days of working on this crap i quit altogether. if it worked right, i would say its a magnificent game with mystery, adventure, entertainment, and so much more. but this is so ridiculously complicated to fix on this PC that after 2 days of constant searching for solutions, i quit. sorry rockstar games, but another classic game with great quality was messed up. if someone managed to actually read this and care at all, i would be GLAD to see if someone has a solution. i looked in forums, wikis, guides, and even microsoft sites. but nothing worked. thanks for reading this if you actually did. im just very dissapointed in how it was broken. i even considered looking for my PS2 and trying to fix it and my gta sa copy.
