This is a huge disappointment.  I played, and loved, GTA3 on PC back in the mid 2000s.  I remember my parents coming into my room and asking if I was playing good games.  Of course I said, see, its just a racing game, you just drive around. So when I saw all these older GTA titles go on sale I was really excited to finally play San Andreas.  After all, I live just 40 miles from Los Angeles, it felt like home in a way Liberty City never could!I was soooo disappointed.  This is a terrible port, and it looks like nothing has been done to make it functional on a modern PC.  I couldnt even get the game to run in 1080p.  I couldnt even get it to run in a wide screen resolution.  The graphics were shocking, certainly GTA3 didnt look like that on my penciltrick AMD Duron?And the controls, also shocking.  No other PC game ever made has used these controls.  Why not use the same controls are GTA4?  So plug in an xbox controller, because you will never get those PC controls working right.This game is a shame.  Unfortunately, I decided it was a good candidate for my Nexus 7 Tablet.  I was wrong, the touchscreen controls are unworkable.  So the game is dead.  I wish that Rock Star would remaster it somehow.  Maybe thats not possible.  Maybe we should just go out and buy Nvidia Shields for these old titles.  I see no other way, and I still dont know the story behind GTA San Andreas.
