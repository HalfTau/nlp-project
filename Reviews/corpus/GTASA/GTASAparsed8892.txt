GTA San Andreas is most defiently one of the best games Rockstar has produced,There is a full array of missions mini games as well as unlockable gear by doing jobs through taxi cops fire brigade pimping stealing, there are stats like muscle and fat, as well as guns stats that allow you to become a more dangerous, there is a good range of selection in clothing and car customization and many easter eggs to find, so much to do and so much more fun to gain. i highly recommand this to anyone.
