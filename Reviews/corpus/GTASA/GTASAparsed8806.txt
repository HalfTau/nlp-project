Did not work for the loongest time, but when it does work its extremely slow and unresponsive. Control bindings are not meant to be for PC, even if you change them, you cant manipulate the camera in any way and there is no use of the mouse during gameplay. I like GTA San Andreas but definatly not for the PC. In my opinion, a waste of money. If youre going to buy it, get it for the xbox or playstation.
