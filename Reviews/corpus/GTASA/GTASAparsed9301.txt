Youve played this game. Do I really need to recommend it? Anyway, it is my personal favorite, as Im sure it is to the most. Famous for a controversial mod, monster trucks, gang wars, mods, jetpacks, getting fat and working it out to supermodel fitness again, hell even an online fanmade modification that lets you play the game with other players. It even has its own myths and legends, and the iconic locations and fun weapons, overall not a single part of the map feels boring.
