DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM. I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW THIS GAME GOT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT IS BROKEN BUGGY GLITCHY SO MANY MISSING CONTENT.Ive played this game countless times and completed it numerous times. However i have never seen this much bug in this game before. Ive just bought it on discount to add it to my collection and i suddenly regretted it. Last warning do not buy this game neither in its full price or discounted price it doesnt worth it. And because of my play time on steam they didnt accept my refund request. Im sorry it took 7.9 hrs for me to figure out the bugs and glitches of this XBOX port has. I still cant belive that steam lets selling of thisin their platform.
