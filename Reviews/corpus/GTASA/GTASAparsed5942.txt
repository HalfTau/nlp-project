Download the game. I played this game in the past many times. Always illegal downloads. It was all working fine. I wanted to play this game again just for nostalgic reasons. I bought the game and I am very disappointed. Many bugs. Many, Many bugs. Cars brake when Im not pressing W. Or the back starts to wiggle a lot. In the mission where you had to steal crates from the old mans house I sometimes randomly died without a reason when picking up crates. Thats why I failed the mission 6 times. And that are only 3 of the many bugs I noticed. If you want to have a better experience, just pirate the game.
