Rockstar/TakeTwo made PLENTY of money of GTA V. Multibillions, in fact. Notice the b in billions. Yeah that much. What Im trying to say is that they have the money to relicense the songs in this once great game San Andreas. But no, they say f the fans and the game, instead of spending a hundred grand or so pocket change for them to relicense these songs for another decade, lets just remove them. Who cares about the music being a huge part of the game! We want people to play GTA V, not this, so lets worsen their experience by removing quality content.
