At first, I loved this game. That was probably just my nostalgia boner poking through. Lets start off by saying that this game has MAJOR optimization issues, as do all old school GTA games. CJ cannot look around with the mouse. At all. Or at least I cant find a way to fix it, making me have to play the game with the  gamepad. And even worse, the game wouldnt even start unless I ran it in compatibility mode. The cameria is jittery as all hell, and sometimes  itself and wont work at all even with a gamepad. On another note, every time I take my finger off the accelerator, my car instantly screeches to a stop. The brakes are always engaged, making it impossible to drift or even turn reliably.But I have to admit, the game itself is absolutely fantastic. It actually has a storyline, which already differs from other earlier GTAs. Every character is likeable and memorable, and the voice acting is great. And the RPG stats that CJ can gain or lose depending on what you do really does wonders to make this game feel more immersive and alive. The world is huge, which further adds to the realistic feel. The radio stations are great, and i love to just cruise around the desert and listen to them.Overall,  it was an amazing game, but a butt port to the PC. If everything worked correctly like on the console, Id give this a 9/10, but because it is marred by serious design issues Im gonna lower it to a 6/10. I wish there was a neutral button.
