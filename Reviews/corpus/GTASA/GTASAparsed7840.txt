This game was realsed 2004/2005 depedning on where your from. I have always had to have a copy of this amazing game, Rockstar makes the best fantasy/roleplay games taking you into a crimalns organziation in any type of seeting. San Andreas is my faviorte GTA game ever, If you ever wanted to be a gangster in the 90s etting this will be the perfect game for you. Besides the ocasianly killing and going on unimaginable killing spress or commting crimes this game has one of the BEST story in the whole gaming world. I would say even if you are not a GTA fanatic I would sure pick up this game from the endless fun doing anything you can imagine.
