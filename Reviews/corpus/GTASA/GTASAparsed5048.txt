Worst version of the best GTA especially after the update.Get the vanilla PC version instead and use the PS2toPC features mods hereRestores virtually all the missing effects from the PC version that were in the PS2 version like reflection shaders on the vehicles, the distinctive background sun flare, blurred rotors, better alpha blending for transparencies like grass, onscreen display fixes, missing parked cars and entire vehicles, bug fixes for vehicles, and a ton more.The mods even add full and true horizontal plus Hor widescreen that isnt available on any other version of San Andreas as well as the option to increase draw distance for elements like vehicles, pedestrians, environment objects and buildings, and shadows.In the same pack of mods there is a Ginput mod that allows you to use Xinput to control San Andreas and III or Vice City as well as they were originally on console platforms.Examples of the PS2like mods in action can be seen hereThere are similar mods for GTA III and Vice City on PC which add in effects found on consoles removed from the PC versions that you can find belowP.S. GTA V is overrated, San Andreas is still the king
