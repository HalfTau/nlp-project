A few months ago, I would have saidIf you have not played this game yet...Do it. NOW.Seriously what the hell are you waiting for?Now I say get a physical copy something similar cough, anything, but avoid the DRMversion of San Andreas. In case you didnt know, Rockstar released and forced a new patch upon us that removes 18 songs from the game some legal issue t, it also deletes your current savegames, it makes SAMP impossible to use and the PC port just gets worse overall, as it supports less resolutions as well.Like I said, get this game, BUT NOT FROM STEAM or any DRMservice for that matter. The patch ruins it all. Just get a physical copy and avoid patches.
