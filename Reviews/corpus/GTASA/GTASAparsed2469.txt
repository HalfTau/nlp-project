The name of this game should be changed to Grand Theft Memes or MemeADreasOn a more serious note, I believe this game has lots of replayableity for I played and beat this game on the PS2. Years later on PC, and again on PC. So three times so far, and I am going in for a fourth soon. There is so much hidden details that you miss on your 1st play through. Like how in the casino you can over bet and go into dept. When you too and dont pay it back, you get hitmen after you. Or how if you do not increase your HIDDEN luck trait, random planes will fall from the sky and kill you Though this is rare and I omost been hit before.I would recommend this game to anyone who wishes to have a game they can play again and again. Plus it is moddable Though you need to downgrade it to a nonsteam version. But mehIf you played GTA V, you may or may not agree with me on this. I personally feel like SA has a much better cast of characters and a better story. The characters have time to develop and change, while in V in my opinion it felt rushed.
