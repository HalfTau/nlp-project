I wish there was a new next gen remake of this game. I know that is cliche, but this was my fav GTA game because it was extremely funny and fun to play.All the things that made GTA and more! The downfall now is that it is really buggy to run and the difficulty between missions can make you want to smash your TV.If you can get it to work, your in for a treat! Unless you hate dated graphics!
