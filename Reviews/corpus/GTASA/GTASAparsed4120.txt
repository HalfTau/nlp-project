Out of the Grand Theft Autos Ive tried so far, this is my favorite. I downloaded something like five of them in a bundle as the series was so popular for years. Thought If it has been so popular, Im bound to like some aspects. Ugh. Wished I hadnt. Not my taste at all. This one? Its like they wrote it for how life is at this moment with racism and all. I was shocked by the words used. I would not recommend any of the Grand Theft Autos for anyone under 18, especially this one I know  those of you who already play more of it probably are like derp  of course. This specific version is not politically correct but on some points it feels like it reflects how some people are treated today by cops and, no, Im not a cop hater  I just know there are good and bad on both sides. For the GTAs Ive played, though, this has been the most fun for riding a bike and everything related to driving. So, for that, Ill give it a thumbs up. But if you dont like being offended, dont buy this.
