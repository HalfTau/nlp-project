I love this old game but MAN what in the world is up with all the bugs to this PC version? Im having stuck camera problems, black screen no response problems, everytime i go to the gym and try to walk out it just walks right back in. The xbox version did not have as many of these problems. Steam needs to address this people still play this game ya know.
