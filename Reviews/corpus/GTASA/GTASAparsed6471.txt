GTA V is out for PC...BUT GUESS WHO DOESNT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO UPGRADE HIS ING SPECS FOR IT!!! THIS GUY!!!  At least I can still play San Andreas, The game with the same map as it...oh wait...they downgraded the resolution on it...oh wait...it runs on Xbox 360 and PS3 HD graphics...WELL  ME LIKE A CJ DURING THE HOT COFFEE MOD!!!  at least this is the best GTA...after 5...of course... I mean, with all the downgrades rockstar did for its remastered t for console and mobile, its story and concept is still there. The only problem here is I sometimes get frequent crashes where after a cutscene, the screen just turns to black, and i feel like a blind man.  At least it was a better lesson to save your game frequently than the Gyroid Face from Animal Crossing.  Now onto the part where I tell you what this game has to offer.  The first black protaganist in GTA...The first GTA with the ability to actually aim down your sights...The First GTA to let you roll around while aiming to make you feel like a total badass...Basically the first GTA to do anything...except take cover...you still zigzag to avoid bullets.  Now onto the part where I try to say stuff that you might like to do and then say that this game is for you... DO YOU LIKE TO  UGLY PIXELATED HOOKERS?  YOU WANNA DATE HOODRATS?  YOU WANNA RUN A GANG?  YOU WANNA OVERTHROW OTHER GANGS?  YOU WANNA BE A ONE MAN ARMY IN A GANG WAR WHERE IF YOU KILL 3 WAVES OF GANG MEMBERS, YOU AUTOMATICALLY CLAIM THAT PIECE OF LAND FOR YOURSELF?  YOU WANNA ...YOU WANNA...you wanna...wait, let me see here...I had a whole damn list written up...come on, all I can do is continue writing ellipses to give the illusion of pausing...ah, here it is... ahem YOU WANNA SHOOT THEOUT OF SMOKE FOR BEING A ING FATASS THE ENTIRE FIRST PART OF THE GAME?  YOU WANNA WRECK  YOU WANNA EXPERIENCE STEREOTYPES?  YOU WANNA TRY AND BEAT THE GAME WITHOUT USING CHEATCODES, EVEN THOUGH YOU PROBABLY WILL USE THE INVINVIBILITY ONE TO WRECK HAVOC ON THE CITY?  YOU WANNA USE THE HESOYAM CHEAT TO MAKE YOURSELF RICH AND GIVE YOURSELF MORE HEALTH WHEN YOURE AT THE LAST PART OF A MISSION AND YOU ING DIE AND HAVE TO START ALL OVER?!?oh, ok. I mean, i thought you did, since, you searched up the game. I mean, if thats what you want, its cool, i guess...Oh, the rating? Oh yes, right...umm, out of what? 5 stars? /10?  you know what, to hell with it... 6 STARS BRINGITON CHEAT CODE FOR BEING A GREAT GAME EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NOT BEATEN IT YET BECAUSE IM TO BUSY ING AROUND IN THIS GAME, BUT THAT DOESNT MATTER BECAUSE I BROKE THE HUGE CHAIN OF DISLIKE REVIEWS OF THIS GAME FOR HAVING SONGS AND FULL HD REMOVED.  AND TO THAT, I SAY  YOU, I DONT GIVE A I DONT LISTEN TO MUSIC ON SAN ANDREAS, I ONLY LISTEN TO THE USER TRACK STATION  BECAUSE SOMETIMES I LAUGH LISTENING TO IT.  IF YOURE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE MUSIC, ADD YOUR OWN AND MOD IT YOU LAZY , I DID IT, WHY CANT YOU?!?  sorry. just get the damn game, its great for nostalgia.
