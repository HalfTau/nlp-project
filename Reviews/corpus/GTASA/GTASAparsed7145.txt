This game is no longer the original version, but a port of the MOBILE game, which means no high resolution, poor graphics, save problems, NO MODDING. It crashes every now and then, because obviously, playing a mobile game on PC has issues. Rockstar removed nearly 20 songs from the game, and now there are loads of issues with it. Instead of simply updating the tracks, they decided not to bother and simply give us a downgraded version.But hey, at least now we can play with controllers Do NOT buy the steam version, get the physical copy.
