Great game for singleplayer only.I launched and tried to play SAMP for the first time. Load into a roleplay server to get used to it. Someone asks me if I need a ride so I get in his car, he gets out and shoots me with a shotgun. I have to wait in the hospital to heal, as it a roleplay server get out after they take 1000 and then theres another guy waiting outside of the hospital for me just sitting there I get out and know somethings up and start running hes nowhere near me and I hide behind a wall because if were role playing he shouldnt know where Im hiding yet he climbs over the wall and proceeded to shoot me. I cant do anything as Im a fresh spawn and have nothing. So he kills me I have to heal again and while healing he pulls up right out front of the hospital again... Which is where I quit and completely uninstalled this game and all its multiplayer components.Other than that, great game for singleplayer, just stay away from the toxic multiplayer!Its more toxic than GTA V Online in my opinion
