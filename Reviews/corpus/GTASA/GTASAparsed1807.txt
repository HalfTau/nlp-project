I really love GTA San Andreas, its a really great game! I love all the GTA games.But since Take Two decided to ban OpenIV mods, I just cant recommend to buy it.Mods is what makes these games last. San Andreas have lived on for over 12 years and I am sure it is MOSTLY because of the vast possibilities of modding.OpenIV ftw.
