Where would i have been without this game? I have 4 copies of this game, 1 CD version for PC, 1 digital version on PS3, 1 CD version on the original XBOX and since now another digital copy of it on Steam. I dont know why i bought it for the 4th time but i just had to have it. To me this is the best game ever created. The storyline, characters, map design and audio its a masterpiece!
