One of the oldest and most memorable openworld games in my life. How many years have passed since its production! But remembering my memories I returned to the game...It is true that there are not many discussions in the open world games right now, but if you reduce your expectations, you will be faced with a very good game.Synopsis is a very good and fun story.
