...Do I actually have to mention why I recommend this game?Like all the other Grand Theft Auto games, the definitive version is the one you find here on the superior PC platfrom. I kinda rushed through the story in my playthrough but still I clocked in almost at 30 hours worth of gameplay. So if you take your time, play around a lot more with mods you could easily get near 100 hours worth of fun!And the story is definitely better than GTA Vs...
