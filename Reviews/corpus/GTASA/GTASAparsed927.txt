San Andreas is a great game no matter what. I been playing on the ps2 and original pc release since it came out and still have version 1.0 of the game. Rockstar did an excellent job on San andreas but I wouldnt recomend buying the game on steam there are a lot of flaws in the game like not being able to import saves from retail releases and not moddable. I do recomend buying San Andreas just dont buy it here. I would recomend buying the original retail release of ebay or amazon if possibly can.
