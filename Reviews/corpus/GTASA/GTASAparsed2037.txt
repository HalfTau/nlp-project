The GTA game that did everything right. This came out in 2005 and has so much more content and variety than GTA5 did on launch in 2013 and still does to this day excluding GTAOnlineDont let my steam hour or lack thereof fool you, I played the game for so long on ps2 that I wore a brand new disc to point where the it stopped loading, if thats any indication.User beware Like with most GTA ports, a controller is highly recommended.
