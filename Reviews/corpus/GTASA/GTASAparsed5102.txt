Takes me back to the days when this game felt over realistic.Its a good game, well made, i must say. A nice storyline with it, great plot twists, missions are challenging but not that difficult. Well, some are. It is very sad how Rockstar made the game unmoddable. This game would grow bigger and get more sales on Steam if it would be moddable. Heck, even let it have its own community workshop would be awesome! But, sadly, most people would download the crack version which is mod friendly, and avoid buying it on Steam. I bought the game just cause ive been playing the crack version as i grew up, and wanted to make a redemption. Downloaded it to relive the old modding times. But dissapointingly it doesnt allow that. Rockstar probably doesnt care about the game anymore since it has newer games to get bigger incomes from. The huge throw off was the point of it being unmoddable but its a great game.7/10
