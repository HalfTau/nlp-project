One of my favourite games EVER!!!But the latest patch 10 years after release on pc almost pretty much broke the game so I wouldnt recommend purchasing from steam unless if your goanna downgrade below version 3 preferably 11.2 maybe and then play it out of steam. Not to mention that 18 songs were removed, missing textures now, save games lost, no mod support via steam version v3 and no support for 1920 x 1080 resolution anymore
