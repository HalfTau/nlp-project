Buy it! Great Story, Great Soundtrack, Great Gameplay.The game still looks great imo, If you really dont like the graphics there are ALOT of mods to improve them out there, Ive never modded it though on Steam so Im unsure how this version mods.I had a problem with savefiles, My original Retail save files didnt work Steam is version 3.0 I believe while retail is 1.0 and my current savefile sometimes causes the game to freeze.
