Grand Theft Auto, a great series but this is still the best game they ever made for it. The story is great. The physics are not the newest one like the latest GTA game but its still pretty fun to play. I used to play this on my PlayStation 2 in the past and I bought it on PC because I wanted to reexperience the game. Recommend this at a deep 9/10. And remember to follow the damn train CJ!
