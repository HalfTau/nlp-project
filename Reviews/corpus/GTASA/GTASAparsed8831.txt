Ive purchased this game on roughly four different platforms now, if that is any indication of how much I love this game. Basically, you start small as a small time gangster and then make some major moves throughout the state of San Andreas. Youll see the slums of Los Santos, to the high class life of San Fierro, or the seedy and shady dealings that are in Las Venturas. Youve got to play this game at least once in your life time. I put in so much time and completed it 100 back on the Playstation 2, and it was worth every hour. It was one of the best gaming experiences of my life, and you deserve to play it. It has held up surprisingly well over the years, and while it might not look as pretty as its successors, it more than makes up for it in humor and gameplay. Do yourself a favor and play this game.
