A nightmare to playwith all the insane glitches boxes kill/shove you into limbo  when picked up, forcing you to retry the mission several times over for example it makes you lose the will to keep playing eventually. Not only that, but a bugged out camera that refuses to move with the mouse the only fix I found was to SHIFTTAB and uncertain controls numpad needed for hydrolics in a certain mission, no surprise its not right 100and you miss a certain key everytime you need to click itSome might be able to make it pasts these big problems like myself somehow but for the most part STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION!!! The PS2 version is far better, play that instead much cheaper too! but if you MUST play this on Steam do yourself a favor and get it on sale.Oh and as others said some textures look really out of place in this version
