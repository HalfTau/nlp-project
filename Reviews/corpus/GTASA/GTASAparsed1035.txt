Best fcking game in the series, back before we had ragdoll physics, this was a game everyone played.Before that shtty GTA V, this was a game everyone played.With missions where your homie takes a big order, or follow a fckin train to stop a meeting halfway across the map, or fight your way through a riot in the entire state for three missions straight, this is why millions still play the game to this very day. Rockstar, you people have stunned us over time, but never like this, amazing game... Thank you Rockstar Games/North, you are gamings best of the best, greatest game development team of the 00s.
