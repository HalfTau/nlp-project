Ah, The good ol classic San Andreas. One of the best GTAs out there today. I spend soo many hours on this game back when I played PS2 alot. And even then, Getting a copy on Steam is even better. I am glad to relive playing this game again. and missed all of the things i really loved about this game. Its still amazing and one of my fav GTA games. Next to GTA3
