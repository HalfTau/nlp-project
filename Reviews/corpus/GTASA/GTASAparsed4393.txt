There I sat in my stolen station wagon, atop the roof of a random city building, wasting away the wee hours of the night jamming out to Stone Temple Pilots. I contemplated my life and the massive amount of cheats that led me to my current predicament whilst the city below me erputed with the sounds of riot a constant frenzy of explosions, accompanied by screams and gunfire. Just another beautiful day in the wonderful city of Los Santos.
