Well.....I can bear with the removed songs.But unstable gameplay? NO.The game frequently crashes at random occassion whenever I load any screen, missions or not.Also, I was expecting a smooth performance in PC version. But nope.I noticed the motion is stuttery, I know its a minor annoyance, but its a let down if the game does not perform as well as the hardware intended to I7 core and Nvidia GTX 7xx GPU .And here I was excited to play San Andreas again since my PS2 era almost 7 years ago ,but the crashes and unoptimizied cores kinda ruined it.Sorry man, even PS2 gave better experience than PC. After multiple crashes, I have decided to call it a quit.I would rather wait for my preordered GTA 5 to be activated than bearing with the annoying crashes.To me, as long the core system is stable, its good to go. But its NOT for San Andreas.
