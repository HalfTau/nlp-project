Many years later, this continues to be my favorite Grand Theft Auto game. The game world especially at the time was absolutely massive and spanned 3 or four depending on how youre counting different regions with fullsized cities. It has quasiRPG elements allowing you to alter your appearance based on how you eat and work out, as well as gaining skill in driving. Then there was a massive amount of different missions, side missions, activities, etc. so that it always seemed there was something more to do. Ive lost a large chunk of my personal time to this game and I keep coming back to it even now. Cant recommend enough.
