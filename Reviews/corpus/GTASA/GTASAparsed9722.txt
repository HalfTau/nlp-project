This is still the best violent sandbox game ever. Its cool playing this and observing all the wicked cool ass shit and good game mechanics and thinking to yourself, yep, they screwed that up in IV. Yep, they forgot about that in IV. Mmmhmm, they didnt include that in IV. For variety you can occasionally get a tiny bit frustrated and go now this is something they did a lot more of in IV or do something tedious and Un Fun and think, hmm, now this is an element they paid a lot of focus to in IV or drive a shitty car and go hey, now this is the kind of handling and speed that IV is all about.GTA IV is probably the worst game ever, simply for the crime of coming after this one and being completely, completely inferior in every way, shape and form. Bigger disappointment than Duke Nukem Forever.
