All memes aside this is basically my favorite game ever. An amazing story, amazing controls and gameplay, a large array of content and postcampaign fun, likeable characters even the main antagonists are hilarious af, one of them showcased in the mission High Noon and awesome mods. The 4 flaws i can see is the complicated downgrading system to get mods on the steam version, the horseshoe mechanic, some of the missions and SOMETIMES awkward driving. If you can look past those flaws which you REALLY should be able to this is an amazing game that no one should not play.Oh, and Wrong Side of The Tracks was not hard in the slightest. Come at me.
