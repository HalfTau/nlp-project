This game has a lot of weed smokin in it. Thats what I was doing while playing this game when it came out for PS2. Well.... actually I wasnt smoking then. I was going through a bad OCD/anxiety period where I was worried I was gay. Im not gay, but I was worried I was and that I really didnt like women. but I love the , and am back to roasting bowls alll day. Im 32 years old now, this game came out when i was 23.
