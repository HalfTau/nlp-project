Ive played this game all the way through on the Playstation 2, I was beyond happy when I found the game on sale. The game is great, the graphics are a different story but the game is huge and good graphics are really just a luxury that companies dont need to make an excellent game like this one. Some games are excellent without good graphics such as The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim even though the graphics were amazing for such a huge game and any Grand Theft Auto game pre GTA IV. The game brings back a great nostalgic feeling when playing, I felt like I was back at my old house playing as I was running over hookers with a motorcycle and throwing molotov cocktails at anything that moved I was a sick kid but the controls on the keyboard are a bit awkward. I recommend you buy this game for PS2 as the graphics are a bit better and the controls are easier to deal with but no matter what, this game will always be one of my favorite games by Rockstar!
