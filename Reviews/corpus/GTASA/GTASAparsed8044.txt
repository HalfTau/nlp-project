This game has everything. Better than GTA V ? Yes. GTASA is a bloody classic. The storyline, the weapons, missions  we don0t talk about the learning how to fly mission . Yes the graphics are not great but mods exist. Alot of them infact. Besides the missions,  story etc theres is always the amazing feeling of having a swaggysuit and car and go to the forests/lakes in search for the numerous myths! Bigfoot is fake but the devs said samething else was in the wood .
