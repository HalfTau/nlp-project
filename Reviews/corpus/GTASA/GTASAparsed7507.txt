Do not buy. 0/10After latest patch, Which seems to me it ruined PC version because Microsoft own San Andreas and since Xbox has the 10 Year update it has ruined it for everything else.If you have already bought it, Download a lower patch v1 or v1.01  V1.01 is a little better as it contains some bug fixes whilst maintaing the main files for modding in v1Im not sure if anyone else has this issue, but the game now forever keeps crashing, if either its 5 mins or 1 hour. itll crash. Some indoor locations also crash. So please note this could be an issue for youIf you still want San Andreas, Pick up a PS2, Xbox, or the ORIGINAL PC disc retail version.
