Easily the best Grand Theft Auto, in my opinion. It has everything you could want in a GTA game. Gun variety, decent story, likeable characters, a nice balance between city, country, and desert, etc. There are also nice smaller touches, such as eating and being able to get fat, or not eat and get skinny over time. San Andreas also gives you the option to work out, an activity that has been abesnt to every other Grand Theft Auto since its debut in San Andreas. The cities are one of the best parts of the game as well, IMO. You have the gang infested ghettos that is Los Santos, based off the real life Los Angeles. Red County and Flint County are your country sides, from Mount Chilliad and the Back o Beyond to the small towns of Palomino Creek and Montomery. San Fiero, based off the real life San Francisco, has your fair share of narrow streets and steep hills, as well as some of the more interesting missions in the game. The final city unlocked in the game is Las Venturas, as well as the neighboring desert that is Bone County. Although your time in Bone County is short, you will experience some cool missions, some interesting individuals, and the dreading pilot school missions. Las Venturas on the other hand really shakes up the gameplay compared to the rest of the game, in terms of mission variety. Though Las Venturas has many sights to see, youll likely be spending most of your time in the Strip.The only real cons with this game rest with the fact that some of the radio music has been removed because of licensing issues, and planes can be pretty tough to control unless you plan on playing with a controller.This is one of my favorite games of all time and I dont think I wouldnt recommend it anyone.
