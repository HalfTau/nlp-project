Old school, gta, what more could you want? A good story? it has that. A good cast? has that. A GTA game which I believe and is believed by many to be better than GTA V? Yes, it is that as well. CJ, Sweet, Ryder and Smoke all get along in a cool hip hood kind of style, is fun to watch, until the betrayal of a few knuckleheads. Really good game
