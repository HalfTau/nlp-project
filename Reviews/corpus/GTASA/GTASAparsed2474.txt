IMO this is the best Grand Theft Auto ever made. The SAMP mod makes this the king of all GTA games. The single player gameplay is also hilarious and exciting. Back when I got it and played it the first time, I used to explore myths such as big foot, so I went camping in the woods down the bottom of Mt. Chilliad.I have spend so many hours playing this game, both on PS2 and PC.If you havent tried it, you should. Youre missing out on one of the biggest games ever.
