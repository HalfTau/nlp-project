Calm down, I myself dont care about mods. I feel as if now that mods are gone we dont have to worry about false myths or infected mods. But rockstar, atleast give us permission to use graphics mods, I dont like to lift weights that look like pizza or ride a bike that looks like it got melted and then fixed without removing the melted plastic.
