The game itself may be over a decade old, but it is extremely fun and has endless amounts of activities and stuff to do in the game. Theres also alot of vehicles to drive in the game, and a good amount of guns to shoot. Theres nice small details such as police chases going around the city, impatient drivers, people complementing you, saying you have a nice car, tattoos, your muscles, clothes, police actually pulling out guns when you equip one, etc. Also cops will not hesitate to kill anyone who scratched their patrol car.
