Older and rustier then my grandpas the pirate version works perfectly, but the steam version that actually costs money bugs the hell out.everytime i go out of a fast food place, or just any place. i can only attack, and not move.over all good game, but steam manages to  it up. just like they did with CSGO, negev,r8 revolverteam fortress 2, useless hats and not updating anything just adding more t to make the tf2 fanboys give them more money to stuff up theyre asses instead of actually changing the really overpowerd classes. ANYWAYS im off topic.i highly recommend this game but dont buy it from steam.
