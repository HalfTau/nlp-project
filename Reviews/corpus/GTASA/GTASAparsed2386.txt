Such a great game. Rockstar has changed it. I kind of did not like the new update when you would die and youd lose all the weapons you had.Only happened when you were busted And the only reason why I support this and I give this 5 stars is because of the gameplay and how well they made the scenes and stuff. Like the whole sotryline was AMAZING! Keep up the great work Rockstar! AND I CANT WAIT TO SEE GRAND THEFT AUTO 6 WHEN IT COMES OUT!
