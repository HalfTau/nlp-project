Well Rockstar, youve just ruined one of my most favourite games, a childhood game. Well done you To add huge insult to the injury, youre not even responding to the gargantuan complaints of your consumers. Yes, I know the notion of modding content back in has been put forward, and thanks to all who have suggested that but the point is that this shouldnt even be happening in the first place. True, it will cost a lot to get back the licenses and restore the old version, but ask yourselves R, what is your community the people who buy your games worth to you?
