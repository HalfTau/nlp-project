Game itself is great, dont get me wrong on that. The reason why Im not recommending this is because the PC port is dreadful. The mouse is automatically invertednot a problem really, just an opinion, other than that I get about 20 FPS average with Vsync on with my GTX 760, I get better performance on watchdogs with Vsync on. The part that really gets me about the PC port is when you change some of the mouse settings, the mouse automatically freezes when youre ingame so you cant look around until you reset the settings to default. The mouse sensitivity is horrible, even with the lowest mouse sensitivity possible and turning my gaming mouse down to the lowest DPI possible it was still very sensitive. Really wanted to enjoy this game but the PC port isnt all that good.
