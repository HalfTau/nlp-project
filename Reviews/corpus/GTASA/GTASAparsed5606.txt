Ive edited this review to note that I added this for the Test of Time Award in the steam awards event in 2016. Though the game has had terrible treatment in the hands of Rockstar, I cannot deny that it is still an absolutely phenomenal game.I have also taken the liberty of editing the review, changing the recommendation from no to yes, and recommending a way to fix the botched update if you happened to have purchased the game.It is a fantastic game. But, Rockstar managed to turn the game to crap when a forced update came along.The update included A 25 FPS lock A bunch of songs removed from the radio Updated graphics to match the mobile/Xbox 360 ports, that many including me consider to be much worse. Along with the updated graphics came missing textures. Absolutely no mod support. Some resolutions and settings were pointlessly removed.If you have a steam copy on your account already, you will have to get a 1.0 downgrader and Silentpatch for the best experience.If you do not have a steam copy, id recommend against geting it unless its on sale.
