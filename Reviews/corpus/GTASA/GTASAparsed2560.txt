Of the few i have played this one by far is and probably always will be my favorite. My origional post said to read the reviews before you played the game. I read the reviews again before i edited my review and cant see why i ever said that to begin with. That was also only 0.4 hours into the game also so i must have been having some sort of issues but the game runs fine now. This game will always be a go to game for me and i highly recommend you grab this game also.
