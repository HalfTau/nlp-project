Finally they updated the steam version to be 1080 3 as for the missing songs people are complaining about...youre playing it on YOUR DAMN COMPUTER. Last time I checked the pc version lets you put in your own music. Just do that. You whiners claim pc master race but dont even use the things given to you. Shutup and enjoy this masterpiece thats still fun to this day steam blemishes aside. If you havent played GTA V this is the next best thing and arguably still the best gta experience. 10/10
