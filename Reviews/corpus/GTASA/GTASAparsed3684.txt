Ok, where to start... This is the best gta in my opinion. The story is very good, the game is pretty long 22 hours aprox. and the characters are well done.Pros Long and excelent story 101 missions including the prologue worth all of its 15 characters are well made you can drive EVERY veicule/planes/helicopters in the game but the one locked girlfriends cars and in some missions you can downgrade version a lot of customisation and features that no other gta has gym, jetpack wepon stats that do cool         things like akimbo light guns A LOT of veicules JUST WOW!Cons some very difficult missions  follow the damn train lol, RC plane, the one with the killers jet and so on need a controller sometimes  plane/Helicopter missions Random crashes poor draw distances you can fix it but... if you mod the dd, sometimes you will crash, theres a lot of bugs with textures and the game. you almost cant mod anymore because of the last update but you can downgrade the last update broke the game, the saves and deleted a lot of songs. sometimes youll need to put the fps cap because the game bugs like trying to go under the water and doing the  cut throat buisness mission because Mad Dogg will die for no reasons.Do I reccomend it? HELL YES!!!! !Thanks Rockstar for this beautiful game and story Chaos
