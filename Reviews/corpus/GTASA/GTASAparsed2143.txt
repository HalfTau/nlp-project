I can safely say this is one of my favourite GTAs of all time.The map is varied, with three cities all in one map.While it has its problems, these can be fixed using a modded patch.The guns feel heavyhitting and the sound effects for them, while unrealistic, feel smooth and glorious inside my ears I know that sounds creepy but so what.The cast of characters feels authentic to 1992 Gang wars and the Police corruption feels authentic too.The vehicles handle well even with the keyboard controls, which is hard to pull off.The missions objectives are clear and easy to understand except for a few exceptions throughout the gameIts only 10. Convert that to what that is in your country. I very much reccomend you pick this game up along with GTA III and GTAVC for only 17 Again, convert it to whatever it is in your country. As theyre great games as well.TLDRThe Game is great. Pick it up already!
