Oh man. What an amazing game this is. Yea, the graphics might feel a bit dated, but the size of the map, the mechanics, the humor are all a basis for the success that GTA V is. The soundtrack alone makes this game a best buy. Faith No More, GunsNRoses, NWA... so many early 90s classics. Its just a fun experience that doesnt take itself too seriously. I had a blast playing this on Xbox the origial and its great having this in my library to revisit when I want on my PC. Highly recommended.
