This single games consists of most of my child hood. Flying a giant Tank through the skys and bombarding the enimes with cannon fire. launching the most ridiculous veichles off of the top of the mountain jump. and cuasing as much rampage in a push bike any game charicter in the world could.I also love trying to find ridiculous glitches in this.10/10 A must own game, so worth it. felt better on the console and the graphics are way out dated. but it was the best game about in its day and the open world of sanandreas should still stand out even today.well designed and beautiful
