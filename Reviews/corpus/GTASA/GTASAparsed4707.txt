Easily my favorite game from the early 2000s, GTA San Andreas is way ahead of its time. Massive map, loads of vehicles, and hundreds at least it feels like missons. The leap between GTA Vice City and Gta San Andreas is absoluty massive. It adds loads of new features that didnt exist in previous gta games. It is even more better than GTA4 in regards to map size, misson count unless you count the DLC vehicle variety, vehicle customization, things to do outside of missons, how fun it was, among other things. Very well made game. I have over 100 hours logged in this game, mostly from just messing around in it. I think that any GTA fan will enjoy this game immensely.
