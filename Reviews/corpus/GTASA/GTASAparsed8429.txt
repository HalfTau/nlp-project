Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is by far the best Grand Theft Auto Game from the 3D series, This port of the game is very fun but due to the fact this is a port means there are a few bugs, for expamle, in this version of the game there is a resloution problem were you cant use widescreen and there is the problem in every version of the game were you cant use a controllerOverall its a great game no matter how you play it, though steam or buy it on disk. its a brilliant game ever way 10/10
