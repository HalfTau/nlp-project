This game WAS amazing. My first thought was i thought that removing the music was okay, even though it took the joy out of it, i still bought it. Then when I launched the game, my mouse wont click and the screen wont move when i try to look around.The BUGS are so annoying as hell and Im raging because I wanted to play this again. I can forgive you removing the songs but please fix the bugs. Good thing I bought this on sale.
