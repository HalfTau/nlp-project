GTA San Andreas is an absolutely amazing game, and far better in terms of story than all other GTAs. Who cares if the graphics are godawful? A game this this big with GTA V graphics would be literally impossible to run in 2003 unless you actually borrowed NASAs computer. Anyways, heres the pros and cons of the game.WeaponsSome awesome weaponsMost of the weapons are ludicrously outclassed by other weapons of the same category, like the RPG compared to the MinigunSeveral weapon categories allows you to pick your favorite weapon of, say, the SMG class Tec9, MAC10, or MP5 and use that weapon without having to cycle through other weapons like you would in GTA VVehicles and Driver AIA huge variety of vehicles, from the beautiful and powerful Bullet Ford GT, to the huge and slow Combine HarvesterYou can find just about any vehicle in the game on the street, with some exceptions such as the SWAT tank or the MothershipThe NPC Driver AI is absolute garbage. I could probably make a better AI back in the 90s. You cant go anywhere on the highway without witnessing a crash.Road rageTheres a Ford GTTheres no McLaren F1NPCs never crash into you
