I have seen many vids telling people to noy buy the steam version..... but screw them! this version is really good eventhough hot coffee is missing. the controls are a bit wonky but you can change them in the settings so its ok, this game does not support 1080p res as it is quite old but for what it is, its awesome! i reccomend all gta v noobs to play this masterpiece.
