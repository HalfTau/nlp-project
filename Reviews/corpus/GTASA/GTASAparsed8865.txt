Excellent game that is the peak of PS2 grand theft auto trilogy. Everything about this game is fun and well done from the story to the environments to the game play itself. I highly recommend picking this game up if you have never experienced it. The graphics didnt age well, but the content still holds up to todays sensibilities.
