GTA San AndreasI spent countless hours on the PS2 when playing this game, and on the PC its as much fun  even better with mods. The story, gameplay, characters, etc, all great. I really like to go on this game, enable cheats and mods and just explore the city. Its really fun to. Out of all the games in the GTA series, this would be my number one.
