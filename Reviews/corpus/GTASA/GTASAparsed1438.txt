Purely because the port is a nightmare. I can look past the poor controller support Press Joy8 to... and the fact a keyboard is pretty much useless here, however after every mission, cutscene or entering of exiting of a building, there is a 50/50 chance of my game crashing which until I manage to fix, I cannot progress in the story any further.If anyone has any potential fixes, let me know!
