I have played this game since 2010 by installing from DVD on the Windows XP laptop. Then I just moved the installation over new Windows 7 laptop. When I move to newer laptop running Windows 8, Ive lost the DVD and the old Windows 7 laptop is broken that I cant copy it over here so I purchased the game on Steam for digital download. Ive redownload the game yet again from Steam last month after replacing system hard disk because I really need this game with me.What I like about this game is that you will never bored of its missions and many side missions. Ever tried going to the other city before it is opened to public? Ive done that and your wanted level will maxed out with all cops, armies and FBI coming after you. You might want to look at cheats at first but eventually try to play it without any cheats at all, you will feel the satisfaction of completing without cheating. Dont forget to go to the gyms in game and eat accordingly.What I dislike is just about the recent update where some soundtracks are removed due to expiring licenses.In general, I recommend this game to others, try it out, this is one of the legendary games, a mustplay game.
