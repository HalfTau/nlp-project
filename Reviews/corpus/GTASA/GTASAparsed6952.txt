For the past ten years, GTA San Andreas has been one of my all time favorite video games, unsurpassed even with the release of GTA V. However, I can no longer recommend it. I got the steam version free as a complimentary gift for preordering GTA V, and decided to relive a bit of nostalgia, only to be horrified at the result. A game that worked even a year ago while I was tinkering with it, is now completely unplayable.The resolutions have changed to cause constant stretching even with fixes, including higher resolutions completely removed, and a plethora of graphical mishaps to boot. As mentioned before, though this is a more minor issue for me, a great deal of the music has been removed from the game completely. The game has always had poor performance on PC, with a cap of 25 fps, and completely broken physics if you dare to surpass it, but now it is even worse on all fronts, to the point where random events in the game will cause fatal crashes. Mods are also no longer supported, just in case you thought you were going to install a fix for that.This makes me fear for the game I just spent 60 on, and proves to me that Rockstars PC support has not improved at all since GTA IVs abysmal port. Hopefully Im wrong. Stay the hell away from the Steam version of San Andreas.
