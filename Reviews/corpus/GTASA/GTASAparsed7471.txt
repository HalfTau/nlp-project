I have hundreds of hours off of steam in this game, and I can tell you this is one of the best games Ive ever played. But that has changed. I am forced to use the steam version now. All my mods are gone. All my progress was wiped. All my favorite songs were removed. The HD Resolution is not even supported. All of this is replaced with the mobile adaptation of the game. It is literally a ing game you playing on your phone. I would expect better from Rockstar.
