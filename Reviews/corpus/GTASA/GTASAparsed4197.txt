CJNo, but seriously, this game has so much to it. After going through many of the games files and learning its code and how the Radio Stations in the game works and all that. Then you find some secrets that you didnt know that were in the game for such a long time, like how Big Smoke will be on WCTR until a certain point in the game or the same with OG Loc, how once you are in San Fierro, OG Locs episode on American Entertainment with Lazlow will always play till you get to LV..This game is a masterpiece, if you havent played this game before, you should! You wont regret a single thing. Still, so much work put into this game.... 3
