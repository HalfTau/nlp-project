Ive been played SA since 2005 in PlayStation 2 until present, now in PC.I have to admit this is the best GTA ever made.Good  Has deep story Has good character development The game mechanic is fun Has a lot of feature and fun activity, that will makes you never bored. Widemap Very good ingame ambience atmosphere Rainy, Thunderstorm, Sandstorm also, the countrysides ambience is real dope. KROSE RADIO STATION INTENSIFIESNo good  THE COPS in this game is the most annoying and frustating enemies ever. Dont doubt to kill those ah0l3s for fun.Groove Street 4 Life / 10
