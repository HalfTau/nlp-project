SO YOU DONT WANNA BE A BUSTA FOR NO LONGER? THEN BUY THIS GAME, BUSTA!Seriously, this game is probably the best GTA game ever made, at least, to me. The story really brings Vice City and III together in one nice package. Not only is the story good, but it provides a great social commentary more than V, IV or the other ones do, I feel. Its fun.Follow the damn train.The gameplay is good, music is eh you can put your own playlist in this game and listen to it thru an ingame radio station, also Vice City has the best soundtrack. The graphics have aged a bit, but it is still a good game. Buy it on sale.
