I like the game, but the steam version is quite outdated. The windows store version has remastered graphics. Better interface. Better map. Auto save. Cloud saving. Better support for xbox360 controllers. The list goes on. Plus its cheaper and takes less space on your hard drive.I would not recommend buying this game on steam unless you are getting it as part of the GTA collection whenever its on sale. I would really like to see the remastered version added to Steam.
