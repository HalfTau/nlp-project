A classic, must play for all shooter fans! Although i havent completed the game ever Too caught up terrorizing the city, i still find myself thinking of this, as the best game ever made. If i had to choose, id even pick this over GTA 5! Grapics are old, the sound kinda bad, but nonethless i still love this game. The story itself is amazing, leaving me guessing whats gonna happen next, craving for more.All in all, if you like killing, old dating sims, shooting, racing, or flying, this is a game for you!
