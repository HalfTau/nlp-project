When I was a kid  67  I used to play GTA III and Vice City. I was never so attracted to SA. I had a friend which was older than me and owned this game. I used to play it at his house, but was still not impressed.One day my mother bought me the GTA triology. It included VC, III and SA. After endless hours of playing the first two, I thought it was time to play SA as well. I loved it. Some years later I finally bought it on Steam.
