if you have fps limiter off and resolution at 1920 x1080 ive found the sound and some game play either speeds up or goes in slow motion. certainly adds an incredibly funny twist to the game. i had to reformat the controls as they were all over the place and made no sense. i can still imagine this as a great game from when i was 12 years old.
