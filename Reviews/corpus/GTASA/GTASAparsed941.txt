He did it guys. Big Smoke made us a promise that when he was gone his name would be remembered. I played this game too much Ignore my hours, I played on mobile in like three different devices too. I was one of the few back in the day before this game was even half as popular as it is now. Its great to see that everyone else has now taken the chance to laugh and joke about Big Smokes order. This game is enjoyed so much that many people have taken the time to do speedruns more than ten hours long. I recommend it.
