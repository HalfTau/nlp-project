This game is by far the best GTA out there, based on sheer size and content. You could spend over 5000 hours on this game and still have things to do. Completing 100 of content in this game is going to be a real challenge for you as theres so much content to complete.In most games, the main story missions are about 75 of the overall game, but this isnt the case here, in San Andreas the main missions count towards about....20 of the main game, if that. If youre looking for a huge game, full of fun and great characters, Id reccomend this game as it was a huge part of my childhood despite being against my parents wishes at the time that I will probably never forget nor regret.
