GTA San Andreas is still the best Grand Theft Auto game in the series. After replaying this shortly after GTAV i noticed a ton of architecture and city layouts that ended up in V the map in GTAV may be larger but San Andreas fills the map to the brim with activities, areas of interest and gives you a great story that takes you on an odyssey across the diverse landscape of San Andreas. You dont have weapon attachments but there is always a tool for the job and SA is the first game in the series to feature stealth mechanics, functional silencers, and knife excecutions.  The voice work in this game is amazing with a star studded cast featuring James woods, Samuel L Jackson, Ice T, and more.The current steam version is a bit buggy and doesnt support mods so it is advised to roll back to avoid issues and use mods if thats your thing. I played through with the latest pach and had to tweak the options and force some settings in NVIDIA Control panel but i eventualy got it running smooth as a fresh shaved goat. FYI i got this running on WIN10.10/10 Would lose the train again.
