The games really cool, has the gangsta atmosphere and a sense of humour making the story really enjoyable.Although people complain that some kind of editting has been done and content removed, i didnt notice any of that missing. The only annoying thing about San Andreas was the controls and behaviour of the car/npcs  maybe I was unlucky but it happened so often that it really annoyed me especially in midmission when suddeny your car behaves like it was not metal and rolls and you fail.The missions in the later part of the game get oldschool, hardcore, you really have to be skilled not to die and finish sth on time.All in all, a really good GTF title, go for it, and meet the homies
