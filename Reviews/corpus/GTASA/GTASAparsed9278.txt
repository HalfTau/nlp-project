This is where the franchise tried to outgrow itself, and added in a whole crapload of RPGstyle skill level up elements that nobody really likes. But it is matched well to the extreme scope of the game, as it has by far the largest world and longest story out of any GTA to date. The story is, hm, different. It starts out as a 90s LA gangster movie and then turns into a cartoon. Gameplay functions more like a proper shooter than the previous installments, and works well enough in general. Oldschool GTA chaos still possible and quite enjoyable. This definitely wasnt a perfect game, and I guess people are quite in the right to not like the story  also the stock radio isnt great, but there is a custom station  but I do remember this game fondly from 10 years ago, and its always fun to revisit. There really is a hell of a lot of content.
