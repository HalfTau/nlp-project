The devs ed up big time. They broke the game with a manditory patch. You can download some patches and get it fixed, sorta. Oh, and mods dont work anymore! If youve already played this and want to buy since you never got it on PC and wanna mod, ignore. Its broken. If you heard this was great and wanna give it a try, or are just browsing and are interested in a purchase, ignore. Its broken.Even if you manage to get it sorta working with community patches, the devs shouldnt be given money for this  treatment to their customers. Get it on a disk for your playstation, it works there.
