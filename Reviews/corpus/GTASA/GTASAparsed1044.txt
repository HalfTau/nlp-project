Great Unlawful Automobile Possession is the game that made video games a form of art. In the game you play as Cee Lo Green, a man who in order to become the most successful gangster, has to overcome the greatest obstacle of all train mission with Big Smoke. I think this is the most bestest GTA of all time, since you play as a black man. Its also one of the only GTAs that I can play, since I play games on a Windows 95 laptop.
