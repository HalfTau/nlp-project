This is, for sure, the best GTA game, a great long story, a game you can play for 10 hours straight thinking it has passed only 10 minutes, totally worth your money and time, even when youre finished theres still so much things you can do, if you never played it before you really should, and if you did, play it again, dont let the bad reviews make you think twice, I played 44 hours and not a single crash, and my pc is a really  one, the controls are not the best thing you could ask for, but after a hour or two you get used to it GROVE 4 LIFE
