Stop playing with yourself  Multi Theft AutoI only bought this out of respect for Rockstar.The new GTA SA update has missing tracks and it cannot be modded.When pirating is less of a pain in theto the alternative of downgrading to 1.0 for Mods, SAMP, MTA you know that game should be DRMfree and not updated.
