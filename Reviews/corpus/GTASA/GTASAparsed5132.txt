What im trying to say is Dont buy this game from Steam! I recommend going to a local gamestop or eBay and buying a new/used copy from there and install it to your PC. The disc version is patch v1.0 or v1.1 which will support the resolutions and it will have the 18 removes songs on it.Final thoughts Mobile version    7/10PS2 / XBOX360  10/10PS3                    9/10PC DISC COPY 10/10PC STEAM       1/10
