When it comes to game reviews I guess it all breaks down to opinion. I say this game is good or that game is bad and you agree or disagree based on your opinion.However, when we talk about this game it is only common sense to say that it is indeed pure genius. Playing the game more than 10 years after its release and still I feel the same chills and goosebumps I felt while playing as a child.If there are people that still havent played the gameI really have no idea what you are waiting for.
