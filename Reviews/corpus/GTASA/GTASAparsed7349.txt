This game is the 2nd GTA game in the seiries that i own, and by far is my favorite the first was GTA III. this game is a blast to play, and if you have a bad computer like me it will still get a good 30 fps. one thing i dont like about the game however is that is does not have workshop support. it has a great soundtrack.8.5/10
