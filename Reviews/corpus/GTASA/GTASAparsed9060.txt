This is an amazing game. Unfortunately the Steam version is really buggy. Half of the time the mouse doesnt work and when you do things known to fix it, it stops working because of Steam. A window pops up saying something like This app is already open even when it wasnt running in the background. All of these things make the Steam version unplayable. Its a great game and these bugs can be fixed if you DO NOT have the Steam version. Get the game elsewhere and you will have fun.
