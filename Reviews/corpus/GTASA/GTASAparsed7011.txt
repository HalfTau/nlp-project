Sitting back years after having beat this game I thought that it was totally worth buying and playing it through one more time. One more time to try to do the most from what there is to be done in this game and 60 hours were not enough to do not more than 70 of what I had aimed for after after beating it. But theres so many other games to try out there, so I decided to move onGTA San Andreas is one of the best mafia openworld sandbox action 3rdPS games ive ever played in my life.The graphical improvements from GTA Vice City are noticable. The voice acting is perfect. The map is huge compared to the games before it.In a big world full of choices you make your way through a very interesting, fun, crazy, and dramatic story about brotherhood, friendship, hunger, corruption and betrayal. GTA San Andreas is the 3rd  instalment of its kind and the 5th in turn within the franchise excluding the special editions of the titles of that time.Lots of vehicles to use, lots of guns to choose, lots of characters to meet, lots of places to explore, lots of easter eggs to find, and s of side quest missions and achievements to accomplish. A game easy capable to stay playable for a ton of extra hours after finishing the main story.And even after all that said, with the game supporting mods and with millions of those out there to be downloaded and tried, the amount of extra playtime that can be spent in this game even today is insane.Its like the Elder Scrolls of its genre.There are noticable cons in this edition to be fair. Some crashes here and there and very few but hard to miss bugs, but they didnt take away from the tons of fun i had. Also some missions, taking their length and places under consideration, could use a checkpoint mechanism though you can still manage them after a few tries at worst.Totally and fully recommended.
