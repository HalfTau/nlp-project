This is a fantastic game. It started me on the GTA series and I still to this very day think it is easily the best GTA in the series. It has that amazing west coast atmosphere that is rare in video games and if you like west coast rap, you will love this. The gameplay is very fun and intuitive.The only thing that is wrong with the game is the graphics yes it is old I know this but it simply hasnt aged very well. In addition to this, the game suffers from extreme screen tearing when it doesnt have the FPS capped but when it is capped it runs at 24FPS and looks poor.But all in all play this game, its fun and unique with a great story. It has some iffy missions such as the train chasing mission and the RC plane mission but apart from that it is a solid great game. I would recommend you use a controller for this as well since it is indeed hard to drive and fly with a mouse and keyboard.Happy Hustling!
