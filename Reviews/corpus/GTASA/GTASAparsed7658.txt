One of the best games ever made. No more words needed.You should play it Now if you havent already.UPDATEThe new Patch Nov. 7 2014 is garbage! I dont really mind about the 18 songs removed, I understand why they had to do that, and I have 12.000 songs linked to my custom library anyway. But the fact that they removed 169 supports makes no sence to me and it totally ruined the game. Almost everybody used a 169 Wide Screen today, and they are now forced to play the game with black bars on the sides at 43 ratio.!! !They should repatch the game to fix the resolutiongraphical issues!! !Also the new patch added controller support and HD textures, its actually the same Xbox 360 HD Version which was an Android port.Also after the Patch the game appears to run perfect at 60fps, without the glitches it used to have before the Ptach at 31fps.UPDATE 2ESSENTIAL PATCH Silent Patch how now been updated to V11 Beta and had fixed every issue that the latest Rockstars patch created Aspect ratios are now correct and not squashed, like they used to be 1.0/1.01 save games will not be rejected now 1.0/3.0 settings file will not be rejected now 10ms frame delay has been removed. As a result, game now locks properly on 30 FPS instead of 25 FPS Mouse should not lock up randomly when exiting the menu on newer systems anymore 169 and 54 resolutions are now selectableNOW EVERYTHING IS PERFECT UPDATE 3Another UpdatePatch was release today 9 December 2014 on Steam. It adds 1080p resolution.
