This is better than GTA 5, been playing since around 2006.Know alot of the cheats but forgot alot as well, this version is somewhat buggy, but it shouldnt hinder anything. The only real problem is that some of the audio tracks were cut but once again it shouldnt hinder anything.The story is also leagues better than 5s. And it has more customization options like the abilty to lose/gain muscles and weight.10/10
