Such a great game, you can get so immersed in this. Theres so much to do, I havent even played many of the missions because Im having so much fun doing whatever I want, wherever I want and whenever I want. Grab spray paint and choke hookers to death. Jetpack on top of buildings. Modify cars. Go on police and ambulance missions. Steal from peoples houses at night. Go to a strip club. Its just so fun, the game doesnt take itself too seriously which I love. Just grab a baton and beat theouta the first random innocent civilian you see, because why not? The city is very alive youve got a lot of things to interact with, clothes shops, gym, fast food, gun shop. Its just great. I would recommend to anyone.
