Just pirate it, youll literally get a better version of the game that way. They removed a good chunk of the soundtrack and didnt even take the time of fixing bugs while theyre at it. Widescreen still doesnt work, mouse controls are horrible. You need to downgrade the game for the best experience.Also, going through the game, some missions Lifes a beach are virtuially inpossible to complete, since the game is fundementally bugged. I had to find an exploit on YouTube to get past it.
