Im not just giving this game a bad review because of the Open Iv, but its part of it I have aroud 20 hours in this game on xbox not the remastered version and it was a lot of fun but this game is broke if you dont have vsync on its real bad but if you do it locks the game BELOW 30 fps and you can move car by touching them but the mods are fun
