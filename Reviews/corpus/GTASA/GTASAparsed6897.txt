Got this game as a PreorderBonus for GTA V and wanted to get back to SA to refresh the awesome moments i had with this game in the past. As it turns out this version on steam just does not work as it should and is sadly a disappointment. I am very happy that i could play this game in its not broken state in the past. Controlls with mouse and keyboard are not what they used to be Songs were removed from the Radio the game crashes all the time on a very powerful PC the old version 2008 on my , old netbook still works fineWithout these gamebraking new features this game is one of the best games i have played.... why would you do this to such a cool game
