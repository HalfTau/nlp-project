This is hands down the best GTA game. Put down your GTA V, it is just a bad imitation. San Andreas has 3 cities, GTA V only has 1. San Andreas has a jetpack. GTA V doesnt have a jetpack. In GTA V you cant eat aton of pizzas and get fat then go to the gym and get jacked. I could go on and on but Im busy af, but this GTA San Andreas is worth your money. Also GSF 4 LYFE ES CJ REPRESENT.
