GTA SAIn my opinion, this was the best GTA game ever made when you factor in the year it was made, and all the attention to detail that the developers put in.SAMP was probably the most fun I had in gaming from 20122015, when I had a bad computer and wanted to play an open world game with friends. I highly reccomend trying it out if you havent.I recently 110 completed the game do everything that you possible can, even if its not required and it was the most fun I had in a playthrough so far.However, this review is for the steam version of the game.Positives It is GTA San Andreas Great story Amazing attention to detail Can run on terrible computers, even on integrated graphics Still remains fresh to dateNegatives The steam version of the game has countless bugs, and If you dont install Silent Patch, it will be impossible to complete certain missions. Having the frame limiter off creates more bugs and issues with the game, yet having it on restricts you to 30fps. Some songs, and things in the original game were removed in the steam version. Definetely not worth 19.99OverallOverall I would reccomend buying this game for 4.999.99 on a sale, but definetely do not pay 19.99 for it. Also, if you do purchase, your experience will be much better with the frame limiter on. It takes about half an hour to get used to it, then you dont notice at all. And finally you must install silent patch otherwise certain missions are impossible to complete due to bugs.Edit Nominated
