Ive played this a lot on my PS2 and it is still amazing. Ive completed the story 5 times already and it never gets old. The final mission is long and tough, but its still fun and worth watching the ending.Its a huge turning point with the GTA series with inlcuding stats for the protagonist, having gang territory, being able to fly planes, and even swimming which previous GTAs didnt have.Even if you are uptodate with the current GTA gamnes, this is great throwback.
