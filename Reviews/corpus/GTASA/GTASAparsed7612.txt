Its a great game, but damn the latest patch puts a sour taste in ones mouth. Rockstar removed radio tracks due to liscensing issues. Admitedly these changes are pretty minor, but theyre in conflict with the games core remaining audience.Its an old game. Folks who play old games like the idea of those games staying the way they were or not changing without their direct involvment i.e. content/graphic mods. Furthermore, when they do make changes to their games they generally put content in rather than take it out as Rockstar has done here.On the side of rationality though, fans will probably unofficialy patch those tracks back in eventually and this version of the game now has 360 controller support. So its kind of a mixed bag. If it still really bothers you, then there is always the retail  pc version which has been floating on the internet since 2005.
