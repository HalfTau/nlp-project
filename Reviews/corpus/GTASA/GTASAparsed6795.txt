Make the game compatible for the XBOX 360 controller and not fidgity, and add steam achievements... then Ill play it. I know I shouldnt complain since I got it for preordering GTA 5 BUT, It doesnt mean that I have to play an inferior version of the incredible game I played on my PS 2 back in the day.Come on R... give a game worth giving. Heck, even GTAVice City is a better complimentary game than this.
