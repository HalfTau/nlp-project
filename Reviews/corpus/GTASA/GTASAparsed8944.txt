I remember getting this game for PS2 when it first came out, it was the start of the great evoloution of the GTA series where things got much, much better. So you can understand when I installed steam on my new laptop christmas day and I saw that this game was on here at a small price tag, that the first thing I did was buy it straight away! It does take time to install the game depending on your internet speed however after about an hour tops i was ready to go. The thing that hit me straight away was how difficult it was to control CJ using keyboard and mouse. But, dont worry, youll get used to it. Unfortunatley, this game does not support my pc controller so I had to make do. Anyway, the storyline doesnt fail to impress and lives up to the tag of being the second best Grand Theft Auto behind GTA V, which isnt on pc. If youre looking for top notch graphics with 1080p resoloution this isnt your game but I didnt buy it for the graphics, this game is all about the nostalgia now a days. I reccommend once completing the story mode to try out different cheats and mods for the game and just have some fun doing 6 star police chases.
