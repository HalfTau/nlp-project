This Is my favorite Grand Theft Auto game and possibly my favorite game period. Ive sunk hundreds of hours into it on PS2 and now Ive started playing through it again on PC. It really is the epitome of a great sandbox game.Best of all you can explore the beauty of San Andreas without the Microtransactions and rampant modding that ruin GTA Online.
