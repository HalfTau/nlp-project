Last week, Id have said this game was a fine set of mammaries.Now, however, without 17 songs that helped to solidify this as an incredible game, less resolution options, and newfound save game incompatibility, its now just a dull shadow of its former glory.Im uninstalling this game now.  I realize it may be sorta petty, but at the same time, it has but a modicum of the appeal it had a week ago.Rockstar must not distribute a single regard about the community. But, with a name like Rockstar, should it be a suprise that they just do whatever the fxxk impulsive, and irrational crap they wish?
