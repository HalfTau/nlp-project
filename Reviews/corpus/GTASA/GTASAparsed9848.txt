This game is an accurate representation of Grandpas childhood, growing up in the 50s was hard. We didnt have fancy things like watches and roads, we had gravel and pavement and we liked it.There were no black people, because they lived underground and so this game couldnt exist then.I enjoy this game, because it has black people in it, just like my favorite movie Friday. I love when they sayalot, it reminds me of my father, when I was a kid. Back then dad would take us to what the whites called quotRaces it was where a bunch of black gentlemen would be gathered and your great grandpa would bet on which one would win the race.We never won, but boy were those good memories.Anyways, this game gets a 9.5/10 because it reminds Grandpa of the early days of black rights and privelleges.Note Grandpa is very old and of a different time, if you are of african american descent please dont take offense  Billy
