This game does not work with Windows 10, dont buy it. You can get it to work by downgrading it with your computer, but then GTA 5 will not work, and 5 is a much better game. I have the 7 disc CD collection of 5. I asked for a refund from Steam, but they refused, probably because theres too many employees hired that come from Shole countrys. They are probably not able to read your comments you tell them about this game being old and broken and not working with Windows 10. Im here to tell you that Steams word is not the last. Im going to dispute the charges with my bank as soon as they open after the holiday.
