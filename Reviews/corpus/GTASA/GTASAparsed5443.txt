San Andreas is a 3D, 3rd person shooter from the original XBox era. In another angle, its a racing genre game with shooter elements. Escape the cops, shooter drug lords, and vandalize the town.One of the best games in 2005, I know gta San Andreas as part of the Spyro Year of the Dragon bug. PlayStation Underground released a demo of Spyro in which it would format your memory card if you saved your demo partway through the game. Because this happened days after San Andreas release date, hundreds of gamers lost their save files, at least one of them being 90 percent through the game.If that happened to you, 2015 is a good time to stop hyperventilating and give the game another try. It works with a USB XBox 360 controller, although the game recognizes all the buttons as JOY1JOY16. This game is so old it works with my Windows XP laptop, a Vostro 1320 with plenty of frames per second.
