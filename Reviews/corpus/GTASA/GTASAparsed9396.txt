The game itself is good.But the PC version is plagued with glitches and some bad, sometimes even broken swimming... controls. Youre better off playing this on a console. That, or using a bunch of good third party patches and a controller.And apparently a recent update long after I finished the game somehow broke the game even more. Brilliant. If it aint completely broken, lets break it some more!
