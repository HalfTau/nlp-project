I already have the retail version of this game on PC which I have spent countless hours playing the SAMP mod alone and achieved 100 completion, so please ignore my playing time on the Steam version.It really sucks how Rockstar took out 18 songs from the ingame soundtrack in the recent update. You can no longer wreak havoc in the city with a Hydra while listening toor fly over the desert while blasting to. Well you can, but you would need iTunes or some other media player running in the background or just manually add the songs back in to the custom radio station, but even then you still wouldnt get to listen to the DJs witty and snide remarks at the beginning or end of each song.Do I recommend this game? Definitely. San Andreas has been a monumental game in the openworld genre since its inception in 2004. But dont the Steam version  get the retail version if you can  unless if there is a mod somewhere that adds the original audio files back in to the radio station. However, be aware that the retail versionhave compatibility issues with Windows 8/8.1. I have the Steam version only because I got it for free with my preorder of GTA V.
