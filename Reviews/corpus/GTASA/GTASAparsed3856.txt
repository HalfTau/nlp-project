Still an amazing game after all these years. The dated graphics are not as much of a turnoff as you might think, although the PC port is an occasional nightmare as far as stability and controls. Youre going to want to mess around and reconfigure to make it remotely playable, especially for the flying missions. I also recommend saving your game often, because it freezes/crashes every couple hours or so.If the minor headache seems worth it to you, I definitely recommend playing this, if only for the nostalgia factor.
