Nice going, Steam/Rockstar, removing EVERY review for this game after a lot of negative reviews were posted. Thats not censorship and damage control at all.Well, San Andreas is one of the best games ever. The Steam version of San Andreas IS NOT the game you played ten years ago though. This would certainly be a positive review, if not for the latest patch November 7th 2014. That update has REMOVED 18 songs including tracks from NWA, 2Pac, Rage Against The Machine, Ozzy Osbourne and Tom Petty and HD support from a game you owned for years. Yes, you read that right. A patch removed content you PAID FOR when you bought the game. That such a thing is legal and was allowed by Steam, says a lot about the current state of the game industry. It sets a very dangerous precedent.Not only that, but the patch has also pretty much changed the game into the iOS/Android version  buggy, often crashing, with low resolution  and yet, bugginess is not as bad as REMOVAL OF CONTENT.While the game is pretty much the Game of the Decade for the 00s, I CANNOT with a pure conscience recommend it to anyone in the current state of affairs. Id even go as far as saying that Rockstar has fallen down from one of the best game devs to EAlevel.
