Grand Theft Auto San Andreas takes us to the city of San Andreas, which is loosely modeled after California. You play as Carl Johnson, former banger for Grove Street, who returns to Los Santos in San Andreas after severalSan Andreas, the gang warfare system, is an interesting addition, allowing you to control territory and push out rival gangs. San Andreas has more of a focus on building the Grove Street gang into an empire, which was different from the way Vice City played. The soundtrack is pretty cool and there are newer features from previous GTA titles, such as muscular changes as you build stamina, or gaining weight from eating. San Andreas has a great storyline, memorable dialogue, and a kickjetpack you can steal and fly around on. Graphically it is better than Vice City, but not as smooth looking as GTA IV.  Though it is 10years old, It is still fun to play and worth your time if you are a fan of the series. If you play or have played GTA V, you will undoubtedly recognize some landmarks from San Andreas.
