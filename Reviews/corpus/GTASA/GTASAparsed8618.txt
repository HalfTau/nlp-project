Im the 0,01. Ive never used mods or cheats in GTASA. Thats right. And yet, this is one of the best games ive ever played. 10/10 story, great characters, diverse, colourful world, loads of things to do, and the best radio stations youve ever got to hear. So yeah, i highly advise you to play thorugh the story first, then turn towards the endless ocean of mods. Because a story of this caliber shouldnt be missed.
