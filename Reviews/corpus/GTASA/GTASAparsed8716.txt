Even after the success of GTA5 I find myself always coming back to this game. Its easily the best out of the series and it just goes to show that better graphics dont make a better game. If youre a fan of the recent Grand Theft Autos and havent checked this out yet, youll fall in love. Just make sure you follow the damn train.
