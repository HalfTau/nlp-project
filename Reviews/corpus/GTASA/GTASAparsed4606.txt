Grand Theft Auto series is known for delievering on the hype each game creates. Over 10 years later and GTA San Andreas is still a highly enjoyable game. While the gameplay hasnt aged well since 2004, dont let that get in the way from enjoying this fun, funny, and large game.PROSGreat long story with over 100 missionsAmazing soundtrack from the late 80s and earily 90sHuge map featuring three major cities and moreCONSSome features were removed from the original PS2 version that most of us enjoyed.using a downgrade mod can fix thisQuestionable Airplane controls that will make you wonder how anyone actually finshed the game.Overall this game is highly enjoyable and I would recommend for anyone looking to play an open world game.
