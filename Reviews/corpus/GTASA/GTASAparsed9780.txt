This GTA I didnt like. It used too many Sims elements. It didnt fit the GTA universe. Plus, the environments were uninspired. Anyone can create a map with huge mountains and make it bigger than the previous games that way. The music sucked, the gameplay was ok didnt like the mini games and the engine was becoming outdated and ugly. Its not bad, but Id rate it lower than GTAIII GTAIV and Vice City remain the best ones.Rating 86/100
