After so many complaints about this game, I dont think people realize you can downgrade to Version 1.0, which keeps the game in the state it should have been left in. Theres even a handing mod that will downgrade your game AND add some nice optional features, such as 16.9 Aspect Ratio support. Get this game and do the downgrade, you wont regret it.
