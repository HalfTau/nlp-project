A definitive classic, and a mustplay game of every person who lived in the early 00s. GTASA was pretty much one of the foundations of the 00s gaming era, and Im pretty sure that it was part of every gamers rooms back then. Be it on the PS2 or on PC, that doesnt make any difference at all. Because no matter on what platform you chose to play this, it provided you with the exact same type and amount of fun, joy and entertainment. From carjacking, carrying rocket launchers on the street, riding tanks on the road, killing prstitutes for some reason Steam censored this word lmao, participating in and/or inciting gang fights to infiltrating Area 51, riding jetpacks and dominating the city, this game definitely delivered what it promised, and with that also helped a lot with shaping Rockstars signature gamemaking style once and for all.
