Heya. This game will  guarantee an authentic groove life experience. The way you make contact with this life, its one of a kind. Its not all about thugs, drugs, thefting and many others like these. It becomes really funny when you discover such a large world, a replica of early 90 years, in which you can transform this game into a roleplay one. You will feel me after you will play it. They brushed every single object, excluding the skyscrapers. You can even enter in some gigantic boats of army.I bought this game for almost 3 euros. I did because it was the game I was obsessed to play when I was younger, like 4 years ago. I even gifted few to my friends. This game has been a massive impact upon Action Games a tremendous jump from GTA Vice City no one would have expected such a real game.Now some particular issues huge map so well detalied plenty of characters you will make contact with variety of vehiclestanks, choppers, boats, cars, bicycles many missions, all achievable sound track, voice lines between characters weather types, all again neat good radio stations, well suited to that period you can find more by playing it. nothin  just to fill this space this game has lost its delight because many gamers now play only by their attention given to graphics details. I know its an old game. Still, you dont know it untill you dont play it.All in all, shall you ask yourself if you should buy this game? No, just do it right away. Its not expensive, not by a strecth. Its a neat game, it calls you! Buy it and play some SAMP with your colleagues, this is the most epic childhood for an earlygamer.Cheers!
