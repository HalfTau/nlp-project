I want to recommend this game but i cant. This game is amazing for many reasons. It feels nostalgic... familiar. Or at least DID.... but here is the thingBOOM, 10 years later, Rockstar decides to update the game. I was pretty surprised myself.Worst update ever.Save files are broken, they removed multiple songs and resolutions.And that shtty mobile port.Now i know most of the negative reviews consist of the new update and so on.But my complaint is modding. THEY COMPLETELY REMOVED MODDING. Now i know GTA SA on steam was never mod friendly, but there was a way to mod it anyways, and i was happy. Why Rockstar? Why would you remove modding capabilites? You removed the ability to play SAMP! Why? The best thing ever!I read a review a couple months back suggesting adding Steam Workshop to this game. GREAT IDEA.Now Rockstar, would you please tell us why you came back 10 years later to break the game, but cant add Steam Workshop after MULTIPLE REQUESTS?As i said, i woudve highly recommended this game a while back, but for now, i feel like i just got robbed.Get your sht together Rockstar.Sorry for english mistakes, it is not my primary language.SpTmBrThanks
