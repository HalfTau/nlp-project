All in all this game is very good, but then steam had to screw up the modding. I spent a whole day trying to get a mod to work and finally saw my problem. I have to DOWNGRADE the game from the steam verson to 1.0, But I had already screwed up because I messed with the files for the game putting the mod in. It took me 4 hours to dowload the game because I gotinternet.me the  off so much im leaving this revew, luckly I found out the problem but before I could mess it all up.
