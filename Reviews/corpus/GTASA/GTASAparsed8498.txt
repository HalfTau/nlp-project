Awsome game, it has improves so much, after turning 3d, Now you can explore massive junk of land, some times it feels almoust too big. Main improvment in this game is movement, you can move more freely in this game than older ones. This GTA is focused heavily on costumizing. You can change your character lookspretty massivly i would say and first time in GTA series Car tuning. There are also lot of easter eggs, and fun vehicles, like Monster Quarry truck, atv, Hovercraft, Karts and more. I liked it and reccomend it.Olny bad moment is sometimes your mouse stop working, but you can fix this, by opening steam in game window
