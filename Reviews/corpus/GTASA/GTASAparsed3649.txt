I highly recommend using a controller for GTASA, makes the game so much better to play, and going through and rebinding EVERYTHING when you first start is also recommended.Other than that, GTASA is a very good game from start to finish, although some missions can be a pain in thedue to sheer difficulty, but its still a great game nonetheless.
