A little graphically uglier than the previous installments but better in so many ways. This is the best GTA yet. It allows you to do a lot of stuff, it has a lot of mods, and it has a HUGE map. And when I say HUGE, I say ING HUGE. It has mountains, desert, forest, valley, beach, and several cities and towns. It has many vehicles and guns. It has a long and compelling story. It has gang wars, ING TURF SHOOTINGS. It allows you to buy property, to invest, and it lets you make money in many ways, that you can spend on customizing your experience or pimping your ride.A must have and if you download ENBseries for it then it will look gorgeous.
