Now before I start here Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a really good game. I love it to the point where I own both the physical copy and the Steam version.But recently, Rockstar made a patch that is just absolutely unacceptable.Heres what they didAdds Xinput controller support Xbox 360 controllersNow this is good. But its the only good thing about the patch.Makes Steering with Mouse enabled by defaultThis is an odd choice but usually Id let a quirky design choice like this slide as long as its toggleable.Removes several songs from all owners and from future purchases the same ones that were removed in the mobile versionEven if certain licenses expired, it doesnt excuse outright removing certain songs from the game. The physical and retail versions still have them, are they gonna get banned globally now? Of course not.Removes several resolution options, including 19201080This is the worst part of all. How the  can anyone defend this? At least with the last part I could kinda see where they were coming from copyrightwise, but theyre straightup removing features from the game for absolutely no reason.Loading a saved game starts a new oneAgain, absolutely unacceptable. What good does it do to literally break the save feature of a game?Final verdict Please, if you havent played it already, either buy it physically or pirate an older version of it. This version is absolutely t that no consumer should ever deal with. Rockstar is never getting another penny from me, and its such a shame that I need to do this with GTA V coming out on PC soon, but I cannot support any companies who think its a good idea to literally REMOVE CONTENT FROM YOUR GAME FOR ABSOLUTELY NO ING REASON. YOU ROCKSTAR.
