This is one absolute classic and a must have for any Steam player. Though Vice City is more nostalgically loved by fans, San Andreas was an innovative sandbox game for its time. With an extremely large map to explore San Andreas will suck in any fan of the series or similar games.Controllers are supported but you will have to map the buttons in the config menu.San Andreas was and is one of the best games from the PS2/XB era and worth checking out for anyone who may have missed it in the 2000s.
