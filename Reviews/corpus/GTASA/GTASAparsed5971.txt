I really dont understand why rockstar patched the game many years after the release. They patched every aspect of the game that i loved for example i loved modding by putting real cars in the game and portal guns gravity guns all this gone basically forever i do not recommend this game for others what i did was buy the game and then pirate it and mod it. I know you wouldnt want to pirate anything but if you do then u have the ability to mod and stuff.Thanks for reading and have a good day/night.
