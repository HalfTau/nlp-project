GTASA is a tremendously entertaining with a huge variety of activities to perform, lots of memorable scenery to explore, and an interesting story populated with character personalities that grab your attention and dont let go. I lived in LA for 7 years and loved the little details used in the game.Its enormously juvenile in skewering pop culture, but the crude sex jokes and parody have a level of creative brilliance that you cant help but laugh at. Fortunately GTASA never lets the presentation get in the way of the gameplay enjoyment. You never feel beat over the head with the story and this leads to some fun where you can leave pressing story plot points hanging for days while you run off to moonlight as a fireman.A couple weak points force you to play through heavily stacked odds or to use mangled controls on some vehicles, but those are few. The character upgrade scheme has a welcome impact on your performance.One of my favorite games. Love it!
