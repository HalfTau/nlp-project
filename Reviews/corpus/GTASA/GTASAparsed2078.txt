To be honest, I am writing this review just so I can recommend this game. Its greatness is needless to say I believe, you should have definitely heard of how fantastic this game is over the time longer than a decade since its release. But in a nutshell, this is a game by Rockstar and although all their games are masterpieces, this is the game produced at the top of their performance, do I need to say more?
