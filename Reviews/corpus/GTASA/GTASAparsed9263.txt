Rockstar once again shows that it is master of its craft by creating an amazing characterdriven story. GTA typically gets criticized for its content but the fact remains that Rockstar is a talented team of designers and writers that make quality games. San Andreas has always been my favorite of the franchise because of its unapologetic wackiness and expansiveness. There is so much to do. After playing GTA4 and becoming more aware of the constant do this messages on the screen, I do think that the gameplay element is slightly overrated. However, for me, this is not where the brilliance of GTA lies. The fun of GTA is vicariously living the adventure of the storys character. In San Andreas this path begins as a gangbanger, then flawlessly expands into casino ownership, chinese triads, and a story of redemption, all while meeting rich characters along the way. Highly recommend SA above any of the GTA titles.
