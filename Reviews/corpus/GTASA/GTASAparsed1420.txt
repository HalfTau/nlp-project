This version of the game crashes like its trying to play bumper cars.  When you get to a load screen, which is often, its a crap shoot whether it crashes or not.  Steer clear, and fk Rockstar for running a great throwback game into the ground.  I gave this game a like because Im pretty sure all negative reviews get pushed to the bottom or somehow subverted in some way.  Stay woke.
