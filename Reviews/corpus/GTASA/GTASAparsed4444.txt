This game is one of my all time favourites, and definitely still holds up gameplay wise today, of course the graphics are the technological equivelant of crayola and fuzzy felt by todays standards but then were dealing with a game you could probably get to run on a Raspberry Pi or... a toaster if you were really trying hard enough.The driving and combat still feel as satisfying as ever, and the PC is by far the best way to experience this game, as the free aim headshots are so satisfing, and it connects you to the experience in a way no controller ever can.There are a couple of caviats to note thoughThe version youll recieve on steam now is a cut down version from the ultimate edition as it were, and can no longer run at 1080p as this feature has been removed for parity with the xbox 360 rerelease this can be patched back in manually by way of a fan made mod, I hear, though.Another aspect of this change is the removal of some classic songs on the radio stations, as the license for these only lasted 10 years and as a result they were patched out in 2014No matter how good your PC is turning off the frame limiter will NOT be a viable option. Turning off the frame limiter lets the game run silky smooth, but also changes the way the game calculates its physics and is just generally poorly implemented, meaning that you can hit some bugs that stop you from progressing with the game entirely, and blocks you off from completing the Vehicle School missions, so its better just to leave it on, rather than having to dig your way through options menus and restarting the mission every time an NPCs pathfinding goes haywire.Other than that the game is incredibly solid, and, apart from a few graphical glitches resulting in, for example, brightgreen mist rolling in over SanFierro, and some low res models/textures, a very fun and enjoyable game, back from the days when there was a middle ground between Easy and Dark Souls difficulties.TLDR Buy it, Play it, Leave the Frame Limiter on.
