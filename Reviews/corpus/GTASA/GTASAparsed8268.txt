Ill admit, I havent played Grand Theft Auto 5 when it comes to PC, I might check it out. with that concession, I consider this one the best GTA. The RPG elements were useful without being annoying building up your gun/vehicle/handtohand/etc skills was just fun and MUCH better than dragging your friends and family to friggin leisure activities between every damn mission like GTA 4. The play control was better than VC mouse looking in vehicles was a great addition, the characters are a little cliche over the top, racial stereotypes, but all in all, it adds to the 90s flavor of the game. Also, the soundtrack cant be beat. After GTA 4, I switched over to Saints Row and havent really looked back. I love GTAs dark sense of humor, but the play control in 4 was a massive step down from San Andreas.Its not flawless, but it is a true sandbox. You can run missions, or just antogonize the local law enforcement and enjoy running across bone county runninngunnin. I got to the point where I owned every territory, had turned in every illegal car, and was STILL finding stuff to mess around with! I also decided to just throw my own playlist together and just enjoy running around in/on various vehicles just to be able to floor it to my jams so to speak and see how long the car would hold together.If you like games where your character can grow, but it dosnt mean their worthless to start, a halfway decent story, a TON of stuff to do, and a high amount of replayability, this game is for you!
