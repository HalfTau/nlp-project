Rockstars recent unannounced patch that they released to the PC version of the game has ruined the game for me.What are the damaging changes, you may ask?Multiple songs have been removed from the games soundtrack Id assume this is caused by expired licenses, which is something i could understandRemoved higher resolution options. I believe this was an issue back in the day, which got the game updated with higher resolution options, why on earth would they remove this later?All save games prior to this patch are no longer usable. If you try to load a save prior to the patch, the game will start off new and fresh. And oh lookie, me who spent hours and hours trying to get 100 and finally did it, until a month later the save gets destroyedThe only GOOD thing this hidden patch gave was simple controller supportI would recommend anyone to refrain from buying this off steam, and grabbing an old CD instead, that doesnt get sudden patches 9 years after releaseIt seems that this version crashes or freezes more often during loadingI ended up losing 30 minutes of progress because the game had frozen, and this has happend 3 times now
