Its the classic hood story of an inner city AfricanAmerican who wants more than being a gang banger, which is reflected over again throughout the story. The main protagonist Carl Johnson, or CJ as hes called, grew up in Ganton, GTAs fictional version of Compton. CJ was raised in gang culture revolving the Families and their rivals the Ballas. CJ grew up in the Grove Street chapter of the Families which was once the Alpha among all of the chapters until their power started to fade. CJ basically tries to rebuild the strenth of the Families Specifically Grove Street throughout the whole game while dealing with rival gangs and dirty cops. the reason this game is so favored is because of the freedoms it brought to us GTA players who were used to playing such GTA games as GTA III and GTA Vice City Which is much better in my opinion, despite not including as much detail. I give this an 9/10 for gameplay and a 7/10 for story.
