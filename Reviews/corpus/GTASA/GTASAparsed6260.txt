id only recommend this if youre going to downgrade the game first. Rockstar updated the game and removed a bunch of songs as well as getting rid of resolution settings, so if you want to truly enjoy this, downgrade it so you can use mods, map modifications, character models, script mods, etc. basically, doing all of the above will allow you to enjoy the ACTUAL GAME THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYED!
