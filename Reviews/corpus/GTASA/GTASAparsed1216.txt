The game is great but this Steam version is a piece of C.R.A.P. Its missing content and is NOT optimized for newer systems. Starting some missions will freeze the game and most of the times your mouse will NOT be recognized. And downgrading it to an older version wont really work as you cant stop autoupdates. Not to mention the fact that its not made for true widescreen and everything looks stretched. Buy it if you really want to support the developers but I recommend you should also get a pirated copy and play that instead
