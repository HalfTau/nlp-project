Say hello to one of the best games ever made. Graphics are of course not very good, but this game is quiet old. The gameplay is amazing, plus the fact that there are so many which enhance the graphics, which i love 3The story is probably the best. I havent skipped a single cutscene throughout the entire game. But it was a little bit repetitive sometimes i thought. The sound is very good. The soundtracks from the radios fit perfectly. The voice acting is great and the sound from ALL the different vehicles are awesome. Actually, what made this game for me was all the vehicles i could drive, anything from different types of planes to helicopters, tanks, dirt bikes, bulldozer and bmx.ROCKSTAR ROCKS
