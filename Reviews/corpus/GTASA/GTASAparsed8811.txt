Rockstar did not slack off making this one. Im really impressed with the effort that has been put into the game details even having different maneuverability for each type of car and the planes, the choppers, the boats  everything! Theres also a lot to do and a fairly huge area to explore which for me is just about right as opposed to later GTAs with bigger game worlds its dragging sometimes. I like how each area has a different aura to it making you feel like youre playing a different game and story for each. The only cons I have about this game is that sometimes I get crashes and there is an issue with the game resolution being unable to match max monitor setting. Anyways, I highly recommend this game! If youre a serious gamer, make sure you dont pass this one. Great story, fun and challenging missions and light game atmosphere.
