Im actually really dissapointed with the product I bought. If I had known that the 1366 x 768 resolution setting had been removed from the game, I would not have bought this. The update ruins the game, makes it UNmoddable, removes high resolution settings, removes about 20 songs,  makes mouse controls act funny. The update downgrade really messed up a fun game. If I could get my money back, I would.
