I succeeded at the first attempt at Wrong Side of the Tracks. I was so disapppointed that I wanted to restart the mission, just to hear Big Smokes most famous quote.Now for realI had some trouble with the FPS With Frame Limiter off the game engine somehow did not work properly. Among other things diving was impossible and cars acted a bit strange while driving. As soon I put Frame Limiter on the frame rate was so low that the game was unplayable. Luckily this problem can easily be fixed by using an extern tool to limit the frame rate. So, still one of the greatest games I have ever played.
