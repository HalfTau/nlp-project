A game with an amazing story, humor, gameplay and easter eggs/myths. As much as i love the game i have to admit that the steam version is crap compared to retail. If youre going to play the game normally just get this version but if youre someone who plays with mods, wants the removed songs back or wants the retail features back just downgrade the game or buy version 1.0 at a game store or somewhere else.
