Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a good but flawed game by R Studios. Im going to list some Pros and Cons.ProsLarge open worldLots of stuff to doLots of weaponsLots of vehiclesLots of secretsGood costomizationConsNo autosaveSometimes frustating/repetitive missionsRandom Windows XP glitchesControls can get clunky at timesVery slow gameThe game is great for sandboxing and if your interested in bein a straight up busta then your like it. How ever there are alot of graphical glitches and mouse glitches that come along with it. Id reccomend this to you if you dont mind researching fixes to issues, or you enjoy secrets/cheats/freeroam/etc.I give it7/10 Bustas
