IT is a great game but i do not like one thing that the fps is quite bad on steam version but when downgrading there is little to no lag always I mean I have a retail of this game from 2007 and it runs much better no choppy gameplay so getting to the game it is a great experience and it is better to get on a sale since the game is 10 euro or 15 dollars and paying fifteen dollars for a game that was realeased in 2005 should be 5 euro nearly always but if you really want this great game yes get it for the 10 euro or 15 dollars because its worth the price overall the story is great modding community is awesome for many mods you need to downgrade the game graphics were great for the time I really have nothing othere to say then go  get this game its literally better than gta 5 in singleplayer and has great multiplayer but i do prefer gta multiplayer to it the gta sa multiplayer is a mod yyou can get so yes this game is great totally worth the cheap enough price Please do not mind the hours played i played alot of it on ps2 ps4 and mostly pc
