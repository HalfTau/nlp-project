Best of all the GTA games in my opinion. So much stuff to do in this game. It would be close between this game and GTA IV if you include TBoGT as part of GTA IV... and if GTA IVs port wasnt a CPU hogging piece of crap that relies little on the video and mostly on CPU. Buy GTASA... the graphics are outdated now, but the gameplay more than makes up for it.
