This game still holds up today. Do yourself a favor and seek out the V1.0 downgrade really its an upgrade and a handful of mods and youll be playing a game that feels much newer than it actually is. Whether you want to go back to some nostalgia or just have an awesome game to play, San Andreas is a great option. Even in the first few hours of me playing the game again, Im reminded of the countless things Id forgotten. While its not as polished as newer GTA entries, it feels like the team put a ton of work into making sure the game was full of things to do. Remember burglaries? I didnt. What about going and dancing? What about the infamous gang wars? Theres so many side activities in the game, that San Andreas is the equivalent of three or four other games, all wrapped up in one budgetfriendly package thatll run on practically any PC.
