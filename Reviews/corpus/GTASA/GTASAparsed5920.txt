alright GTA San Andreas is a good game i can carry a rpg in public and nobody cares at all. But THE UPDATE SUCKS. They removed soundtrack, saved games and most importantly Modding and im pretty sure that almost all the people who play gta sa on pc uses mods on the game my suggestion bring back mod support or open a steam workshop COME ON ROCKSTAR DONT BE A BUSTA !!
