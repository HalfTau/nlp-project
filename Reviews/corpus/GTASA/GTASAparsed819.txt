One of the greatest games of all time and still my all time favourite GTA game and PS2era game.This is literally the culmination of all GTAs leading up to this point  the map is HUGE and amazing to drive around still to this day, the music is some of the best in a video game Be sure to downgrade your version though to get the cut music due to license expiration and the controls / gameplay are phenominal.Oh and the story is just.... Perfection... Samuel L. Jackson though.... so good.......Stop reading this review and get this ing game!!! !11/10.
