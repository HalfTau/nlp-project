There is A LOT of bad reviews slamming this game for removing songs in the latest patch. They are giving this game a not recommended review because they are butt hurt over this. The reality is that the PC verision of this game lets you create a custom radio station from any music file that resides on your PC, So most likely, this is a nonissue if you can figure this out. You can replace all the songs they took out with the original files on your computer or any other songs that you would want to listen to while playing  like your crappy band you played guitar in while you were in college!I have also read that this does not support 1920x1080 resolution. It does and it works great on my 46 HDTV. The only weird thing is that certain graphics  the most noticible being the map in the lower left  are still lower res. This doesnt really bother me though, because the main game is running in full res.I havent experienced any crashing or glitches thus far. I bought this game the day it came out on Playstation 2 and this Steam version is just as good as I remembered it, except it looks way better. Oh, and Im playing on an Xbox 360 controller, so all the original controller mapping is still there as well.I cant, for the life of me, figure out why people are so upset over the latest patch. To not recommend this game because they took some songs out is just idiotic! Some complain that mods or previous saves dont work after updating, but if you dont own this already, then that is no reason to not recommend this game to you. Buy it! Especially if its on sale for a few dollars. I spent 50 on it when it came out for PS2, and I happily paid a few more dollars to have it on Steam as well to relive a great game thats still as good today as it was over 10 years ago!Buy it if you havent played it, or if you have and want to relive old memories.
