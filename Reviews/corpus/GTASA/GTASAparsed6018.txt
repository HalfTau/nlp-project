This game is complete awesomeness.I like that theres so many customizable stuff! You wont believe how many sht is customizable here unless you play it.. Or see a video or something..The only thing that I dont like a lot is the cutscenes, but its obviously cause the game is pretty old, still, the game hasnt aged that well.This game was and still is, the definitive Grand Theft Auto game.. Well GTA V still pretty good though.. And GTA IV has the best story of all.. Whatever.I r8 8 outta 8, dont h8, m8.
