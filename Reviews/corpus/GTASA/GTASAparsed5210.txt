The story takes place in the 90s. You arrive to San Andreas to bury your mom. Here you introduced to all the most important characters and you seek revenge for the death of your mom. The game is massive and feels bigger of what it actually is. It definitely feels bigger than GTA V. You can climb walls now and your character can actually swim, which was huge back in the day. The story of San Andreas is the biggest yet. Rockstar put a lot of effort into the story this time.There is a lot of variation in the missions, which is something even newer games cannot pull of. There a lot of new features in this game such asto personalize your character.One of the biggest sacrifice Rockstar made was its graphics. Yes, the map is huge but there are few details. Not saying the graphics are bad, but even back then it was underwelming. The only down side of San Andreas must be lack of vibriant colors. Colors feels washed out compared to the previous games, which is personally why San Andreas is not my favorite Grand Theft Auto game.Brilliant voice actors as always! The radio stations are pumped with classics tunes of the 90s anybody can enjoy. They have upped their sound quality and the cars, bikes and planes sounds more realistic this time.I still play this game today and even though it is not my favorite game, it definitely pushes the limit of what games could do back then! Like most Grand Theft Auto games it has aged well, and younger people should appreciate the scale of San Andreas, even if graphics are not on point.
