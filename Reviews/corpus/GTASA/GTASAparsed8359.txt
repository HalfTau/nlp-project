Grand theft auto san andreas is one of the best gta games made in my opinion.This game has many fetures left out of most future grand theft autos and where not incorparated again until the realease of gta 5,such as gambling,property buying,lots of clothing options,the ability to get muscular or fat,eating,ect.I have heared many people complaing about this game not working right,but i have had no game breaking problems.The only thing that happened to me was sometimes the camera would get stuck and would be unrotatable,i fixed this problem permently though,by puting the game in compatiblty mod google how to do it if you have this problem.Story wise it has a strong story as most gtas do,so overall i think this game is a must for gta fans.
