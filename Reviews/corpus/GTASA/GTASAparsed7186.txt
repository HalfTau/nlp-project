Just as awesome as I remember from playing it on the PS2 years back. Lots of fun to be had. All the negative reviews about this game are idiculous, downvoting because of some songs from the sountrack being gone. You realise you can mute the game and even throw on the original soundtrack on in the background or whatever.
