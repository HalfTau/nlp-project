Classic, like always. But apart from all the praise lets face itThe game is a little dated at some points. No, I am not talking about the graphics.There is a certain mechanic I can not get passed in this game. It is such sequenses where you have to dance and press the arrow buttons on the right time. I think it is broke, I cant figure out how to complete those parts. In other words I can not finish the game.
