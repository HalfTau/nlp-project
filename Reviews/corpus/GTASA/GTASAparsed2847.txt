If you ever are keen in the Grand Theft Auto Franchise I suggest getting Grand Theft Auto The Trilogy first.Its a compilation of 3 games set in the 3D Era of the franchise.Okay, to start off. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is ARGUABLY the best GTA game in the series. Some will say Vice City is the best, which is also understandable. First of all, San Andreas OpenWorld environment is very big for its time. It includes a lot of RPG elements such as Stamina, Fat, Weapon Skill, Clothing and the like. As such this includes a lot of socalled minigames to boost said stats and also some are for entertainment sakes. Second, the STORY. San Andreas puts you in the shoes of Carl Johnson hence will be referred as CJ who after the death of his Mom, finally returned to San Andreas after 5 years in Liberty City. Little did he know that a lot happened and changed. It is up to CJ to return the Grove Street Family back to their former glory. Of course not everything is all great, there will be hindrances along the way.Lastly, the soundtrack. San Andreas 17 songs were removed tho, but with a DOWNGRADE PATCH this can be fixed, offers songs from the 90s that will give nostalgia. From hiphop to softrock, this game offers alot and caters to music lovers all over.I suggest getting this game on a sale but the regular price in itself is justifiable enough to warrant it.EDIT This game can run on almost any toaster device out there. Even still, the game holds up to this time.
