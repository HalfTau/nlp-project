The best GTA game, followed by GTA III. Excellent story line and just all around amazing gameplay. The only complaint I have is the port, the port is simply dreadful. No mouse control in the main menu, no support for 169 resolutions and mouse movement is buggy at times. I also noticed a tiny amount of negative mouse acceleration which cant be turned off!. But in the end its still one of the best open world games around  9/10
