I bought the GTA Complete pack on Steam just for this game or rather, for the multiplayer mod. I hadnt played this for years on PS2, still a fun game. Much more to do than in the other GTA games imo and that multiplayer mod puts it above all the others for me. Look up some videos of for SA MP and see if it looks like your sort of thing. zXNoRegretzzXz has some good videos of it.Id say wait till the GTA Complete Pack is on sale again and pick it up then and you get the other GTA games to mess around with as well if you feel like it.
