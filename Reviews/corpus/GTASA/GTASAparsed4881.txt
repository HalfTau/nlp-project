Even though this is a old game I still enjoy it greatly. This game shows what the old GTA was and now what is with GTA V. The game is still great with the great story and believable voice actingWith a few characters to enjoy through out. Also you can do the ocassional rampage killing people.ProsGreat storyBeleivable voice actorsand funny charactersConsDriving sometimes slides aroundBad shooting mechanicscrashes sometimes
