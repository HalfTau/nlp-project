In a way I wish I could have the ability to share the incredible experiences that I had while playing this game with this review.I sadly dont think im that aware of myself, nor am I familiar with my ability to express myself purely, and completely, honestly.I can only say that Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is in a lot of ways the epithome of not only the Grand Theft Auto series, but in my opinion, of open world games.This is the formula that Rockstar created, refined and polished to perfection, and while the game might have technically some issues that range from minor, to abysmal, I dont think anyone can deny that this game, at the very least, has had a significant impact in their lifes, in one way or the other.This is a game that is beloved by people that played it way back when it originally released, up until newcomers to the series that are simply curious about the legacy of this game.The story its excellent, the characters, the missions, the complete an utter range of jokes, ideas, concepts, and experiences that are packed with detail in your journey are merely the fragments of what this game holds. In its attention for developing an enjoyable experience, and a heartfelt one at that, Rockstar turned the flaws of their games in benefits and values, that are shared perfectly with this example of a game.Even when everything in the game feels dated, old, and mechanically flawed, objectively flawed whatever that means the game somehow manages to revert difficult and often hateful missions into pieces that conform something bigger, something memorable.Even after years from the games release you can see that people still share their memories trying to beat missions like Wrong Side of the Tracks a mission that is not only difficult thanks to the tight controls over your vehicle, but also because of the dependency of the games a.i.Altho as much as I can praise the games story, the games incidental experiences that you can get sometimes by simply driving around listening to the incredible selection of songs that are available in the games radio.Theres a significant problem with the games pc version.For starters, the game is missing a lot of content from the consoles versions of the game, cars, effects, enviroments, textures, etc... Theres a lot here that conforms an incredible atmosphere and enhances what is already an excellent game, thats simply missing, with the only ability of instaurating this features with the use of mods, thanks to the incredible, and still active community that still keeps itself passionate even after 12 years from the games release.As I said, a true testament of the legacy of this incredible game.However if it wasnt only the missing content there are other issues, the game has problems running at framerates higher than 60 framerates per second, while there are other people that debate the game also has problems while even surpassing 30 framerates per second, either way its something that I havent personally experience in my time with the game, that as you may see from the Steams recorded time, its not much.This is simply because I have had to downgrade my games version from 3.0 to 1.0, the first, and most compatible version with the modifications created by the community now a days.Its been the only wat that ive found myself actually enjoying the game, as much as I resent the phrase that the developers intended for me to play.If that wasnt enough, new versions also eliminate certain songs from the different fictitious radio stations ingame. Something that as I said I havent experienced thanks to the ability to downgrade and mantain the original first games released version intact by also having to, sadly, move the game away from Steams game directory.At its core, I love this game, I have incredible memories with it, and I think its a game that you owe yourself to play, if you love games, and certainly, if you love Gta, this is a game that in my opinion deserves all the praise and remembrance that it gets even now a days, its a game that can have frustating missions, repetitive ones at that, other times it can be sad, but for the most part I dont think anyone cant deny the game its a fun and entretaining time to experience through and through.This in a lot of ways is also the last Grand Theft Auto game released for the Sixth generation of consoles, and similarly to how in a way Grand Theft Auto 5 was that for the Playstation 3, and the Xbox 360, even while they rerelease that game for newer platforms, including pc, this is a firm, a departure and a letter of love from Rockstar games towards its fans.The gameplay, the characters, the different places and diverse cities that you encounter while exploring the map, the small fragment of time that the leaved since this game up until Grand Theft Auto 4, was enough for people to show there love as well, sharing experiences, creating mods, and even stories that end up becoming part of videogames culture.Grand Theft Auto San Andreas its essentially the definition of what, in my opinion, a great game can be, a great game not only in sales, nor in scores, but in heart, and in memories.Thats the true definition of a successful game for me, a game that 12 years after release people still talk about, still get involved with, both by playing it, as well as in by creating features for the game.I just wish in a way that love had also been shared at its fullest with the pc version of the game, altho after all this years, I frankly can say that I just dont care...Mainly with all the mods that are out there.
