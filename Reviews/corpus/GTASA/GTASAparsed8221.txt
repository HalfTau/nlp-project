One of the games I will probably never put down unless I cant find a platform to play it on.The only gripe I have with it is the fact that you have to jump through several hoops before you can successfully mod it, not only that but even then it will still give you a hard time. Downgrading your gtasa.exe Steam version is 3.0, previous was 1.0/1.2  2.0 is almost mandatory according to a wiki I was reading through for some of the mods...Its still an amazing game without mods though, worth the couple of dollars you can get it for during the sales. Worth full price too.
