Finished this a while ago, but today figured Id load up the old save and wreak havoc. Problem is, when I loaded the game, it brought me to the first cutscene and the beginning of the game. I try a restart. Again, same thing. Pity, its a good game, but this port is ruined by a sloppy system of saves being ruined by updates.Theres apparently a user made save editor that can convert the games saves to newer versions an save them, but I tried it and it isnt working.All I can say is Rockstar, we get it. You cant stand pc gamers after the Hot Coffee incident, but you could at least pretend to like us.
