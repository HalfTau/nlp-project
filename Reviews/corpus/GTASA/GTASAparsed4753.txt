At one point in this game there are three missons you must do to progress in the story. one of the you have to get boxes while defending an npc. this misson is stupidly difficult and the other 2 are button press mini game that i cannot compete for the life of me. other than trying to beat the stupid difficult missions i got really bored. 4/10 CAN I PLEASE JUST WIN THE STUPID LOWRIDER CONTEST!
