Everyone seems to be giving the Steam version of this game bad reviews because of the few missing songs and resolution support loss, but as retail copies are fairly hard to come by nowadays, this is still a great way to experience Rockstars classic game. Dont be scared away by the negative reviews San Andreas is as good as it always has been. However, 15 seems kinda pricey for a game this old, so Id wait for it to go on sale. I got this bundled with III and Vice City for 6
