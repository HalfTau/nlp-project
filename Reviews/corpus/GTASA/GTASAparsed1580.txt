I used to have this game on my PS2 until I accidently spilled coffee on it. The game was fun and I could play on it for hours. Sadly, after buying the game on PC, it got boring very quickly. Hopefully it will be fun again once I give it a few months brake, however, I keep finding myself less and less interested in ever reuploading it to play. Despite that, I still recommend people to play this game.
