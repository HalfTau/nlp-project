ID GIVE THIS VERSION OF GTASA A 5/10... ASKING WHY??NOT MOD COMPATIBLE, GTASA IS KNOWN WELL FOR ITS MODS AND THIS STEAM VERSION MAKES THE FUN GO AWAYSINCE THIS PATCH OF THE GAMENEWSTEAM R2 VERSION IS NOT MOD FRIENDLY, IF YOURE LIKE ME THAT ENJOYS PLAYING THIS GAME WITH INSANE MODS, BETTER NOT WASTE MONEY ON BUYING THIS GAME. IF YOU HAVE THE DVD VERSION BETTER KEEP IT CAUSE ITS NOW AGOLD VERSION OF THE GAME.TORRENT THE GAME VS BUYING THIS VERSION??WELL I WOULD SAY IM A BIT HARSH IN PROMOTING NOT TO BUY THIS GAME.... BUT REALLY IT TOOK SOME INGAME MUSIC THAT WAS SUPPOSIVELY THERE BUT NOW ITS GONE... AND PLUS ITS A REAL HASSLE ON BUYING THIS VERSION THEN DOWNGRADE IT, THERE WILL BE POSSIBLE ERRORS DURING THE PROCESS OR MAYBE GAME BECOMES UNPLAYABLE, MOST ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A VERY SLOW INTERNET CONNECTION. ID BE BETTER OFF INSTALLING A CRACKED VERSION OF THIS GAME AND MOD IT ENDLESSLY AND ENJOY IT... ALTHOUGH I PLAYED THIS GAME AS THE TORRENT/CRACKED VERSION OF THE GAME AND I FELT THAT THE DEVELOPERS DESERVE THE PAYMENT ON THIS WONDERFULLY FUN GAME.....ID PROBABLY REWRITE THIS REVIEW AND GIVE IT 1000/10 IF A FUTURE UPDATE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE VERSION 1.0,WHERE THE MODS ARE COMPATIBLE AND A BETTER SCREEN RESOLUTION FIX..ID STILL ENJOY THE GAME THOUGH REGARDLESS IT NOT MODED BUTBECAUSE OF MY PAST EXPERIENCE OF THIS GAME AS A MODDED ON ID BETTER CHOOSE MY COMFORT ZONE OF THIS GAME.... ANYWAYS THIS GAME WOULD STILL BE REMEMBERED AS A VERY EXCELENT GAME THAT MADE A STRONG COMMUNITY....
