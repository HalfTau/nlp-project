I had played this game originally when it came out in 2004. For some reason I abandoned it without finishing the main campaign, or doing any of the side missions. More than 10 years later, with some luck getting it running on modern computers I was able to replay a game which I now consider the best open world game made.Closing in on almost 100 completion, I try to think of the other GTA games Ive played and for some reason they dont compare to the fun Ive had in San Andreas. Just the sheer amount of things to interact with, missions, side quests, hidden quests, safe houses, business assests, driving schools, races. The fact that you can gain more skills in driving cars, bicycles, motorcycles, boats, planes, increase your muscles, stamina, health. The amount of it is staggering to me looking back at a 10 year old game. To top off the content San Andreas offers you, there is the obvious GTA universe over the top mayhem and destruction to look forward to.The main campaign is pretty great, and will take you from a young busta living in the ghetto on grove street, to a multimillionaire with legitimate business assests and fantastic mansions. CJ is a really fun character to play, and he surrounds himself with a great supporting cast with lots of high quality voice actors.This is seriously one of the best open world games made, and easily in the top 5 of my favorite games.
