One of the best games i ever played.its 13 years old but many people still play it.I went through it 5 times and I still did not get bored.The plot sweeps, some of todays games do not match her in terms of the historians story.This is a legend.Despite the notsogood graphics and mechanics what to expect from the 2004 gamehes doing an amazing job in your head.Hundreds of memes have come down from this game and the channels based on this game are still very popular.In one word, the game is for everyone, and all selfrespecting collectors should have it in their library.
