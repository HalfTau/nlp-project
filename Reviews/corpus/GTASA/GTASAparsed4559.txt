Never before have i played a game that is so story driven. San Andreas in my opinion is the best GTA game out there, and if you havent played it before, i recommend that you do, not only does it do well on story and gameplay, but also with dialouge. For those who have played the game, Ill have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese and a large sodaMelvin Big Smoke Harris in the mission Drivethru.
