One of the best GTA games in the series. It isnt about the great graphics and physics, you have to remember the time period. This is a great game to go down in history, I do recommend getting it on the original xbox and ps2 like I have. Better controls in my opinion but, thats just me from playing it on there eight years ago. Beat the full story on 10 Year Verison on Xbox 360. Great game, would play again.
