Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is Probably the best GTA Pc port availible besides Grand Theft Auto 5. The game throws you into a world of fun as soon as you start. If you have played GTA 5 before, This game may seem slightly familiar as its concept is very much the same. I hav enjoyed almost every minute of playing. Its a blast to pull out the old cheats every once and a while and cause mayhem throughout the city. It is a really good game and you should totally buy it.
