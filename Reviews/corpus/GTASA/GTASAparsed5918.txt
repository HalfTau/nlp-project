This game is literally my entire childhood. I have so many great memories from this game so I cannot say anything bad about it. Yes its old but so is HalfLife you dont need to look at the graphics to define a good game and this is truly the best Grand Theft Auto out there. Grand Theft Auto V is a very good game and one of my favorites also but I cannot put that before this game because of the memories.Seriously, try this game and just dont concentrate on the graphics, then you will appreciate how good it is. This game was way ahead of its time.
