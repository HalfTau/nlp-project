I will preface this review by saying that the pc version has many issues however there are many fixes available.Overall this game is a masterpiece. Great characters, plot and many twists and turns along the way. I hadnt played this game until after I had beat GTA V and can say without nostalgia goggles that this game is still one of the best games of all time.
