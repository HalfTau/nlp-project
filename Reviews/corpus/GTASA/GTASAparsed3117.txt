What a great game. The story is great, and the dialogue between characters is well written. Combat feels nice on mouse and keyboard. Flying is a bit of an issue, but certainly passable. Recent updates have given it 169 resolutions and Xbox controller suppoart that the original couldnt offer without mods at least. One of the downsides to the updated Steam version is the omission of some music tracks from the original game, and the fact that you cannot utilize multiplayer mods. Great version if youre looking to just jump in and play easily, though.
