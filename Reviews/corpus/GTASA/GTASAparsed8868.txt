Not including 5, this is probly the best GTA, and probly my favorite game of all time. And also the hardist. The three times I have botten this game I have never been able to beat it. But in spite of it flaws San Andreas holds true to what makes the Grand Theft Auto seiours great and has lots of enjoyablty, replayablity, and insanity to keep you entertained for hours.
