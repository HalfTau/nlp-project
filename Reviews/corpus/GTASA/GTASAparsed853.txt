This game is broken. Its a shame. This was my favorite GTA back in the day, and it sucks to write this. It has to be updated, or Steam needs to covert this back to the 2.0 version of this game. If neither of those are options, you really need to give people their money back. Its unbelievable what a disaster this is compared to the PS2/XBOX verisons of the game.Heres what I dont like so far. Its been like a couple hours or so of playing time1. I go to the gym and then I try to leave. It cuts, I walk out and then I walk back into the gym. Im thus trapped inside the gym.2. Im doing the home invastion mission for Ryder, Im creeping along and then I go to pick up a crate, and I die out of nowhere, for no reason.Ive barely started playing it and its such a wreck. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying this, and until they update, thats where Ill stand.
