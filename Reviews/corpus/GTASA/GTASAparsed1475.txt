This game is t in its current condition. Never have I seen san andreas crash so ing many times. Not even when I was pirating this game it did crash that often. Which was over 10 years ago, so dont be a butthurt softie too.Good job rockstar, not only did you remove songs, but somehow you made the game ier in the process too. Youve beat it in hard mode. Congradulations.
