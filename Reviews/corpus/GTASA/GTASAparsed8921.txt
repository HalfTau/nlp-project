GTA games have always had their place. And although San Andreas is supposedly the most fullyfeatured release to date, it is deficient in almost all areas.Graphics The game is graphically inferior, for the time it was released on the PC. Low quality textures, models and low view distance make this game a mediocre entry at best.Sound The farcical dialogue can sometimes be funny, and the radios feature good songs. But all the stereotypical voice acting is grating and obnoxious, and the gun sounds and other sound effects are mediocre at best.Gameplay Clearly, no effort was made to port this game to PC, although whether or not it should have been remains up for debate. At its core its a TPS with driving elements but the aiming system is clumsy, the driving controls are downright drunken, and the consolized save system  you can only save in your house is incredibly outdated, even for 2005 standards. In addition, the story and characters are incredibly annoying. Annoying isnt a strong enough word. Im all for crime films and games IF they have compelling characters. There is nothing compelling about anyone you meet in this game. Nearly everyone who is your ally is despicable, and have no redeeming qualities. Maybe its just me, but I find no reason to do missions involving tagging and lowriders, especially for people who give me no reason to like them. I understand this game is gang themed, but despite its sandbox gameplay, the missions themselves are quite linear and offer nearly no reason to complete them.A good deal of my criticisms are subjective, but I believe this game is not only better suited on console, but better suited for a specific type of gamer that has little in common with me. Im all for morally dark or straight up evil characters, but they have to be interesting, and the opportunity for roleplaying has to be there. Theres nothing interesting about ordinary criminals and gang scum.Whether you agree or not, This game is off my hard drive for a long time.
