One of the best GTAs to date.A whole ing state for you to explore, and a lot of missions to be played.Thankfully, Rockstar fixed the terrible aiming of GTA 3 and Vice CIty with a better one. And hell, for a GTA game, it has a good story, but its no match to IVs story.And, oddly enough, the game still holds up. Thanks to the modding community, you can make this game look like GTA IV, or a game that was made in 20072008.But, as any sandbox game, it has its problems in this case, texture problems, and its not only to this one, Im talking like GTA 3 to this.Just buy it, you will not  regret it.9/10
