This game was a very good game up till now.Instead of a great PC game made for it now he have lost close to 20 songs, 1080p resolution and weve got port of a mobile port of this excuse of a game.Rockstar is going down, also pulling their games down with them. I used to think that rockstar is a good developer, ive bought most of their games including gta v on ps3 but what they pulled now makes all the previous actions not important.Important thing is weve had a good PC game, now they switched it for a stinky smelly piece of crap. Congratulations Rockstar, good luck selling a version of a game worse than pirated copy downloaded from the p2p torrent. Not many studios can destroy already good game like you do!Better look for a box copy of the game to experience the only true feeling of San Andreas PCi recommend this version. Digital downloads can easly change the game and rip us off.
