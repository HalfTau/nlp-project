This update makes me sick.Heres whats going on Its no longer the PC version of SA that weve come to know and love. An update made it into the iPad/Xbox 360 port which led to content being cut as well as mods being left in the dust.I wont lose sleep over it though. You could always pick up a physical copy somehow or play it on PS2, I guess.
