Its over 12 years old now. Why does it still hold up? The graphics are st! Shut up. Graphics matter absolutely nothing. They are a bonus. If you have good graphics then great, if you dont, who cares.Why does it still hold up? Because1. The story is great. The story is great. It has everything that is still a problem in society. It has racism, police brutality, corruption, drugs etc. Its basicly taking all the problems in the world and jamming them all together. Sure, it is not as realistic as it could be but who cares? So what if the cops are idots and the entire place is filled with gangs killing each other? Its still fun. These things add to the story. It isnt just a Laadi daadi daa, I am living in a good town, OH NO! A sudden insert enemy here IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD CJ I will save this city!. No. The city is lost. Los Santos is lost. CJ isnt a hero, hes just a NORMAL person, just trying to survive while trying to keep his gang and his family together.2. The entire San Andreas is fun to explore. It is a fun place to explore. It has easter eggs, before mentioned gangs, basketball, fast food, gun stores, everything. Not much to say. Answer to why it is fun to play is EVERYTHING.3. Come on. Its GTA. Come on.
