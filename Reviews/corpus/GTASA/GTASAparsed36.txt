Great game. I absolutely love how Steam has yet to recognize that I quit the game 3 days ago, even after I completely closed out of Steam and reopened it, the game still lurks. I mean, how could anyone put so much time into these generic levels? Dons get me wrong, the games great, has a good story, good soundtrack, and a ton of character.
