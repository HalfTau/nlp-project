This is a great game, its the exact same game that was released on consuls including the graphics. Yes, Rockstar removed a ton of songs but thats not Rockstars fault. Music license was over so they had to remove the songs for legal reasons. Just like the consuls the game does freeze now and then but as long as you stay saved its not a big deal.
