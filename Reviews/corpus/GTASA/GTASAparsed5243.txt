It took me 7 years to complete this game. I got it on PS2 7 years ago and rebought it recently. I decided to play the story instead of just messing around. It was among the best decissions ever. This game, and many if not all, GTA games are rewarding and full of many, many, manymanymanymany things to do. Its hard to find someone who doesnt like GTA games. Its pretty much a second life. Some missions are INCREDIBLY hard and it is HIGHLY suggested that you get a CONTROLLER. The story will take you a good 30 or 40 hours to complete. Please buy it.
