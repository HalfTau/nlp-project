Another amazing installment in the infamous franchise, GTA San Andreas tells the gritty and compelling story of Carl Johnson who returns to his hometown in Los Santos only to find that things have gotten a lot more violent in his absence. If story is not your thing, there is still a vast map with so much to explore that you could play for months and still not discover everything the game has to offer.
