Ive got 100 completion in this game 5 times so far I used to play it preSteam, my playtime here isnt correct, its over 300 hours and I still get the same satisfaction and excitement every time I start the game. It represents such an important part of my gaming history.The soundtrack is great, the story is one of the best in GTA history I like GTA IV more, the customisation of CJ, the side storylines, the city... I love everything about it, I know every part of Los Santos by heart.I recommend it for everyone, literally.
