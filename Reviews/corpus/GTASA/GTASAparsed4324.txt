so through my past 97 minutes pretty much an hour, I have already fell in love with this game, I dont care about how the acting is, or the graphics. its 2005 for this game. and this is my second gta game i have played first was gta 5. Buy this game before july 4th. you will regret not buying this game. But you should change up the controls a little. they were werid.
