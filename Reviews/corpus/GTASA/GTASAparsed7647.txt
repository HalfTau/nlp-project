GTA San Andreas in general is a classic game no doubt, but this release is truly a horrible port. It took nearly 10 years for Rockstar to add true controller support November 2014 and even that is mediocre at best. Its worthy to note that in the November 2014 patch, Rockstar disenfranchised its current customers by unnecessarily removing content and apparently stripping out higher resolutions options. The patch also caused the ingame graphics to appear worse though this could just be isolated to my experience. Overall, the steam version of GTA San Andreas is more like the Frankenstein version and I wouldnt recommend it to those seeking the authentic GTA San Andreas experience. If you dont mind your game constantly transforming on you, then I suppose this version may be for you. Rockstars track record of poor GTA PC releases undoubtedly continues with their latest revision of this great game.For those who already own GTA San Andreas on Steam, you should consider installing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas  Enhanced Edition mod per the Steam User Guide. You will not be disappointed in this mod as it will make your GTA San Andreas experience on the PC much more tolerable and playable!
