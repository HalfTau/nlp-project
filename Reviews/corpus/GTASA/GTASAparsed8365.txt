Dont get me wrong  Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a fantastic game. Ive spent many a childhood hours playing this game, and spent 15 planning to reunite my current self with my fantastic adolescent memories of San Andreas. However, this game is essentially COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE with Windows 8, and from what I hear it is a chore getting it to work with Windows 7 as well. From my experience, my mouse did not function at all. This left me to use the NumPad to simply look around, which quite honestly sucked. I attempted to use my Xbox 360 controller which normally works flawlessly on every other PC game I either want or dont want to use it on, only to experience the L thumbstick alone working. Every other button on the controller did nothing whatsoever. I attempted a controls configuration ingame, which wouldnt recognize the controller. Xpadder showed some promise of using the controller with this game, but was not compatible with Windows 8 Steam San Andreas.Basically, yes  San Andreas is an amazing game I would reccomend to everyone. However Windows 8 and apparently Windows 7 Just simply dont work with this now dated game. I thought Steam would properly port this old gem, but in this case I was unfortunately dissapointed. If youre rocking Windows Vista, buy it! I was able to enjoy GTA SA on my older laptop to full extent, even without a controller. Otherwise, youre better off downloading/buying a disc on your good ol Xbox 360.
