zero is an annoying, useless, cringy piece of his missions are either too hard or too easy but boring because it takes so much time and in both situations you have to listen to him say the same thing over and over again, the guy specializes on remote control toys and it is  and out of place. i think they tried to make a smart hacker nerd type of guy but even saint row did that more realistically. who did they think would like playing a gangster game and use a toy helicopter withcontrols and battle another guystoy helicopter or race a toy car orwith that boring of a character instead of using the realand blow some realup.also when you fall into water you have to drown yourself or swim to the nearest shore for like two hours irl because you swim so ing slow and ladders dont work
