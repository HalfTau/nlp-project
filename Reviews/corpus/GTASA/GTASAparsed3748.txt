For the first few hours youll be distracted by the older graphics, but once youve acclimatized youll discover the gameplay has held up pretty well over the years.The city and architecture are really impressive once you stop to take a look at it, with each different region feeling distinct and well thought out. The cast of characters is as good as any other GTA title, and as usual theyre always entertaining. A few standouts would be the hilarious Catalina Cynthia Farrell, Toreno voiced by James Woods, and Kanye West lookalike y B voiced by Charlie Murphy.You can expect to spend close to 60 hours working through the storyline and various side activities, so for such a low price you get amazing bang for your buck. The side activities are varied enough to keep them interesting as well  from races to aerial acrobatics, pimping to performing semi truck deliveries, taking over gang territories to hunting down collectibles.Aside from the older graphics, those who have played the more recent GTA games will notice the absence of the cover system and Euphoria ragdoll physics that first appeared with GTA IV. Even without them its still a blast, but it will make you appreciate those features more after being reminded of what GTA was like before them.
