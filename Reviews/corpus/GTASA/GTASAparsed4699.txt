What can I say? I think everbody heard of this masterpiece from 2005. It literally shaped the modern OpenWorld games with an interactive enviroment.This is just a small insight of the story dont worry  there is noincluded. exciting story until the end best radio stations/soundtrack inovative mechanics special folder for your own music! nice gameplay modeled cars and cities long playtime! really funny moments you can drive a tank huge map different ambients country, forest, ghettos, towns other OpenWorld activities RPG elements/stats design your CJ with tattoos, cloths or a new haircut customize your cars no highend 8k gamerPC needed  toaster is enough Multiplayer!!!!1!!1! MODS its laborious to install mods frame bugs activate FrameLimiter  30fps annoying bikecops... mods can cause crashes update November 2014 probably cut All you had to do, was following the damn train CJ! Smoke Rider saying that you dont know how to driveThe update in November 2014 changed as I heard lots of things  and not in a good way deactivated the HDversion and other things. In Germany maybe somewhere else... the game is also cut as far as I know  that means that you can not hit people while laying on the ground, shoot their headoff, people dont drop money and bodies disappear after 5 seconds. The UncutPatch causes often problems and crashes.I would recommend that you do not buy the Steamversion of GTA San Andreas to prevent the changes of the update.But otherwise I can say that this part of the GTAseries is in my opinion the best because Carl Johnson is the most authentic protagonist in my opinion...DOn purpose I did not mentioned the bad graphics, because this game is from 2004/2005 and it would be unfair to mark that as bad aspect  so dont be a graphicwhor.eTo conclude I give GTA SApossible points. I think that this is a very good and entitled result Ill have two numbah 9sa numbah 9 largea numbah 6 with extra dipa numbah 7two numbuh 45s, one with cheeseand a laaaaarge soda...  Big Smoke
