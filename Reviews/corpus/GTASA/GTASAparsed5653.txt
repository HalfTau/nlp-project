Who doesnt love some good old violence, with virtual people and virtual objects to destroy at your will. The game runs great Ive had no problems and crashing or errors all the missions play quite smoothly the only issue I have are the controls you may have to do some changing to fit your needs. Since I wasnt able to do the plane missions I had to use a controller to fly the plane a lot easier it worked out incredibly fine and thats how I got through the game. If youre looking for a nice classic game to play that has tons of violence and partial nudity with drugs an action then this game is pretty much for you or if youre trying to get into the series of grand theft auto. I completely recommend this game as long as you have a controller with you to do the plane missions.
