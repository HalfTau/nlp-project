Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is what I consider the best of the series. I am constantly surprised Rockstar managed to put this game on the PS2. It features a massive open world, with a simply sublime soundtrack and cast of characters. The gameplay was far more dynamic then its predecessor. With being able to climb walls, to having a parachute, to finding a jetpack and doing drive by shootings from 50 feet in the air.San Andreas was just as amazing when it first came out as it is today. Almost every modern sandbox game takes leaps and bounds that Rockstar first carved in 2004. If you only buy one Grand Theft Auto game, buy this one. You will definately not regret, nor forget, San Andreas.
