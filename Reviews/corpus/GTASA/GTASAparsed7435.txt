Excellent game, but I advise against buying it via steam, since there were 18 songs removed in the latest update. If you want to relive your childhood memories, go buy a disc version of this game somewhere else, or borrow it from somewhere wink wink . There is also no 1080p support, so you have to get mods in order to get your songs back and fix the resolution.I highly reccomend this game, but I advise against buying it from steam, and therefore I will give this a negative review.
