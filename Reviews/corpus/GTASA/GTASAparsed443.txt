I was hesitating to buy this again off of steam since I heard the version was updated to remastered mobile edition quality, but to my surprise I got the original version where when widescreen is selected, the mini map is wide. Dont know if I got lucky or its just always that way but Im surely reliving my childhood here.There are the occasional glitches still, but the story and gameplay have held up after all these years. If youre looking to play a true GTA game, you gotta start here.
