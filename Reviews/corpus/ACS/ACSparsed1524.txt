I have played many of the Assassins Creed games not all of the additional content, mind you and played this game immediately after replaying Black Flag.As far as graphics go, the improvements are minor. Fluidity depends on your operating system and tweaking some of the graphics settings is not difficult and can vastly improve performance. I played on highest graphics settings with no hiccups but I was playing with 2 GTX 970 graphics cards. I did notice that in cut scenes often times sounds or voices did not sync up with graphics.The gameplay itself is very similar to all other Assassins Creeds, with the added bonus of having a character solely meant to beat people to a pulp. I did love Jacobs character because you could take a break from Evies infiltration and silence to ruthlessly beat down baddies to your hearts content. While this may not be the most effective way to play the game, the option is there it makes the battling so much more enjoyable.The game itself is significantly less cluttered than other AC games. It does have the collectibles that all the games have, but the sidequests dont become too much of a task to complete and scale well with the leveling system. The main story progresses rapidly in comparison to the other AC games but I didnt mind this as much as I do with games like Far Cry.All in all it is a good game worth getting. It is nowhere near as long as the other games, so i wouldnt exactly suggest spending 60 bucks on it, but definitely pick it up at a sale.
