Theres no way I could have played this before assassins creed unity, so much more improvements with scaling buildings and fighting. The story is very interesting and I enhoyed all the side activities. I didnt have to grind to the point of losing interest which is perfect for me. Gaining skills and items are fun and of course you gotta love the frye twins! 10/10 game for me.
