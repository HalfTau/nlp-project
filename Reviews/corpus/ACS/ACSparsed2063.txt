Generally fun. If you liked the other AC games, you will probably like this one.The racing events are pure crap, though.I had a comfortable lead and  had crashed the AI carriages into walls to take them out. Then I watched their markers on the minimap teleport from where I left them to right behind me. Free tip, Ubi  if you have to be lazy enough to make your AI cheat, at least put in the effort to make it less obvious.
