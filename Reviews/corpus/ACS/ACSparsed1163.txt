What the  Steam. I had no idea this game was running and now I cant get my refund because the game didnt even ing start. Thanks Steam, really appreciate it. Buying a game that doesnt even work what a joke. 45 down the drain and no way to get it back. Unbelievable, I worked myoff to get that money you know. Ridiculous, this game is the appitomy of DO NOT BUY IT
