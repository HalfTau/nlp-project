Its my first completed Assassins game D. Earlier Ive been never interested in this but exactly Syndicate was able to attract me because of Victorian atmosphere. The game telling us about twins and their adventures in the world of corruption, politics and liars in Great London at XIX. Besides story missions we also have missions with famous people such as C. Darwin, C. Dickens, K. Marx, queen Victoria and that extends storyline much better. That game especially for those who appreciate the beauty of architecture the majestic Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and many other historical buildings was evoke delight and aesthetic pleasure. The world around is very interesting for observing some help in catching a thief, scaring off a bully or protecting ordinary people was a kind of a rest after another mission for me. Besides of repetitive missions like deliver merchandise to their destination I almost never bored and thats why I can recommend this game at all.
