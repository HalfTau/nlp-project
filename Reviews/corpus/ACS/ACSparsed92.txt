If youre hoping they improved something from the previous games, either story or gameplay wise, i can tell you thats not the case. They tried adding a cool new mechanic with two playable characters, but unfortunatly the character development is garbage. I dont know why they would challenge themselves in trying to make two interesting characters, when they cant even handle one. Gameplay wise, its same old ubisoft clear map objectives type of game, only this time you clear buroughs and make them your own. The first few times this is exciting and cool, but then you repeat the same thing over and over again, same gameplay and the same damn annoying speech at the end. This game is fun for a couple of hours and then grows stale.Also, the best gear you can get in the game is the ones that are unlockable by either preordering or buying a DLC. So if you actually have that gear, you never have to upgrade and a huge amount of the games item mechanics go unused. Such as for example crafting gear by using rare crafting material which you achieve from various missions.Would not reccomend spending your money on this game, even with a discount.
