Well where to begin.. SInce this is the PC version lets begin with the graphics. Well its optimized, but then again you need 4gb VRAM to play this game at high graphics. Thats asking too much! This is where optimization comes in. But guess Ubisoft does not have time for it. Have not played much of the game yet. WIll update this review as I progress on. Till then keep on assassinating!! !
