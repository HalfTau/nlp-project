I like this game Because, its telling the history and whats happend in the past, i really enjoy it, its one of the best games that i am playing now, some people they dont like history and they dont like to read about it, here is one thing if we all think about whats happened in the past and what they were doing we will never find an answer how did we get here with all these technological stuff, soo Thumbs Up for the Creator of this game to bring the history back to life again.
