This is the first Assassins Creed game I really got into I tried the first one, but it was a little slow for my taste and I love it so much! I love the characters, the stories, the surroundings and the many historical personas you meet along the way. I love that you play as both Evie and Jacob twins and that they have their specialities when it comes to mainquests. With all sidequests and running around London outside of mainquests you get to choose which one of them you play as, so you can upgrade them both as you like all the way. This game has gangwars, magic, romance, action, awesome outfits, awesome weapons and ghost hunts. I mean, come on! I would suggest to also buy the Season Pass for the whole experience.Shoutout to my friend Sondre who got me this beauty for my birthday. 3
