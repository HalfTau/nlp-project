Besides the positivity from other users on the performance, i feel like this game is an improvement from past Assassins Creeds.The combat is so much faster than Unity and just feels better, fighting tough enemies can make fight repetitives as you have to hit them alot, but besides that is overall a good fighting system.Im very impressed with the music, it makes the game feel even better and just fits in.Playing as Jacob im absolutely loving the dialogue. He has something appealing that i didnt feel in Arno and is overall a great character. I see him as a pretty funny idiot.This is my opinion based on the first 3 hours of the game.
