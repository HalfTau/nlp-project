Assassins Creed Syndicate is a great game... at least it would be if I could play it. A recent patch has broken the game leaving thousands of players with a product that wont launch.The issue is related to a warning that used to pop up about old video drivers. Before the patch you could click OK and the game would start, but now the pop up no longer appears so the game just sits there with the AC logo forever displayed. This issue persists even after downloading the latest Nvidia drivers.Any one considering buying this game be warned! YOU could shell out the cash for this game only to be left with a product that doesnt work.To my knowledge Ubisoft has been very silent about the issue as no one Ive found has gotten a reply about it, so until Ubisoft gets off their asses and lets me play the game I paid for consider me disgruntled. And to think I trusted them again after Unity...
