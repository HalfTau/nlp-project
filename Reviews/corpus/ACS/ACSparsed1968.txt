I am a long time Assassins Creed fan, might have been one of the few who was looking forward to Syndicate and dont think Unity was an dissapointment.Syndicate on the other hand, really dissapointed me. I played through the game but it was a pain. London looked amazing, the game on the other hand was terribly boring. And most of the time it annoyed me.I am going to buy the next game, but please Ubisoft do more.. this was NOT worth the money in my eyes.
