The problem with this series is it became a Politically correct virtue signaling of crap.Females did not wear pants during the victorian era, and if they did they were not making a fashion statement. It was out of sheer necessity because females could not have found jobs or it was dangerous for them to be dressed like a female due to the massive amount of crime.I know this series is not the most historically correct entertainment, though they did have their history down up to Unity. Now its just a really goofy thing. Why would there be female gang leaders in charge of gangs who also fight grownmen, including those brutes in the game. I mean come on, who is this for? I know females do not make up that large of a population in the real gaming community not mobile gaming, so why are these developers pandering to them like so? Do they not realize they are completely trashing this series and the rest of their games because they are listening to some very vocal and fringe minority who represent maybe 3 of the gamers when they ruin a historical series like this?Aside from my rant, the game isnt a bad one. Its just these things really ruin the game due to their glaring historical smears. It has great graphics and a better parkour system. I dont really remember the story except that it was feminized and of course the male protagonist has to be the stereotypical jockimpatientbrute while the female was the catlike smart one.If you can get past the identity politics in this game, than its worth a go when on sale.
