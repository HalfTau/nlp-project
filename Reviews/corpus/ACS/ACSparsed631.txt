I loved this whole games mechanics and, despite the time gap, i like the idea of rope weapons and train and boats steam engine. The storyline is kinda cliche but i think its a nice break from either dead silence from our protaganist, or really shtty dialouge. though i am a completionist and i thought all the helix glitches and chests were simply to mind boggeling so this is a game that will never touch 100.Conclusion BUY THIS  NOW!Ollie
