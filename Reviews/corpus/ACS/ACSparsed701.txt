The main quest is decent but the sidequests are often too buggy to actually finish.The choice of having two main characters is very odd and it doesnt work at all. You end up becoming attached to one of them and swear as soon as youre forced to play as the other one. Good in theory but awfully excecuted.Combat system is absolute garbage.Youre stading on a ledge, looking down on an enemy and thinking damn, this is a good spot to snipe with a throwing blade. You aim at him and press the button to throw a dagger. However, your character jumps down and melee kills the enemy instead  alerting every guard in the entire area. The button to fire/throw is the same button as doing a jumping assassination. Countless times Ive died because of this.Oh and lets not forget the tailing missions. NO ONE LIKES THE TAILING MISSIONS. Yet Ubisoft keeps adding them to every AC game.
