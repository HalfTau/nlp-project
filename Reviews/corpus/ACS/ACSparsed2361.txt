Good game. I like the story line so far, and i can say for sure that this is one of those storylines where you care about the main characters. So far i am not too happy about the combat system, but that is more like a personal opinion. Personally i prefer the old combat system, where everything was a little bit easier. Syndicate takes Assasins creed to the next level, because the choices you make in combat does matter, and you can indeed end up dead if you choose wrong.The Graphics are ok. Just like any other assasins creed game, i dont really see a big difference in graphics, but hey, that might just be me being stupid. My game did also end up crashing 1 minute into the game, but it did not happen again. Maybe this just had something to do with the launch. I am also getting a lot of loading lag spikes whilst driving a carriage, but i dont really prefer the carriage so it does not matter to me.I will for sure finish the campaign and try to master the combat system so i can have some fun, but i dont see myself playing a lot of hours after the main story.So as an assasins creed fan, is it worth buying?Yes it is. You can for sure get a lot of hours of fun gameplay and interesting Main quests.So is it worth getting today? Should i pay the full price?I would say no. The game has some stuff that i simply not prefer and do not like compared to other assasins creed games. I suggest looking up some gameplay and story on youtube before buying the game for its full price.
