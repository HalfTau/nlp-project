Brutally awesome! Currently 35 hours of game play and 62 complete of the game! Yes I do the side stuff on searching for items, but still great bang for the buck. Bought it on sale 25 EUR. Even tho it has partial Steam controller support, you wont have an issue with it. But you must start the game from steam, and the controller preconnected. It wont connect when game is launched.. That the only downside Story wise, I found it awesome. I wont spoil anything, if you want to know some more about the story I would suggest you Google that!Ps. If there are missions you cant get throu, there are a lot of forums ans wikis for the hole friencise of Assassins Creed.
