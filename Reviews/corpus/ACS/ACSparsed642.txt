Underrated and best AC game since Black Flag, and one of the best of the entire franchise.   It is a shame this game got overlooked by so many in wake of the AC Unity mess.  This is not just more of the same AC stuff.  This game mixes up the gameplay content to keep you interested for a good while, with a better variety of side content than past AC games.  Both of the protagonist playable characters are fun.  The voice acting is exceptional.  The story is better than average.  The city of London looks and feels incrediblibly alive, and has a steampunk vibe.  This was definately a bargain from a Steam sale, but I would have paid full price had I not been as appreshensive when it first released.
