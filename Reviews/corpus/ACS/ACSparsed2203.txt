I dont usually write these, but for this one I think its warranted. I like to feel that after Unity no one was more critical than I. Just felt like it was so good with so many issues that kept it down this is known.Here comes Syndicate, and I can confidently say that this is by for my favorite AC, without a doubt. I love the era, the feel, the fighting, its well optimized for PC, and I love the characters and the ability to swap between them...and the zipline feature is a game changer!!  Ubisoft did a great job with this one, hopefully this is a glimpse of the future, no more mistakes like Unity. Keep it up, AWESOME GAME! AC IS BACK!!
