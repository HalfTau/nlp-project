Requires some 3rd Party UPLAY account. What garbage....Seems that you need to be online in order to play. GTA 5 sucks for the same reason and I never want to deal with such an annoyance ever again. Honestly I never played this game after I purchased it. I just know that it isnt worth the headache to run it. I simply started it up, and as soon as it asked me to create some UPLAY account, I knew that I wasted my money. I want no part of this.Better off waiting for a crack to be released. I dont know why they include something so annoying.
