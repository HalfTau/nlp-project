This game is certainly a return to form for the series in my eyes. It has become my second favourite behind ACII for many of the reasons I enjoy that legend of a game. It took me a while to get going with it because within the first couple of hours the game crashed and this is apparently a recurring problem with playing the game on PC. However, I ended up enjoying the game so much that the infrequent crashes which would only happen after certain loading times no longer became an issue for me. I greatly enjoyed all the characters in this game and loved the humour throughout. Jacob and Evie are fantastic main characters and I hope to see more of them in the future. Likewise, the villains in this game felt like they had a lot of character and individuality. The combat feels fast and fluid, same with the freerunning. The city of London looks stunning and is a lot of fun to traverse. However, although I was satisfied with the story and ending it certainly wont satisfy everyone. It doesnt grip you as much as ACII but it still delivers. This game feels much more lighthearted than other Assassins Creed games and I thought this was a welcome change. The side quests were a lot of fun and included interesting historical figures such as Charles Dickens and Charles Darwin. Overall, a very enjoyable experience and a game I will continuously return to. I didnt think the Assassins Creed series could pull itself together again but this game is definitely a comeback.
