Syndicate was fun, with fun characters, with fun dialogue and a relatively mediocre story. The graphics are great, it is surprisingly well optimised. However, there is simply something wrong with it. I dont know exactly what but it is as if the game has lost its speed. The introduction of the grappling hook is certainly a minus for me. Free run in the AC series was about being fast and fluent. With so much gap between buildings and the necessity of the grappling hook, free run is ruined in AC Syndicate. Every 1015 meters, you will need to halt your parkour mode and watch your player move very boringly across a line. This is not the only problem but for me it was a frustrating one  even though I understand its reasons being due to the greater street capacity between buildings of the industrialised London.Nevertheless, it was a good game, so I would definitely recommend it.
