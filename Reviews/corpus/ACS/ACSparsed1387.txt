More fun that unity. Just one major drawback bugs and freezing. I had multiple crashes in the game. Also a a bug where I landed in a wall and could not fast travel. Another thing I did not like is that I never reached upgrade for poison darts because I could not find Thanjavur. I did open the yellow chest. Weird.Anyway overall I enjoyed it, despite the crashes.Regarding the Jack The Ripper part if you have crashes in the main game, then this addition is indeed a horror to play due to the numerous crashes almost one after each mission. I do  not recommend to buy the addition.
