Absolutly amazing. Easily the best game Ive played for a long time.The free run and graphics in this game are incredable. I see a lot of peole complaining about the controls but if you go through and configure them to the way you like then theres no problem. Yes, the freerun down and action button are the same, but Ive found they rarely interfer with eachother. Sometimes Ill have to press a button multiple times for it to work but this is rarely an issue and I can easily overlook it in a game this incredible.BUY THIS GAME.
