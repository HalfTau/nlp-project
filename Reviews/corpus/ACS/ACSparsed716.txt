A definite improvement over Unity, but the game still has its fair share ofbrPROS Great setting Interesting characters Good story Its not like Unity at allCONS Modern day stuff sucks. The combat ing garbage and only works when it wants to Climbing is awkward because the controls only work half the time Story was somewhat predictable Too many collectibles Helix credits. you Ubisoft  for dragging thatinto here aswell. Uplay No hidden blade combatAll in all, its a pretty good game, but it has a long way to go. 6/10
