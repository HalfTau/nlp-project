8/10  Very GoodAssassins Creed Syndicate is fun to play, with a good main story as always, lots of side missions, and new game mechanics to further enhance the playstyle of the standard AC gameplay.GOODMain story is interesting, I was always wondering what was going to happen next.Jack the Ripper DLC is one of the best DLC campains I have ever played, exceeding my expectations greatly. Good enough to be a standalone game if it was just a bit longer...perfect length for DLC, though.A few new game mechanics grappling line, carriage driving, etc.Signature AC stealth and parkour.BADModern Abstergo story realizes just how pointless it is by having almost nothing to do with the main story...maybe this should be listed under the Good, lol, I always thought the modern story was needless drivel.While the environment of Old London is really cool, graphics overall prove to be lackluster. NPCs that arent main characters look drab and unpolished the buildings all look dusty, and not in the sense of dirt, but rather lack of vibrance.Same signature AC stealth and parkour comes with same signature AC glitchy maneuvering. In one instance, I died multiple times because my character would ignore the handholds not inches away, and simply plummet to the ground.Animation glitches freerunning across thin air, executing enemies without touching them.CONCLUSIONAssassins Creed Syndicate has the same old formula as most AC games, as well as the same old problems. But, its far from bad, its actually rather enjoyable to play...highly recommend the Jack the Ripper expansion as well.Game currently runs on Steam for 40, Jack the Ripper is 15, its worth it for both.
