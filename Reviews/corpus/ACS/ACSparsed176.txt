London as a setting is really nice play to it, seems more open to move around and doesnt have those out of place ramps all over the place that make it obvious to you to climb on. The grappling hook is a bit OP IMO, can easily escape targets and climb buildings with with no effort, but i still dont mind having it in game. One of the main issues with the game is that climbing buildings and moving around in general isnt very smooth as you would sometimes climb the wrong ledge and then get spotted by the enemy, which is incredibly frustrating. Overall game has a decent story and main characters, has its flaws but would still recommend.
