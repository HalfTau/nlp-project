Didnt expect much going into this game, and still managed to get bored rather quick. First of, I dont like protagonists one bit, theyre too cheesy, Jacob reminds me of Ezio, with that annoying womanizing brat attitude.Evie is better, but still pretty cheesy. Secondly, the whole gangstuff with the Rooks, is lame as hell, I cant stand it. I just want to run around by myself like we did in the earlier games, and none of this street gang t. The city is pretty stale, it looks good, but it looks the same everywhere. Having the base on a moving train, cool idea, bad game mechanic.Lately, every main character is following their own goal, they dont give a  about the creed, which saddens me, A lot.Final verdict  Its decent, nothing special.
