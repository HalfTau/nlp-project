For me this game is on par with AC2 wich is the best in the series in my opinion.The characters Evie and Jacob are both fun and charismatic in their own way,industrial London is amazing setting and combat is better and improved over the last AC games. Its a great addition to the series,i was delaying the purchase for long time but finally pulled the trigger on the summer sale. And it is well worth it.
