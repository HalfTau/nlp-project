I understand the importance of the graphical stability and the framerates and whatnot, but really, people should also talk about how ing epic the gameplay is.As a fan of the franchise since the first game, I dont find the story to be that good, or the characters too interesting comparing them to the first ACs. We dont need a carbon copy of Ezio, but sadly Ubisoft cant make any other set of characters as interesting as the ones in the Ezio trilogy. They arent bad but they arent great eitherBut gameplaywise? This is where the game truly shines. I havent experienced this kind of feeling with an AC game since I played AC2 after playing the first one.The game takes the best bits from Unity and makes them better, like the new to the series stealth system, parkour system, customization, skills, and some resemblance to the combat blocking at the exact time is not important tho, and the combat feels more arcadebutton mashing style, way faster than any AC gameThe combat may feel clunky at first, but for me it was an acquired taste. The parkour however, feels as fluid as ever and the new grappling hook is a really nice addition in my opinion, and if you dont enjoy it you can avoid it without problem.I also think the new missions are designed way better, I have not finished the game yet, but the missions make way more sense, are more interesting and way less repetitive than the first games. No more endless tale missions, there is an immense variety of stuff to do, and every type of mission requires a different aproach, youre not going to try the same thing inside a factory than aboard a boat.The thing is, the stealth is implemented way better in this games than in previous ones, the mission design is more open and interesting and the navigation through the world is fluid, also taking into account the carriages.The game is chaotic and it doesnt take itself too seriously,that is a really fresh change that the franchise needed.For the people like me who likes the modern story, the game is a small step but in the right direction, there are just 10 minutes worth of cinematics, which kind of sucks, but it means that Ubisoft knows that the modern day storyline is necessary to keep a lot of old fans buying the games.So, in the end, it is not the perfect AC game. it has its problems, but the gameplay is really well designed and it really shows that the developers are walking towards the right direction, in a way if you dont btch a lot about every little mistake you might find just for the  of it it could be said that this is the return of the franchise...sorry for bad english, not my native language
