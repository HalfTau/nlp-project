Very sad i have to bring my setting all the way on Very High from Ultra to have 60 fps with GTX980 i7 4790k CPU. Just sad. This game i think is dead to me. People pay so much money to build Pcs and then in return we cant even get good games. If you think about it, i had to refund all 3 new games that just came out include BO3, Fallout 4 and this one now.
