It seems Ubisoft has finally learned its lesson, or at least knows a refund is just a few clicks away. Either way this game runs buttery smooth at least for me with a GTX 980 and FX8320 that is overclocked to 4.5 Ghz.  The game itself is light years ahead of Unity when it comes to fun aswell.  This game is a must buy if youre an AC fan.
