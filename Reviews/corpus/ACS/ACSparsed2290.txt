Too many bugs. Yes it is a Bugs Creed. Suffer graphic bugs even with my NVIDIA GT 980M. Missions and story lines are not good, a little bit boring. Now, I think I cannot finish this game. I play a Charles Dickens side story, I fail to tackle a theif. Then it comes to loading. I think after loading I will tackle the thief agian as normal. But in fact, I loading, I suddenly enter the critical time the screen becomes red, and I can do nothing. ESC and TAB do not work. Then the game loading again, then red again, Even I restart the game cannot avoid this stupid bug. I cannot abort this memory either, since ESC does not work. I do not think Uibsoft really cares about the comment secion here. They just want to make money. The game such as Assassins Creed cannot be produced so fast. Yet, for the sake of money, they produce it annually. Then, what I get is boring story lines, graphic bugs and loading bugs. Plus, one of the main character is ing stupid and annoying. He is Jacob Frye. He can be an Assassin? That is hilarious. What he can do is only to kill people. He does not have or respect memory. He is stupid. But Ubisoft sets up a such character. This is the first time I write comment here. I am just so disappointed and feel nothing I can do. Though this is an average quality game, let me finish it. But even the least requiste, I cannot get. Sigh!
