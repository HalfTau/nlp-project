Another assassins creed game..After waiting for more than a month to play this game on PC and after reading many reviews on PS4 I am finally able to see all the glory for myself.Yes, GLORY. You read that right.I too was expecting anothershow, the return of Unitys game breaking bugs and boring gameplay,  AI and dry story.But this is not the case with Syndicate. Syndicate combines the good looking graphics and enormous city of Unity and the attention to detail and interesting game mechanics of Black Flag.We see the return of the Whistle, we can also carry bodies and hide them or put them in a particular spot to attract attention. Combat has been refreshed and while at the first few levels its a little bit boring, it gets much more interesting later on as you aquire new skills and combos.The game offers a variety of activities stretching from Fight Clubs, Carriage races to Templar Hunts and Gang Wars.The story 6 hours into the game appears to be much more immersive and connected to the Real Life stuff  something that was missing in Unity.There are no game breaking bugs in the game but it is far from perfect optimisation. Londons streets sees less people than Paris and this has helped bring down the load on your CPU, however all the Nvidia Gameworks gizmos sure take a load on your GPU. With my GTX 970 i can have almost everything maxed out and i manage to keep it just over 55 fps.Overall the game plays really well and it offers long hours of gameplay.Worth the 59!
