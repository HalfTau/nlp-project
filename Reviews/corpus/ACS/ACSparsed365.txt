 Victorian London is mesmerizing and atmospheric, as is the stunning attention to minor details in places like Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, St James Park, Trafalgars Square, etc. Standard faire of addictive collectables and side missions. Usual black tar heroin for history buffs that is the series hallmark. Writing  dialogue this time around feels particularly strained and uninspired. Very MagicSchoolBus/ForrestGumplike shoehorning o genericf historical figures like Dickens, Queen Victoria, A. Graham Bell, etc.
