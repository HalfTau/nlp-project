At release, like any other AC Or Ubisoft, really game this was a buggy mess. Sure it wasnt as bad as Unity, but few things are.Now we are a solid year postrelease and I have to say that apart from the franchises typical Its not a bug, its a feature misdemeanors, Syndicate is surprisingly fun. Runs smoothly, plays well, very pretty when it comes to the eyecandy, well worth the buy.
