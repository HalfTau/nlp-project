Ah, I had forgotten why I stopped playing Assassins Creed. Those missions that enter a particular section where, no matter what you do, you are now locked into what is basically a mobile cutscene where your only option is to keep on dying until you figure out what you can and cant do . Escaping with the book bought it all back. Cant jump onto other carriages. Can only fight people in the wagon. Cant throw knives. Have to shoot the designated targets in the head to kill them fast enough. And, at the end, make directly for the destination marker or youre not going to finish. Video game on rails. Do the exact sequence of actions as the programmers have dictated. Sidescrollers have more flexibility.Having said that, it would appear that the rest of the game is more or less as good as most of the previous ones. Nothing particulary astonishing anywhere. Just Assassins Creed as it has always been, despite their assurance that its an improved combat system. Phaugh. Ubisoft couldnt do an original thing if their very lives depended on it. Just reskin the thing and kick it out the door. Well, if you like AC, be assured its no worse than the rest. No better, either.
