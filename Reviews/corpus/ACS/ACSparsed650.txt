After playing Black Flag I was afraid Id never be able to enjoy an Assassins Creed game again if it didnt include awesome naval warship combat. Well, Syndicate didnt have any warships, but it was amazingly fun without them.At times this game felt like Grand Theft Carriage. The inclusion of horse drawn carriages lead to some of the most fun and chaotic moments in the game. Theres nothing like hijacking a rival gangs supply delivery, and the high speed chases that ensue. Its reminiscent of the chariot battles in Ben Hurr. Smashing your carriage into enemies carriage, running them off the road, and jumping on the roof while your horses keep running so you can attempt a drive by shot to enemy drivers. Its a great adrenaline rush.I also love the new main characters. The brother  sister duo of Jacob and Evie Frye are as charismatic and likable as Edward Kenway. Instead of being pirates, the siblings are street gang leaders. Battling rival Templar gangs for territorial dominance is the majority of the games side missions focus. Youll be doing various task to sabotage the rival gangs operations including  freeing children from poor labor conditions, hijacking cargo delivery, kidnapping leaders, to good ole assassinations. Once you do enough of these missions youll draw out the enemy gangs general in a final Gangs of New York style brawl to determine who runs the region.I really enjoyed the side missions and gang wars. I never grew tired or bored despite the inevitable repetitious nature of open world side missions.This is certainly a great Creed game. The greatest? No, thats still Black Flag for me. However, Syndicate is a damn close second. Im now excited again about the AC franchise, and looking forward to the next era.
