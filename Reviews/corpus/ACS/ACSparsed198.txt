Did you enjoy black flag? well you might enjoy this one! I dont know you . . . so . . cant make promises. But i can tell you that it is packed full of fun missions, has even cooler historical characters than black flag i know, its hard to believe, and even cooler gadgets! plus its not unity edit it has come to my attention that some would consider unity a good game for the whole family and in that case it is unity so . . . play it, have fun and probs best to read the comments on the DLCs before buying them. Have fun!
