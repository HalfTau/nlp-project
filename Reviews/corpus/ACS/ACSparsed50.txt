This game is many things, but i asure you This is not an Assassinss Creed game! The main story has a plot so week that it feels like your watching a low budget TV movie. The side quests are meaningless. One can argue that 19th century London is well constructed, well...it is, but a game cannot be measured by its map alone. There is so many things wrong with this game that its hard to number them all. I guess ill just asail you with the fact that parkour was rendered obsolete by the inception of the cable gun, so, you will not parkour more then 5 seconds straught through the entire game. Still, this was a must play for me because of my AC marathon on my road2origins. Thank god Origins is something from an entire diferent universe, but more on that later when i finish it.
