Played it.Finished it.Story 10/10Gameplay 6/10Graphic 8/10Overall 8/10Story is nicely done and interesting but gameplay is frustrating. You can complete whole game only by throwing blades. Characters sticking to the building fragments or going up when you want to go down, its making few missions hard to do like tail missions. Grappling hook is good only becouse its making us close an eye for poor climbing and sticking to the walls. THERE IS NO JUMPING BACK WHILE ON THE WALL! Parkour missing a lot of parts from previous games.Simply finish the game with blades and thats it. Everything dead in no time if you hit headshot. EVEN BOSSES Nice story poor gameplay in compare to previous ACs.
