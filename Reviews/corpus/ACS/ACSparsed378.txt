Fighing in this game is equivlent to press attack 9999 times and dont even bother trying to block vs. blackflags and before  where you can actually survive more than 4 guys beating you up due to choppy fighting. Feels and plays like a bad port in that regard. Carrages was interesting but, as plenty of people point out, unrealistic and awkward. I went into AC Syndicate right after playing AC Blackflag and about 23 chapters in I couldnt play any more it was that painful to move or fight.Movement. Going into a dark tunnel has poor light transition that leaves me blind. It maked me jump into/on/over/below everything when i was trying to do something that isnt that hard like climb a wall, jump over an alley or climb down. The only good thing was the camera angles when i moved around.While there were some good things to the game, there were also bad things that made the game less than enjoyable. I dont know anything about the plot, sadly, which seemed like it would head in an interesting direction from chapter 1.
