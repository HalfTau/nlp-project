I would never call myself a superfan of Assassins Creed i have a curse where I have to buy them yearly, but I have only finished one in the entire series Assassins Creed 2. I usually put about 10 hours into each one then quit from having too muchto do on the map.Unity really turned me off of the games and I vowed to quit. Well, that vow lasted about 4 months after Syndicate came out and it was on sale and I bought it, thinking I was going to regret it.Boy was I wrong.This game is amazing. Its going to be the second Assassins Creed game I ever beat because it is just so full of charm and fun. Gone is the frustrating missions, and Evie and Jacob are just a joy to play as. Theyre not terrible people who murder and steal for no reason. The city itself is amazing and the graphics are insane if you can run it.I cant speak highly of this game enough. Sure its another Assassins Creed game, but if you havent played the series in a while then get this one. Ziplining makes traversel so so so so so much more easier and fun. The cameos are charming and the missions are fun.
