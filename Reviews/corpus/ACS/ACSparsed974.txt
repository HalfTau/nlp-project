A return to Standards for Ubisoft and looking back on it, they still ed up The Division but regardless this was actually a good game with a reasonably low number of bugs. Best game Ubisoft has released since the last AC2.Evie and Jacob are both fun characters and its interesting seeing this story from two different perspectives.Typical Assassins Creed gameplay dont expect anything groundbreaking.Jack the Ripper is some fun DLC especially if youre interested in detective type things.
