Really enjoyed it. The plot is a bit meh but the gameplay is classic AC gameplay. Every now and then had some stuttering bugs 3 or 4 times during the playthrough but rebooting the computer and it was back to normal.Buying helix credits doesnt work properly though it took a couple days for them to be added to my account and when they were it wouldnt let me spend them, so stay away from those.Jack the Ripper DLC is pretty good.Basically, its pretty, fun, has the odd bug, and you should ignore the e shop.
