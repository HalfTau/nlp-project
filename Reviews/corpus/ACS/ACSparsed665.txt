This is the first Assassins Creed game Ive finished since Revelations.I am not a fan of open world games. Sadly, I cant even finish Witcher 3. But this game did not bother me.Cool setting, great soundtrack. The dual characters are a nice touch for implementing a female character as well as a male.Okay story line, nothing amazing. If youre getting this game, its because Victorian Era London is an exciting playground in your mind. Its a well realized world.Ran pretty well, though I did have a few instances of the game freezing my computer. Maybe three over all 27 hours.Average framerate was right around 48 FPS.i7 6770RX 480 8GB16GB DDR4 2400mhz
