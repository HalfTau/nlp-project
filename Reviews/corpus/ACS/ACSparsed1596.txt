This was one of my favs along with 4 and 2. I really like the setting of Victorian London and Ubisoft didnt disapoint.They always do a fantastic job at detailing the world while also teaching you a bit about historical characters and events. The gameplay is also more along the lines of 2, were you have to take strong holds aroudn the map in order to unlock items/money.Jacob and Evie are likeable enough still no match for Ezio and I enjoyed their story line. Although I still dont care for the modern junk they put in every game, its just an annoying side part of the game in my eyes, Id rather AC series didnt have it at all. Luckily the main quest did not have much of it, unlike some of the privous outings that overdid it AC4One thing that reallyme off was the horse racing and any time you had to run from AI which is quite alot and the rubber band effect. If youve played any racing games, you know what Im talking about. In Syndicate, there is no outrunning the AI, they are faster then you and they can aim very well and shot you from behind where you cant get them. Very frustrating.Evie also becomes super strong late game with her invisability cloak plus throwing knife upgrades making missions a walk in the park. Just throw a knife to the head and enemies are instantly dead even level 10 all from being invisible. Not that its that hard with Jacob either but at least you have to put some effort in sneaking and positioning.Finally the final boss fight  ending is super lame. Its like Ubisoft rushed the final 1015 mins or so of the game. Anyway if you like AC this is still quite an ejoyable run. Definately better then AC Unity, though this one like Unity crashed on me every time I took a stronghold and the custscene would finish. I conquered the strongholds first so after that it ran fine.
