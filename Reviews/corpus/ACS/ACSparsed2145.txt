Assassins Creed has, until now, been something I appreciated more in concept than in execution. Syndicate is the first in the series I have actually, legitimately enjoyed in almost all regards. Part of this is due to a bit of personal bias  Victorian London has always been a favorite setting of mine and its here in beautiful, meticulously detailed glory. But aside from that, the actual gameplay is improved, specifically with stealth and traversal. Botching a stealth kill doesnt automatically alert everyone and their mother within a 20 mile radius, and the zipline lets you avoid having to ponderously pick your way up every single building facade if you dont want to. Furthermore, each sidequest can be completed through a number of different methods, and theres not an overwhelming amount of stupid collectibles. And while the story itself is merely okay, the characters you meet and play as are all pretty charming and even legit funny. Syndcicate seems to be all about removing all the series barriers between you and fun, and its definitely working for me.
