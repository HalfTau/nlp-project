I have a mixed feelings about this game. It IS enjoyable but i dont think it has AC soul in it. You are not a real assassin but something more like mafia father and i think assassins should work more alone than with an army.Great settings and graphicsLondon is very beautiful and aliveFighting mechanics are more realisticAC 3 was brutal and i liked it but this is better for sake of realismHorse carriageracesfights on roofshijacksTrainsfights on roofshijacksSeason Pass and Jack the Ripper DLC BRUTAL,GRIMM the way i like itFamous side characters are are well chosen but they are all assassin friendly what i mean is you know that they will give you a mission and you will help them/i had a feeling they are all ultimately good and can do nothing wrongAdam and Eve dont act like assassinsin the crowd sure you cant just say you are an assassin but even they are angry they dont look threatening at allStory worst part of the game in my opinion. Sharp distinction between goodassassins and eviltemplars. From early parts to the end predictable. Childish and lame lines from protagonists.Atmoshere graphics are good really but i prefer more shady light in the dark type gamesDreadful Crimes not because they are bad worse than unity in my opinion but because there is not enough of them and it is a DLCOverall i think i agree with metacritic score.
