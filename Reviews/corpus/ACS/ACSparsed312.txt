After 30min of playtime, I think I know what Im talking about.Just another AC game. Now In England, it seems.Press SHIFT to freerun. Just hold a button and they game does everything for you. You can be a parkour badass, and drink beer with your other hand while at it.But the dealbraker for me was FOV. Or the lack of availability to change it. Like playing with binoculars on, cant do it, eyes hurt.2/10, would refund again
