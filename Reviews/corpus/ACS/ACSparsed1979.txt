Well i know my hours dont say alot but listen anyway!for starters i have to say I was worried about buying this game due to the last 2 games that came out you know those unmentionables but I am very please to say that Ubisoft has made an amazing come back with their assassins creed games and that Syndicate will be played long after the next ones to come out.for starters this game is finished and tested for flaues and i have to say i havent found many that hault game play, the only thing i found is that some enemies end up hovering in the air when your fighting them.the game adds many new futures to assassins creed like the grappeling hook, gang wars, train robberies ect that i hope will come back around later on in the series.in short i recommend this game to all current Assassins creed fans anyone new looking to get into the series and those who are a little worried the game will be like the last ones in all i give this game a 9/10 because there are some small flaues but like i said they dont hault the game play in any way or form.Well done Ubisoft on this amazing come back looking foward to the next one.
