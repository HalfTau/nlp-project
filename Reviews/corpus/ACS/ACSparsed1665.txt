Assassins Creed Syndicate is what the franchise is all about. Keep in mind I didnt play Unity. Visuals are beautiful I love the battle system you can view an enemys level using eagle vision V, the higher his/her level is the harder it is to counter their attacks. Gunshot have a window of opurtunity in which you can evade them buy pressing F. You can finally crouch C again I didnt play Unity so for me this is new Parkour/Free running system improved in a way that suits industrial London. Instead of simply holding shiftW and climbing upwards or free running, you can hold shiftW  E to free run down or shiftW  Space to free run up. If your only holding shift  W you have no risk of jumping of high places.If you loved Brotherhood you will definiately love Syndicate.
