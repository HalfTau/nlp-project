Very beautiful graphics. Sincerely enjoyed walking arounf Victorian London.Super awesome mechanics  lots of different combinationsGood amount of side missions story.Theres one susprise mission which I likedThere really isnt any story whatsoever.You get to play both Evie and Jacob which I really enjoyed.I didnt like the fact that they give you a little taste of Jack the Ripper, to encourage you to buy the DLC later. lol
