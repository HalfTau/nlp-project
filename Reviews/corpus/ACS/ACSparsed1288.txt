this game is unplayable. You will crash  alot of times. and then u will have to re start teh game which takes forever in my opinion and hope u dont crash again. But Hopeing does not work since u will crash later on in the game. gameplay seems fun its such a shame that they released a game in this shape and no news on if tehy gonna fix all these crashs. kinda wish i read teh reviews before buying the gold edition. next time i will read reviews.
