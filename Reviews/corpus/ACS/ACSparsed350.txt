I know this game is almost 2 years old now, but ive just played it and so here why i like it vThis game is so very recommended, because, wellwhy wouldnt you want to play this gameeven if it isnt AC Origin, where you could kill crocs with new unfamiliar combatyou could, explore or assasinate and kill people in Victorian Era London/England whilst listening to classic violin that itself is the reason why i love itAlso, you could play as Evie or Jacob thats cool although i prefer EvieWhat I did right after attaining the freedom to roam England was to find viewpoints just so I can enjoy this game at my own pace while accidentally bumping into enemies v
