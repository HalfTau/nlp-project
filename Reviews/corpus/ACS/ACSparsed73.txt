So after 13 hours I will try to sum up the game with no spoilersProsGreat graphicsInteresting storyGreat free roamActually hard combat that often forces you to go stealthMany things to exploreLikeable charactersPlenty of freedom in transportationDoes include Karl MarxConsNot a lot of weapon varietyClunky controls while drivingCant aim your weapons while in combat meaning you have to either quick fire or fight, making it rather difficult to fight more than one foeI give this game an 8.6/10
