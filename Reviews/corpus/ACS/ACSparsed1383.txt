Awesome game returning the franchise to its former glory, Brits do it again. Fell in love with the characters.Awesome story and the dlc are worth it.Nice graphics and love it.Only downisde is that the cockney rhyming slang comes with translation so them nonlondoners can understand whats goin on half the time,Overall though, the story is awesome and the game is beautiful. The characters are captured perfectly and the famous people from the Victorian era are captured in such a way that you are 100 emersed in the game.The Best History Lesson Ever!
