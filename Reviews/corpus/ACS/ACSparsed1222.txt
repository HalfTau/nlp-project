Ill keep it short and simple.My favorite game so far is AC2. AC Syndicate is the first AC game after the Ezio trilogy that felt like an AC game again.Free running and harpooning/ziplining through London feels great. The whole game feels great actually. Like the assassins got a bit more modern.I really like seeing a female main character in AC since most AC games are male dominant.But I love both main characters. But also how they implemented this in the game.With the skill trees there are skills available only to Evie or Jacob, making Evie a more stealthie character and Jacob a more combat character.Ofcourse this game has some cons as well, the region takeover is repetitive. But every game has its flaws. Generally I feel that Assassins Creed Syndicate is a step in the right direction.
