So it seems like UBISOFT has learned their lesson with its buggy UNITY port came out last year however the game still has some minor performance issues... Hopefully UBISOFT will look into those issues...Gameplay wise..Its great! Im glad they added two characters into this game!Jacob is fun with his stupid humorEvie is a bit more serious and likable DBoth of them has different ways of playing and set of missions which is great..Kidnapping is something new to AC lolhowever this is still primarily a game of stealth...Try it for your self!My PCIntel Core i74770K  3.6 GHzGIGABYTE GAH97MD3HMSI Geforce GTX 970 OC16 GB Kingston HYPERX  1600 MHz
