this game by far is one of my favourite Assassind Creed games. it implements a new Grappling hook mechanic which helps move around England with more haste than normal, as well as fun territory control missions that make the game more enjoyable to play and really helps you saver the gameplay if youre the kind of person who beats the main campaign and instantly moves on. if youre not, youre in for a really really long playthrough experience. and must i say, its worth it.
