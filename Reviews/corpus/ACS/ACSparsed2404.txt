Well its a Assassins Creed game, so you like it or not.Concerning performance on a 4790K 980GTX SSD Ive turned down AA to FXAA and shadows to high due to some weird camera stuttering in the intro part of the game, everything else is running at max. However once I got into the real game map all problems disappeared and its been silky smooth 60 fps at 1080p.So if you have stuttering issues in the game, just hold on until you get into the real game world.
