Pretty fun, but I wish it had not required you to play the other assasin at points, because it just feels like Oh, Evie needs something to do, Ummm, Have her go help a sick kid IDK it just doesnt really feel fluent enough. Other than that the cloth physics are atrocius, its probably just my PC but my cloth physics run at a almost constant 15 FPS, which annoys the Sht out of me, but enough about the Negatives, My Positives are that its the first completely open world/city Victorian game, which I would love to see more games cover this time period, as I think its really cool. Opinion Secondly I liked the variety in apparel, I felt it could have had more, but it shows that Ubisoft is taking steps in the right direction. I hope you found this review helpful, thanks for reading!SignedBoomerLizard
