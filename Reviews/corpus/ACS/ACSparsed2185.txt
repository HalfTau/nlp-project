I loved this game! If youre really serious about complete continuity and historical accuracy every other step seems to lead you into another historically significant figure you might find yourself at odds with this latest game in the Assassins Creed franchise, but if youre willing to suspend your disbelief, its tons of fun. Though the fasttravel points are handy especially when your trying to actually go across the map and do the quests, but keep getting distracted and ending up farther away but if you dont want to use them, theyre completely optional. The open world is great, alternating between being Victorian Batman, staring in Grand Theft Horse Carriage 5, and just running around murdering people because, well... Why not, is really fun and engaging. The twins, though their history/origins a bit... rushed over, are genuinely likeable if you alow yourself to try. Their reactions to things are animated quite well, and feel realistic.Theres so much more I could write, but thats a rabbit hole I wont head into.Anyways TLDR Great game just dont take it too seriously and youll have fun.
