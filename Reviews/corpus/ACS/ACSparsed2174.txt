Update 2 Still doesnt work and a  patch was released 3 days ago! Im refunding this game a second time sadly and Im no longer gonna play AC games on the pc, sadly. Its just too much of hassle going through the troubleshooting steps when the game should work right when you load it up, just like every other steam game I own. I did buy the game on the ps4 though, and its really fun if you still like assassins creed games since 2. I havent played much of Black flag or unity yet, but the main characters here seem to be way more likable than Connor who seemed way to bland to me.This GAME DOES NOT WORK. this is infuriating because I went through an hour trying to get this game to run with different troubleshooting steps and  the game simply crashes at the startup screen. Ive never had an issue where Ive purchased a game before only to not work with the exception of Games for Windows Live games. I got this for half off from a sale and I really do want to play this game because Ive played and see in it grow from the beginning up till black flag so far. If Ubisoft doesnt provide a fix soon, I might have to sadly return the game because spending hours trying to run it just isnt worth my time. This is how pc game was like before the steam era, but for the most part now you should easily be able to just simply download the game and run it as long as you have the recommended or higher specs.
