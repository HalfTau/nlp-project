THE CONTROLS HAVE MESSED UP THE GAME ENJOYMENT!!!!!At the start of game imidiately gave out the stinky feeling.  it had no start menu option and removed the smaller window setting of 600800 for the lower hardware pc like mine. or everything becomes a slow motion of 5minute mission turning into half hour of real time waiting for the actions to complete, the only  thing it was good for is the animal attacks reppell.Starting with the Unity the extra controls for the same actions as before are tottaly messing up with understadning of what needs to be done and whats going on, had spend entire day on just retrying the cover abillity segment of quest.The freerun had payed the price as well. instead of keep going, the character just stops at the ledge untill the extra E comand activated, the AC3 had it better then this, just Shift and W for free run ,with the safe run along untill jumped, and an extra Spacebar for climbing.And some of the good skills have gone missing, the human shield has dissapeard alongside with stealth swim, dissarm parry, rope swing, tree climb, insta kill chains, parry kill and the first game blenblend.The skill tree is totally unnesesary and unexpected, the new game starts, as a previus player you would expect the basic skills to be avaliable from start or develep as needs appear natturaly thru game progress.  and only the new abillities that are not key to character  development would be trainable, like the new armmour and weapons.The actual horse ride would be a welome return since AC4 instead of cariagge ride.The AC4 Black Flag had replaced the horses with sailing which is one thing, but the further Freedom Cry and Rebellion had bigger share of land travel. And  Unity had very short story, for the main game thats it ssuposed to be, but atleast nice new iceberg feature.    So far my favorite is AC3, which had everything, the good controls, the land mount, hunting feature, and the intringuin story that keeps you hooked.and with these confussing controls and slow animatic video, you already forgot what the stroy is, and hard to fully enjoy the game.The only good things about Unity And Syndicate are the advance eagle vision thru walls, makes tail goal and stealth kill easy, andthe crouch sneaking, dont even need to hold the activation button and can sprint while its active too.after  I finish this one, not bying any more untill its worth the price.
