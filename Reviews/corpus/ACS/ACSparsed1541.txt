Syndicate... the reviews looked good the gameplay looked good and I let my self get tricked into buying their games again... after installing the game 2 times on diferent discs and reinstalling Uplay, hello darkness here we meet again. This pile of dung only gave me the loading icon and never started. Its a known bug without a fix and they wont give aabout it. I hope you choke on this game ubisoft.
