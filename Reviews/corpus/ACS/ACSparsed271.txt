Same old but.....I thought I got sick of the franchise.....but this one is good. While its not the Assassins Story i care, London as playground is amazing. The bleak weather and dark back alleys attract. The nights are especially beautiful.The 2 Characters Evie and Jacob are also more interesting as the usual protagonists in the franchise.The gameplay has a variety of new features only thing missing.....a photo mode. Like in all Assassins Creed i wish a photo mode, but in this one especially.. The basic camera is bad as alwyas and ruins the look.I wish Ubisoft would produce new franchises with such fantastic settings. But even its just another AC, its worth the money and time.
