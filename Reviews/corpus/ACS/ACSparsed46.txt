I love the AC games but fell away form then after Black Flag. During 2017 Steam Winter Sale I picked up AC Black Flag, AC Rogue, AC Unity, AC Syndicate, AC Origins. I played Black Flag on PS3 so I started at Rogue then, Unity, and Syndicate. I have not played Origins as of this review. I love the story of this game, or at least as far I got in it. After 10 hours of DOZENS of crashes and doing stalking forums and community posts, No fix.You might have heard that Unity was a CLITCH AS  GAME but not compared to this, Unity crash maybe 6 times for me throughout the story, I havent even made it throught after the game. My advice is look up a story recap and skip the nightmare that is playing Syndicate.
