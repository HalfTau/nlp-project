I just played the game for a couple of hours and came to the conclusion that I cant recommend it.The setting and story are quite nice, the game looks pretty good and is fun playing.BUTSometimes movement is just messed up. Im using a XBox 360 Controller and at some points the character wont climb down and goes sideways instead or even drops an dies.That would all be ok so far, but the game keeps crashing.First it crahes in the first bossfight when you cross the Thames, then it crashes on every more or less important mission.It normally crashes in the last part of it, so you have to replay the mission over and over again and hope it will last once.After all this time the game is released now, there still is no fix for those issues...Not worth the money.For 10 to 15 Bucks Id recommend it, but not for 60...
