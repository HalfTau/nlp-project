Well, i think this game is off the charts. Exellent graphics, great gameplay, nice storyalthough like review from gamers before, its too subjective, i do love the combat system, its the best, because i think the combat system in AC unity rather hard to control, better combat system than AC3, but the enemy less variant than AC3Well i give 9.5/10 for this game....very recommended for AC series loverBut the story i prefer the EzioDesmond saga....breathtaking story, such ashame tho for now....but keep going ubisoft, youve done amazing job
