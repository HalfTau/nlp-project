I am new to Assassins Creed so I have nothing to compare it too. I thought the gameplay was great the story kept me going and the artwork was beautiful.I have spent a lot of time in Syndicate and have not yet started Jack the Ripper, though it looks interesting.Not much to say except it is fun to play, and I am looking forward to the next installment.
