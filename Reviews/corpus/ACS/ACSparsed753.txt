i got like 30 before i was just dont the story is rather borring industrial london is not what i would call a beautiful or fun place and the combat system is absolute garbage  i remember comboing a guy nearly 30 times befroe i was able to kill him...... i thought i was supposed to be a deadly assasin and im restricted to only a few  weapons with diffrent skins and a bunch of   HORRIBLE combos
