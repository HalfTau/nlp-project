A great game and one of the Best in the Series....Gameplay is smooth and the storyline is better compared to Unity....The Graphics are awesome apart from very minor glictches and Bugs....The overall feel of Londonis just great and the Side Activities are better and put up quite a challenge....My rating is 9.5/10...
