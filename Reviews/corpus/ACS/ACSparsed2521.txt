I believe that Ubisoft learned from Assassins Creed Unity. So far I have finished the first mission with no FPS drops. I was able to maintain a constant 60 fps with little to no changes I am playing with MAX settings The graphics are great, and the game runs so much smoother than Unity.I commented this, but I will leave this here nowKeep in mind I have only gotten through the first 3 missions. So far I enjoy the concept of being able to switch between characters, but I dont like that that share money and do not share gear. The story has not hooked me yet as much as the games prior have. I really am enjoying the atmosphere of Industrial London. I hope to encounter a larger selection of weapons, for as of right now there are no swords just the hidden blade and the sisters cane. As the game stands with the performance, atmosphere, and the story, I would give it an 8/10My settings are set to all MAX, with the exception of VSync turned off.For those asking about my sytem specsI have 2 AMD Radeon 290s Crossfie enabled 4GBIntel I74770K Quadcore  3.5 Ghz16 GBs RAM 2 8 GB sticks1300 Watt power supplyWindows 10
