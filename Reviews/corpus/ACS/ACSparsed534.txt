I have currently only played 2 hours of it and i LOVE it,I receomend this game to any AC Fan although Black flag was much more Interesting to begin with. I do admit that it takes awhile before you can get to open world, Which i dont like Only because the open world aspect for me is one of the seller points. however i do like to story so far and i cant wait to continue it! But in my mind 53 dollers is a little much maybe 35 or 40 would be more worth it so i recemend waiting for the summer or winter sale before bing to drop the prices. This is still a great game and a truley recomend it and i hope if you do buy it that you enjoy it!
