Terrible, same as the other AC and not much different, sure you can swithc between characters and you get a grappling hook, but both charracters have very little differences til later on and the grappling hook only make it too easy. Stealth is no longer a factor as you breeze through the missions and most mechanics havnt changed from the first game. Big let down
