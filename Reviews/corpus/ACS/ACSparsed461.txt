I, for one, have always been a huge supporter of the concept behind the Assassins Creed games a virtual historical tourism action adventure in which you meet famous characters from history and change the world through an eternal rivalry between two secret societies existing in the shadows? Count me in. But after Ubisoft got more and more comfortable with taking the p.i.s.s and eventually ran their own hypetrain into a ravine with the disastrous releases of Watch Dogs and Assassins Creed Unity, I was done  since 2007 Id played 7 Assassins Creed games, putting, at a conservative estimate, more than 250 hours of my life into the series Assassins Creed Syndicate was hopefully the last of the annual AC games, and despite being a better game, generally speaking, compared to Unity, but frankly, at this point I just couldnt be fked. But now its 2 years later, and after a solid break from the exhausting openworld formula that had homogenised so many of Ubisofts major releases, I bought Assassins Creed Syndicate to see just how much of a returntoform it really was, and whether it had managed to break free of the worst of the series tropes.Assassins Creed Syndicate puts you in the VictorianEnglish boots of Jacob and Evie Frye  twin siblings, and children of a former Assassin. They venture to London in order to continue their fathers legacy through divergent means  Jacob wants to cleanse London of Templar control by liquidating its highranking members, and Evie believes that its more important they find the Pieces of Eden that the Templars are using to further their power.19th century London is gorgeously realised  I dont think Ive seen an AC game with so much detail that is also so welloptimised. I live in London, and its incredible to walk around the streets and see them as they might have existed 150 years ago, and see the detail thats gone into familiar sights like Westminster, Waterloo Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. I even found the place where I work  its a theatre in the converted undercroft of a church  and loandbehold, a church lies atop the site ingame.Syndicate unfortunately perpetuates the directionless backseating of the story following the wrap up of the Desmond storyline in Revelations Jacob and Evie are enigmatic personalities, but their story doesnt offer much by the way of motivation to progress. Perhaps I was spoiled seeing Ezios transformation over three games from a rakish punk to a wise Master Assassin, but it seems that most of what the Fryes have going for them is their charm. Their attributes differ slightly as well  Jake is a slightly better fighter, and Evie a slightly stealthier assassin  although their similar enough to be capable no matter the person you choose to play as.You can switch between characters smoothly and at will most of the time, and while the overall experience doesnt change much, it does help to freshen things up a bit to run through a few missions as a different character and experience the game with a different flavour of personality.Additions to the series include a grappling hook that allows quick scaling of buildings and easy travel between rooftops, an extension of Unitys climb up/down mechanic that now allows you to easily descend from heights without worrying about plummeting to your death, and the ability to drive horsedrawn carts GTAstyle down Londons cobbled roads.Other than minor changes, though,  ACS doesnt offer much new to the series stalwarts among us, adhering strictly to Ubisofts policy of iteration, not innovation, and its in these small changes that we see that Syndicate is often typified by imperfection.For example, the parkour system that put AC on the map used to take two buttons  you hit run and climb and you could scale anything and leap from anywhere. Now, you are required to specify whether you want to climb up or down. This should be helpful, and on its own this wouldnt be such a problem, except that there is little consistency in how it executes in the game. Most small obstacles can be scaled by simply hitting runexcept for the random ones that cant. You can hit climb up, only to find yourself stuck at the top when it wont let you jump down. You can hit climb down, only to find that it doesnt work on anything over 3ft high. So what used to be a fluid process now requires constant input adjustment, troubled by the fact that you can never be entirely sure if what youre pressing is going to allow the action it should. Even worse is the fact that you simply cannot jump from a building if the game deduces that you will get hurt  selfdetermination be damned, youre flatout denied the ability to leave the top of a building by any means other than scaling it or leaping into a haystack. The developers have endeavoured to stop the player leaping blind to their death, and have unfortunately stopped the player leaping at all.This is perhaps the most annoying sideeffect of the changes, although I also found the target tracker to be very touchy  performing multiple takedowns almost entirely boils down to whether the game decides that it wants to let you do it, and while double assassinations used to be easy to execute as long as the enemies were within a few feet of one another, it now seems that you need to approach from a very specific angle regardless of how close the enemies are to one another, and even a change of a few degrees will sour your plans and alert the one enemy you failed to attack.The physics system can be quite janky, and corpses flop and bend in strange and unnatural ways. I also had a number of fatal, unexplained crashes that brought me back to the desktop  an annoying occurrence given that UPlay is so slow that both shutdown and startup can take minutes at a time.Syndicate is not the saviour of the series, is what Im saying...but that doesnt make it a bad game. I have a tendency to rant about annoyances while glossing over major boons, and aside from the stunning presentation of the city, there is some sense of levity added to the formula in the numerous entertaining moneyearning activities. These particularly come into their own after meeting and completing the first mission of the character of Ned Wynert  you can rob trains, hijack carts of enemy provisions, defend your own carts that tour the city, and rob or sabotage enemy ships that sail down the Thames.On top of that, each borough of London lies in the hands of the enemy gang. Their hold can be loosened by performing a number of missions such as Templar assassinations, freeing child labourers, and kidnapping gang leaders and delivering them to the constabulary. For each of these actions completed, a section of the borough comes under your control, and is populated with your gang members. They didnt make the same mistake as Far Cry 3 and 4 and turn your territories into a ghost town upon liberation, and enemies still appear with a reduced frequency, but now you will have more help at hand should you stumble across an interloper within your territory.However, while not anywhere near as fraught as Unity, Syndicate retains the signs that the formula is simply exhausted and stagnant, and while I can enjoy the virtual tourism in any way shape or form, theres something irrepressibly tedious about having to go through the motions of another Assassins Creed game. Syndicate is a more enjoyable experience than ACIII, and certainly an improvement on Unity, but for those looking for the quintessential AC experience, youll likely find it elsewhere.
