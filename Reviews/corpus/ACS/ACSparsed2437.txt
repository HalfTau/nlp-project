Wow Ubisoft did a really great job after the mess they did with Unity. The graphics in this game are way better and the game runs so much smoother than Unity. That is a lot to say since Im running on the exact same hardware I ran Unity when it came out.The scenery is impressive and the level of details everywhere is astonishing. I really love the idea of being able to play both as Evye and Jacob.Although Ive only played about an hour, so far Im really impressed and Im looking forward to spend tons of hours on the game.
