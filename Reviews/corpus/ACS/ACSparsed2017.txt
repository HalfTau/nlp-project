Not worth 60, but when it is on sale I would buy this.This is a fun game that Ive sunk a lot of time. It becomes very repetive towards the middle/end of the game as you are just running around trying to clear areas and follow brightly colored points on your map and seek treasure though. The combat is very simple and very easy. I completely agree with the negative reviews that mention this, but it is fun. Something easy that Ive quite enjoyed.
