just like unity. there is a lot to do and explore, but we do not do anything outside the animus. we see almost nothing of what is happening in the present.the batgrappling hook is a great addition that I hope does not banish forever like the bombs in assassins creed revelations.the only interesting thing you can do is collecting the glitches to unlock abstergo files.this is not a bad game, just not a good assassins creed game.
