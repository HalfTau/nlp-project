This is personly my favorite Assassins creed game.The game has a good story where you play as twins Jacob and Evie Frye in the Industrial Revolution in 1800s London.The customization and weapon system works very good compare to the older Assassins creed games. The game has three differnt types of weapons, brass knuckles which only make enemies unconsious and its also Jacobs Favorite weapon. The second weapon is a staff this weapon is similar to the brass knuckles in which they also make enemies unconsious this weapon is Evies favorite. The third and final is the Kukri which is a big Knife this is my personal favorite since it actually kills people. The side missions consist off helping iconic characters such as Alexander Graham Bell, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Florence Nightingale and Queen Victoria. In some side missions you help a police officer arrest or kill criminals. There is also a gang features were your gang called The Rooks can be called and help you fight. You can also upgrade your gang to carry more weapons, ride faster carriges and so that you earn more from your businesses.This game is Fantasic and I would recommend it to people who like fast combat games, history, open world games and story games.
