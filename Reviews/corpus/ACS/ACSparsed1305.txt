Clunky and does not feel like a traditional assassins creed title. Assassins Creed 2 and Black Flag are the cream of the crop for this franchise and I hope they get back to the roots of what makes this franchise what it is with whatever comes next. Story is not Linear enough for me, Im not sure what is a side mission and what should be the next story mission in this title. Would not recommend.
