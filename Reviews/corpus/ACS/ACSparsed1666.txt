Despite being worried I wasted my money on another Assassins Creed game after I said Rogue was where the series ended for me Im so glad I was wrong. Probably one of the better titles in the series. Theres so muc thats good about this game and with the news that Ubi isnt doing annual AC games anymore Im hoping the series can recover some of its respect.ProsGood Port Even for AMDGrapple Hook is an amazing toolStoryCharactersThe City of London is never dull.ConsRandom CrashesObnoxious British AccentsNot alot of Fast Travel Locations Sometimes driving carriages or running or jumping across the rooftops can get rather annoyingWould I recommend this? Absolutely. This is a good apology from Ubisoft after the nightmare that was Unity. shivers
