Carriage theft simulator.Communism rally simulator.Zipline simulator.This game started out to be really really boring and it took me months to convince myself to finish it. After I got back to it and was frustrated with the need of notoriety in order to progress which caused me to do all the tedium right off the bat, which took hours and made me want to kill myself, it started to pick up and was interesting when the main story finished.Then they tried to include some extraneous activities after the main story was over and they were really mundane. Once you finish killing Starrick, just stop, its not really worth finishing Queen Victorias or the World War I missions.6/10
