HI, I think this is actually the longest review Im writing.After Assassins Creed Unity, who most people think it was a fiasco, even if I dont. Anyway, enough about Unity. Assassins Creed Syndicate is an amazing game.First, the story. The story is pretty good, the Frye twins travel to London, where Jacob wants to end the Templar reign, while Evie wants to find the Shroud of Eden, a piece of cloth that is rumoured to heal any wounds How awsome is that!Also, during the story, you will encounter many allies like Fredderick Abberline, a sergeant in the police, Henry Green, an Indian Assassin, and ClaraODea, the leader of the free kids.Very awsome are the side quests, from capturing some wanted criminals for Abberline to clearing gang strongholds for Green, I assure you that you will never get bored!
