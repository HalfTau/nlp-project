Only played  little over an hour. First 3 times i tried to play, the game crashed, had to run Uplaywhy is Uplay still a thing? and Steam in administrator mode for it to work so far. Game runs fairly smoothly except for characters clothes, it seems that the clothes of the characters are stuck on 30 fps or lower, so when you run around its like youre being dragged back almost. Hope therell be a fix for this soon.But the Jacob and Evie seems like interesting characters, when I decide to play on I hope that the twins wont disappoint.If this is anything NOT like Unity itll be worth the playthrough.Too flashy, unresponsive controls and wild jumps and leaps when free running Also double assassination is back! So 1 for that!If this game doesnt seem interesting to you, no shame in skipping it and waiting for the next one.
