I have this on PS4 and PC... The PC is in my opinion the way to play this game. I stoped playing on PS4 because of the constant FPS drops, laggy, slowness, just doesnt feel smooth at all. Playing on my GTX980 is a complete different experience. Silky smooth makes this game an amazing and actually enjoyable experience.
