I think SYDICATE did a bignono...They removed the coopration mode, that made me feel so sad. But I still need to recommend this game. ACs series always give suprise when they came out a new one. SYNDICATE added a new move that was so convinient. The ACs move style is really cool, like climb or something like that but after the gamers were good at that, they hope AC can give them little surprise, and AC did. SYNDICATE hit them with that.
