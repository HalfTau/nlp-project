This isnt the game of the century. Its fun in its own way and is challenging in some mission and for once you actually have to be creative and use your own brain. However the story is lacking and the dialogue is not that impressive even though the idea of a tiwn assasins is simply brilliant. I would recommend buying this game while its on sale. However I have to mention the graphics, which is just stunning. My labtop isnt a exaclty a beast and still the game looked amazing. I would imagine the game would look very good on a high end PC.
