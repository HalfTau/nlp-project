This game is not what you want it to be. If youre looking into it because it looks like something new and fresh its not. To start off I want to say that I have a maxed out pc and the game looks worse than the screenshots ive seen. Plus its not too optimized which is confusing because a lot of people are saying that its okay enough which in fact this is not the case. The first five SECONDS of my game I experienced a bug and i felt like I had to be careful because the game seems so fragile and it takes away from everything good that this game has at the very least. On the other hand its all around boring. Repetitive missions and side quests, and the game makes me not feel for the characters. If you are starting to get into AC, I reccommend getting black flag. Save your money.
