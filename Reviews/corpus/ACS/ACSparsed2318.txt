Assassins creed syndicate....The combat system is a nice change though i have had issues with it. Movement is quite smooth but again ive had my issues. i would be nice to say i havent had any gameplay related bugs such as being unable to interact with certin npcs on missions..now this is a bug i have encounterd about 3 times so far.. the work around id to restart the memory though this has not worked 100 of the time. in one mission in particlar i was unable to get the master key from the nurse.. all that aside its a fun game with only minor letdowns at the moment.
