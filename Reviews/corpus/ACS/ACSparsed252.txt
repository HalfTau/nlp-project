A wise man once said Never ascribe to malice that which can be equally explained by incompetence. But does this maxim hold true when talking about Ubisoft putting a virtual Karl Marx in their game and making him say dumblike The only way to socialism is through democracy. Are they just stupid dumbwho have never even read Mark? OR are they really Marxists whitewashing the words or their lord and master... Disgusting perversion of history, cannot recommend.
