By far the best Assassins Creed in a long time, possibly one of the best if not best in general.The main characters are likeable, the gameplay is a better, more refined version of what it used to be.The new sneaking mechanics and melee system are both more fluid and fun.London looks incredible, as does fighting on a moving train or carriage. The new driving system is pretty decent as well.And it actually runs well and isnt a buggy mess.
