Picked it up ona  sale and had low expectations but so far its been one of the better assassins creed so far. so the reason for the negative recommendation is cause it often crashes at the start or end of missions, especialy ones with cutscenes and given how many diffrent crash fixes i found online i think its quite a common problem.
