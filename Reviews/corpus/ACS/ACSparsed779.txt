So, we all know that after Black Flag the series went kinda down. I didnt really want to try another AC game but i grabbed it on a sale for just 20. I must say, ubisoft redeemed theirselves with Syndicate. I would have even paid the full price, if i knew what a fantastic game it was. They did a really good job with the Freerunning thing and bugs are basically non existant, so dont listen to ppl that just complain about issues and bugs. You get plenty of different skills and new game mechanics. You can also switch between 2 characters all the time Evie and Jacob, which lets you play 2 different styles stealth and aggressive. There is also a good equipment system with a few different factors to make you stronger.To end this review i must say its a great AC game and competes with the older titles, grab it if you feel like playing AC again.
