Syndicates combat is much smoother and faster than Unity.With equal video settings, Unity probably looks slightly better, but Syndicate still looks fantastic.Multiplayer has been removed. The ability to switch between two main characters is a nice addition. You can play either Jacob or Evie for most of the time. The story missions will force you to be one of them, but its ultimately your choice for everything else. There are a lot of side activities, side missions, chests, collectables, and community events.Jacob and Evie share weapons and have similar skills, but they spend skill points independently and each character gains a skill point whenever you gain one point, meaning you can have two completely different strengths. However, most of the skills will be acquired by each character near the end of the game.There are outfits with unique bonuses for each character, gang skills that provide benefits for you and your gang, and crafting upgrades to increase the effectiveness of secondary items.Ambient noise occupies your speakers for a large part of the time as you traverse the rooftops, but missions and activities keep the music flowing.The distances between buildings and their sheer size have introduced a new method of travel, the grappling hook.I only have one negative note for this game, more music during lengthy explorations.
