Feels blank, frankly speaking. Repetitive tasks. Story does not really make you feel like you should care. Pretty shallow characters, hard to believe in their motivations. By the end of the game I was forcing myself to not uninstall before completing. And the final punch in the face the Queens missions after the main plot ends? Those should not be ever included in the game, they are too simple and too boring.Not to mention frequent crashes in random moments. But this is my experience, might be specific to my machine.On the positive side, good graphics and a lot of historical or made up knowledge that you can find. But it feels like thats not nearly enough for the AC series title. I can only hope that AC Origins will be better.Still, thanks to the game developers team for being able to create the game they have. I realize it might be hard to keep up the standards AC series has set in the past.Cheers!
