7/10Well, it could be better, but i get it. Assassins creed should be about assassins, not pirates D I know, you have to add new crafting etc but it kinda is just game where you need to play it for a long time  to get some outfits, weapons etc but sadly you dont have to if you pay.. But the story is good, havent found any big bugs or glitches and i like the city great work btw.I would still recommend you rather playing AC4 before this but whatever, depends on what game engine youll get used to.
