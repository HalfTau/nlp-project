SPOILERS ARE HIDDEN! Great setting, London really feels alive and looks realistic Two main characters, and both of them have their own skillset Evies skills are stealth based, while Jacob specializes in combat. Both characters are also interesting and dialogue between them is great! Story left me wanting for more, and in a good way! Hopefully this is not the last time well hear of Jacob and Evie Frye. Plenty of things to do and historical people to meet. Ive so far played through the main story, but I still have many side quests and liberation missions to do. Talking about the liberation missions, they are not the same thing all over again. They differ from capturing a criminal to setting child workers free and killing the factorys headman Fighting animations and assassinations look briliant Whenever you need to eliminate your next main target, youll get a chance to perform an unique kill on them. Dont waste these chances, they are awesome. While Ubisoft has otherways done surprisingly good job with optimization, game stutters a lot when youre driving a carriage. In my case, it freezes for about 13 seconds every now and then and works fine other than that. Not game breaking though, since the main idea of the game is not cruising around with a carriage. I have i7  GeForce 970  8gm ram so I do not know how this problem is present on different rigs At times, free running feels clumsy. Often times I found myself climbing a wall I didnt want to climb etc. Unity had done better job in free running tbh.I have played every Assassins Creed game, except for Revelations and Rogue, and this one might even be my new favorite. I highly recommend this brilliant product.
