This game is definitely optimized better than Unity was. Ive got a GTX 970 and after tweaking the settings a bit, Im running 1920x1080 at 100 Hz with no noticeable problems. I bumped it down to 60 Hz after messing around for a little bit so I could connect to my tv and its running smooth as silk.Ill write more later after Ive gotten to play it for a few hours.
