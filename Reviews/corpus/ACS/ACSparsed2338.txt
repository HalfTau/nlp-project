ProsBeing able to have your own gang and give them upgradesNew tech like trains and revolversCarriges are a fun way to get aroundOpen world is very interestingIt runs better than UnityThe story and ending is good.You can switch charactersinteresting side activitesDoes not have full blown naval combat, but you can raid cargo shipsConsThe two main character are twin brother and sister, I pefer the lover realtionship in Unity opposed to the sibiling realtionship in this game.A level system were each enemy and your self has a skill level from 110. The annoying thing is there could be a level one enemy and a level ten enemy with the same equipment, but the level ten enemy is much better because of a number. You could shoot a level ten enemy in the head with a level one pistol and they would only lose a quarter of their health.d.Overall, I would give this game a 9/10.
