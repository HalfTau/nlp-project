I Find this Game Very Interesting,with the Old Steam Engines and I have a Connection with them,of Course..My Late Uncle was the Engine Driver on a Fletcher 240 No 910,which is in the NRM in York..He Drove it on the East Coast Main Line from 1875 to 1925,when they were Taken Out of Service and Scrapped..I Noticed that the Large Woman in the Train Hideout has a Similar Surname to my Late Uncle Bean..As Far as the Game is Concerned,I am Enjoying it and Being an Assassins Creed Fan I Bought it through Steam,as I have with the Previous AC Games..It was at a Reasonable Price..The Only Part I dont Like is the Character Jacob Frye,who Seems to be a Complete Idiot and Seems to Sulk a Lot,if He isnt Getting His Own Way,so I Use Evie Most of the Time,until Certain Quests ? Require Him,then I Change Back a.s.a.p..I would Recommend this Game to AC Fans..Plus the Graphics are Superb with a GTX 980 Ti,but I do Notice that the Frame Rate FPS Varies Quite a Lot,sometimes it is at 172fps,then Shoots Down to approx 59 fps and Lower....
