This is probably the best of the AC games. Some will love it, some will hate it.Personally I liked it for a couple of reasons.The main characters nudge you towards stealthy play or more brutal play. Their roles in the story are reflected as such. I always used to wonder if I just spoiled previous games in the series for myself as once you were adept at the combat you could just ignore most of the sneaking around and just butcher everyone you come across.But Ive found myself playing more and more as Evie, sneaking around, enjoying it.The skills are effective and the perks are an added bonus.The combat mechanics are a little simplistic, counter strikes are ridiculously easy to do. And throwing knife head shots are so OP.The story moves at a pace and there are plenty of side missions to complete.Overall Id say this is the best AC, even since ACII which until then was probably my favouriteI also really enjoyed the WWI sub section which I felt would have made an amazing AC game in its own right if it were expanded. I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed this bit.Currently tucking into Jack the Ripper DLC, which so far looks interesting.Its a decent return to form for these games and Im looking forward to see which era they do next.
