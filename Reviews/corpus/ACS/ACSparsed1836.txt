11/10 FANTASTIC ! ! !Ive played all of the Assassins Creed games and only Black Flag feels beter than this one!I thought that era is already too modern for a AC game, but Ubisoft really managed to pull it off!PROs Fantastic, likeable and interesting main characters! Very cool humour, sarcasm and overall relaxed feeling throughout the whole game  nice change for a AC game! Combat feels better than in any AC game so far! Fast and with incredible animations Great new items, outfits etc., cool craftings and skills system, upgrading your gang... its all fun to do and rewarding! London is huge and looks great! Side activities are incredibly fun to do Syndicate is a lot longer than Unity  50h and I still havent finished everything! Unity took me 30 to finish up! Main story is very cool and I also like the ending  ignore people who complain about it, its a great setup for future AC games! Great voice acting, great cutscenes too! Amazing World War I scenario if next AC game would be in that era, Im happy to check it out!CONs Buggy. Small glitches now and then. Games crashed pretty often on my PC even though it never happened with Unity! Slows down a lot while using carriages. I guess those things will be patched up soon enough! Nothing else!
