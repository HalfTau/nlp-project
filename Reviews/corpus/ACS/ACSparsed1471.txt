After logging over 40 hours on Assassins Creed Syndicate I feel that I can finally write a worthy review. ACS is the story of a brother and sister assassin couple who you get to switch between to play the story, which is an interesting way to play a storyline and, personally, I liked it a lot. This is the second AC series game that Ive playedthe first being Black Flag and although I may not be the most diehard fan like some others, I can definately see how the AC series has a certain feel and groove to it, and ACS most certainly fits that groove in new and interesting ways. Youre able to hijack trains, carriages, free children from factories, and steal cargo from ships which are all great additions to the gameplay of AC. The map itself is absolutely beautiful, the details are all perfect and it really feels like being in victorian London. At times, I felt that the main story was not very interesting and fell into a dull pattern of assassinating characters and I felt that Ubisoft couldve made the storyline much more fascinating, and conquering boroughs is incredibly repetitive and takes so much time. Eventhough the main story is a bit dull, I felt that the side missions made up for it  meeting historical characters like Alexander Grambell, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin and fulfilling missions for them was very fun. Even if the main story was dull, the assassination missions themselves were extremely fun, because you are able to pick your path to assassination of the caracter instead of having it already layed out for you. All in all, ACS is a worthy addition to the AC franchise and is definately worth the money for a fun game to play especially if you get it for cheap on a steam sale. The AC franchise is on the right track with this game, and with only a few changes, I feel the next game will be greatly improved.
