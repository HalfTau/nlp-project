While I was playing, i decided to switch characters. After the loading screen, I found myslf on a rooftop with a grapple gun. Mind you, I decided to finish side missions before doing the story so I didnt even know there was a grapple gun. Suddenly, the days I spent trying to liberate london i was almost done with westminster were gone. I found myself with 13 sync and unable to even play any missions, they just didnt appear on the map. Also, the memories I had completed were locked too. Thanks Ubisoft. I dont even want a reimboursement, just go fun yourselves.
