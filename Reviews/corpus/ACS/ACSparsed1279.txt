I am a big fan of the Assassins Creed series. I have enjoyed this game so far but I cant really get into it like I did the previous episodes. Ive restarted at least three times but cant quite get hooked. That said, the controls are fantastic and the combat is amazing. I recommend this for fans ofCreed, and players that just like shanking people.
