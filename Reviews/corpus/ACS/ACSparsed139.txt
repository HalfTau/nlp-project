This is an amazing entry in the AC franchise. As there is the autumn sale now, you should definiately get it! Here are my pros and consProsAmazing graphics, this time without the bugs and glitches of UnityVictorian London imo the best setting everVery good main missionsTwo assassins, Jacob is a good character and Evie is fantastic!The best DLC for any AC game Jack the RipperThe rope launcher is very fun and you feel badass with itAmazing sidequestlines, Dickens and Darwin are my favourites, but the others like Marx are good too. The last Maharaja was OK Well worth the money if its around or below 20 EURCons the story is very forgetable and the storytelling is somewhat grey I personally couldnt care less about the gang aspect of it, you might enjoy it tho, but being an AC game you wanna handle yourself alone if you are like me The borough activities are a bit boring after a while no modernday gameplay, and the modernday story is almost nonexistentAll together, it is a very good AC game, and an excellent game in general. If you liked Unity, you will love this one! If you didnt like Unity, this is the game to get your hopes back up!
