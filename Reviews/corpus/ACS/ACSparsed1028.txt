Assassins Creed has always been a game series on every gamers mind, with this installation by Ubisoft, the detail into every part of the game is both notable and exiting. I think the best part of Assassins Creed Syndicate is that it uses the historic period of Londons industrial revolution and allows the player to get a taste of what life was like for people in that period. Likewise the storyline is not predictable, it manages to incorporate the values of any AC game but at the same time provide a refreshing twist to the tales of the AC series. What I disliked about this soontobeclassic game is just the similarities such as the hay bales dives and hard to access menu screen, which is understandable as the creators would still want the game to fit in and match up with the rest of the AC series. Would I recommend this game to someone? Yes I would, if you are on the edge, I would say it is a worthwhile purchase. Will I ever compete this game to 100? Probably someday, well have to see. Haha. All the best, Mikethinksthat AKA Thatmichaelone
