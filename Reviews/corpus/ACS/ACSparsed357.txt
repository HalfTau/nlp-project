After Replaying the whole series and ones like these which I got burned out too fast to actually buy in the first place in hype for Origins, I have to say, this is one of the better games in the latter half of the series. Gameplay wise it is fun, and not just stand and counter. Sure its nothing crazy technical, and the kill animations get pretty old, but overall much more engaging. Character wise, I really liked them a lot. I thought it brought something a little different than your usual broody or suave assassin stereotype. If you hated Unity with good reason this has some potential to give you a little more hope. especially the fact that there is actually a modern day storyline, albeit not much. But still far more than previous entries, looking at you Unity. If you already hate the series, dont buy it, its not going to change your mind.
