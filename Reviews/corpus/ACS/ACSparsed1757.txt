Pros Grapple Gun.  Likable Main Characters.  Were getting closer to the modern day AC game that everyone wants.  Grapple Gun.  Free Running changes take getting used to but I think its an improvement overall.  Solid changes to combat.  Very responsive, sometimes even Visceral.  Good work on London.  Oh and also, the Grapple Gun is very good.Cons Runs like absolute horseon a machine that got a solid 60 fps with MGSV.  Running on rooftops at 10 fps makes me nauseous.  Maybe too many cameos?  Could have done without character levels Skill points are fine, getting mywhooped by level 9 thugs just feels arbitrary.Weird Civilians are oddly unresponsive when you choke out a policeman right in front of them.Anyhow, cannot recommend it on PC without serious optimization improvements.Maybe get it for Console.
