An outstanding game. One of the best AC games, alongside AC 2 and Black Flag.Conquering the boroughs was a bit repetitive, but switching between Jacob and Evie gives a range of options to eliminate your targets. This variety spices up the conquest activities, something that wasnt there in earlier AC games.The main quest is extremely interesting, and more than that is the interaction of the Assassins with historical figures, like Alexander Graham Bell, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin and Charles Dickens. It gives a live insight into the character and charisma of these people.The Darwin and Dickens DLC seemed unnecessary, and was a piece of forced comedy, irrelevant to the Assassins, Templars, Charles Darwin or Charles Dickens.The Last Maharaja DLC is quite action packed, but 10 long missions are topped with a very faint and unemotional finale.Jack the Ripper  now theres a piece of work. This one is more of an Expansion Pack than just a DLC. The atmosphere of Jack the Ripper is so much more tense than the Main game, it gives a real sense of what Londoners mustve been going through in August 1888. The uncertainty, mysteriousness and fear in the game is not as in horror games, but just enough for the standard AC player to feel a slight chill up his spine. The main campaign being as good as it is, this Expansion still beats it hands down.Piece of advice  If you can, play the World War 1 missions in the main game after finishing Jack the Ripper. Some lore in WW1 missions is a spoiler for the DLC campaign.
