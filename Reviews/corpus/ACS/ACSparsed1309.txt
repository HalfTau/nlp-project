this game officially is the best assass creed gamejust, it feels so nice to move, it looks amazing, the combat is so much better, they now have an actual sneaky sneak mode, you can whistle at any time, the main characters are a ultra rare find in assass creed games they dont suck is the rare part, the combat is just awesome, free running isnt asand you actually are running instead of the pathetic jog arno and shay did, you can mark enemies in eagle mode, the detection is much better and easier to keep track of, fancy london stuff, your character doesnt try to climb everything within three meters, AND IT IS SET IN INDUSTRIAL STEAMPUNK LONDONand all the characters are real people, not real as in did exist but I mean, all of your assassination targets arent portrayed as hitler and the enemies are just regular dudes doing their job, scared of their boss, this is one of the few games EVER where I have been listening to enemies and havent heard anyone talk about how much they love hitting children or killing jews, dues ex was the only other games where they had half decent enemy personalitites and in this game the bad guys actually care for other people or about animals or are just doing stuff for fear, I mean the biggest bad guy is essentially a more evil person than hitler ever was but there has to be at least one actually bad guy or the game wouldnt make senseTLDR everything about this game is head and shoulders above every other assass game and I highly recommend it
