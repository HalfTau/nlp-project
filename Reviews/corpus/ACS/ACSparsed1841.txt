I was sceptical at first, didnt expect much after Assassins Creed Unity, but i was glad to be mistaken. This is probably one of the best AC games to date. It drew me in mission by mission and I didnt even notice how i ended up spending all of my time trying to conquer London.The game is incredibly beautiful and has fun gameplay, what else can you possibly want!?
