I very much liked it. Not quite sure if I loved it, but I definitely really liked it.The main story leaves something to be desired. Its decent, which is something, but pretty much boils down to a person needs to be assassinated b Jacob assassinates person c Evie looks for piece of Eden. It was fine overall, but not particularly memorable. That being said, the London Stories missions where Jacob or Evie helps someone historical were generally pretty cool/fun.Jacob and Evie are both great, wellwritten characters. I feel like marketing did a pretty bad job in portraying Jacob as the protagonist moreso than Evie in truth theyre given separate storylines that come together at the end and they are both in their own right the main character. I enjoyed playing in the open world as both of them, although I probably spent more time as Evie due to her more stealthy approach.Gameplay is pretty good freerunning seems to work better than previous games, and you can zipline now! Makes getting up tall things way easier.All in all, I definitely enjoyed this and look forward to DLC.
