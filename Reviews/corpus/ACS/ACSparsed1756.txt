One of the better games in the series, somewhat overshadowed in a strong year for video game releases. The game sidelined the main quest in favor of a ridiculous amount of Ubi outpost/tower challenges, which made it quite similar to Assassins Creed Brotherhood. I was surprised how demanding some of these challenges were, especially if you aimed for the optional mission objectives. The traversal was improved compared with last years Unity, and the charismatic pair of main characters were also a clear improvement compared with the pale main character in that game.
