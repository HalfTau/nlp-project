I dont know what all the negative reviews are about, Ive been running the game absoultely fine on high settings, 1080p  60 FPS with no frame drops. This game looks beautiful and aside from some control issues with climbing, tackling, etc, its a very great addition to the series.PC Specs in case some people are skepticali5 4690k  4.4ghzGTX 97016 GB RAM120 GB SSD  1 TB HDD
