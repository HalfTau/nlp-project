Every year, the Assassins Creed series struggles with the idea of inheritance. Like its Templars and Assassins, who are locked in a neverending struggle for relics, each game picks a side in the question of how strongly should it lean into its nowconvoluted ancient lore and incorporate the stillunderdeveloped presentday elements. Assassins Creed Syndicate chooses wisely, leaves out multiplayer entirely, and pushes a lot of that baggage into the background, largely freeing itself up to make the most of Victorian London and have fun with sneaking, climbing, and stabbing.
