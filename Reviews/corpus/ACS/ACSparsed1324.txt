I dont understand why this game would get so much hate. There is a great stories with good game machanics and combat. I do suffer from the frame drops here and there but for the most part it runs like a dream. I really enjoy all the hostoric figures incorparated into the game, such as charles dickens and alexander granbell. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a fun single player game that really pull them into the story
