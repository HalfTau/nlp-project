I enjoy this game, but I had to stop playing it after the first few sequences...I have a freshly built PC  by my own hands, as a  computer engineer  yet I was disappointed to be continually missing out on content because of continual crashes after major events and cutscenes. Great game...just wish I could experience it all.
