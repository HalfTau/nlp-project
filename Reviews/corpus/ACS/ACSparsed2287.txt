This game is good but its utterwhen it comes to performance.Im running 4 way GTX 980 SLI an intel  i7 5960X 32GB of Corsair Domintator Platinum DDR4 2666MHz and im getting 40 frames at Ultra Setting with just AA disabled at 1440p.WHAT THE  UBISOFT IM GETTING A REFUNDSLI IS ED IN MOST GAMES.If your going to buy 2 weaker gpus than buy 1 stronger gpu JUST DONT.Save up money for the next GTX Titan X and buy 1 beast GPU dont go SLI like i did its a waste of money, it causes a lot lot more heat in your system, more noise and finally MORE MONEY.Most games out there dont benift from SLI or just stutter like hell or just arent worth spending more money on another GPU.I just really hope Just Cause 3 doesnt end up like Assassins Creed Syndicate because if it does im going to overclock the ingout of my 3 other GTX 980s turn off all the fans in my system run the GPU fan speed at the lowest and run the most hardware intensive application out there and just cook eggs on them.
