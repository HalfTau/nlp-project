Id give this a 6.5/10. i dont like the fact that you only have three main weapons you can use. Past ones there was multitude of weapons and Id wish they would make a weapons pack that had every weapon possible and have a disclaimer that said these weapons were used in different time periods so noone is confused. Had about six glitches and one crash for the entire gameDLC which is pretty fair for the size of the game. Most of my deaths was caused by climbing difficulty about 13 times. This tittle didnt go far into the story of the ones before.
