I played this at the same time as fallout 4 and just found it to be really linear and boring, I mean I really did get bored of the game play quicker than I have before. Sure it looks nice but, I dont know, I just didnt enjoy it as much as Black Flag, which was actually a pirate game, Im not even going to mention unity and I still think AC2  Brotherhood are the best in the series and Im not sure Ubisoft know how to get back there. Shame really.
