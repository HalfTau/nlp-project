Such a fun and interesting journey,Story missions are the best of assassin creeds games so far, The fact that there are 2 characters is amazing wouldve been nice if it was like GTA Vs characters switching but its still pretty amazing.The map is pretty small, only 1 country/city/place, comparing to other assassins creed games like IV Black Flag, or Rogue, but its fine since the whole game is about the city of London.the attacking is pretty challenging at first, it becomes easy at later stages of the game when leveled up, its much challenging than the other assassins creed games, but in the same time much preferred.The only thing that changed in parkour/freerun was the addition of the climb up/climb down method which was used in Unity aswell, which was a nice touch, however some complications might happen when trying to jump from a ledge into a ledge behind. the character doesnt jump easily.I never enjoyed playing an assassin creeds side missions like in Syndicate, most of the characters you run into in the game has cool stories in their side missions, and the weapons and tools they unlock are the best in the game.In all I really enjoyed playing this flavor of the assassin creeds series, its different than the others in many ways, but not to the worse its new in a good and an amazing way.Worth every penny you spend on it.PS Helix points are not worth the money you spend on em, dont buy em.
