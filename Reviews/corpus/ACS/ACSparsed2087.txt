I would like to say that Unity started a revolution in graphic engine, however, the temporal detail techniques  failed to bear the weight of such awesome graphic quality. But Syndicate perfectively fixed this problem. Very nice feeling of control and the actions are fluent. Players will enjoy the process of assassination.
