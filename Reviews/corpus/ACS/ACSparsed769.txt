Definitley a better experience than Unity, thats for sure. But does it reach the bar that Black Flag has set so high? No, not at all. But it is a gorgeous game with fun mechanics and environments to explore. The Frye twins and their story are written well enough that Im genuinely interested in whats going on in the story and what will happen to them so far. SPOILER ALERT If you play the WW1 missions featuring their granddaughter/great niece which are weird and jarring you find out that they both live to see their old age and that nothing too serious happens to them during the Syndicate story, from what I can tell. The negatives include the usual Assassins Creed tropes like unresponsive controls and frustrating tailing missions but I can deal with those now. Combat gets pretty frustrating when you try to fight enemies that are a higher level than you. Its not impossible, its just super annoying how much damage they can take. And finally that gross Helix credits t. Absolutely unnessesary and really frustrating to see in the game. Its designed to make gathering resources for crafting upgrades and new items tedious enough that some people will cave in and pay real money for Helix Credits so they can buy resource packs. Seriously dude,  that noise. But all in all its a solid entry in the series and I can say that I am now back into it. I just hope they dont kill the series with that Helix Credit nonsense.
