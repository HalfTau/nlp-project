At no point thus far, four hours into the game, have I begun to sympathize with the characters. They are lacking, and have no personality or story you can relate to. Especially important in a game like this is to understand what drives and motivates the characters, and I cant feel this at all.Sure, whatever, the concept of Assasins Creed is great, but what good is it if you just waste the same gameplay with just different cities and skins?
