I know ubisoft messed up with Unity, but this is what I call a great comeback with the AC franchise. With all the awesome historical figures you meet and do missions with them and interact with them makes Syndicate that much better. For the combat, the animations are smooth as can be and there are moments where youll cringe because of some of the executions you do. Its also very easy to get side tracked, one minute youll be going for a story mission, and then youll see a cart of cargo you could steal and get money, xp, and materials. I didnt know what I would think of the gang system until i started using it. It seems like at every corner there are members of your gang that can help you, and most of the gang upgrades are very useful even if youre just going on your own. Both the story and the two main characters are interesting and the game lets you see how close twins Jacob and Evie are with their competitive spirit and teamwork. Overall, its a great game, sure there are some slight glitches, but nothing game breaking, and the game is always running smoothe. Its fun, action packed, and theres always something to do.
