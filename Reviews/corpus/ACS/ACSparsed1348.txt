I loved this game. This is my first Assassins Creed game so I didnt have experience coming into it from previous games. The game play overall was really interesting. It was fun to pick skills and such though it was a little disappointing that by the end I had gotten all the skills for Evie and Jacob. However, the various minigames were fun diversions and especially liked the Fight Club. Other notable things were encountering some fun characters from history, HQ on a train and the immense feel of London.Where the love came was from Evie. I thought she was really well written and definately the most interesting character between the twins. I really enjoyed the interactions between the two but Evie seemed so much more interesting and fleshed out.I didnt find the controls as game breaking so a bit sluggish here and there. Not saying it was perfect but well recommended. In fact, it got me interested in the AC franchise.
