i dont like buying things mostly cuz its nearly always a dissapointment, aside from some very minor lag and even less glitches i gotta admit this game was worth the cash put into it. black flag being my last played assassins creed its certainly a level of euforia for the game series reawakened, even if you never played a/c before, you can start with this game as all the others, without feeling lost. plenty to do for both evie and jacob tho so far ive played upto sequence 3 using evie only.
