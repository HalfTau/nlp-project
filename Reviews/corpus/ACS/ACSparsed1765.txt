Just a short and simple review here.The storyline is excellent, they are able to reclaim the face of franchise.A lot of new weapon are introduced to the series , fighting style has changed as well quite challenging.Still though the game needs a significant work , graphics are somehow mixed between PC and consoleMy 290x cant get at least 55 fps , I mean what the heck is that ?????? , Ubisoft you cant just copy and paste game from different platform and expect it to be playable .In shoty lol , Story, weapon, side mission  Excellent workGraphic , Performance , Optimisation  Booooooooo
