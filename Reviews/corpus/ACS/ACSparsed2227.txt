Ive played every Assassins Creed and I have to say that this is by far their worst game. The freerunning mechanics have been made over complicated and unrealistic, and the optimization for the game is terrible. The cloak is locked to 30 FPS regardless of what you do and it does not support SLI. It may say it supports SLI but it doesnt. Only like 10 of your additional GPUs will be used, if any at all.The game is an Assassins Creed simulator, not anything like the previous epic stories of Ezio and Altar. Jacob and Evie are interesting characters but with little to offer overall. Initially youre forced to put different skills into the skill tree for each of the two characters, but eventually youll have all the skills potentially before reaching 40 of game completion except for the ones locked to each character.The NPCs in the game are a lot better, and it makes a good impression of creating a lively and vibrant world. It actually appears like every NPC is doing their own thing like normal human beings. But this doesnt compensate for the overall lack of emphasis to the story. Other characters are interesting but they die so soon and the ones that dont are the ones you dont really get to know either.
