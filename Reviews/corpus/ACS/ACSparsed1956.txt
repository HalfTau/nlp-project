Great action game. NOT a good assassin game  stealth was never a strong point in this franchise anyway The side activity are good and rewarding enough for me to play around with them. The story is......meh but the twin is an engaging pair of character. Cuztomization is stupid....along with its lame skilltree. Still, thing of this game as a Victorian/Steampunked Batman but better since you can kill!!!!The ending of this game......oh gawd....the ending is ......sooooooooooooooooooooooo cheap and stupid to play
