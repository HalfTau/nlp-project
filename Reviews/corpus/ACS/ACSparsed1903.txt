So 85 hours latter and about 98 Scync latter, still got a bit it clear up mostly chest in WW1.This game is good, their no coop or any Multi player  so the story good. What lets it down it the ammount of bugs in the game kinda like Unity but not so bad... Though I seem to just crash a lot before and at the end of misstions and while free roaming for no reason. It get really annoying I completed the game and then boom no joke it crash, I say it too happy with my amasing skills but I dont think so. It was relisted what a few months latter than out concel present friends and we still seem like we are beta testers.Though the game great, great story line, but feel it lacks on adventure of looking for Pices of Eden, the whole game you look for one bit, I mean wow... you spend lots of time setting up for the grant finish which is cool.The Devs said before we got the game as soon as the game starts we stall know what been going on in the real world. Im sorry to say it was poor, I was looking forward to this hopeing it be like ACB but it was not just cut sences, They said it hard to make the real world and yet the made them just not for the player....This game willyou off and make you smile. Either AC always been about the story, for me any way. So final verdict.Story 8/10, not as good as other but its getting back,,,Gameplay 5/10, need to be improved, needs lots of patchs to stop crashing, the rest of the game play is fine all work apart from counter kills and stunning enermy mid fight is also a pain in theas you press and nothing happens...Overall 6.5/ 10,  good story but far to many crashes their yet dont seem many patches to have fixed these issues. if your want to buy for the story go for it if not then I pass...
