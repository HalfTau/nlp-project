Yet another broken game released by Ubisoft. I am 100 sure I have the specs to run this game however, even on lowest settings, the background textures look as if you put them in a blender and turned them on. All I can see is my character trying to move though a mess of colors. UNPLAYABLE. Getting a a refund and very disappointed.
