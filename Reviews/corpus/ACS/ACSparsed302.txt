I like the theme and scene and its pretty fun for the large part.But i dont really like that it starts in uplay too, oh well only if that would be the only issue. I feel that is poorly optimised as i found it pretty annoying till i got it to show me a smooth image. With Vsinc off or using nvidias fast setting the fps were from 60 to 80 constantly and i still got jitters, not tearing but micro jitters. With full vsinc on i get a smooth experience. Then the figthing mechanic kind of sucks sometimes. I meanwhen an enemy is on the ground you cant kill him because your character cant target him, or enemies that are not affected by your smoke bombs. And plenty or other bugs like weird and suddend deaths after you finish an enemy or you slightly bump a carriage, missions not loading properly like when i had to kill a weird dressed guy scaring the people pretending he is some sort of demon, i went in to the cellar and killed his friends but he refused to show up for the party. And the mission was saying that i still have to kill his friends. Had to reload checkpoint to continue. And many more, of which the most annoying that lead me to white this is constant exe crash and long freezes in game of which some lead to the crash.I recommend it because it is a good game and maybe my issues are somewhat singular to certain specifications, like hardware or OS because i did play a cracked version some time ago on a diferent system hardware and software and didnt noticed these problems, the functional ones not the gameplay stuff.
