This game looks like SO MUCH FUN! the graphics are BEAUTIFUL! and that said... I owned the game for about 20 minutes of game time hats off to steam for their refund system. this game and Unity are the first time Ive had to use it and it was quick, efficient, and painless. You rock Valve!. My rig is leaps and bounds over what Syndicate requires, but apparently around half of windows 10 users are going to find this game UNPLAYABLE no matter how beefy their system due to severe artifacting and nearly immediate crashes. I tried everything short of dual booting as Im not going to pirate an earlier windows just for a video game to no avail.Ubisoft, I want to like you... youve put out great games... But lately between all your games being riddled with rediculous DRM, and Unity and Syndicate being essentially unfinished, youre making that very difficult. I for one will no longer be purchasing Ubisoft products until Syndicate is fixed. This experience was worse than getting socks for christmas.
