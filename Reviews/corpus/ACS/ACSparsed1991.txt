This was an enjoyable game, with no technical glitches. The city of London is gorgeous, and I found the music in this game to be really well placed in the world. However, there are two issues that stop me from wholly endorsing it.First, it is entirely too easy. The enemies are weak and stealth is incredibly easy as well. I understand perhaps that this is part of the genre. But it made the completion of objectives and missions feel cheap.Second, the game world aims to be an epic centuryspanning saga, but is internally inconsistent and regularly breaks disbelief. A common example is that enemies continue to taunt you, rather than tremble in fear, long after they pose no threat to you at all. Another is that the supposedly secret societies of the Templars and Assassins walk around with public badges. Yet another is that the Templar plots are sometimes shockingly incompetent. They rarely felt like the secret allpowerful society they were supposed to represent.In all, an enjoyable game, but with standard plot holes of an action genre focused on overpowered protagonists. So not bad, but not really excellent either.
