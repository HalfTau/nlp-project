GREAT game ......on Consoles!...... but so poorly optimized for Nvidia cards is ridiculous, 10 fps on lowest setting with 980m card, even though it was putting out 60 fps for the first couple hours of play. if your going to buy it, buy it for ps4 not pc cannot speak for all users but my problem is widely spred and shared with alot of the steam community.sucks i couldnt play one of my favorite franchises on my favorite platform another case of the pc gamer afterthought.
