The best Assassins Creed game so far in my opinion. The graphics in the game are absolutely gorgeous. Especially the lightning is very impressive. The Victorian London is highly detailed and feels authentic. If you ever visited London its easy to recognize the places. The engine ran very well on my AMD machine R290 4GB, FX9590, 16GB RAM, W10. No stuttering, no short freezes. Just prefect. The story missions didnt feel repetitive at all and having two player characters made them really interesting.
