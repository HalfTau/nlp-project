I love Assassins Creed Syndicate.Quite the controversial opinion Ive discovered, since after the Metal Gear Solid V fiasco I solemnly decided never to watch trailers, gameplay videos or otherwise engage in the community of games Im more than average exited about playing. As a result I dived into Syndicate pretty much completely blind after a much needed AC break of a little over a year. And I can assure you that it didnt disappoint.The exiting combat and increased fluidity of gameplay and movement is the main culprit here since previous installments felt like awkwardly moving through a jar of honey but this time around combat is fun, exiting and brutal and it made the core gameplay so much more fun than before that I wasnt even sick of it after 58 hours of gameplay.I found the story and setting far more interesting this time around as well, so much in fact that I was actually interested in sightseeing and reading Shauns descriptions of buildings and characters.I wont go on much more here but I will say that Im not in the camp of seemingly 99 of you who apparently hated all the things I loved.Play it. Its a good game.
