AC S is a perfect parkour game. Your movement on the roofs and stealth possibilities are really great, mainly after getting of all perks, so from this point of view I can strongly recommend. Dont look/find any rich story, even assassins story  there is nothing special. But the same like a AC BF IV was a great simulation of buccaneer/ship/pirate, AC S is a nice and a graphical superb parkour in London of 19th century. Thanks Ubisoft.
