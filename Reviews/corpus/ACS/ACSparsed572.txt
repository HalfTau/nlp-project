Potential mild spoiler!!!Less than 4 hours into the game with a reasonable amount of wandering and exploring I obtained, on a story quest, the most gamebreaking device a game of this nature could offer. A grappling hook...The game was playable up until that point with some good features. The story line was as average as Id expect from AC at this point. The characters were quite boring but just entertaining enough that I would have kept playing...Until the hookshot... That totally killed it for me and Ill have a go at getting my refund please.
