Coming from a lover of history and a supporter of the series since AC1, this game is dull as dishwater.I have played every one of the main series games/spinoffs, and have hours logged into each of them. I have even found merit in the slog that was AC3.There is nothing to reccomend in this game. Its greatest flaw is that its so stupefyingly samey, with washed out graphics and gameplay that feels more akin to Far Cry with a leveling system rather than themore direct open world freedom provided by previous titles. All of the complaints about the dullness of the combat system have come home to roost in the rotting ravenry that is this series.
