Very slick and very, very violent. Has some of the best graphical detail Ive ever seen in a game, the architecture is beautiful, the shop windows at night are amazing. There is tons going on, London feels alive. The childrens dialogue is particularly funny with some superb voice acting.Some FPS drops in the cutscenes which seems to precipitate similar drops in gameplay afterward. Can be fixed by restarting the game. Its one of those games that is so good you can forgive the problems with it.Update 7 hrs in and the FPS drops have thinned out a bit. Getting some weird flicker in the scenery in the distance. The game is one of the best contructed I have ever played with some wonderful puzzles. I really, really recommend this game.Update Changed my GPU to an R9 Fury, now the game crashes after a couple of minutes EVERY TIME.Update Fixed the crashes by using the AMD beta driver. WHY do AMD release these rubbish drivers in the first place? ?Have had to change driver to most recent now the crashes are back.
