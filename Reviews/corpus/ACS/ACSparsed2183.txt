I absolutely enjoyed the game! The story wasnt that surprising and I would have loved to learn a bit more about Crawford Starrick and his evil plans, but London was a great setting and the twins were quite charming and fun. I also had the chance to meet great characters of the time and they were lovely. It didnt feel that big as Black Flag, but I recommend Syndicate.
