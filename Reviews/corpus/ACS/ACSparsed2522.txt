intro so far has been good and explains game mechanics well,but in the intro sequence as the female character after you kill the scientist you cant die trust me, i sat around for 20 minutesSo far, i have beaten men with a cane, assassinated a scientist with a throwing knife, and pretended i cared about stealth. Time spent well.How does it run?Well, it seemingly runs fine for me. Windows 10 64 bit even with the graphics on relatively high settings.The controls are simple and easy to use on both Keyboard and mouse and on my Xbox360 controller, although slightly different.also, WHY UPLAY ACCOUNT  i get it, it even says that you need one on the page, but i still hate it. despite how used to it i amI did not expect so many people to even look at this review, but i appreciate the feedback and people telling to not be lazy
