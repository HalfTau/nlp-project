I was very skeptical purchasing another AC game after Unity was such a disapointment. After asking for my friend how he liked this, his respond was to shrug and to say at least it was better than Unity.Well I got it on sale and played it for myself. Very glad I did! I experienced the crashing problem a lot of people are complaining about, but it can be fixed by not playing in full screen. Also, if you use dualmonitors, the game might not like that.Another disapointment was the fact that I have a decent computer, and had to play on medium graphics just to get 45 frames. For a lot of people this is unacceptable, but I dont mind the graphical difference too much.PROSThe fighting system is more advanced and more challenging.London and the different boroughs are beautfiul and the layout is well thought out.Story is interesting enough to keep interest the whole way through.Gang mechanic similar to Saints Row 1 and 2. If you liked those games, youll probably like this.Fleshes out the backstory of the modern day assassins.CONSCrashing problems fixable.Taking over teritories cant get grindy.Main story is relatively short if you do no side missions.Overall 7.5/10, better than 3, not as good as 4.
