its assasins creed so you should expect the usual map cluttered with collectibles fairly big open world with better fight system than previous games at least by my opinion and double character setup is beautiful for me one brute style and other sneakygame is not very long if you are not a completionist it will take about 20 hours to finish overall its a good game if you are a fan of te series far better that AC 3 for example
