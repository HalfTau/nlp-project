With the exception of two things, this is an amazing game. The two exceptions are 1. the setting. I dont think Victorian era London suits Assassins Creed and 2. the story. Sure, it wasnt the worst thing in the world, but it wasnt nearly as good as other games like AC4. If youre a fan of the AC series, you should get this, and if not, you should watch some gameplay or something first and then decide whether you want to buy this or not. Overall, I would give this an 8/10.
