Frankly, Id like to recommend this game on a lot of levels, but one thing in particular utterly ruins the entire experience. They introduced leveling into the game. While that isnt so bad in and of itself  they made enemies that are higher level than you practically invincible badasses thatll take a hundred or more hits to kill and will also kill you in about two hits. Oh, and to make it better the levels of enemies are just randomly distributed around the city. So.. youre walking along, and totally own a group of random level 2 thugs. Walk a block over, and suddenly youre fighting the exact same thugs.. except now theyre level 9 and will utterly own you without question and without the player having any chance at all. Exactly what AC games needed  an MMO leveling scheme.
