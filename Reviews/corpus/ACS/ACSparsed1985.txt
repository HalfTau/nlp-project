A little late to the party here but figured id throw in my 2 cents anyway. I have owned every AC title up to this point and was seriously considering passing this one up. If it wasnt for Steams Holiday sale I probably would have.I really wasnt sure how much time I would like to be spending in dirty old industrial England walking around in a top hat after all of the other GRAND locations Ubisoft has given us in previous titles. I also was still feeling a bit jaded after Unity and AC 3s horrific releases. Anyway, that is in the past and it truly is with this game. While it still has elements of Unitys gameplay and controls, it adds something that has always been lacking in every AC title since the beginning of the series...No, not stealth which finally does make an appearance in an AC title. Im talking about a GOOD story and relatable characters! To be honest, it is the BEST part of the game for me. The writing is well done and the story seems much more complete. The banter between brother/sister duo is also exceptional. I found myself on more than a few occasions laughing at the interactions between the two. If we have to put ourselves in a characters shoes for many many hours, you better be sure we actually like them, and I really do! Both Evie and Jacob have their own personalties and styles and are both enjoyable to play.ProsGood Story  Characters.Costumes and weapons are well done Seriously, they look amazing!Gameplay is smooth.ConsRepetitive nonstory missions Nothing new there.Poor controls I really hate the parkour up/down worse on PC.InGame micro transactions Yuk!! !
