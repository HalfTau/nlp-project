Well, as i expected, ubisoft learned with errors from the past and made a amazing game of AC franchise. few first hours playing and i saw a different game mode, skills, graphics, and few bugs. with the time, soon will disappear. dont say you didnt see any bug like kill someone in stair and it stay inside of it or something like that but if u didnt see you will. in overall, i highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoy the AC franchise and those who are new in AC world. easy tutorials for everyone and many explanations about AC history from anothers versions in the game. First in franchise where you can play with both characters, with different skills and own personallities. About compatibilty? using a quadcore from AMD with 8 GB and just a GTX 750 i could run the game in high graphics no problems. no freezing no lags, insteald of unity i had to run in medium sometimes in certains places. this one is perfect! gratz Ubi DEVS!
