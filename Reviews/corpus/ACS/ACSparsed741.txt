I like this game, the graphic is improved. Which is nice, but if we can wake up form the Animus during the game. It will be better, just as like Assassins creed Rouge. Because I really want to see the Abstergo company, and the high technology staff, such as computer, Animus, or some kind the PC mainframe.
