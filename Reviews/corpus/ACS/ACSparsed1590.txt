This is the BEST assassins creed game that I have ever played. The main and side missions are excellent. The graphics are superior for a 2015 type of game, great soundtrack, acceptable controls, the game could have a little bit better physics, it is glitchy and a little bit buggy but not as much as some other assassins creed games, but overall outstanding gameplay. 8/10, one of the best game that I have ever played.
