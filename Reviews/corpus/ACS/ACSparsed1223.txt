Its a fun game. Not very deep but plenty of fun if you like using stealth to accomplish goals. The recreation of Victorian London is outstanding. Ive a few quibbles one of which is the seeming inability to change the difficulty level. However it seems to scale to your proximity to your target i.e. the foes get more challenging as you get closer to the goal. I also dislike not being able to manually save my progress.Running it on a gtx  970. Had one crash so far but other than that the game runs pretty smoothly and looks great. I havent tested the fps and not sure I feel the need to given how smooth it is so far. If youre running it on an integrated graphics chip or something less than a 700 series card just forget it. If youre going to try on a laptop thats not a recent gaming laptop dont waste your money. Also update your Nvidia driver and make sure you update your Uplay account i.e. uninstall it and reinstall it and that way the game will run. Have fun!
