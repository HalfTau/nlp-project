I was curious to buy this game as the reviews were decent and it looked pretty good and there was a ubisoft discount week for this game on half price so i gave it a shot.First thing i was met with after installing the game was a splashscreen icon that seemed to be loading something but after 20 minutes nothing had happened so this was obviously a bug. I looked online to figure things out and found out that at least a few people on PC had this problem. I tried to move some of the files around using the instructions from various forums, non of them solutions by ubisoft themselves. After 3 hours of messing around I gave up however I found out that after closing the window the program hadnt properly shutdown and it was running in the background giving me 8 hours in total playtime recorded to my account. I decided to completely reinstall it and if no luck I would file for a refund.I reinstalled with no luck.I filed for a refund to ubisofts support. However Im not sure they even read my ticket because all they sent back was that my playtime was over 2hours and therefore my refund was ineligible. I was getting pretty angry at this point so I decided to send another support ticket. Again half an our later I recieve pretty much a copy of what my last ticket got, even though i went into a lot more detail.Do I recommend this game?NoWhy?Because if anything goes wrong and you want your money back, expect a cold no.
