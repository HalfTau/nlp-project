 Awesome graphic, duh! Still get crash from time to time Can play either one of the 2 MCs most of the time Really, I cant think any downside of this, their VA are awesome too HQ in a moving train! HQ in a MOVING train, theres a fast travel, but still Better mechanics than previous ACs, especially combats I missed Black Flags ship, yeah, you cant control the train Lots of crafting items Feels like a pay to win, but not, but yeah, not really, but you know what I mean, Ubisoft A good amount of new system The NPCs feels more idiotic than everI cant think for anything more, its AC for christs sake, whaddya expect? Theyre starting to be a generic franchise. I say its better than Black Flag, and definitely way way better than Unity. Buy it? Definitely
