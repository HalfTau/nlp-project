Im a huge fan of a few decent AC games not everyone isthey can be repetitive, overly long, and sometimes the gameplay setup just doesnt gel with everyone. ACS is pretty much the same deal cool story, fun history you get to hang with Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Charles Dickens, etc., interesting writing, pretty graphics, and stealth assassinations. I think the highlights for me were using the grappling hook to get everywhere wheeeeee! and using gang members to do my bidding and take over gang territory bit by bit. The slight steampunk bent feels a bit outdated that trend was like 5 years ago lol but its charming.Im gonna compare this game with AC Black Flag cuz everyone seems to think thats the best one its pretty amazing. I loved Black Flag for its captivating script and story and characters. ACS cant live up to the magic of Black Flag in that regard but it tries. On the other hand, a lot of people were down over how OPd the protag in Black Flag was and how easy it was to just waltz up to a plantation and murder everyone in battle, which kinda made stealth a bit pointless and timeconsuming. Theyve changed that in ACSits a skillsbased leveling up system and youre generally pretty weak in battle.Oh, also UPlay is an awful, awful programme you need UPlay to play any Ubisoft game... legitimately. It keeps crashing at crucial points in the game and my cloud save has clearly carked it somehow. The game wouldnt even start unless I did some weird thing with my directory or something. Its a broken system and Ubisoft clearly hates PC gamers and isnt planning on fixing any of these things.
