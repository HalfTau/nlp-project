My gamer life started with the first Assassins Creed game. I played each installment up until Black Flag. In this series of games there were some aspects that I valued most of all, especialy in the first four games. From then on i felt the magic of AC had been lost. AC Syndicate became for me a fresh start for this saga, returning most of our beloved AC defining characteristics, such as immersive story and interesting characters, stealth and fight mechanincs and that feeling that you belong to the historical setting the story takes place.All in all, as a fan of the first AC games, i believe this game is a must for those wishing for the good old AC days. Its not a perfect game, but it is different in a smart and new kind of way. Id give it 4 stars, in five.
