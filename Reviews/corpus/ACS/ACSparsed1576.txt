Dont even think of buying this crap! It will cost you 19.99 GBP on sale, 8 hours for installing well, you will have to download it TWICE in different drivers since the first try wouldnt work, which makes you try to redo it for starring to a single AC logo for the whole time. Worse, Steam will start to count your playing time, even though all you were doing were looking to the AC logo.I heard that Ubisoft is quite pathetic when speaking of PC Games, now I got chance to approve that.So, if you dont want to waste your time and money, dont even think twice. Just dont buy this game.
