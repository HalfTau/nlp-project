The bugs, glich are fine and understandable. BUT the gameplay is just plain boring. The AI is stupid, you die too fast, AND there is a level system... like what? All I did was recruit and send them to do the dirty work for me and while they attack more allies came to help and kill the enemy in large groups which was really stupid and boring to watch. The map is small, Even ASC brotherhood is better.
