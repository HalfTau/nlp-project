Ive been busy working with my gang so Im going to give my early impresions.Wow the gameplay is buttery smooth! I got into AC recently starting with Black Flag and then the Ezio Trilogy and the movement is flows really well. Some vets may not like it but you use more buttons now for the free running as opposed to Black Flag/Rogue where you use only 1 button to free run. This uses 2 for the free running whether you want to go up or down so you should have more control on your movement. The story is not the greatest since its relatively safe so its not the greatest story in the world but it makes up for it with some of my favorite main chartacters in an AC since Edward Kenway and Ezio Auditore. Jacob and Evie Frye are an awesome brother and sister duo with Jacob being the less serious brother who prefers loud and proud and building up a gang and Evie being more serious with the Assassin and Templar business and prefers being stealthy and healthy. Jacob and Evie are incredibly likable and the 2 together in cutscenes I always have a chuckle with Jacobs sarcasm and not giving a crap about Templar stuff and Evie trying to be serious and get him to get it together. This is a very light hearted AC not as serious as previous titles so I like the change in direction the story takes. Not to mention. London looks beautiful in this game,  The PC Version runs really good on my PC as well, so its very well optimized. I would definitely reccommend Assassins Creed Syndicate if Unity gave you a bad taste or if you havent played an AC game in a long time.
