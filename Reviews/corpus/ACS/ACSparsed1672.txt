Assassins Creed Syndicate. Well, if you have played the previous ones and hate the controls, movement, story, yearly releases and whatnot, buy this. Once again Ubisoft proves to the world that AC is just another disaster under the publishers wings.Quick summa summarumGame is set on victorian era London and you have to play as a dimwitted duo of Assassin Legacies trust me, not assassins anymore. Gentle blend of brawling and the league of extraordinary gentlemen. The setting itself is fun and interesting, but it is not alive. The pedestrians walk aimlessly up and down the roads and after couple of hours you just start spotting the red guys who need to go. Walk close, press X, deal is done.Cons The game is graphically satisfying, but falls short on delivering it. Remember the sticky slimethings you could buy from bubblegum machines in your youth? Meet our designer of controls. Story is not immersive, it falls short and it has nothing to do with anything, the last time Ubisoft delivered something new and fresh was 2004. The story is like watching the Kardashians after DMT. You can actually purchase ingame boosters for single player game. Did I mention the controls? The ingame crafting system and upgrading yourself as you go is like playing Farmville on Facebook. You shouldnt bother, and after a few accidents you realize there really is nothing more to be done, except waiting. Overall quality of the product is not that good. No multiplayer support but still they introduced microtransactions to the game. Not that it would be good to have one Repetitive gameplay and mission mechanics, feels like doing the same thing for 15h.Pros0 Graphics are fairly good Animations are fairly good, although sloppy and laggy4.5/10, wouldnt recommend if its not on 70 sale.
