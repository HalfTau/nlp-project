Fun so far. I dont really like the free run up/down controls. Its nice sometimes but when I want to jump off a ledge or jump in a certain direction, I cant because theres no jump control at all it seems?Also PCSS Ultra and HBAO Ultra settings tank my fps to like 4 r9 290 1080p. Not sure if Nvidia has the same issue
