As far as mechanics go, its not very realistic, but boy is it fun and EASY to move around. I really enjoyed the storyline. Jacob and Evie and my two favorite assassins behind Altair. Theyre fun, they joke with each other, but theyre also badass and get things done. This game is probably one of the best AC games yet, and Im sooo excited to see another. Ive been following the series since the first game. I REALLY want to see the next games similar to this one. The graphics ARE SO AMAZING. Unfortunately my computer cant handle ultra graphics, but even on high graphics, Im blown away.
