This is one of the better Assassin games I have played in a while. Black Flag was a LOT of fun but at the same time the story really brought me down and I was not sure I was going to go and play another Assassins game again even because of.. dont get me wrong I LOVED the ship part of that game.... anyways this one is just all around better with the two types of game play with either charactor. I love it. Depending on my mood of that day I choose the charactor that fits it.
