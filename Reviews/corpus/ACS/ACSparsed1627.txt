This game is hard to decide wether or not to recommend. I personally found the game EXTREMELY tedious. Everywhere you go seems to take forever and I usually dont complain about fluff. Both Jacob and Evie were interesting enough to keep me playing all the way through, but Crawford Starric is support forgettable. I only remembered his name because I was talking about the game with my friends. I loved the gang stuff, and leveling up your companions. I wish I could get to know their store better, but thats not a thing in this game.I would wait for a sale, I didnt and I kinda regret it. 7/10
