I really wanted to enjoy this game, trust me. In fact, I did enjoy what I did play and I think that this game may be one of the best in the series. I use the word may because if it werent for the absurd amount of crashes and freezes Id seen, I wouldve played much more of it. I scoured the ACS forums and Steam discussions to find fixes for these crashes, but it was ultimately pointless. It sucks that I had to use my first Steam refund on what may be a great game, but Im not going to put up with these frequent crashes just to play it.
