I really enjoyed the game. I personally think that the game is underrestimated, because people were so butthurt after Unity came out, that they didnt really open up for this game. It has a great story, i love our heroes Jacob and Evie and the gameplay is defenitly next gen graphics. Even though i think that Unity had better graphics than this, i still prefer playing Syndicate, because the performance is much better. Defenitly recommended!
