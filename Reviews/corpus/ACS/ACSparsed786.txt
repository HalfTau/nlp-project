Despite the crap like 3 and Unity Im still a fan of 1, the Ezio Trilogy, and Black Flag. So when I heard Syndicate was good and it was 20 on the Winter Sale Id though Id give a shot.That was a mistake.Syndicate starts off strong enough with giving you a bit more freedom than past games in approaching your targets, even so much that they tailor two different characters for combat and stealth. The problem comes in that the game controls like Were this far into the series and weve had great rival games like Shadow of Mordor that control like a dream but Syndicate is just a janky mess. I had one incident where Evie just refused to drop down as enemies took potshots on me. Another example is the counter system which feels like it only works when it wants to so enemies just wreck yourand theres barely anything you can do. Theres also bugs like targets just running around in a glitched state and stuff like that just made it even more frustrating. The load times are also kinda bad.All these problems started rearing their ugly head after the first area, Whitechapel, so Imout of luck for a refund. Its a shame because there are some nice ideas here, but its just let down by Ubi not even getting down the fundamental controls right. Well at least I learned my lesson that I should have just gave up on the series after Black Flag.
