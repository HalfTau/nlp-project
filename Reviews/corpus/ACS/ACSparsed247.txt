This was the least enjoyable Assassins Creed. All of them are repetitive, but the repetitive actions in this game arent even fun. Everything is a chore  the kidnappings, the child labor rescues, even the assassinations. The controls took a big step in the wrong direction. The grappling hook had potential to smooth out the bland and boring climbs, but it is counter intuitive, the grapple option rarely comes up when youd like it to, and you have little to no control over the aim. I dont care to have a vehicle in these games, and the horse carriages are a poor attempt. The story is unbelievably boring, and the characters are even worse. I could not have cared less about the main characters, and actually disliked Jacob a lot. Having two main characters takes away from any immersion as well.
