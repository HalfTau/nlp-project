TLDR Overall Opinion  One of the best AC games in a long time and one of the best performing ones as well. Thank you ubisoft for actually listening to feedback and putting an effort into a PC Title you deserve my dollar for this one and i hope the rest of your upcoming titles have the same effort put into them.ProsThe story starts off with abstergo but so far i have played it, all the abstergothat nearly made me die of boredom in previous titles is all cutscenes that dont take long and puts you straight into Jacob and Evies shoes right afterwards. No 4 hour long origin story which takes 7 chapters just to start wearing the assassin gear.Very good textures and Lighting occassional render pop ins and low res textures however it is open world and the scale of the world makes up for it Performance is solid GTX 980  I7 4790k  8GB RAM i run it on ultra highs besides having PCSS off and using base high shadows, HBAO  and not ultra, and TXAA x2. it seems the main performance eaters are the gameworks options so i have to turn them down a little or have them completly off like PCSS because it isnt worth the fps dropSetting is amazing i really enjoy seeing London packed full of carriages, trains and people everywhere in a packed enviroment with tall buildings all close together.Even the music just fills the game with more charm and goes well with the setting Im from England so minor bias hereCharacters are so much better than in some recent AC games in my opinion with obvious weaknesses and strengths and just overall charm in cutscenesCombat feels more fast paced and more challenging than previous titles where enemies seem more agressive and can block at any time. No more counter spam and then just LMB to kill everything which got boring as hell eventuallyCustomisation feels solid with many tiers of items like belts, capes, outfits, colours, gear, firearms and weapons to change with and upgradeZipline is a great addition and saves time and hassle but also is awesome to use when you jump into a carriage or assassinate people from itConsReally jarring low fps cloth textures like on jackets or capes of your character which i hope can be fixed with a patch because it is noticableCannot change motion blur in setting, when you use the carriage or zipline there is a huge amount of motion blurYou only get 3 choices of main weapons Kukri, Cane, Knuckle Dusters. There are lots of variations but i would have liked to see maybe two handed weapons or just swords and other kinds of knifes for example To follow on from that  would have liked to have the options of rifles instead of just a pistol, enemies use them however you cannot pick them up off of dead enemiesOverall im pleased Ubisoft have paid attention to their mistakes and feedback and have changed for the better. i would say for the effort into putting out a solid port for PC and it is quite a fun, charming game on top of that it deserves a buy. I understand skeptisism because its ubisoft and i hated what they did last year but if they carry on like this i hope they earn the trust they once had back because they have proved they can make a solid title in what was a very terminal series.
