For those having trouble launching the game Make sure you update your drivers and restart your computer. The game has been known not to launch if you dont have the latest drivers installed. Was a really annoying thing, took me four hours to figure out what to do. Hope this helps!I think this game is a big step from Unity, I cant help but enjoy this game and the Frye twins.Id totally recommend this game.
