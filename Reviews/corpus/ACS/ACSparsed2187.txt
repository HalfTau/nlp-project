AC Unity dispite is massive amounts of hiccups. Was overall an enjoyable story of where I became attached to the characters inside that game. Despite my disappointment of the overall game mechanics AC Syndicate makes up those mistakes and has given me faith into another Assassin Creed game. The story is quite refreshing, but I do believe it fell rather short. Many of the sequences in the game felt anti climatic towards there position in the game and I believe that some of the characters that were introduced into the game like Miss Nightingale only came into the game about 3 or 4 times depending on your mission agenda. The voice acting on the other hand was much like assassin creed revelations. It was outstanding and I felt the need to really care about Evie and Jacob Frye. I grew attached to the twins and I do hope that the next Assassin Creed game will bring in a new Dynamic of displaying two assassins. They do not have to be twins but it would be nice to have two personalitys to play to. AC Syndicate is a breath of fresh air and am looking forward to the next Assassin Creed. I do recommend you sink in as many hours into the game as possible P
