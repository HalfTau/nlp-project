My first impressions its pretty, even if you arent on the max settings it runs smoothly and its immediately and noticeably less buggy than Unity was on launch. Furthermore, the story is immediately more captivating.If somebody wants to hate this game because they didnt like Unity, fine, but 20 minutes isnt really enough time to give a comprehensive review. If you like the AC series, try it out.There are probably bugs, but my game didnt break on launch, so this is immediately better.If there are any big, bad bugs, Ubisoft will fix them, just like they did with Unity which, by the way, turned out to be pretty fun after the bug fixes.
