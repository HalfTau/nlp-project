Assassins Creed Syndicate took a step in to the right direction in the series. Loads of side quests, things to explore, likeable characters, ok story. Still havent played the game through since I have been doing so much other stuff than main story. Of course the game can get repetitive and boring from time to time but honestly that happens in every single game did you admit it or not.Then I should talk about the combat. Combat is different, again, but this time it is a bit harder and requires practice. Since there is the leveling system ,which I am going to talk about next, the lvl 9 mobs are so hard when you are lvl 2 or 3 that you want to stay away from their vision and from the streets in the areas they move.Okay, leveling system, yeeey. Seriously this system is actually pretty good, it keeps you playing the game and trying to do all the side missions in order to get more xp to lvl up and use skillpoints and such. But if you do it like me that you are still in the early sequences and just spam side quests, the mission combat is going to get too easy if you get the hang of it. Since you do more dmg so you oneshot low lvl npcs. But other than that, the system is ok and there is no reason to dislike it imo.I rate this game 8.5/10 since there is still couple of bugs. Oh yeah the hoodmechanic lowers the score, because I dont want to assassinate someone with a tophat on, I want that badass hood. Yea of course you can get the hood on when ever you like  which is actually cool  but if there would be a crouch button and not hood and crouch assigned to the same button it would be 9/10.
