This game is a 10 for me, put the past week straight into this and just cant put it down. The atmosphere, the writing, the lead characters, even the people you do missions for all have some significance and their own charm. Even the more threatening Templar characters have likable qualities.The gameplay is spot on, best of any AC title to date. The combat is lightning fast, brutal double, triple and quadra kill animations are all INSANE. Moving around feels right finally, up and down free run, the grappling hook is more a thank you to AC fans, instant gap cover and instant tower climbing getting Eagle points is a piece of cake. Best of all, its all optional. Stealth killing is better suited to Evie while heavy combat is Jacobs forte.Pros Victorian London setting The Fry Twins unbelievable dialog and chemistry, simply masterful Strong supporting cast and villains Graphics building up the rooks Beautiful art directionConsTiring companion rep grind Broken up story side activities grow old overly simplistic combat
