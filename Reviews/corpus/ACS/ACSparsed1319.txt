I dont understand why this has better ratings than ACU, except that the mechanics are a tad bit better and it was less glitchy on launch. Both games are dull, boring and uninspired. I keep trying to like them. I keep trying to finish them. And in the end, I just cant because the substance that makes a game fun just isnt there.Then again, I loved all the games through Black Flag, including ACIII, so maybe I just have different tastes. Im also not a city person, so being stuck in the same city, where every rooftop looks pretty much like every other rooftop, is just plain boring to me. In ACI through Black Flag, I always felt like I was discovering new places and meeting new people until the end of the game. A few hours into this game, and it feels like Ive seen all there is to see, even when I go to new areas. The missions are repetitive, the side quests lackluster, and the characters wooden. Altair had his arrogance, Ezio had his charm, Connor had his anger, and Edward had his ambiguous morals, and all these characters had their traits and their transformations linked to their stories. Evie is that even her name? I cant even remember and Jacob which I only remember because its written in the game description are so generic theyre interchangeable and forgettable. Theres no backstory, no compelling reason for them to fight the fight theyre fighting, and it makes for a dull tale. Im actually more than a few hours into the game, and Im probably just going to give up on it because I dont care. Im not interested. Its almost a chore  I should finish this game just in case theres something interesting that springs up  rather than a compulsion.So in short, is this a bad game? No. Is it an interesting game? Also, unfortunately, no. And thats why I just cant recommend it.
