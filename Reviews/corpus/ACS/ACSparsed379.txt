A pretty good one of these games. The only major bummer on my setup was that after every major storybeat the ending screen would crash me out to the desktop and I would end up replaying it again from the last checkpoint. That defect got really old to deal with fast as there are a lot of story missions. But I did put up with it to finish the game and even the Queen Victory missions you get to play after the main story is complete. I do enjoy how its full of riculousness, like Evie racing her horses smashing into everything and the Batman type grapple. I wonder if anybody at Ubi really pays attention to the mission ratings they always are thanking me for.... In summary its not bad especially if you get it on sale.
