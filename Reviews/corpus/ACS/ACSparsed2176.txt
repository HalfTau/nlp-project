Alright, now, that Ive managed to be almost done with the game, lets talk about what Ive experieced with it so farFirst, the main sequence assassinations. I was really glad when Ubisoft decided to retain the Unique Kill minirequirements, allowing some more cool looking assassination cutscenes if you know what youre doing, as well as allowing the player to just forego them and go with another strategy. Just in case you might want to just directly head to the traget or just outright distch stealth and go kill everyone in the target area. Although, the return of the optional objectives is still a majestic pain in theSecond, the battle system. The ever so powerful counter attacks combined with the new, powerful spammable stun attack makes things pretty easy, with only the fast pace of the fights being the only challenge, as you will still have to time your counters, stuns, and combos.Third, the story. Ubisoft finally improved from their previous hijinks with Unity, and made gold material with Syndicates story. That said, you might want to buy the game yourself if you ever want to find out, as I do not want to throw around spoilers like misplaced christmas gifts.Fourth, the level grinding. Just go find a fight club around levels 58, keep winning it, and youll reach level 10 in no time. I actually reached level 10 before sequence 4, complete with the necessary equipments.For now, this is all I can say about the game. And I sincerely did not regret buying it.
