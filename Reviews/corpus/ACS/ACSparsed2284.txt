Only up to level 4 yet, but so far Im loving it.  If you like Assassins Creed style, Its more of the same.  I like that they have added back ? crafting.  The main story line with the Twins has been fun and interesting so far.  They readded a  Different side quests, and as always, the hunt for chests!  I foresee being lost in this game for many many hours to come.  They brought back a version of the Zip line, which makes getting around the city easier.  like the gritty feel of the industrial revolution London.
