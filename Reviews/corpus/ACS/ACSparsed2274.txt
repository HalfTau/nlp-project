If youre on the fence on whether or not you should buy this game I highly recommend that you watch streams or lets plays of people playing this game because seeing is believing. Ive used Steams streaming to broadcast my playing to some friends. Every friend Ive shown the game to so far has taken an immediate liking to it.I highly, highly recommend this game.I took a gamble considering the previous Ubisoft releases over the past couple years and their everdeclining quality. WatchDogs was supposed to be my jam, and the game was so terrible to play on PC, it killed me inside. AC Unity and FC4 both disappointed me highly.Assassins Creed Syndicate is definitely living up to my hopes of what an Assassins Creed game should be. The movements are much more fluid. The cover system is much more intuitive. Stealth is highly highly enjoyable.Theres I wanted to move here bugs occassionally, but on the whole, movement has been intuitive the entire time.The story is highly enjoyable compared to AC Unity, and I would rank it up there with AC Brotherhood or Revelations in terms of quality of story. Amazingly enjoyable, but not necessarily the best story handsdown.The gameplay in this game is easily my favorite of all the Assassins Creed series.10/10 Would recommend being Victorian age Spiderman again
