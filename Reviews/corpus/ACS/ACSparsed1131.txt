Great story but clunky gameplay. its the same assassains creed theyve been making for a long time so its worth the buy.  Moving between train cars and the fine motor control you need sometimes just isnt there.  Some of the smaller issues I found to be extra irritating as well.  However in general good game that was poorly executed
