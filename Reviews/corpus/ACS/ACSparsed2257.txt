Ive hopefully refunded it. Not only is this one of the worst games mechanically to come out of the last ing decade, the combat is mindless.You are PUNISHED for failing stealth by having to do this god awful button mashing rubbish.It crashed before london, I reloaded and could run around and not clip through terrain.Its just terrible. All of it. Dont buy it.Jesus.
