All the great things being said about this game are true, so Im just going to focus on how well optimized it is. Its obviously a demanding game, so not any old puter is going to be able to run it. However, I have a relatively lowerend Alienware x51 r2 with an i7 4770, 8 gigs, and a 1.5 gig GTX 760. Note that 1.5 VRAM. Even still, Im running at 1600x900 with a mix of medium/high settings, including vsync, the lowest AA setting and going a gig past my VRAM, but Im still getting between 30 and 40fps. I know there are a lot of gamers out there who look down on anything less than 1080p at 60fps, but Im thrilled to be able to play such a highend AAA game on my aged hardware. And it looks fantastic, even at lower settings.
