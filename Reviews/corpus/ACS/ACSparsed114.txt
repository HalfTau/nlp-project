I only have a few hours played on this game and already I cant take the repetitive gameplay and uninspired storyline. This is not horrible, this is just plain boring. It feels like pure grind. All the good Ubi games have some of this grind built in to some extent, but they add many layers on top to make it feel multidimensional and immersive. This is a game without a soul. You just go through the motions. If youve played some of the better ACs, dont get your hopes up, this pales in comparison. Had I known how generic and forgetful this one was, I would never have paid full price. Even so, I cant find the motivation to finish it. At least wait for the sales if you really want a go at this one.
