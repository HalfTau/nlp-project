To undestand and compare I have played AC12, Brotherhood, Revalations and Black Flag.Visually game is awesome, but combat is just sloppy button mash, parkour has been downgradedno jump options from previous instalations, you stick to all the wrong surfeces. Story is medium, so basically AC standart nowdays. Customization is lacking Unity level one of good few good this in that game, weapon choices are okay.Side activities are also okey, but compare to other openworld games, map is empty.Overall I would give 6/10 .Good buy if on sale and price is under 15 euros, if not, than I would recommend to skip this one.
