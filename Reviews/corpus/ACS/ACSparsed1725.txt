I know, I know, Assassins Creed has had many entries so far, and most of them have the same feel to them, but if you are a fan, such as myself, or havent played an Assassins Creed yet, then this one is a great choice! It is very well ported for PC, and has some very amazing looking textures. I love the setting being in London and the story line is pretty good so far. I do think the Assassins Creed series needs a revamp and maybe a few new and different features, but either way I do think this is a great game and I have been having a lot of fun playing it so far, and committed to completing it very soon.P.S. One thing I do wish it had is Steam achievements. It does have achievements on Uplay, but wish the Devs would add them to Steam as well.
