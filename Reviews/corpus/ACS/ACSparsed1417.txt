it says I have playedd 55 or whatever hours but really the game refuses to start... it goes to the first loading screen outside of the game then it wont do anything else... but then when I close it task bar, Task Manager, ETC it will stay open on my steam Library!! Any fix for either? I am playing on an Alienware btwIMPORTANT EDIT!! !I downloaded it a while back and it worked! I can now punch peoples groin and stab them to my hearts content!
