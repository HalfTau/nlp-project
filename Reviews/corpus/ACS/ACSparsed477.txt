Very satisfying game. Ive played all of the games in the series and this is one of the best. I like being able to play as Evie or Jacob and that they have very slightly different skills and styles. There are lots of things to collect as usual and some repeated tasks, but it doesnt feel overly tedious as in some of the games. You feel like you are making progress and makinga difference. Its fun to just exist in the worldspace and listen to conversations or drive around. I definitley found the interactions more humorous and entertaining. There are no missions or activities in the present day, which I appreciated, although there are some cut scenes throughout to keep it in line with previous games. This one definitely kept me focused right until the end.
