Im posting this because many people wait after last years experience  this review is only about performance.This year, it runs smooth, less CPU more GPU usage faster, more optimized performance. It runs a whole lot better than Unity. Ive played 30 mins so far, ran around to check out the graphics and controls in crowd, too.Im using GTX 780Ti 3GB VRAM, 8GB DDR3 2133 Mhz, i72600k 3.4 Ghz OC to 4.2 Ghz and all settings are maxed out, except for PCSSUltra shadows Id need 400 MB more VRAM for thatGraphics settings give you a slider, it explains what settings do what exactly. However the game autodetects settings on start, NVIDIA experience suggested max settings, and works.It does burn the GPU but there must be a lot less draw calls passed on to the CPU per frame, it stays relatively cold as opposed to Unity when the PC wants to take off Visually, it looks nice, the combat seems improved, but cant say much about that yet, as Im about to actually start discovering London.If you had doubts like I did  compare your specs with mine and decide. Seems like weaker systems can handle it on lower settings easily. I might write another review about controls and gameplay as I play the game.
