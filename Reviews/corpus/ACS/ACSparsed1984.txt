Astoundingly impressive, atmospheric and immersive.So far only played for a short time but can usually tell wether its a good deal or bad. Ok I know its your usual stealth, block and attack  but isnt every game effectively a defend/block and attack if you want to compare the core stratergy basics.Possibly the best Assassins Creed to date.
