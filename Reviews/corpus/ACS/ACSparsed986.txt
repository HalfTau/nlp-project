This is a great entry to the series. Gameplay wise it is the most stealthy and fluid combat in Assassins Creed, the story is pretty straight foward this time, well, except for the cheesy present day scenes, but those are short and more bearable than previous titles. The visuals are stunning BUT rather demanding on Very High and Ultra settings.If you are a fan of the AC games get it, its solid and fixes a great deal of problems from previous titles while building the glorious setting of victorian London.
