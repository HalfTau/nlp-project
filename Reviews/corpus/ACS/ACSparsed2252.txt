Last AC game I played was Black Flag, so some of the new stuff I mention may have been in Unity, so sorry in advance.Combat has been redone completely, you no longer have a godlike counter attack that instakills anyone who attacks you, now all you do is dodge. At first the combat felt a bit spammy since you do have to mash attack a lot, but you also have to mix in stuns and dodges.The parkour has been changed a bit too, you can now freerun down meaning that instead of leaping out towards whatever ledge may or may not be reachable, you jump or climb down the side of whatever youre on. This is something I didnt even really realize the game needed, but it is an awesome change.The story uses two characters, the Frye Twins that you can freely switch between when in the open world but for missions it will force you to play as one of them, some of the main missions force you to play as both of them as they simoltaneously do different parts of the same mission. I think the whole character swapping thing is a cool idea but it feels forced, like they included that feature just for the sake of having it rather than it being core to the gameplay.Overall this is a solid game that runs really well i5 4440, GTX 980, 8GB RAM on all but maxed settings, as usual, the Nvidia gamedoesntworks stuff murders your framerate having all the nvidia stuff turned on will eat a solid 15 fps if not more but with those turned off it runs great and still looks good.Seems like between Unity and the even bigger how that was Arkham Knight Ubisoft finally realized how to make a good PC port.
