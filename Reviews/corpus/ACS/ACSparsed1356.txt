Just OK.  It runs well, the mechanics are fine, the missions are dull and the story has little emotional resonance.   Some good ideas, but they left out the fun and sense of adventure.   Not worth full price.  Its a decent timewaster while waiting for a good game to come out.I dont know why it shows I spent over 200 hours in this game.  It must count when the game is minimized and Im doing something else.  Probably spent 25 hours total.
