The story and main character development is really mediocre, and either always rushed or sounds fake. Support character is unsupportive. The climbing mechanic is a bore, the fighting mechanic has a lot of glitches and lags. I want to tell you more, but my English is not that good, and I dont want to spend too much time here. If you dont believe me, get this game, and see for yourself if you enjoy it, lucky for you, you dont waste your spending. For me, this game is 5.5/10. Not below average, but not worth it.Also just want to mention that, I finished 100 sync not DLCs.
