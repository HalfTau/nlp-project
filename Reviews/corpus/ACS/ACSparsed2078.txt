With this game and Rainbow Six Siege as well as the PC port of Rogue earlier in the year, Ubisoft really turned themselves around this year.Other than cloth physics being locked at 30fps for no reason, the game is great and one of the better AC games, up there with Brotherhood and Black Flag. The new combat and movement systems work great having a hookshot is something Ive wanted in an AC game for a while, and even after finishing the 20 hour main story, theres plenty of fun to be had. Despite this, the story is kind of meh in comparison to the Ezio and Kenway Family trilogies.Definitely not Game of the Year by any means, but I definitely got my moneys worth with this game. 8/10.
