Assassins Creed in Victorian London, I went into it after the mess that is Unity without any hopes for a mindblowing experience, I found myself surprised, its a lot more polished and diverse than Unity which made me play the game alot more than its necessary to do every single thing.I got it for 35 and dont regret it but nowadays these games need to be carefully bought, theres plenty of side activities even if the main quest is only 9 sequences long. The gameplay doesnt change much from other AC games, but now theres a skill tree to improve Jacob and Evies traits aswell as the gangs strength. The weapons are also alot different, youll get Brass Knuckles, the cane sword, the classic assassins gauntlet, revolvers and the kukri.The combat is a bit more fast paced, I found myself having Jacob as the hothead fighter brawling with duzens of Blighters with nothing but his brass knuckles which is damn fun and not some copied out animation like in previous games, but there could be a few more combo moves. Evies whole style is stealth, you can liberate a whole stronghold without having them even noticing whats happening.The gang activities could have alot more content of course, just like in Brotherhood, you have to liberate every single discrict in London from the Blighters and after doing this, youll get gang wars and those are basically less than a minute long if you killed the leader previously, but you get to have up to 5 gang members following you at basically anytime and some of them can be very helpful if upgraded, the Rook volley fire is devastating.The grapple gun makes travel and maneuverability alot easier, but the game has alot taller buildings and a bit bigger London than Paris in Unity, this doesnt mean much because after liberating districts theres not much more to do after besides having the endless search for chests, flowers and music boxes which I refuse to keep doing since Black Flag because its just useless and boring work, and goes against everything a game should be, which is to be fun and not a task!The story is what normally save AC games, I got alot more interested in the characters in Syndicate, theres plenty of them, besides Evie and Jacob and their allies and enemies, there missions that have you working directly with characters from the time, such as Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria herself.Not a masterpiece of a story by any means, but it portrays the situation of London well with plenty of corruption, mentions on the economic situation, and interesting characters, this combined with a bit more fast paced combat system makes for a good AC game, but since there is the ever presence of the grinding aspects of Ubisofts games I would recommend purchasing the game on sale for about 20 which would give you a good value for your money alot more than a 60 edition that doesnt add much to the game.
