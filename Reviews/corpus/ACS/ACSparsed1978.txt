First of all, let me start by stating that I have beaten the game all the story missions and boss battles, but not all the side missions and I have never felt so compelled at writing a review for a game, but Syndicate is different.As an AC fan who has played every single AC game except for Rogue, I lost a lot of respect for the AC franchise after Unity due to its poor character development, crappy storyline, and glitched gameplays. As a result, I didnt expect Syndicate to be fun when I purchased this game, I simply bought it because I had the money at the end of the year and it was on sale sort of. However, in my opinion, Syndicate is the best AC game so far. The game really emphasizes the personalities of Jacob and Evie, how their goals differ, how they argued and competed in a sibling rivalry way, and this really touched my heart. Ubisoft really stepped up their game literally and put in effort in the development, which is something that I have never felt in Unity. I liked their idea of liberating the city in another way, the blackbox kills, the city of London with her bustling engines and carriages, and their most interesting side missions involving historical figures yet even though this has been done before in previous games, Syndicate did the best job. It seems like Ubisoft has finally realized their failure in the presentday storyline and has chosen to deviate from it quite a bit in Syndicate to many this is even worse but to me it showed me that Ubisoft has realized their mistake and is now trying to fix it by using only short cutscenes instead of meaningless playthroughs, and this is a good start cutscenes still show instereting story.I was so drawn into this game that I completed the game in merely two days two days, but I have 24 hours on record in two days, and I am by no means saying that the game itself is short even though it can be made longer. For me, the ending is not amazing, but it is by no means bad at all unlike IGNs review. As a fan, I dare say that I have moved on from Ezio, and that Jacob and Evie are my new favorite assassins. And yes, the Season Pass is worth the money for many reasons.ProsCharacter developmentStoryEvies outfitsNew  fast paced combat systemUnique and coollooking weaponsGood graphicsCarriage riding and chasingTwo playable and mostly switchable AssassinsCity liberation missionsAssociates of the BrotherhoodTwo types of NPCs Aggressors and ProtectorsYour gang that fights for youSibling rivalryRope launcherNew leveling system and skill treeBadass, mobile Assassin HideoutSmoothed parkour/free runningAmazing background music and soundtracksKidnapping peopleBig yet useful world unlike ACIIIs frontiersBritish accentsConsJacobs outfitsNo coopCan only wear hood when crouched/stealthedMicrotransactions still here even though not necessaryPoorly managed weapon rewarding system missions unlock weapons w lower statsNo significant difference in the skill treesEvies capes animation didnt notice until I saw other reviews, but yes it is like 20fpsMinor glitch in the inventory where they mark some equipments as new items even though I have had them for a whileOverall, 9/10. Best AC game so far, good story, strong characters, new level systems, weapons, and skilss. Definitely would recommend. Season pass is worth it for the first time. Buy the game and have fun.
