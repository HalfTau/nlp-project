I will be a ing liar if I say, Hey  you this is not an enjoyable game. Ive spent 68.2 hour gameplay currently and was not done with the game. 98 is Im at. The game is good, mechanics was soso, story is ing awful seriously. If you want to play this game because of its story, let me hold you off right there. The gameplay though is enjoyable and LONDON is amazing. I believe this will be a good, traveling simulator rather than an action stealth game.
