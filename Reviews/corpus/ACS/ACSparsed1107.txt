Assassins Creed Syndicate or as I like to call it Saints row in disguise. lets get one thing strate first its not an Assassins creed but never the less its still a good game.BasicsYou play as Jacob and Evie Frye, gang leaders of there new gang thay made on the spot called the rooks much like the rooks from chess that was a joke. You can upgrand your rooks buy spending money and crafting materials that you can find, earn or steal. You can upgrand Jacob and Evie with skill points and new weapons and armor ya they added a level up system in the game for better or worse.GamePlayThe Gameplay is fun you can sneak you can go in load as load as you acn go with a sword or you can run people over with a carriage and some how not get dsynchronize. I guess the hours did it??? Any way its fun.PerformancePerformance sucks you need like tripple or perhaps even more of the speacs to play this game smothly and it gos through ubisoft so that may be way also that means max frame rate of 60pfs because of ubisoft.StoryIts good lets leave it at that dont wont to spoil it for ya.ExtraI own this game for the PS4 and I like to play it on there over my pc just saying btw I have a pc that can play day z on ultra but cant play this game I mean come on!!! Not to menchin it took me a bit to figure out why it would not run in the first place forgot what I did but if I remember Ill post it in other words it may not start up for you as well after waiting like 5 hours for it to download so be aware.So YAY fo console NAA for PC Im a pc gamer so dont get me wrong.
