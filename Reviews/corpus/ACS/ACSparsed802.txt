It was an ok game, the main story was shorter than AC Unity at about 1415 hours so that was disapointing. In all honestly I prefered Unitys story as at some points it was pretty boring. Overall though, it was fun and capturing all the Boroughs can add hours to the overall gameplay and are a fun addition. I give it 7.5 child labours out of 10 indutrial revolutions. Also the grappling hook is a blast to play around with.
