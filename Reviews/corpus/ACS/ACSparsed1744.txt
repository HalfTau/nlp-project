Didnt like it too much at all, way too much that it basically does for you now. basically just hold the button/toggle stick to move forward and it can do 20 parkour moves by itself as you basically just watch it happen. you no longer feel like youre controlling the character, just pushing buttons to make them do things. Fighting expands on that feeling tenfold where i didnt feel like i was in a fight, more of just hit the buttons at the right time to let it fight for you.ran perfectly fine for me with a gtx 770 though so thats good i guess.
