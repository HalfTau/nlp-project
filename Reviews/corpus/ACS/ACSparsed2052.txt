Another ubi buggy release that is basically unplayable for many users.Rig is near top of the line gtx970x3 SLI, fx9590, 32gigs ram...I am one of the many plaugued by stutter issue as usaul support is 100 useless.  They basically tell you to update windows and your graphics driver with a  form fill.Tried the gambit of suggestions no solution yet.CPU/GPU and memory are at 30 utilized on low settings game still stutters ever 34 seconds.If you want to play this game buy it for console clear they dont care about the PC market anymore.Added1.  microtransactions...really?2.  game is optimized for 30fps forcing game to 30 will solve most issues and input lag vsync half usaully3.  holy crappy console port
