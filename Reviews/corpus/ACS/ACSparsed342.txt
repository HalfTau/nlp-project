This may be the best Assassins Creed yet, but certainly in the top two. A wide variety of things to do, though not too many like many of the previous ones and engaging characters.I would definitely recommend getting the Dreadful Crimes and Jack the Ripper DLCs, as they both enhance the story and play length.A game I was sad to have beaten.
