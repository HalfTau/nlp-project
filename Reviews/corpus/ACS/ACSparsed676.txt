Absolutely amazing game. Stunning visuals and a very Assassins Creed like plot. It reminds me most of AC Brotherhood in the ways the sidequests are based. If you enjoyed taking over Rome then youll enjoy this. The city feels like a more refined version of Paris from AC unity so thats nice as well. So far Ive conquered London and have completed most of the associate missions and Ive only just finished sequence 5 I did 8 too and my level is 10 so you really dont have to progress the story much to be able to do all the side missions. A step in the right direction for Ubisoft!
