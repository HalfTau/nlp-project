It was my first assassins creed that i bought and played myself and i was not disappointed. i just dont like the fact you dont have save slots but it didnt stop me from figuring out how to save them and play through the entire game twice. it helps that i absolutely loved the historical aspects of the entire game and how much i love the franchise before i even bought the game. evie and jacob have amazing chemistry and i enjoyed the perks and ways of playing both characters. evie also quickly became one of my favorite characters after ezio. i enjoyed the controls which are so much better than ACU. i hate the controls in that one so much and couldnt play through it at all lmao and all in all, being the first game from AC that i bought and played, 100 satisfied. thank you for introducing me to this game. 100 gonna be buying all of the ones coming after it
