I thourougly enjoyed this game. The villains were unlikable enough to feel they really warranted assassination, the heroes were FINALLY likeable again, after the emotionless husk of connor and the naivety of Arno. The reward system encouraged me to go out in the world and help the people of London and my associates and above all there wasnt too much modern day rubbish to distract from what Assassins Creed is all about becoming emersed in a period of history not seen in many other video games.Assassins Creed Syndicate is definitely one of the best Assassins Creed games. Up there with Assassins Creed II and Black Flag. A must for fans of the series or gamers with a love of history.
