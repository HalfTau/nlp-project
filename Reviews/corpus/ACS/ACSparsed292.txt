I decided to play this game two years after its initial release just because I became a skeptic after the disappointing release of Unity. I did love Unity after its fixes, but there was still alot to do for the game that the developers never accomplished. Now Syndicate has totally changed how I view the franchise. I believe they got right back on track with Assassins Creed and did well on release. However, I believe theres alot left out due to the yearly release schedule that couldve easily been implemented in to the game such as coop, more side missions, more DLC, etc..
