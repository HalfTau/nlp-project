Freerunning seems more fluid.. But combat seems to be lacking, and feels rather whimpy when you counter people. Feels strange having to beat on someone for a good 810 whacks before they can be killed. Still, its AC, and the cutscenes are delicious since its next gen... Id recommend this one for the hardcore fans only as I still say the Black Flag series rogue and freedom cry included are the best.
