I am new to the whole Assassins Creed games, this is the second one I bought after Black Flag and I am not disapointed. I always wanted to visit London and like history, it was absolutely fascinating to see it all come to life in this game. This game is beautiful and amazing. You quickly grow attached to the characters, not just Jacob and Evie. I loved the grappling hook, making it my favourite mode of transportation. In some mission you could not kill anybody nor be seen without having to flee and it obligated me to use stealth, althought it could be a little frustrating at time, in the end it is some of the missions I remember the most and enjoyed it. I absolutely loved the steath in this game, especially with Evies chameleon skill. My only con from this game is that sometimes my character jumped on stuff when I did not want him to. It is without a doubt one of my favourite games ever.
