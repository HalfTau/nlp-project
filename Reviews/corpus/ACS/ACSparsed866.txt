At the core this is another Assassins Creed game, no huge changes have occurred so if you havent liked any of the last 3 or 4 AC games then this isnt likely to be your cup of tea either.If however youre merely a little wary after AC Unity then I can assure you that this is a vast improvement. Everything about the game feels better and more refined than Unity.The storyline is interesting and has a clear goal and villain right from the start.The characters are well developed and witty, the siblings contrast each other very well and the banter is well written.There is the usual repetition of mission types to liberate each section of the city, each section requires around 5 seperate missions to be completed to gain full control of the area and culminates in a gang fight where you combat a boss. These fights are usually challenging as each one will have a special item or ability for you to adapt to.Overall I would recommend this to anyone that has enjoyed previous AC games or is completely new to the series.
