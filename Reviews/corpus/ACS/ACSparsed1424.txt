Pros A well designed/built urban gameworld that captures Industrial London extremely well Switchable player characters A nice sized cast of memorable fictional and historical characters Fluid, albeit easy, combat A balanced amount of side missions, collectables, and gearCons Modern day storyline leaves a lot to be desired Abnormally large amount of technical issues with the Jack the Ripper DLCThe Bottom LineSimply put, Syndicate is an improvement on Unity in almost all aspects. The storyline is comprehensible, the characters are three dimensional and memorable, combat returns to a simpler but more fluid and visually entertaining design, and above all else Syndicate manages to properly balance its amount of side missions, collectibles, and weapons/gear. Additionally, Ubisoft learned from its mistakes in Unity by NOT trying to force us into coop missions or obtaining a smartphone/tablet application in order to get the full experience.However, Syndicate does show us that Ubi is still having some issues getting its modern day storyline/characters off the ground postDesmond era. Things were much more straight forward and interesting when it was just Desmond and friends trying to prevent the end of the world in 2012. Now, the modern day plot has just become so bogged down with Sages, Abstergo entertainment fronts, the Initiates, and Juno having free reign of the digital world and of coarse what theyve now added in Syndicate involving the Shroud and the Precursor race. While players may have complained about poor ol Desmond during his time I think its safe to say we miss him and are in dire need of a new modern protagonist.Finally, it does appear that a portion of the player base continues to have technical problems on the same scale as with Unity. Personally I have not experieced any of these issues outside of the Jack the Ripper DLC which crashed quite often and glitched out with things like throwing carriages across the map. If youre looking at purchasing this game I would go ahead and try and figure out what kind of setups those experiencing issues have to avoid any possible disappointments.All in all, I would certainly say that if you lost faith in the series after Unity youll want to give Syndicate a spin  it may very well restore your faith in Assassins Creed.8 top hats out of 10
