Gameplay  3/10 AI 1/10Graphics  9/10Story  3/10 almost no story, very bare bonesI went into this with quite high hopes due to the numerous reviews online, Unfortunatley I was diasapointed. The overall world is great, i live in London and I feel they really nailed the atmosphere and astetic however in terms of gameplay Syndicate really falls down.The AI is terrible, its truley awful. You can engage a guy in combat and less than 100 meters away thier friends wil not notice the fight. You can throw dynamite near a group and they will not flinch, explode it and others are not alerted unless its in thier field of view. Guns work almost the same because the AI has almost no reaction to sound.Added to this when guards are alerted the do very little to hunt you down and quickly revert back to passive state, you kill 3 guys they will be alerted for a short period of time and then quickly act as if nothing happened.The AI is so broken that it destroys challenge and immersion for me, the things I have metioned have a huge impact on gameplay.Also I feel that variety in stealth is very limited, you cant do as much as a game like black flag so it makes gameplay stale.This wouldnt matter so much if the story was interesting but it really isnt, there is almost no decent story. Characters are generally flat and thier motivations limited to being very shallow. I liked AC4 because of Edward kenway as a character, he was genuine and funny. Evie and Jacob are dull and uniteresting, for example they go to London on a whim, no reason or explanation.Honestly Its just not a fun game, maybe for the first few hours but then you realise how flawed and dull this game actually is, theres no gameplay, lack of focus and other than its visual assets a generally dull game.I spent 24 in a sale, but honestly I wouldnt even call that value for money.
