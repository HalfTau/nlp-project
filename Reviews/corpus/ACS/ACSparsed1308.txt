I had my doubts with this game. I figured it would be recycled garbage. It wasnt. I fell in love with the characters Evie, and Jacob. The constant oneliners from Jacob gave him such a likable personality. And then Evie was so wise, and she truly felt like a Assassin to remember.... not to mention shes pretty hot right? Overall i give this game a 8/10.
