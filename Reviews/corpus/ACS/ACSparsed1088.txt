Great game, I enjoyed the upgrades, combat and the grinding also really liked being able to switch easily between the brother and sister in the menu screen. since the brother thrives a bit better at open combat, and the sister is more better used as a silent killer. even though both can still do either one pretty well.my only complaint would be the free running, i think liberation pretty much nailed it so they should of kept it that way. like for example in liberation you had a high profile button which was the running command, but it also allowed her to automatically jump and climb swiftly, as she was running. in this game when my character is running i get stopped dead in my tracks alot, even by stuff like up to my knees. because you actually have to hit another button to jump or climb as you run, even if it looks like you can just step over the object.
