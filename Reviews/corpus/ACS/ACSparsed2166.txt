Hello. Yes, I would recommend the game for its solid plot structure, fun gameplay, and good characterization.Unfortunately, that does NOT mean I have to like everything in it. Let me put it simply, you should definitely buy the game, but be wary of these things.When youre on a mission with a higher level than yours, you can outmatch the game. Unfortunately, the game will not tolerate this, and will outright CHEAT to keep you from victory. In fact, I was doing a child liberation in Westminster at level 8, and the game, among other things, automatically had me leap out of my cover, disabled Chameleon, and, by far the worst part, took away all my smoke bombs and medicine during the middle, without me even using them.Helix credits need to be bought. That is all.Manual aiming is disabled during combat, and nonmanual aiming Via the keyboard is unresponsive a lot of the time.Enemies are QUICKER than you. You, a trained master assassin, WILL be beaten by lowly Blighters because when you press your counter, the game instead carries through with attacks, especially with highlevel enemies.Charles Dickens storyline has no proper resolution. We are just to assume SpringHeeled Jack is not out there, slaughtering more innocents as we play.But, despite all this, it is a solid game, which I would give a 7/10 and advise you to buy. But remember these things so you dont lose like I did.
