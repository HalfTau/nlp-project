Ubisoft did a pretty good job after that disasterous Unity pile of poo. This game is the new coming of mighty Assasins Creed series and its well made and fun so far. Thing worth to mention is that game is very very demanding especially if you want to play it on solid 60fps. I have GTX 980Ti GPU and Intel Xeon e3 1231V3 CPU and i can manage very solid 60fps with good quality eye candy but people with lower powered gear should consider twice if solid 60fps is their goal with decent looking game. I really recommend this game since it has great and interesting story with good game mechanics and glorious graphics plus that semiwell done optimization. Its on sale now and if you were Assasins Creed fan like me before the Unity, you are definately going to enjoy this one like good ol AC games in the past.9/10 would buy this again even at full price. got mine on Holiday Sale
