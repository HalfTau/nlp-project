This game has amazing graphics, plot and interesting characters. But the controls are awful and really the only thing that makes this game frustrating to play. It does not feel like you are controlling the character but rather pressing buttons that make them do a sequence of actions. Climbing is the worst part and really a huge part of any assasins creed game. Fighting is fun but it feels like one long quick time event, which I dont mind personally. It is a decent game but it is not worth 60 dollars. Oh yah by the way you need to use Ubisofts Uplay to play it and they have in game purchases in it,a game you already payed for. Overall I wouldnt recommend it 5/10.
