Stability Within the 4.3 hours of my first playthrough, Ive experience 1 crash and only 1 so stability wise, its alright though I would prefer it not to crash at all. Playing on ultra settings at 50 fps smooth, no stutter with a gtx 980 ti, intel i76770k, installed on a samsung evo 850 series SSD.Gameplay Enjoying the zipline mechanics, although they need to improve it because occasionally, I cant find a target to hook the zipline to even though Im close enough. Progression in the game seems fine, I enjoy the stealth mechanics. The movement mechanics feels a lot like the older games preAC unity so it feels fast but sometimes unresponsive. Its quite frustrating when Evie/Jacob doesnt move the way you intend them to. Finally, I like the idea of a train being used as a base but it brings about many glitches, namely being positioned too far from your mission checkpoint.Overall, I think its alright to get this game. If you really like the Assassins Creed franchise, do get this, especially if its on sale. If not, its worth skipping this, I think Ubisoft needs to take time to properly improve the series. Its becoming repetitive and much like Call Of Duty nontreyarch ones.P.s If you liked Ezios character, you might like Jacobs .
