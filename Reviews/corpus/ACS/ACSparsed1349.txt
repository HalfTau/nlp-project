Great game they really put work into this one was as nearly as good as ac2, i loved it cuz i played in ezios suit the hole time  the only thing ive always wished for after you beat the compagn there really isnt anything to do, so i just wish they had like zombie waves or something because when your maxed out with nothing to do it would be nice to do like waves or something with a friend.
