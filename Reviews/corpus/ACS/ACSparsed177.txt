When I bought this game after playing all the previous AC games my expectations where high. And at first the game did not live up to it. After abondoning it for about a year I started playing again an now I realy love the game. It is open, you are free to do and go anywhere. I has so many things to do it will keep you busy for a long time, been playing for 42 hours now and am only half way there. Fighting is still challanging, you have to keep an eye open in every corner to rebound incomming attacks. So in my opinion the price is realy worth it.
