Pros and cons styleBeautiful graphics.Fantastic 10/10 atmosphere.Fantastic 10/10 audio.Great character design.Fantastic animations.Interesting premise.AMAZINGLY HORRIBLE controls. LIterally the worst control scheme and camera Ive ever saw anywhere on anything or could possibly imagine. This is the quarter claw game of video games, or the Linux FOSS developer with a hardon for CLI decides to design a GUI and parkour control scheme for a video game game.Engine is pretty resource heavy though it looks good enough to justify it.Story is rather disjointed and all over the place.UPlay is essentially cancer to appease mouthbreathing accountants who think DRM makes them money.Combat is basically frozen moose spunk in a bucket, on rollerskates. With knives.Inane DLC with very nickle and dime shenanigans for ingame currency and such nonsense. Hi, Cheat Engine.Tends to crash for no real reason other than Uplay/DRM garbageaids.Its like a company with amazing funding decided to make a AAA game, and succeeded, then listened to their money guys for suggestions for additional changes, but didnt have enough money left to hire someone other than the minimumwage, Gentoorunning neckbeard janitor to come up with a control scheme or GUI.Regardless, its...positive aspects outweigh its negatives. Its pretty damn close, though, the controls are THAT bad.
