Great game, love the fact that you can switch from one assasin to another with different skill. All lots of bug from previous UNITY  game have been corrected and the game play is a lot nicer.Lots of side quest in the main map and its a good 40 hours game is you take time to do must of thing.Down side, i feel like once you play one assassins creed you kind of play them all. Overall is the exact same game play as the other with very few minus change. The game did not evelove as much as i hope.Miss the time attack mission that was in Unity and much more complete second map and mission.The game is also WAY to easy. If you, like me, dont let anything slide and do all the side quest, you will be way to strong way to quick for the game level. Save some side quest for later to keep difficulty level higher.Overall 7/10 still a great game and great franchise, good 40 hours spent.
