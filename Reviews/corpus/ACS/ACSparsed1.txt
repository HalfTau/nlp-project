Im so glad I decided to give this game a try. The trailers and gameplay looked so bland and boring but once you actually get immersed into the story with its extremely likeable protagonists, youll never be able to get your hands off for a while. The combat system also seemed unrealistic and stupid at first, but once you understand it, its actually really fun.
