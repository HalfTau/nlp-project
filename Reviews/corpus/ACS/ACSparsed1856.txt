I played this game on PS4 initially and now playing again on PC. This game has brought Assassins Creed back. I hesitated to even try this one because of how the series has been going but I decided to give it a chance and I was honestly surprised. I like the story and having 2 assassins to choose between I like. I understand why on some missions you are Evie and the other youre Jacob but sometimes I just want to play as one.This game still has some of the usual problems like camera and climbing issues where you push one direction but the character does something else. This isnt too bad but can be annoying. The combat feels a bit easier than other games but to me thats not a bad thing.If youre a fan of the series, then I believe you will enjoy this one.
