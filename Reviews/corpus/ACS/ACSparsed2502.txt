Awesome awesome awesome!!! Like many AC fans I was worried that ACS would end up being a ACU repeat. Im happy to say its nothing like Unity!! Im about 4 hours into the game, game play is awesome, graphics are great, so far no glitches, running a solid 60fps. Running GTX 970M i7 6700HQ. I would highly recomend this to anyone who loves the Assassins Creed franchise!!
