Its a good game for the most part.  Excellent visuals, animation, etc.  As is the minimum requirement for a AAA game.  Unfortunately, even after a year later, theres still bugs and random crashes.  Technically, this is expected considering the size of the game.  Unfortunately, most companies actually fixes many of these issues within 6 months if not the first month.  Its just disturbing that Ubisoft doesnt care enough to follow through and update this game to fix the gamebreaking bugs.Plotwise, it continues the slide that started with Unity and is quite forgettable.   Gameplaywise, its good somewhat but the combat system pales in comparison to combo oriented games like the Batman Arkham Series.  Contentwise, it falls into the usual trappings of open world games of filling the game world with collectibles that has no plot bearing and are just a chore to collect.
