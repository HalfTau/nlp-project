Finished the game on PS4 Pro.You would think that Assassins Creed Syndicate, as an Ubisoft game, is grindy, repetive, buggy, and collectibles galore by default. The statement isnt even half false, if thats what you are wondering. Still, I managed to have some fun out of a dozen crashes on PC AND PS4, final build and gamebreaking bugs that I yelled and rolled my eyes at. The revamped combat system was fun in the first frew hours, but it became a chore after I realized smashing buttons works just as well, if not better. The leveling system is okay, but it lacked the genuine sense of pride and accomplishment that is essential to such systems. In Syndicate, its almost impossible to NOT reach level 10 if you follow the storyline and do some side quests, which have very limited in variety and bore you quickly. In fact, I capped out halfway through the game and all the experience points I got in the other half simply went to waste.Granted, the game has an interesting setting and for the first time in the series dual characters of two genders. However, the story itself is bland and unimaginative. Although the fitst few chapters set up a good contrast between Jacob and Evie, or actions and consequences, the last chapter ignores it entirely except some superficial bantering and leaves what could be an amazing discourse on this theme halfcooked.It was fun most of the time exploring the Victorian London, but this game just isnt polished enough to make you feel as if you were there.
