Personally, I would like to see them go back to a present day with some actual playability like you did with, Desmond. But aside from some minor details, Syndicate, for me, is one of the best in the series and is definitely recommended. Many improvements have been been made with the mechanics of the game to REDUCE frustrations you likely experienced in the other games. All around good game.
