ENI personally recommend this game. I love open world parkour games and this ACS fits with the traditional mechanics but with a new twist to things which balances it out nicely and makes it a brilliant game to play. The storyline for this game was also very nice and interesting which made me want to keep playing, I would highly recommend you getting this game if you like actionfilled parkour with some funny moments between. The missions were also very fitting within the storyline and kept me playing without becoming bored.There are a few secrets within this game so after youve completed it, have alook around for them KR    . . . . ,          . . ,        .
