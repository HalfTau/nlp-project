Do I reccomend this game, No. Heres whyThe game suffers from the same symptoms of other assassins creed titles and yet they seem worse in this title. The controls are not very good, often finding myself jumping onto the wrong ledges or completely jumping off the building when I am trying to climb down. Had an easier time moving around in Black Flag even with the addition of the zipline in this title. Storyline feels very basic, youre thrown into london to start a gang with all your typical repatitive gang wars that other games have done better. The combat is much less intresting than previous titles, only 3 weapons types to choose from 1 of which being nothing more than brass knuckles. There are other minor glitches and dissapointments throughout the game, all of which I would have forgiven if it wasent for the crashes. Often when the game is loading between cutscenes or before the mission reward screen pops up it will shutdown the program entirely ending with an error message. I would not buy this game if I had known how lackluster and buggy the game would be.TLDR  Typical assassins creed annoyances are worse this title, it crashes often, buy blackflag instead.
