At the time of writing this review, I only have a few hours on this game on PC. But rest assured, I had hit almost 100 on console prior to purchasing this on Steam.This installment in the series was a HUGE step in the right direction, in terms of both story and gameplay. I have a slight obsession with the AC series, and everything since AC3 just didnt really feel like AC. This game, to me, began a turnaround back to the great character stories and dialogue weve come to expect and love from the AC series. The game doesnt take any time at all slogging through a detailed character background sequence as per usual it gets right into the meat of the game and lets you learn the character stories along the way.This game is also optimized much better than Black Flag or Unity, and Victorian London with graphics at full blast in 4k is absolutely stunning.One of the more common complaints Ive seen is that the combat is too arcadey and the addition of the grappling hook makes the game too unrealistic. Id like to address these...1. The combat is much faster. Beyond that, I dont really see how its more arcadelike unless you consider all the others arcadelike as well. Be honest with yourself, how many times have you found yourself in an AC game finishing a fight and suddenly finding Altair/Ezio/Connor/Edward/Arno standing in an overly large pile of corpses?2. As far as the grappling hook making the game unrealistic, I would like to remind those critics that a core element of every AC game has involved jumping dozens to hundreds of feet/meters off of buildings INTO PILES OF HAY.I digress. If you are a fan of AC, and you werent really into AC3 or Unity, and you shared my concerns about the direction of the series, I recommend this game. And I recommend that you play it all the way through, including the side story stuff.
