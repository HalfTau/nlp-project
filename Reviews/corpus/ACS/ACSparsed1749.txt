After reading alot of negative reviews about this game from windows 10 users, I thought Id chime my two cents in. I use windows 10, and have being playing the game in 34 hour sessions, not a single crash. Im using a cheapish PC, paid roughly 1000AUD, runs perfect 60fps no drop on a I5 4690 and a GTX950 with 8GB, so whatever was wrong with all those people must have being patched at this point, so far I havent experienced much of the story, but what I have seen is, at least in my opinion a little bland, and on par with AC3 which I enjoyed thoroughly. That being said I never played Unity, so for me the gameplay is amazing, but from what Ive seen from walkthroughs of Unity, the look similar but not identical. Long story short, if you were putting off getting this game based on technological reasons, it seems to have being addressed.
