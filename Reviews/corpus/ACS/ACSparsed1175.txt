I picked up this game hoping that it would be better than Unity and it was. I got it for around 25 and Id say it was worth it. I had a lot of fun although the tailing missions made me want to unistall but besides that I had a good time. As of 7/21/16 I have 33.3 hours and about 10 of those hours are me doing tailing missions... Probably8/10 Would somehow get in world war 1 againEdit I did need to go into the ini to make the game run better and this worked a lot better than it did in Unity
