The game frequently fails to start, without reason or error message. Its ok when it does actually manage to run, but it does feel like getting ripped off for such an unreliable program. Definitely wait until theres an extreme discount, or youll be reallyoff at having spend a lot of  money on mostly nothing you get to look at your steam library and troubleshooting pages a lot, sometimes Ubisoft will bother to start up, if youre lucky. Not recommended.
