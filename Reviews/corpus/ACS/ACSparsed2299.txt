Played about 50 of the game now and done alot of side stuff aswell.I really enjoy that you have two Assassins to play with. I used Jacob for most gangrelated stuff and Evie for most stealth stuff. The story force you to use one or another for spesefic main story missons. But ppl feared that you would not be able to use Evie Frye a whole lot. That is not the case. Ive have played about 50/50 with each of the twin Assassins.I feel the game got two sides and both of them are done fairly well.1. The Assassin side. Missons where you can really get your sneak on and decide how you want to take down your target.2. The gangside. Gang related missons, gang upgrades, gang wars, gang zones. It got alot to play around with.All in all i think this was a giant step up from AC Unity.There was a few bugs and glitches the first day, but after the patch that came out i havent encountered many bugs. A few times ive seen a person sitting on the ground slide away on the street and one time a misson got locked because i dident take the recomeneded horse cart. Just restarted and did it again.So not much problems.I really recommend you to try this game. Its been alot of fun and i am only halfway done
