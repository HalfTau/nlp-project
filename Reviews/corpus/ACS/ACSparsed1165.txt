This might be my next favourite after AC Revelations. The storyline is gripping. The characters are outlandish at times but it adds to the flavour thats ACs almost alternate reality ! My complaints though is as usual the buggy gameplay.there is very little fluidity even on low graphic settings.sometimes i am moving without pressing any keys. Sometimes i need to restart a mission because when i press for kidnap it doesnt work unless i press repeatedly. i can see how much of my graphics card is being used for gameplay which is a really good thing .however at 50 usage at 2gb ram ,i still think the game is underperforming at low settings even.Love the English aspect of it,especially Charles Dickens.Overall love the game.Just hoping the gameplay can get better.
