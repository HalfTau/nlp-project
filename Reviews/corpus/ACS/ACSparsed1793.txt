Been a fan of AC series since the first one came out. I wont be like the others who will hate the game because of what happene to Unity. The game has a brilliant new combat system and the appearance of the city is delightful, the story is so interesting that I was sitting at the computer playing without hearing whats going on around me. If I did not have a weak hardware at his disposal, I spent the whole day in this world. Plus points of of this game are New combat system new weapons New story Wonderful city full of life Brilliant side missions with whom I spent more time than the main thread Able to choose form Carriages that they can lead chance to meet historical figuresHowever, there are also cons The level of the game is easy Opponents are sometimes stupid they killed Jacob on the Jack the Ripper dlc /3 ooops spoiler alert
