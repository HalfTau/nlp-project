I have an GTX 860M and I am running it with the resolution of 1600x900, FXAA antialiasing and high environmental textures and low everything else, and I am getting an average of 40 frames per second. I like it a lot. The main characters are great and London looks great. My only gripe is that some textures, bricks for instance, look better on some buidlings than others which is odd. If everything had the same texture clarity i think it would look better even if it is a little blurry. Anyway, if you like Assassins Creed this is a great game. This is, of course, just my experience and it does seem like some others are having some issues, but I just wanted to throw in my two cents worth. Honestly, I have been able to run Unity day one and Arkham Knight day one on this laptop it never fails to impress me how much it can do, so maybe I am just a lucky guy. I am sure a lot of small issues wil be fixed with the inevitable Nvidia graphics driver thatll come out later today hopefully this helps people with there problems. Anyway, back to my positives again, I like this game a lot so far and it runs far better on day one than Unity ever did.Edit Ive fiddled around a bit and got it to run at 1080p with low everything, FXAA and maintain around 35FPS is anyone is curious
