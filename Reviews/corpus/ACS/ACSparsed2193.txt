After long a good assassins creed game . the London setting is pretty nice , new twin assassins are charming and i find the story to be interesting leaving the modern day bits out , combat has been improved and feels more responsive than ever and on the free running side of things its same as unity the same age old assassins creed problems are still here ,your assassin wont exactly do what you want them to but the addition of the new rope launcher is neat makes you feel like a Victorian spiderman . performance wise it runs pretty good with my 970 though gameworks tax ur system a lot and cannot keep a study 60fps . but what i dont like the most is micro transactions . at least its not as bad as unitys where its not force upon .but seriously ubisoft do we really need them in a game like Assassins creed . overall good game ,needs bit more optimization .
