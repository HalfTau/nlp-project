Its not the best AC clearly, but is the most bugless and playable one.The screen of the game is great and brings me back to the 19 century London, which is why I always love AC. Two playable characters are interesting but unfortunately quite the same except some attack styles and of course gender, which means if u like to act as a female such as Lara Croft, u will like it. The story however is clich, just like other Ubi openworld games.
