As a fan of the AC franchise, I was glad they made reaching to vantage points easier.ProsGreat storyline. Both during the Industrial Revolution and the Present time.Awesome visuals with huge architectural and historical buildings.Narration was splendid, and humourous.Missions were creative, for example, it wasnt always the same old assassination methods. The Unique Assassination worked wonders.Character were created beautifully. Jacob and Evie had that sibling rivalry most of us can relate to. Which is nice.Fighting was improved with the double, triple and quadraple kill.Gangs were okay, with upgrades and all. But I still prefer Brotherhoods gang. Which are of course Assassins and not some random Roots.ConsMovement still isnt all that smooth, like free running. Its good, but it could be way better.Funny NPCs that spawn in places that there were no entrances, Unless theyre freaking Assassins as wellWhy do they have Helix Glitches???? Unnecessary items to collect again in the AC franchise.All in all, I would still recommend this game! Cheers
