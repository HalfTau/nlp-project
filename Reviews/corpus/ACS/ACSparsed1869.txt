I bought this in the sale, expecting to be dissapointed, Id told myself I was never going to buy another Assassins Creed after the whole Unity disaster. However, im really glad I bought Syndicate. Assassins creed is FUN again! Yeah, Its not on the level of Black Flag, but its good.Pros Looks pretty AFRuns ridiculously wellSneaking actually feels like sneakingPeople saying shhhh hes hidingThe rope launcher is an awesome stealth toolJacobs obsession with his RooksCons Repetetive finishersCombat is ok, but its still not fast enough to make me feel like a ridiculously lethal AssassinSlightly repetetiveI cant customise my tophatNot enough difference in weapons.All in all, I highly recommend Syndicate, ubisoft has actually done some good this time round.7.5/10
