So much to do, so much to see.The missions are varied from annoying to sublime, the characters do seem to play similarly, but that could be user bias.  The grapple hook is a great introduction but not as insane as Just Causes version which is understandable.This is a game to take your time over and level up before taking on the take over missions.  Its a shame youre not sending out teams of assassins around the world on missions as that was an interesting diversion and a way to acrue money and materials.I recommend this game, and am also glad theyre taking a break from an annual release.  Hopefully the next chapter in the installment will be able to introduce new elements along with the familiar.  Perhaps some limited gunfu?
