This in its own simplicity is a good game! Is it a good assassins creed game? No... Unfortunately.The story is decent, even the combat is okay, but when it comes down to player movement, its. I am constantly finding myself screaming at the game because my character decides to jump 90 degrees in the wrong direction.. Also this addon to the freerun mechanic where while holding shift you hold e to go down, or spacebar to go up makes it alot more inconvienent and tedious feeling to get around. Movement feels like a chore and ruins the game for me.I can not recommend this game to anyone like me and with little paitience.I hate to give it a thumbs down, but in terms of an assassins creed game it has gone way below my expectations, and I really wanted to like this game.
