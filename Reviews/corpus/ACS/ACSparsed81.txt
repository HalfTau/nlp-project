Coming from someone whos a fan of the Assassins Creed series, I would save your money and not get this game. Controls are horrible. Game would give a button to press, you press it and it wont do anything. Button commands fail more times than succeed. Way too many bugs and glitches happening in the game. Characters would appear invisible. There will be times youll see a  horse and buggy glitch and fly off the map. Story really isnt too interesting. Unless you know London history like the back of your hand, you wont be too interested in whats going on with the characters. Combat is just horrible too buggy. Going back to what I said about the controls of the game. Button commands would happen in combat and it would fail more than half of the time, resulting in you losing and dying to most fights. This goes the same when trying to kidnap, sneak, or even tackle someone. Game is basically pay to win. If you have extra money laying around and to throw it at Ubisoft. Basically can buy XP boost, in game currency, crafting resources, etc.Overall, Unless you bought this game on a steam sale, you basically paid 4070 for a broken game that STILL to this day havent recieve any updates to its fixes.
