Pretty good game the only AC Ive played all the way gave up on Black Flag because it was too frustrating. It gets to be a bit of a grind at times, and there are some very frustrating missions along the way one minute you have all the time in the world to be stealthy, the next, youre relying on splitsecond timing tough for older assassins like the present reviewer. Overall, its a 3.5 stars out of 5 from me sadly, there will never be another Witcher 3, it seems...
