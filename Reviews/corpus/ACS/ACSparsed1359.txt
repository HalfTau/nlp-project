I played it briefly but then Ubisoft did a patch which broke the game. Ive tried all the fixesposted online to no avail. I asked for a refund from Steam but it was declined. This could be a good game if it was playable but currently it is not and there does not seem to be any urgency on Ubisofts part to fix it since it has been months now. You are wasting your money buying this game. What a shame!
