The story/concept are good but once again Ubisoft has put out a glitchy, undertested game which is insulting to any gamer still willing to take the risk of spending or possibly more appropriately wasting their money on a Ubisoft game. I truly hope Ubisoft is willing to spend more time on the next one before releasing it rather than just pumping out another piece of garbage.
