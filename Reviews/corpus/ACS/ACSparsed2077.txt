This game is an improvement over ACUnity and ACRogue.First of all and most important, the game works. I havent had any gamebreaking bugs or glitches, and it has frozen only once. They learned their lesson from last year.Now thats out of the way Ill talk about the story. In 1868 London you play as Evie and Jacob Frye trying to free the city from the Templars. This story feels rushed in the beginning and the end, but the middle is steady. Evie and Jacob are much better characters than Arno or Shay and the Templar Grandmaster and his advisor are great antagonists. The modern day storyline is cutscenes between the sequences and it is better than Black Flag, Rogue, and Unity. Though I think it needs to have a new playable character to replace Desmond.The gameplay is similar to the other games surpise, surprise. The fighting is like Unity but much faster and fluid. The parkour system is improved only a little. The zipline you get is fantastic, so you can spiderman around the city. Freeing the boroughs of London is usually fun. Instead of a tower of control like in Brotherhood, you have bounty hunts, templar hunts, child liberations, and gang strongholds. Then when youve done them all, you have a gang war. Its a neat concept but gets repetitive. The unique assassinations are really cool if you want to do them. The side missions are decent. I am really tired of collectibles. To get the unique armor you need to collect 32 music boxes. Instead of going through an Assassin tomb, or the Lairs of Romulus, or the mayan stelae, you collect find them around London....yay fun. Collectibles really need to either go away or be heavily limited.Overall I give it an 8/10, I like the game and it seems like Ubisoft is headed back in the right direction...hopefully.
