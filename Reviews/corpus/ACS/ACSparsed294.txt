I have mixed feelings about this. Gameplay and missions can be a lot of fun, but also they repeat the same style way too much, go here kill this guy if killed this way get extra rewardMain questline is interesting, and does not repeat the same style as much. Characters are good, and their stories are interesting. I like that you can play as 2 different assassins, who can favor different playstyles, because they have different skilltrees and inventories.Parkour element that Assassins creeds are famous for, feels really good and the grappling hook is a really nice addon, and fits the game well.Horse carriages are horrible tho. I play mostly with a controller, where they are easier to control but AI traffic really makes it impossible to travel well with these vechiles. Only if there would be a way to move just slightly slower with them would be good.Its a moderate game, not the best I have played, but I like it and would recommend, to pick this up from a sale.
