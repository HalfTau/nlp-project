One of the best games Ive ever played, with no doubt.Stunning graphics, thrilling story line.You can definitely feel Jacob and Evie, they are really realistic just like a movie.The only con i can find are some little graphic bugs sometimes which make the game less fluent,but it happens once per a few hours.Overall, extremely worth buying!
