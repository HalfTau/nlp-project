As an Assassins Creed Fan and a game developer, I would say that this Syndicate is the best title of the series. Wonderful Graphics, controls, fights. And the most amazing part is the history that makes you feel like you are living that era in London.I never feel addected to a Game like Assassins Creed especially Syndicate
