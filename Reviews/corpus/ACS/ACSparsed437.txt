Overall, I had fun playing Syndicate, but I think that might be because Assassins Creed Unity and Assassins Creed 3 were really unremarkable games. But at this point, I dont even know if I would recommend the game to someone that isnt already invested in the series. Because it feels like the writers have completely lost track of what is supposed to be happening and very little actually happens in the overall narrative in terms of progression but at the same time so much has been done you cant understand who all these people are anymore. But, if you were going to put a gun to my head, or a blade to my neck and force me to have to choose, an Assassins Creed game it would at this point be a choice between this one and Black Flag.You can find my full review over here.
