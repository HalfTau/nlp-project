If you like the sneaky stabby part of the Assassins Creed games and somewhat entertaining dialogue  youll like this.The main characters have actual personalities and I didnt feel like punching the TV when they spoke, so thats a plus.You can switch between the two male / female twins whenever you like when youre not in a mission.Combat is easy as always, though it is faster paced and window for counter/parry/invincibility is quite a bit shorter.Performance wise its better than Unity... as in it functions. If you use up too much vram though the game can randomly alttab you to desktop without actually crashing. Also, high/ultra custom settings the game runs fairly smooth 60fps, but the cloth physics are locked to 30fps for some inexplicable reason. To fix this youll have to edit AC.ini in Documents / Assassins Creed Syndicate add FlexibleMotionSimulationFPS1 under Options.My rig GTX 780 1050Mhz 3GB / Intel Core i54670k 3.4Ghz / 8GB RAM 1600Mhz CL9 / Windows 8.1 64bit  / 1080p 60.
