If you are a die hard fan os the Assassins Creed Series then I definitely recomend to pick Syndicate up  I too was one who began to lose faith in ubisoft beggining with the launch of assasins creed along with the infamous Unity The character devlopment in syndicate felt deep and heart felt. The graphics felt real and unbelivably beutiful. The combat mechanics and parkour felt fluid and diverse. Overall Ubisoft took their early mistakes in Unity and astustly converted it into a chance to do their best.9.5/10  An almost perfect game.Assassins Creed Syndicate was Unitys Redemption
