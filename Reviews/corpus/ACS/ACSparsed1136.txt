I really enjoyed this part in the series unlike Unity, this games plot makes you actually want to continue, and continues on the main story in the real world. I had some problems getting it to stop crashing, which was easily fixed by running both the game and uplay as admin, and changing the Setdriverworkaround to 1 in the AC.ini in documents. I then had alot of lag which was odd as Ive seen others run it fine with lesser systems, but that was also fixed by going into my Nvidia control panel and changing Vsync to adaptive and Max frames rendered to 1. The game was like butter after those fixes. Hopes this helps people.
