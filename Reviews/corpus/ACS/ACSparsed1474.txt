My review is not about the gameplay mechanics of the story since after days of trying to play the game it has been impossible. When I open the game it gets stuck on the assassins creed logo and will not go further. I have tried several solutions reinstalling, troubleshooting, contacting ubisoft support and nothing. THe most frustrating thing is the ubisoft answer which was you do not meet the minimun requirements of graphic card when my graphics card is the recommended one rather than the minimun requirements one. Ubisoft games for pc for some reason do not work. Couldnt play Watchdogs either the key was already in use even though I had just bought the game. Extremely dissapointed.
