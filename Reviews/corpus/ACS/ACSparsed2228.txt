Syndicate represents the first step in the right direction for Ubisoft after the recent disappointments in the Assassins Creed series, improving upon the core gameplay and taking the franchise to new heights. It became my favorite Ubi game, and in my opinion the best of AC yet. Beautiful, immersive, vivid Victorian London thats very fun to explore with more polished mechanics and some new elements thrown into the mix. I must also mention the games great voice acting, and its sublime soundtrack, contributing to the settings appeal. The side activities are entertaining, and its combat feels smooth and very satisfying, with both protagonists. Despite each others different strengths and their showcased individuality, both Evie and Jacob are fun to play as, and their skills are yours to select. Evie is without a doubt the more compelling of the two as a wellwritten protagonist, and her calculated stealthy style really suits her and her path towards her endgame goals. The twins dynamic, however, mostly stemming from their differences, is very fun to watch.Given Ubis past mistakes, perhaps the most pleasant surprise about ACS is that its PC version does not disappoint  not only it looks gorgeous, but its one of the best Ive played this year some hiccups here and there  minor things that patches will certainly take care of soon, but overall optimized and runs well within ones hardware limits, and I have a midrange rig.A fun game with a refreshing choice in protagonists, moderately intriguing main storylines with a few history icons as associates, and a rich setting that can easily draw you in with its stunning sights and enjoyable activities. Keep this up, Ubisoft.
