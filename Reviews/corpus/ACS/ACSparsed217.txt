Same old, so ill keep it short...Plays and feels just like the others BUT less trailing there are some but they go fast this time, less cutscenes, less bugs or at least not game breaking ones, more fun, short extra WW1 content...and grapple hook.Nice graphics. Nice voice acting, i liked the dialogues, nice facial animation, nice fight animation, story is pretty good.Its a good one.
