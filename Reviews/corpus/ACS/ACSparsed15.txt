Ok, so I went into this game with abysmally low expectations, following the disaster that is Unity.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.  Turns out that this game is actually fantastic.  I wasnt sure what to think during the intro/very beginning, but it quickly becomes apparent that this game is improved from Unity in every possible facet yhe story is better, the characters are better, the freerun up/down system works much better, it runs better lol.The only real gripe I have with the game is, as typical of the other assassins creed/ubisoft games, the heinously overwhelming amount of t collectibles spammed throughout the world.  Its really, REALLY excessive, so if you go to 100 the game, be prepared to spend many hours collecting all of the stupid helix glitches and chests.  That being said, if you arent an OCD nutjob it isnt too big of a complaint.Seriously, dont let Unity deter you from this game its fantastic.  Its easiluy one of the best nonpirate games in the franchise since the second game.
