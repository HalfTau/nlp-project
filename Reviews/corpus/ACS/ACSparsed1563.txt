I bough and downloaded this game last night, tried to start it but it keeps getting stuck at the logo when loading up. Talking to support now, but the sheer fact that i have an hour and a half of game play and havnt even gotten to see the intro cut sceen has left a bad tast in my mouth about this whole purchase.  Worst part is that this game series is one of my favorite. I may rewrite thjis once i get a chance to actually play the game finially.
