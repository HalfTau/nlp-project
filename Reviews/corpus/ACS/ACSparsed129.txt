The story is great, the graphics are brilliant.... BUT!! The control system in this game completely destroys the game, I mean it breaks it completely for me. I havent been this infuriated and frustrated since I played Primal Rage on the SNES when I was like 12.Some examples would be, when your navigating a building face and want to climb up, dependant on the camera angle you will either jump sideways when you want to climb or you will scale down the building when you want to go sideways. Ive also noticed that if you want to go into a small gap where say your objective is with a wall either side of it, the character will snap to the top of the wall on either side, unless you walk slowly into it. Obviously when your hurrying its annoying. Ive also noticed a fair amount of bugs despite this game having been out for nearly 2 years now, NPCs falling through the floor on the train and spawning at wierd angles occassionally.As london is tightly packed in some areas, the character is constantly snapping to walls or jumping up onto things when you dont want them too. I couldnt possibly imagine what would happen if they set this game in modern day Tokyo, I think every blood vessel in my head would explode! !If your a die hard Assassins creed fan, fine stick it out, the story is good and I like the characters, theres lots of famous historical figures in this game also.I played assassins creed 1, 2, 3 and 4 and some of the add ons, I remember 4 being just as bad, but there was plenty of open area for the character to Faff around without causing to much rage. However I dont remember 1 2 and 3 being this bad although still not great.I was going to buy the other older assassins creeds Chronicles series etc Not a bloody chance in hell!!! I think the integrity of the blood vessels in my brain have been compromised enough!
