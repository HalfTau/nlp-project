Be very careful then buying this gameThe language support displayed on steam store page is straight incorrect!You can only get your language if you live in corresponding region  and theres no way you can know that youll get until you buy the game, and no way to change the regional limitation.I had to ask for refund for my copy, after both Ubisoft and Steam support refused to help me to change the locale language to my spoken language  and it took me 3 weeks of negotiating with support, with no result  both Ubisoft and Steam support showed no interest in helping me at all, they just waved me off.And they didnt even fixed the incorrect information on store page, while I explicitly pointed it to them.Ubisoft support, and Steam support  shame on you both, youre a huge disappointment.
