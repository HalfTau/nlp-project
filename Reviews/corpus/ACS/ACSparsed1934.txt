im happy for steam for the refund system. i cant last 5 minutes with out falling through the world and it crashing. and  it took 2 day for me to get a cd key. when i got the email telling me how to do it i was so happy. and i turn it on 5 minutes later my hair is being pulled out.i have most of the other creed games and i liked them and they worked. but tis one does not work.
