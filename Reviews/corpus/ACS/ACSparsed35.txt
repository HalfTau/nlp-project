The glitches and bugs are a complete moodkiller. Frequently enough the game would freeze and ctrlaltdel would be the workaround to get into the game again worst case 3x in a single minute. But the absolute moodkiller is Ive played every PCplayable assassins creed game so far, but this is the first time where a side mission resulted in an infinite loop of the following sequence your aggressor died and thus failreload the memoryyour aggressor died. It is impossible to load the menu, abort the mission, restart the game or try suggested solutions like alttab with Fullscreen settings. It is an issue that has existed since the game has launched and has not been solved for the pc version of the game. 32 hours and no ending... Last game I will ever purchase from them.
