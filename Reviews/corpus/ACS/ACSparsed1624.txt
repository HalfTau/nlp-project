This version is one of the best Assassins creed I played so far, together with Black Flag.The rope launcher is cool and the fact that you have 2 characters. The graphics are quite amazing, much better than in previous versions. You do get bored quickly after playing the game for 30 hours.Its an easy game but sometimes its repetitive. A few times the game crashed and I was on my windows desktop with the error message saying AC.exe has stopped workingI would give this game 8/10I would only recommend this game when youre fan of the Assassins Creed genre or when you like to play open world action adventure games.
