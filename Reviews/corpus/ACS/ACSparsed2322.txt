I am a big fan of this series. I have been playing since the begining. I feel that there have been a few games in the series that fell short and had me wanting more. My overall favorite was Assassins Creed 2.  So far Ive made it through the begining part of the game and unlocked a small portion of what is yet to come. And I can honestly say I am excited. This brings the feel of the original Assassins with a few new twists.  Also another nice thing about this game is the made it playable with a controller on PC, a big plus in my book. OH YEAH AND THOSE FRECKLES !!!! OMFnG
