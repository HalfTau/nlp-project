Didnt know it was possible for a PC version of a game to not be able to detect my keyboard and mouse and only work with a controller. Wouldnt be so bad if the controller actually worked with the game but the camera goes straight to the sky and spins in circles. Will try flight stick next.The control issues have been well known since launch from what I can read online and Im not sure why Ubisoft refuses to acknowledge that their dying game series has serious flaws that are putting it in even more of ahole.0/10 too aids for even Magic Johnson.
