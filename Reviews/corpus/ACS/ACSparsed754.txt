NOW, i dont usually write reviews, but this game deserves it. I think it looks great, plays great and has a very cool story and likeable characters. But this game is bugged out to hell, and since there has been no patch in at least a year, i can tell ubisoft doesnt care. I cant even get past certain missions. Not because they crash, but because the gang leader or main enemy dissapears and i cant even find them, and i have restarted each one with hopes of completion but nothing works. I even deleted a save to see if it was a one time thing but it isnt. No matter what i do if a gang leader or main target escapes, i cant do anything. If anyone knows the solution let me know, but for now i cant even play it anymore, because there is nothing to do.
