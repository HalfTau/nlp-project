Dont really care for this one. You play both male and female, and pretty much your forced to play both male, and female witch I dont like. I prefer to play just a male, but of course in this one you dont. The enviroment feels claustrophobic.I would recommend Black Flag over Syndicate. You only play male, and the enviroment doesnt feel claustrophobic.
