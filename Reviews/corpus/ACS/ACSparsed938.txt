i played the original Assassins Creed and this is def not a disapointment. free running in London is esp fun since i always thought of that city as a perfect place to do so. go there in real life,it just is my favorite part so far is the fact i can play a female assassin finally D it allows you to switch between the twins brosis but i def prefer playing as Evie though.
