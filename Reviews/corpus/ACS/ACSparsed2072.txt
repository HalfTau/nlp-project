There are some technical issues with the game crashing because of your settings and just freezeing for a second or two here or there. But its playable compared to Unity as long as you have a good PC. The story peaks before the end of the third act and the beginning is a tad long and boring. The game series still suffers from map mess and you spend more time playing the map rather than the game. I recommend to more or less focus on the main story since youre gonna be forced to do some side activies to progress the main story anyways. Youll rank up good enough without breaking a leg.The two main characters are likeable and works best togheter, however the rest of the cast is pretty weak, except for the main villain. The game truly shines during the last mission of every sequence when you get to assassinate your target in different ways. Trust me on this one, always gor for the unique kill, its by far the best one.The recreation of London is great and using the hookshot, or whatever you should call it, along with horse and carriage really speeds up the game a lot, in a good way. However Im now a little concerned that the next game will feel slow if they dont shrink the playable area, or give you likewise tools to get around. I do however hope that the move backwards in time in the next game.All in all its a good Assassins Creed game, something that I thought I was never gonna say after the disaster, also known as Unity. Id say its up in the top three games in the series along with AC2 and AC Black Flag, even though AC Black Flag is a very untraditional AC game, but nevertheless a solid one.I bought the game for 35 euro and played for about 2025 hours. Id say its worth the price if you like the series and a bit smaller open world games where you can focus more on the story than side activies.I recommed this game.
