This is my first ac games, and it has been quite impressive so far. Previously I am more inclined to almost limitless open world game Skyrim, fallout and less inclined to storybased rpg witcher and such. But the atmosphere of this particular ac has been so immersive that I feel like I am introduced to a new world! Gotta keep playing and see what this famous series leads me to!
