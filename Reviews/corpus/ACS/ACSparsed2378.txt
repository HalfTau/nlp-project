cant believe im saying this but its the first UBI game that actually is good optimized, aside from that PCSS frame rate killer option everything else works great and is an incredible stable game, usually with open world games you get the odds spots were the frame drops without explanation, this game is very stable all over the place in gameplay, cutscenes the frame tends to drop but not by much, about the game i have to say is awesome, after unity i didnt think i would get another AC game but after renting the ps4 version it convinced me that unity was just a fluke, so i decided to wait for this version and the wait was worth it, great job UBI, now please DO NOT SCREW UP THE DIVISION!
