Until now I DONT recommend this game. It has way too many bugs and glitches. Currently Im stucked inside a house because of the R item.. Some times the npcs AI just stops working. The enemy stop attacking you and you can do whatever you want until the mission is complete. Many times when I have my view to right right and want to move to the left it moves to the right. I took one npc as hostage in a mission. While hostage my char kept moving by itself away from the horse. When I want to move to the horse it keep blocking like there was a wall. The movement with E and SPACE suck so hard. The story is completeand so boring. Everything is way too easy. Im lv 2 and complete lv 5 missions.This game compared to assassins creed 1 or 2 is COMPLETE garbage. Dont waste 70euro on it. This game is worth 10 euro but not more.
