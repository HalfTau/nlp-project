Nice game, polished world, series fans should buyIm a AC sceptic. I dont like the old rehashed formulaic gameplay which oozed over to Far Cry and dont care much for the slapped on endless eden story which does not progress. Liked Black Flag for the novelty though.I also like Syndicate despite of me, details below.Now Syndicate features two likable mains, brother and sister which you can skill differently and equip with gear. You can usually switch them at will in free play.Gameplay with viewpoints and collectables and killing is still there and untouched. Production is AAA as usual with the ubi club and rewards and dlcs and timesavers to buy.You play in a pretty victorian London with all the expected sights like Big Ben. You meet Dickens and Bell and others, you ride horse carriages. There are pistols, cane swords, kukri and knuckles also disposables like darts.Activities include gang wars, brawling, carriage race, freeing kids from child labour, abduction and lots of murder.As a fan you will buy this anyway, as a heavy gamer you will probably also like this and it would be a good game for AC newcomers.As usual you need the UBI account and client to play the game plus online activation etc.
