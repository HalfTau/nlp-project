what I likethe hero and heroin are twin brother and sister and they are sooooooooo cute when they have little quarrels. the story lines are very clear though I dont think the story is reanoable enough. Gangs system facinates me most and it is really exhilarating and exciting to see two groups of men and women firing one another. The busy boats on the Thames are amazingly presented while do not affect the fluidity of the game.what I dislikethe change of the way you steal makes me very uncomfortable when I first played it less places to hide means when you only have few skills, it is really hard to keep low which usually means death.  the parkour is also changed.  Due to the different key mapping of running up and down, sometimes a dwarf wall which cant even reach the heros wrist may stop   your way, for running over it is consider as two actions, running up and running down, and you have to punch your keyboard really quickly to avoid being slowed down.A little bit flaws are not enough to conseal its greatness, so I recommand you and you wont regret.
