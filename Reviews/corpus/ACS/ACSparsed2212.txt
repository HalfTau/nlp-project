I dont understand why theres so many positive reviews, this game is broken, I cannot complete the game because failing 1 mission sends me back from sequence 8 to 6, due to a loading screen/savepoint bug and its not the first time its happened.So far, Ive tried to enjoy it, but the game breaking bugs are very, and I repeat very bad.Can Ubisoft please get their  together? Theyre a big company, this is unacceptable for a company of their status.This had some potential, and they blew it, I do not recommend buying this game, at all.
