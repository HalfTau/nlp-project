I retract my previous review.  After about an hour more of testing the game seems to be running smoothly.  Upon my first few minutes with the game everything seemed fine until I exited the factory in the beginning to the alley.  After I entered the alley way I was greeted to a slide show of 3 frames per second.  Prior I was doing no lower than 38fps inside the factory I was playing at 4K Ultra with no AA or Occ.  The game was also freezing as I entered and exited the pause menu.SpecsIntel i7 4790k  4.36ghzMSI 4G Gaming Edition GTX 970 in 2 way SLIRipjaws Trident X 16gb  2400mhzPlayed on a Samsung 1tb 850 EvoTests1st Test Disable SLI and drop down to 1080p Low, No AA, No Occ.

Syndicate seems almost reminiscent of the Ezio games.  I would recommend picking up this game if you are a fan of the previous Assassis Creed.
