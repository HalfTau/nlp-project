After an emotional installment in the series this game was light hearted and fun to play. The conquering of Burroughs is a good challenge to keep between the story. The levelling up of skills and the skill tree is a great addition to the game. The switching of character gave a fresh feel to the dynamics. Overall it was an immersive game though it lacks an emotional appeal. The game crashes very frequently Everytime a Burrough leader is defeated. Other than that the game Mechanics are wonderful.
