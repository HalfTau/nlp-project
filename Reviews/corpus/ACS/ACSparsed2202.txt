So much fun and helped me to learn more about history, from all the series that involved some historical event teached me more about history Help me get a better garde in Social Studies, not really lol. One time accidently walked in to the level 5 area and Im only level 3 and assassinated templar level 5 O.O , seriously just do the combo perfectly and you can beat anyone in the game lol, but if you get hit by an enemy that is 23 level higher than you, say goodbye to your life lol. And also, I nearly forgot to tell you that I test this game on core i3 laptop with nvidia gtx 660, I can run it perfectly fine, but experiencing some lags during the game. If you are true fan of this game and have low spec laptop like me, buy it if you can bare with the lags most of the time cutscene will lags if you are using low spec laptopwalking is already lag ., Im not recommended to plsy on a laptop that had lower spec than mine, woops forgot to tell that my ram is 12gb, hope you read all my comment first before you buy the game or you may regret of too much lags NOTE If your laptop is high spec just ignored what I said sentences ago. Hoped you enjoy the game. D waait... forgot to tell you that I play on new pc lol... nvm... D
