I was really excited to get this game. Even when it launched in a window and said that it was full screen, i was still happy. I found that the full screen mode was actually still in a window and that i could only use the full screen  borderless which ubisoft mention lower the performance to have it cover all my screen.The performance... i was happy to see that the video runned flowlessly at the beginning of the game. However, as soon as i started to play, i had a lots of laggs. Even with the lowest settings... but how come i can run fallout 4 smoothly and not this game? ?I stopped playing now. Wondering if i should ask a refund or wait for an update that will make the minimum specs actually playable.Also there is an insane amount of ingame purchase which worries me a lot in case i decide to keep playing...
