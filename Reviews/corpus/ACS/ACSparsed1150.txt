Potential SPOILERS.Im a simple person, Ive more or less enjoyed every AC game so far Yes, even Unity. However Syndicate still feels like a renewal of the series. The ability to switch between two persons with different playstyle i really liked, also their connection to each other througout the series. Loved the grapplin hook mechanic, i was worried it was gonna remove the all the enjoyable parkour since i would only use the hook, but i got lovely mixed up between both. Horse carriages are fun to ride, but hard as  when being chased, Grand Theft Assassin. The only lost points is the points who NO OTHER PERSON will say is lost I want more of the present day story.8/10, Jacobs top hat is so cute.SPOILER Finally a entry that ends with the begin of an relationship insted of the end of one. Also another reason for removing a point is that there was no extremely sad ending, and i love a game or movie that will make me cry.
