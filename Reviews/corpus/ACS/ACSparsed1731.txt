I really like the AC series since the first game, I almost played all of them except 1 or 2, but Syndicate is far the most brilliant Assassins Creed Ive ever played.19th century London is amazing, I can spend hours just walking around the city, searching for famous spots, or places I know from real life.Btw the game has so many new, awsome ideas implemented, compared to the previous episodes, that you wont be able to put it down for a while!I highly recommend u to buy!10/10
