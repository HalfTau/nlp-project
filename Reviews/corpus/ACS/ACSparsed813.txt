To start it off let me put it this way  I have played every single AC ever released, including some versions people didnt even know existed such as the one for the original PSP.Syndicate quite possibly has characters lovable enough to be compared to Ezio, even if not quite there. The story as far as I have got into the game seems fairly intriguing. The climbing actually works, especially when compared to the disaster that was unity.All in all if we only consider the game through gameplay, characters and story it is up there in the list, unfortunatelly all that experience is being heavily impacted by the rather lackluster optimisation of the game.To put it in perspective in order to actually be able to play the game decently with my ocd gtx 970 and i53570 Not the best, but more than enough for ultra on say witcher 3 I need to run the game in windowed mode It freezes like no tomorrow and stutters otherwise in addition to having to modify the priority from my task manager. Additionally I need to limit the game to 60 fps via third party software if I ever want to consider using a carriage otherwise it will freeze every five to six seconds.If you can implement these things yourself the game will run fairly well, however to many this might be a deal breaker. Do consider this before buying the game for yourself.
