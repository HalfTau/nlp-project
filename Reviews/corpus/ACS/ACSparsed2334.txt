probabily the best game series ever made. Id say that assassins creed 2, ezios stories, were much better tho. Still this was way better than Unity.Jacob and Evie Frye both have a great characters which makes the game fun.If you are assassins creed series fan, you gotta play this version.sucks for the rope action tho... cant use it to pull someone... could have been better. The cartge riding was also not very good. The skills they give you worth no shet.The gang was like a nerf version of assassins creed brotherhoods assassin training, but they are needed through out your missions somehow.9/10, and Id recommend this game to you
