Game doesnt get past the AC logo. No working solutions available. Great Game.Update After adding 70 gb on my windows partition and reinstalling the game there not because it is listed as a solution anywhere, but simply to try it, it finally runs.Still a downvote though.The parkour, which once was the great highlight feature when this series started had been reduced in importance over the last games, now with the introduction of the hookshot it is irrelevant. Where once one had to find a way up to viewpoints and through toombs, it is now done with a single button press. It really was the best part of the gameplay, now sorely missed.The male lead character is an unlikable, rude jerk.The story not really engaging, rather boring. The overarching background story that is being told has been told before, the current timeline story adds nothing overall.
