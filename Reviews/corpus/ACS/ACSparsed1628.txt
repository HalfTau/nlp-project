If you like assassins creed you will love this game. It is like a much better version of unity with a xp system an gear crfting and you start a gang so it is awesome. Also their are carriages so you have very carlike transport. And you meet queen victoria charles darwin and dickens and alexander graham bell. All in all I think it is the best assassins creed game money can buy. The charles dickens side missione are very interesting and go into the spirit world of things as was believed at that time.
