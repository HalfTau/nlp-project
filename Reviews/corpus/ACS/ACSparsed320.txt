At first instance, I started to enjoy the game and found the beginning to be interesting. The gameplay seemed fantastic and showed potential for a decent first experience of an assassins creed game. However, I experienced some bugs very early on such as the game crashing for no apparent reason. This brought me to the decision of refunding it, as I would not like to take my chances of playing over 2 hours and still experiencing this bug. I would recommend if no crashing occured. In addition, the fact that you need to sign into Uplay to play the game on steam is very frustrating.
