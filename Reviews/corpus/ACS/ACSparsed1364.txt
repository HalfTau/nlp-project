It ran ok, however the animations are way to long, to the point where you avoid fighting just because the animations are a drag. Avoiding fights is however impossible because the AI follows you like a train follows tracks.I posted an angry tweet to ubisoft about the gangof evy fry, that is not a spoiler, its how I describe my fighting experience in this game. A bunch of mad men running after you, chipping away at you till your inevitable demise, which , again, fighting and running, simply knowing that youre getting butchered, AWESOME.Why im actually posting thias review is because the game might have been worth it if it would run, but when I click continue story it crashes. So I cant tell you about the story, or about how it runs, because it doesnt anymore.
