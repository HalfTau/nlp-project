From my not so long experience i will only review the performance on my GTX970 and AMD FX8350.Game runs at constant 55 fps in main London, goes down to 50 and up to a solid 60 on many ocasions but that doesnt hit the game flow like it did in Unity, its better coded and feels better coded.The engine now runs nicely, there are a few graphical bugs around but nothing major, combat is quicker and clearer than in Unity, with a flow of battle that resembles a good Arkham game.Map feels quite alive and is very well depicted as usual, nothing unexpected from this franchise, and both characters have enough charisma to outshine Connor, Arno, and Altair. Jacob and Evie Frye are charming characters so far that sound and act much like a mix of Ezio and Edward.Will update once i finish, but i wont be asking for a refund, well played Ubisoft.
