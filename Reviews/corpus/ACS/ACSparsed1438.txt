If AMD i do not recommend.Thanks to Nvidea being in bed with these people here is another installment that runs like crap for AMD users for no reason other than branding.stuck being forced to run the game on medium settings, im a mid teir amd user, Radeon R9280X but im able to use High Majority with a nice Ultra mix a vast majority of my games. All AC games i own run poorly and need major tweeking from AC2Synd.Stuck on Medium Settings with 3040 fps. Thanks, Nvidea for your terrible business practice.
