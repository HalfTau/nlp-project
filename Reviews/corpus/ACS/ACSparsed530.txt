Im sure I will change my opinion just because I love Assassins creed. BUT atm this version just dosent feel like it came from the same creators but a team trying to put there unsuccessfully twist on a EPIC series. Yes it has alot of the same weapons, free running etc but as of this moment there is something missing or wrong and it just dosent feel like Assassins creed.Ill push fo ward and keep my fingers crossed it improves.
