Only other Assassins Creed games I have played are 2, and Brotherhood I lost interest until my dad commented on how much he LOVED blag flag and now that Syndicate was coming out we REALLY need to play it. So he gifted it to me as a early Christmas present and I finished it in less than 2 days. Loved it even more than the ones Ive played and there was the bonus of playing a girl which was nice for a female gamer like myself. Didnt know what happened to Desmond so at the moment I am watching videoes to see what I missed. I tried to play Revolations but the controls are a bit screwy to me so it turned me off of playing it but I want to know what happened. IF there is another Assassins creed game made I WILL PLAY IT!!! I want to know what happens next.
