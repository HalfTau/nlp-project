So far, of what I played, the game set my reso to 2k and everything set to high, it was a solid 5060 fps and never dipping below that, I set my reso to 1080p and pumped up the settings to ultra maxed out and it was solid at 5560 fps. So far so good, havent experienced any texture issues or fps issues so far though there is a bug where you go change your video settings reso or graphical settings and the game crashes, But other than that, so far so good. Also havent experienced any climbing or desecending bugs which Unity had plenty off. Waiting for Nvidia to release their drivers to hopefully fix some of the fps dips, I lose about 5 fps.
