GoodThe city is gorgeous and it feels more real and alive than Paris did in Unity. The main characters are well written and voiced, especially Evie. Unity felt like a tech demo, Syndicate does not. All in all, its a good AC game, just dont expect it to be totally different from what youve seen in the previous games.BadAs I said, the city is gorgeous. But copy pasted buildings it feels like. I experienced the first 2 hours as great. But now I felt like I wanted my 20 euros back. Its a great game. I experienced something wonderful the first 2 hours. But I just, feel like theres better titles for under 20 euros. Sorry ACS..
