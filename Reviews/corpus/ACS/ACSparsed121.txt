With about 20 hours into this game id personally say get any Asssassins Creed before blackflag, This is alright but not great it crashes after you complete simple tasks like taking a gang hideout after you finish it get the stupid repetitive cut scene that is the same everytime you take the same thing in that charcter,You will find yourself spamming a key for you not to dodge and have to restart, might just be me. But over all i would get again, just know you wont have the Good feeling that you enjoyed in other assassins creeds, you are limited to 1 melee weapon and then the normal berzerk darts, a gun and knives, its a really bummer not being able to swap to a knife mid fight. You only can change this weapon in the menu and not mid fight, you are limited to 3 weapons a Knife cane, One bigblade and Brass nukles in different skins but same animations and other weapons ETC,          Would get 35USD bundle again            6/10
