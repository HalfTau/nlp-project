Ubisoft has amazing art and world design teams, their vision of Victorian london is completely stunning at times and the city feels truly alive, the majority of the characters are really interesting, the main villain especially.Their gameplay team on the other hand, needs to be punished severely for the shoddy, repetitive, buggy missions that half way through, made me want to uninstall this otherwise fantastic game.
