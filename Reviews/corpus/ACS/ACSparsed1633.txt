You play Syndicate as Jacob and Evie Frye, a brothersister assassin team who are both wellwritten and skillfully voiced. Jacob, while predictably cocky and sarcastic is still funny and likable, and Evie, the more serious of the two, is herself prone to moments of charm and levity. Theyre also superbly animated. Its not often a facial expression in a game will elicit an intended laugh, but it did here more than once. I liked both characters a lot, especially in the scenes they shared with one another.The twins are often at odds with each other, too Jacob wants to loosen the stranglehold of the Blighter gang and kill Templars, and Evie wants to hunt for a Piece of Eden, a magical doohickey that grants eternal somethingorother. For most of the game, theyre basically interchangeable to play save for a few highlevel abilities they have identical skill trees. Only near the end of the game do they really begin to feel distinct. Jacob is more of a brawler, Evie more focused on stealth, and crafting or unlocking gear like sneakier outfits or deadlier weapons can complement their respective toolkits. You can switch between them whenever you want in the open world, while story missions can only be performed by one or the other. FINAL VERDICT  66
