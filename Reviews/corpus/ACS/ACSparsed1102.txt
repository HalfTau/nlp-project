Really going to be my last AC. I always disliked the antiChristian rhetoric pervasive throughout the series, but heard good things about the gameplay. The gameplay is still stuck about a decade back with the excruciatingly slow and unresponsive combat animations seriously, SoM figured it out, how can Ubisoft not take a page from their book. The story is still trash and whats worse the stability is absolutely atrocious. In about 9 hours I have had no less than 10 crashes. This is really unacceptable.
