I requested a refund 45 minutes inConsThe fight system feels too fast paced, like im playing Mortal KombatRuns terribly on i74790k  4GHz with GTX 980The storyline is absoulutly terrible from what I can tell so far, I have no idea who the Assassins are or how they got to be Master Assassins as theyre praised to be so early on in the game The environment feels so weird, no where to go, no real vantage points, the free running feels clunky and worse than Unity The graphics settings menu has been dumbed down tremendously, no customizationProsGraphics might be better than prevous gamesOverallGet Unity, Unitys storyline was captivating, fun and very enjoyable. The online system was fun but is pretty dead atm. The main character of Unity is what really makes that game, you start young and progress through your time as an Assassin, in Syndicate, youre thrown into two characters with no background at all. Unity was far more optimized than Syndicate. The leveling system and character customization is what made you your own Assassin, I cant stress this enough, try Unity before you get this game, you will enjoy Unity far more.
