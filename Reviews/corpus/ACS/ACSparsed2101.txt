A much better game than Unity not hard to do. The mechanics are a good mix of the best of Unity and Black Flag making the game feel more responsive and updated with the good stuff from Unity run down button thank you! while retaining a lot of what worked in Black Flag.Ive not played enough of the story yet to fully comment but 8 hours in and its so far compelling and gives a sense of purpose that was lacking from Unity.While Jacob is fun and has a good sense of smarthumor. Evie is the real star of the game. From her voice acting, to character design to her animations, she stands out among the lineage of Assassins. She looks very commanding when leading the gang and ordering them to attack, her stealth kills are great and her cane sword animations add finesse to counter Jacobs brute force tactics. Combined they are absolute stars. The interplay and the cheeky sibling rivalry chemistry is well done by the voice actors.London is just massive and epic in scale. Where Paris was big and cramped, Londons Modern feel is well designed, from the wide streets that look just on the cusp of beign populated with Model Ts to the tall buildings that dwarf even the tallest cathederal in previous games.All in all a good addition to the series and not at all dissapointing like Unity. If you are a fan of the series its worth the money. Here is hoping for more good characters like Evie and Jacob.
