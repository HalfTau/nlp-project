I love the characters, and the story is decent, but I just hate the actual gameplay so much I will likely never load this game up again. The controls are unintuitive and frequently unresponsive, with a character just plain refusing to follow your directions at the worst possible moment. Trying to be stealthy? Sorry, Evie/Jacob has now decided to stand on a ledge in full view of the enemy and refuses to move in any direction. Oh look, now youre dead. Again. Even towards the beginning of the game when you needed to climb out of a collapsed elevator shaft, I just plain could not get the controls to work I was eventually reduced to just hitting a bunch of keys at random, and somehow managed to get out after about 15 minutes of random flailing  and still have no idea what actually worked.And I really, really did try to like this game. I pushed through for a solid 9 hours in the desperate hope that it would get better, because as mentioned, Evie and Jacob are great, and I loved what I saw of their bantering. But the gameplay is just. that. HORRIBLE.
