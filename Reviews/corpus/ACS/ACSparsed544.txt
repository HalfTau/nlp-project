Assassins Creed Syndicate is a nice new fresh of breathe air in the AC games as its something actually decent compared to that last three games or so. It has a great story that keeps on the Assassins plot and adds a new and awesome combat style, biggest map yet, many side quests and several events to do as well. However the city is very bleak and ugly looking but maybe thats because its London lol, and the present day timeline is barely explored and seems to not be going anywhere. Although in the end besides with a few bugs the game is fun to play and adds great new stealth strategies to assassinating major targets.Great new combat systemSweet musicTwo characters that add different playstylesEquipment is more depthLeveling system is betterNo Multiplayer it allGreat unique characters that stick for the whole story or most of itGrappling hook is a unique changeReally cool historical characters that even have several questlines and arent a one time seeStorys ending really leaves a big cliffhanger to whats to happen nextAdds multiple opportunities to major targets helping you find interesting ways to kill them like HitmanEdward Kenways houseGang take overs are really funFight clubs are sweeetI felt that the major target cutscenes when they are talking to you when theyve been assassinated is weird with them standing up as if they arent dyingEnd boss fight had weird transitions and cutscenes and we just a repeated stab, thrown, stab, thrown, etc.Enemies detecting you through wallsMap is way too hugeTo many collectibles for such a little rewardRandom crowd events are uselessUbisoft still cant make characters hair look good in cutscenesPresent day stuff is very littleI like how you can take off your hood whenever but not when the character does it on their ownSeveral alerts in the inventory and crafting system are super hidden and or brokenCity is very ugly and colorlessMost of the DLCs are outfits or theyre poopy new quests that you can finish in an hour and most dont even work or even in the Season PassDont buy the Gold version it just adds boring new content and most of it doesnt work rightStill a lot of bugs, not as bad as Unity but still more than usualNo Steam achievements, and even with that most of the achievements are annoying Do 50 kills with this one time thing you  can only do in like 5 missons!Syndicate is a right direction for the series as the storyline and side activities are actually good this time around with sweet two new characters to play as with good personalities and perks. The game has such a wide variety of sidequests and activities that it almost adds several hours onto the main story and even has huge historical characters recurring like crazy. The game has its moments with great visuals but mainly develops on its sweet new fighting style that just makes you want to stop stealthing and purposely fight everyone. Although theres a lot of bugs still and the city is pretty ugly with too big of a map, useless collectibles, and meh DLCs its a good returning point for anyone who quit playing after Revelations or perhaps for someone starting this as their first AC, Id definitely say start with the Ezio collection then go here and decide if anything in between is worth it.
