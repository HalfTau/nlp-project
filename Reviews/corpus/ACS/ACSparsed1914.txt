This game seems pleasantly optimized for PC as opposed to recent predecessors in the AC series! I would strongly recommend this game. The combat feels good  I can only describe the game as walking around in Thomas Shelbys shoes from Peaky Blinders on Netflix mixed with a hint of Spiderman. The hairwork looks a bit lacking, especially compared to The Witcher 3... But other visual aspects of the game look great! I honestly, hate the whole buy it on Steam then activate it through Ubisoft! I didnt realize I had to do that for the DLC as well and sat there wondering why my extra content wasnt working despite Steam telling me that it was installed and paid for!There have been plenty of moments of hilarity where Ill be walking down the street and all of a sudden a horse  carriage will randomly start spiraling/spinning/clipping out of control destroying everything and everyone in the streets in a terrifying whirlwind. Those would be the acceptable times for the game to bug out in my opinion. In the unacceptable times, Ive had game quests literally break on me. Forcing me to restart from a check point or even canning the quest and restarting the game. The idea behind having basically two skill trees to play with in Evie and Jacob is nice.. But all in all it is a mute point. Because leveling is extremely easy to do in the game and each tree doesnt have unique enough options in my opinion to even really be of much value by the time you hit level 10.ProsGraphics Story Atmosphere ConsQuest Bugs Movement Bugs Steam/Ubisoft Integration Overall8/10
