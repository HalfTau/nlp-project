Yay, an AssCreed game you can play as a woman, despite how hard it is to animate her. Boo, sequences that require you to play as her idiot brother.You win some, you lose some.The game brings a lot of quality of life perks to the Creed franchise that have kinda been around but not excessively. Restocking tools has been a thing since the first game, however weapon variety dwindled for a while until games pretty much had you just use one thing consistently and nothing else. This gives you a little variety, and some enemies are actually more complicated than counter counter counter finish. Not all. Some. Travel options like the ascending grappling hook lets you scale tall buildings rapidly, as well as traverse peaks of rooftops as it doubles as a deployable zipline. Its STUPID useful. Basically, if you have buildings, your Spidey Sense  grappling hook lets you set up the kill however you need to. Having a roaming base is also nice, and it generates revenue for you with a cap while you are in game and not in a menu. Slightly annoying, not immersion breaking. Some of the missions are interesting and require a different take on traditional Creed nonsense... but they do get repetitive. I love the fight club missions. Nothing like some old London underground ring fighting where you hear noses crack and jaws break. Gross, but kinda fun.ProsIts an Assassins Creed game. Its just like all the others and while it brings some quality of life improvements, the story is blah and the gameplay is almost identical to every other Assassins Creed game. If you enjoy all of those, you will probably enjoy this.Evie is a badass.ConsIts an Assassins Creed game. Its just like all the others and while it brings some quality of life improvements, the story is blah and the gameplay is almost identical to every other Assassins Creed game. If you didnt enjoy any of those, you will probably not enjoy this. Probably. One of the two protagonists is Evie, and she is a badass.
