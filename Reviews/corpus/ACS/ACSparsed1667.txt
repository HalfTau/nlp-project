After the how that was Unity, I was very wary of Syndicate. Picked it up on sale and was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.It reminded me hugely of the Ezio trilogy, arguably the best Assassins Creed games. The world feels perfect to travel across, the player characters are likable with each of them having their own goal for the creed.The level up system is far better than the terrible idea in Unity where you must play through the missions and reach certain sequences before you could even get basic Assassin abilities. You can level up in any way in this game, unlock loads of brilliant abilities. Likewise with upgrading your gang The Rooks and your gear.98 in the main game enough for me, not bothered about 100 and 100 in the Jack the Ripper DLC which was absolutely bloody fantastic, albeit very dark no complaints, worked incredibly well.Like the older AC games, especially the Ezio trilogy? Burnt by the recent ones? Give this one a go, definitely great fun and a return to what AC should be.
