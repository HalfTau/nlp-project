Overall a decent game, but there are still a lot of issuesStory like in most of the recent AC titels, the story is more or less unimportaint und boring. You also dont play in todays time at all. That precourser story also continues in baby steps. I dont know how many titels it will take to appear in full glory shooting with lasers down to templars and assassins and laughing like a maniac. I hope Ubisoft changes their cashcow strategie and delivers a nice forward pushing AC in the future.Grafic issues Now the AC series is known for its difficulties with grafics and i have to add, that there are not as much problems as there were in Unity. But after several games and after one year after the release there shouldnt be any troubles according that. But beside that, the grafics are absolutely gorgeous. Wonderful face capture of the actors looks realy nice.Stability Frame drops are always a topic if you play AC, if I can run BF1 with 90 to 120 FPS stable all Ultra and AC runs at 50 FPS, I guess its not only my systems fault. Also it crashes from time to time. Especially after a mission better there that during. But its anoying af.TLDR Average Story, nice grafics but some difficulties, sucks your system like a professional porn star. If youre a AC fan buy it with a discount or when its on sale, I dont think its worth its full price. For me the best AC titel are 1, 2 and Brotherhood.
