Overall I find the game is kinda fun. Its new, of course, and Im sure itll wear off. I will say though, that some of the C missions, Dickens, Darwin memories are ridiculously  stupid! A total waste of time. I cant believe that they were even considered  let alone published with the game. So for you purists  out there that have to complete the game in its entirety to reach 100 sync. be forewarned of some really dumb content. And I mean DUMB!
