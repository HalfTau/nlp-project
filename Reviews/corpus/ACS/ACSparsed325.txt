This game has state of the art graphics, but still i refunded  it, its really boring since its the same game and same missions like in any other AC games, there is no development in game mechanics, no better combat slash buttons and drink coffee aside, its very linear and there is no difficulty, feels like grinding from the start. Walking simulator... which is really looking nice.
