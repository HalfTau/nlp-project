Well Assassins Creed never disappoints. Another great instalment in their epic franchise. The fighting style and techniques are even better. Stealth is just as crucial as the last game. Theyve brought great language and dialect and you get a sense of great research efforts with the featuring of Charles Dickens. Evie and Jacob bring typical British sarcasm and sibling love. 10/10
