The game was really good. The graphics were great and the story and gameplay pulled you in. The game was pfair bit buggy but as is all Assassins Creed games. At the point of writing this review I have 81 of the entire game completed including collectibles. For some people, I can see the game getting repetitive, but its a good mix of challenge and ease, in which it allowed me to easily enjoy the game, but by like 75 way through the story if not a bit before, it became extremely easy due to all the upgrades as I went around doing all the collectibles and such. This is not like the classic Assassins Creed games in the sense that there are a lot of new mechanics that werent in the previous games such as horsedrawn carriages and the zipline. I do miss being able to sail a ship from previous games but nonetheless the game was enjoyable.
