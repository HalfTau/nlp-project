This game is horrible. Full of so many bugs it isnt even funny anymore like yeah the first one was, and you get around it by killing the boss before you get to the train bridge where it freezes. But after that its all down hill. Dont waste your money on it because Ubisoft doesnt seem to care enough to make the right patches to fix / make sure to put out a quality game before releasing.Lets face it, Black flag was like the golden era and everything after has just been the down fall. I got so annoyed with the game I reinstalled counter strike  instead which I was surprised to see people still play.Here is the break down.Plot semi ok, but then again I didnt get very far in the game due to bugs so I cant fully give a yay or nay.Graphics graphics are good but only if you love lag. They didnt design the game right and it loads too much as you ride so it slows down. Also something is seriously buggy in the cut scenes.Combat Good combo moves and not a game where you can just run all over killing everyone. Some foes are harder to beat at an early level.Reward system Similar to other AC where you level up as game goes on. Rewards are good and give you specials which is cool for each twin.over all rating 2 out of 5 stars the extra star is for finally having a female lead character other than that silly side Chinese game.
