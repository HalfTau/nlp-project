TLDR Beat up English s on a beautifully crafted London as gorgeous Evie Frye!NVidia 960M, Medium graphics, probably gonna risk High tomorrow. No FPS drops, fluid 60 FPS. I have not played Unity nor Rogue yet, but this is the game AC fans have been waiting for on PC. Stunning visuals and then again, Im on medium, London is H U G E and quite accurate with the layout.Hookshoot is a really cool, new mechanic. You can zipline through London real quick and enjoy the views. Train hideout is genious, serves better as a Fast Travel point most of the time. Combat it good, combat rings are great, liberation mission though Bounty Hunter missions are the least enjoyable for me are well thought, not very easy, but not frustratingly hard to get all constraints.Still on sequence 4 so not much I can tell you about the story, plus I lack Unity and perhaps Rogue background on the PresentDay storyline to completely grasp it. Charle sDickens and Darwins missions and story are fun and entertaining. Cant wait for Jack the Ripper DLC and idk when you play The Last Maharajah. Outfits are cool, plus have perks depending on which previous assassin or assassinette ? you choose.Plus Evie Frye is gorgeous. 11/10 Would fantasies with Evie being my grilfriend again, anytime.
