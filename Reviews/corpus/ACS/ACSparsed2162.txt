The game itself is fun, and a definite improvement over Unity in many ways  with the exception of some facial animations and lighting. The game itself runs fine I get around 40  60 FPS in the open world with no stuttering on the high preset on an R9 280X, which is decent could be better mind you, but Ive played worse. There are some drawbacks, however graphics settings are pretty limited e.g. no anisotropic filtering, antialiasing is limited to nasty FXAA and MSAA combinations, cant turn off any of the postprocess stuff, special/Gameworks graphics settings are nearly broken on Radeon and apparently some Nvidia cards and some cloth physics are limited to 30 FPS, which sounds anal as hell but youll know exactly what I mean when you play it. But, overall, this is a solid port.
