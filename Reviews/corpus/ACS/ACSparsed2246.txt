ACS is a huge improvment over the previous Assassin Creed games. It fixes many of the bugs of the last ones and London, which has been recreated, looks amazing and is a joy to explore. The gameplay is fun and exciting the new grappling hook makes getting around London so much fun. The new characters are great Jacob and Evie are my faviortite assassins since Ezio and there voice acting brings them to life so well. And with the large amount of content you get your moneys worth espically if you are a completionist like me. Despite all the great things this game brings to the table it has its issues, one of the main things being that it changes NOTHING in the AC formula. This game is almost exactly the same as all the previous AC games and that is really disappointing the age old issues still appear here as well the wall climbing is not fixed meaning there are times when jacob/Evie make a movment wrong and get caught or killed and this is extremly anoying, also the world content is very much the same thing over and over I have also heard they ruin the end but I am not there yet. Overall this game is great despite all its flaws and is well worth getting!
