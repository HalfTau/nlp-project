This game is not as bad as people are saying. In fact it is great so far for me. First off, I have an i54690k processor with GTX 970 2way SLI. I run the game at Very High preset with my fps rarely dropping below 60 80  90 fps most of the time.ProsGame runs smooth most of the timePlaying both Jacob and Evie makes it not boring. Having 2 characters that could have different playstyles early on is a plusBigger map than Unity. So much stuff to do!Rope launcher makes it easier to climb buildingsConsCrashes sometimes Ive only crashed twice in my 16 hours of gameplayThe cloak is definitely locked at a lower fps. Not a huge issue but it would be nice to have it smooth as wellCombat gets really repetitive after a whileAll in all, Im glad that I bought AC Syndicate. I heard there was a patch for consoles lately, hopefully PC gets one too.
