Not an amazing chapter in the AC franchise.  In fact, Im sure that Ubisoft is seeing constantly diminishing sales  in the AC series and that is why there isnt a game in 2016.  Ubi is probably reevaluating the series to see how they can increase that bottom line.  Anyway onto the gameThis is the first AC game I could not finish.  After 9 hours I just didnt care about the characters, Evie and Jacob, nor the npcs that you run into.  Everyone was just so boring and stock.  Your base is on a train, which is fine. But navigating the train can be a trial in itself sometimes as your toon wont jump from train car to train car if the animations dont line up perfectly.The horse and buggy animations ruin this game.  They litter the streets and are horrific to control.  In fact, the wagon cars were the main reason I couldnt stand the game.  In some missions, you are escorting npcs and random enemies will spawn in their horse carts and start attacking you.  These sequences are VERY frustrating.  It just becomes a cluster  on who you can attack while driving.Perfomrance is all over the place on my rig.  Im running an AMD 6350 with nvidia 970 and 16 gigs of RAM.  I can run the game on high.  Although after 5 minutes or so, the performance starts to fluctuate between 70 and sub 30 fps for no reason. Ill literally be standing in place and the fps fluctuates that badly.  This h appens with the Division as well, another ubi game.  Its probably my rig, but lowering the settings to low AND going to 720p has the same issue, so lowering the settings does nothing.In conclusion, I found Unity to be more playable then this garbage.  Luckily I got it for cheap off of steam so I dont feel too bad about my purchase.  LIke I said above,this was the first AC game I couldnt finish and Ive played them all.
