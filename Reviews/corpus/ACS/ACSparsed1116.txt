Ill be honest, I usualy not a big fan of the Assasins Creed series, but this one cought my attantion.Flowing and simple gameplay, a rather Variety set of missions, nice story and good balaced with the fray twins, one for stelth and one for frontal fights. I also liked the leveling system, not too hard but do make you work for your progress and the gang side is a good add, though maybe there was room for more in this aspect.I do admit that I incountered some technical issue during the game, but nothing that ruin the gaming expirience.
