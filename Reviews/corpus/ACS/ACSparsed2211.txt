After playing up to Sequence 7 Driving Mrs. Disraeli Mission I was enjoying the game, even with the little glitches here and there. I was ready to make a recommendation to this game even, but then....came Driving Mrs. Disraeli Mission. Game Breaking issue. Once I complete the mission the game goes to black loading screen and freezes. I can not even cancel the quest to do others while waiting for developers to fix this. Therefore I am unable to play the game I paid 60.00 to play. I can not recommend this game at all. Not even on discount with such a game breaking bug.
