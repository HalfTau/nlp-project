I know I only have a few hours, but its enough to give it a brief review.Assassins Creed Syndicate is a good recovery from the failure of a gameAssassins Creed Unity. The mechanics felt on par with where the saga actually left offAC4, with the combat feeling smooth and mostly complete. A few setbacks I noticed from AC4 were the throwing knives and quickshot with the pistol.As for the optimization, its pretty good but it could be better. Personally my FPS is all over the place, I go anywhere from 60 to 40 depending on where I am in the game. Ive come to the conclusion that this game is very demanding in terms of VRAM rather than CPU intensive like other Ubisoft games.From what I have played so far, I like the game. The story is fun but the setting 19th century London is my least favorite of the series, the game would be much better if the time period was different. I feel that the series cant really go past the 18th century without it becoming too modern for the AC series, technology advanced way too much in the 19th century for The Assassins to stay on top of the pecking order.
