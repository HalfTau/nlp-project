Honestly not the best one of the series, but not the worst. I think the real star of the game was the setting of London itself. The story wasnt anything to write home about, but I loved the gang territory aspect. Reminded me of San Adreas that way. Its not a bad game by any means, but it really didnt do anything too different from the previous few games that will have a long lasting impression on me. I still think one of the best features of an AC game that Ill always remember fondly was the Brotherhood feature where you could train your fellow Assassins and call them for help in any situation.Sidenote Also I was angry that Ubisoft forced me to do missions for Karl Marx. Like...I dont wanna help this guy at all. I should be able to choose if I want to help his cause or harm his cause. Every single mission I did for him, I attempted to shoot him in the face. Thankfully in the end when you finish all his missions, you can finally cap him in the head. Worth it.
