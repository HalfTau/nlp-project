Great game but theres so many issues with lag, fps drops and crashes that have no fixes.Very disappointed and Ive tried to hard to keep playing but its getting so bad I just dont want to play anymore!Weird issues usually happen when driving a carriage but also on the train and when using eagle vision.Game play pauses for a few seconds so often I feel like Im playing a slide show game.My computer is pretty good too. I can play other games with ultra graphics, e.g overwatch, dishonoured 2 with no issued.Please for the love of God someone fix it...if it can run on xbox one it should run perfectly on my pc!
