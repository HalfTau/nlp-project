I love it!!! Some parts seem a little buggy, but they are minimal compared to the bugs in Unity. The story is good imo, and you get more options of combat with the two assassins. The only big difference is that the storyline is less personal compared to the plot of the previous AC games, but its still good I never liked Ezio anyway. 3
