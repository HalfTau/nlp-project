Highly disappointing! I requested a refund and died a little inside.PLEASE Ubi, Make me love an Assassin like I loved Ezio!I love Assassins Creed! I own a lot of them, I even have a large AC symbol in my man cave. lol. I dont even mind Uplay, but this game was sadly very disappointing at every turn. As I unlocked things in the game my first reaction was, oh sweet that seems cool. But in reality it ruined my experience. The worst of all was the grappling hook. Again, thought it would be awesome... JC3 am I right... it was not. Being a fan of  feeling like an assassin, this took a lot away from the enjoyment. I want to climb and race over rooftops not slow zip and shimmy my way about. The leveling system and skill trees seemed to take up more time deciding what to use points on than being cool and useful. The combat did not seem great either so many enemies shooting at me and a majority of the time counter would not work not that I would die, like enemy goes to attack, I push counter, enemy decides not to attack anymore. Wut?!? The twins, again, sounded cool and was for an hour then it wasnt I want to be an amazing assassin like Ezio, although I dont think any assassin will be as bad as Conner always bein a whiny b. There is more I could say but basically if you like the greats like AC, AC 2, Brotherhood, Black Flag, and Rouge, give this one a skip or it will make you cry.
