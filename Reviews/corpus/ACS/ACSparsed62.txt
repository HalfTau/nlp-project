A fun game, Librating London all over Templars gang was fun, Combat is different from any other previous assassins creed game. Twins Character Mr/Mis Frye, I loved them both  as they carry unique skills. There is also a DLC, which further increase our game play timing. Graphics are Nice, Game sometime for me just closing automatically dont know why. Must buy during specially on sale. Now next, Origins xD
