What you would expect from an assassins creed game. IMO this is right behind AC2 and Black Flag as the best in the series. Some new minor elements have been added that are nice, such as switching between charaters and the grapling hook. I have enjoyed it so far. It plays similar to the style of AC2. As is typical with Ubisoft there are minor nuances that can become annoying such as occassional crashing, wonky mechanics, and characters spazing out. I have also noticed that the character costumes move at a slower frame rate than the environment when playing at 50ish  fps, it can be distracting. All in all I think this is a grreat game with beautiful visuals and plenty of content. If you can get past the minor nuances which are not really detremental to the gameplay and you like the gameplay of AC2 this is deffinitley worth the 2040 price tag.
