If youre an Assassins Creed fan, then youll like the game probably.Ill give this a positive review, but I believe it will be the last game I bought.Great characters and interesting Templar adversaries. The DLC Jack the Ripper was good as well, giving a fresh perspective.But, the engine, premise and the atypical Assassins Creed style has really outlived its interest for me now. Its just not improving much at all since Assassins Creed 2 with each installment placing failing to really push forwards the continued playability of the game after the main quest and areas are captured. I was relieved when the game finished, really. It was getting boring, like most of the other games before it.In short, if you love the series, youll love the game. I give it a thumbs up, but glad to ending my fling this weary, repetative franchise.
