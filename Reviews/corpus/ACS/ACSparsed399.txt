This game absolutely blew me away. I had heard stuff about this game Most of it being backlash from Unity that just happened to make its way here and when I finally got my new PC a few days ago and loaded it up, I instantly fell in love with it. Now the modern day story parts Im completely lost as Ive only played the very beginning of 3, Black Flag, and Syndicate. But the setting of victorian london instantly hooked me! Its an absolutely georgous game and I cant get enough of it!PROS Fun Main Characters Amazing Setting Grappling hook is an amazing addition and takes stealth to a whole new level! The villian feels real! Graphics are so good and the game runs amazingly! The missions all feel fluid and I love that each sibling has their own mission line! The map is huge but full of stuff to do and see!These are just a fewCONS The side missions that you need to capture different parts of London are very forgettable. The A.I. is well... its not awful but not amazing either. The plot is kinda weird where in the real life segments its one person controlling 2 characters in history? Idk I havent finished it yet so maybe they explain it. The wagon driving is probably the glitchest part. Not like youll get flung across the map glitchy, more so the animation will bug out and the driving is kinda janky.I cant think of anything elseOverall Id easily give this game an 8/10 and I highly recommend it to any stealth games fan, Assassins Creed fan, or hey even shooter fan if you play Jacob!
