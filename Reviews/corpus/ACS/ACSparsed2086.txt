I decided to give this one a shot since its one of the most modern assassins creed stories up to date. And I was allured by the idea of using a gang to dominate londons streets.After AC3, which left me with a disappointment so big that I skipped on buying Black Flag, which in turn ended being one of my favourite assassins creeds after I decided to play it in my brothers account. I deeply regret this, because the theme of pirates and plunder turned out to give Kenway a much better story than his grandson.This one caught me by surprise, from the start they throw you into one of the missions of jacob and evie, working for the creed. A clever way to present how the Frye twins charge at their problems and to give you a glimpse of their personality. Jacob is a clever bloke cocky, and headstrong who wants to bring london back to the hands of the assassins even if they have to become a gang itself, not that worried about the creed, but more focused on destroying the opposition, Jacob ends up giving a lot of trouble to the templars.Meanwhile Evie is a more collected but far from calm dutiful assassin, who wants to follow up on the lead that her father had on the Shroud of Eden, an artifact recovered by Edward Kenway and hidden in London making the story feel like a follow up to Black Flags, which just makes it even more enjoyable.The enemies this time arent as strong as their leader, which appears with every few assassinations to remind you how much of a evil gentleman he is, giving you a small glimpse of the templar side from time to time. Some of the templars arent as memorable as in other games, but one of the best things about this game is that every templar that you must kill comes with a set of tools that you can follow to kill him in a cool way, or do it yourself, making it feel like how the hitman games gave you alternatives to enter and assassinate your target.What this game lacks a bit is more important support characters for the Twins, theres no la volpe or the courtesans, or even the thieves from venice in AC2, and theres no manager of the gang, the rooks, which made the rooks seem more like a helping hand for you rather than something to get sad or invested in when they die during a mission.But lets talk about mechanics a bit. This game adds carriages and the hookshot as I like to call it, that give you a different way to maneuver around. The carriages allow you to stay on top of them while a rook from your team drives for you, letting you fight your enemies or even jump to their carriage, kick them out and steal theirs, all of this seamlessly! its an amazing work for sure. Back to the to hook, you can use it to easily reach other buildings in a faster way, giving you an alternative to just going through the building, and making it much easier to travel not only vertically, but between buildings, giving the tools to go from the river thames all the way to the top of the big ben in a much easier and quicker fashion. its so enjoyable to just waltz around with these that youll probably catch yourself strolling around london looking for more secrets rather than making the templar assassinations.tldrGood Protagonists that actually make strong impacts in LondonLovely craftmanship of London and its Victorian Era of innovations and advancements.Fight on top of carriages seamlessly and hijack the opponents carriage while you move away from the police!Great maneuverability vertically and horizontally between the gothic architecture of the Victorian Era using the Grappling Hook.A Moving Train Base with all your accomplishments decorating the walls!An enjoyable story with references to the best past AC Games.AMAZING Soundtrack full of violins packed with that london feel!Lack of support characters related to your gang, making you not worry what happens to your gang when you use them in combatVillains dont come around that often to give you that needed edge against the templars.They still talk about the animus and the not so interesting story of shaun and rebecca, but just with videos, making it much better than having to play with desmond like in previous installments.Overall I had a blast with this game, The soundtrack is packed with accordeons and violins, that add a certain sherlockesque, that just nails the london feel so well. Fighting is really enjoyable and rather than just being a prince of persia esque fight like in the early ac games, its focused on combos and killstreaks from punching people in the face, I strongly recommend you to play it if you were a fan of the series and wants a throwback to those good times of ezio, they made the right choice on not doing a multiplayer, letting them focus on adding more content to the main game.
