This is by far my second favourite Assassins Creed, after Assassins Creed II. Ubisoft came back to reality and to the roots of their most famous last generation videogame saga with this title, REMOVING MULTIPLAYER / COOP, giving us a thrilling plot set in the Victorian London near the end of 1800, two charismatic characters that are twins and both of them gave me the same feeling I felt when I was playing as Ezio Auditore the first time.I recommend this game to every fan who still believes theres hope for the Assassins Creed saga, cause the first stepping stone for Ubisoft for their redemption is this game, Assassins Creed Syndicate.
