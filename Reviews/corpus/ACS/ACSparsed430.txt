The best thing about this game is the rooftop parkour, which is super fun. As far as I got there are only two player characters to choose from, the sister and the brother. Which is cool, unless you desire to play one of the other exclusivly since the story forces you at certain points to play one or the other whether you desire to or not. And that brings us to the storyline.... I know what you are going to say, its AC, we want to be Murder Hoboes, so who cares about the story. Well I do, and I imagine others might as well. So, for those whom care, its.... it is truely attrocious. Not to the point that I find it painfull there have been some, but all I have to say is dont play this game for the story. Two final things, this game does not like Radeon video cards at all, and while the parkour movement is phenominal, the going down and getting off of buildings is a bit clunky and less then intuitive. Of course you can get down by assassinating others, so do that. .
