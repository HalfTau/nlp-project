Syndicate has no perfomance issues and contains no gamebreaking bugs. A big step forward after disaster of 2014 called Assassins Creed UnityDesigners did their best in recreating London of Victorian Era. City is looking quite alive and historically accurate. And this magnificent views from sync pointsConcept of two characters is a fresh idea for the franchise. Moreover Evie and Jacob are one of the most interesting characters in the series since Ezio and Haytham. Now take a look at the dull and cliched character of ArnoNew fight mechanic removes big swords and axes and adding a fast and light weaponry. Combat itself is looking more impressive and playing much faster nowComfortable shooting mechanic. In Unity I can barely hit someting with pistols with such clunky controls. And here shooting mechanics is nice and easyGrapling hook is a blast! Since the buildings are much bigger now, devs added a mean to reach the top of it much fasterAssassinate missions are designed in Hitman style. You need to plan your assassination and there are multiple ways to complete your task. I am so glad devs actually returning to the concept of the AC1A lot of working RPG elements. Syndicate has working and balanced levelling system. Compare it to the grind disaster in UnityMusic. Austin Wintory did a great job on Syndicate soundtrack. It fits the game perfectlyPlot is WEAK. Yes, there is a lot of wellwritten characters here. Look at Frye twins for example. But the story itself feels dull and stupid. Character motivations is unclear and there are a lot of weak spots in this plot. And modern storyline is patheticMissions are WEAK. Dont get me wrong. They are well done in design terms. But they so dull and unrealistic. Sometimes they just break the whole immersion in the game worldGraphics looks downgraded after Unity. But I guess this is a part of optimizationIf you still feel dissapointed in Assassins Creed franchise after Unity release, try Syndicate. Of course it is still a pretty standart AC game, nothing unusual. But it is pretty solid though.
