The game told me my Graphics card with 2GB vram could only handle low settings. I put them to high and its still running with 60 FPS so try it out even if it tells you otherwise!!The game is the best assassins creed game in quite a while and altough it took some getting used to since I didnt play Unity its a really good game with likeable characters and a beautiful city!
