I dont know how people play this. For me, it worked fine for the first 50 minutes then it all goes wrong, especally in the train. Now, my game crashes everytime I try to load into the game.  I tried every solution, and none worked. 6 hours of game time, but actully 50 minutes of gameplay. The rest 5 hours and 10 mintues just me trying to fix the game. Once again, disappointed.Buy when there is a patch to fix the crashes.Good luck!
