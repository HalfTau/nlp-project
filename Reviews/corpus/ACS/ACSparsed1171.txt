This game is the ultimate timekiller, and while glitchy at times, Ive thoroughly enjoyed it. The Frye twins are one of my favorite pairs of main characters, each with their own playstyle and interesting story. While some weird physics and visual glitches have occured, nothing fully ruins the experience nad the story is rich, full of actual victorian historical figures all would know by name. Defintiely my favorite purchase during the Steam Summer Sale, and in my top 10 games overall.
