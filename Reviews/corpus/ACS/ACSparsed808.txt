Ill make this quick, Ive been playing Assassins Creed since Ubis first release and Altair reforged the Assassins Order.Assassins Creed Syndicate is an incredible addition to the AC franchise. The fun factor is incredible and is by the far the best addition since AC3 and the end of the Desmond arc. If you played any of the AC games for the depth and immense storyline, you will not be disappointed while locating your piece of Eden through the memories as Evie Frye you also play as Evies twin brother, Jacob, who has memories more so based on taking over London from the Templars his own way. Ubi has also added carriages which gives memories and open world feel more of a GTA feel being able to pick up to 5 gang members or Rooks at a time to assist you on missions or your takeover of the corrupted world map.I am longing for more to the story from the new title in 2017 and cannot wait to see the movie.
