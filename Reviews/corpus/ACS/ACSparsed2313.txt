Quick and simple  great game, runs well, a lot to do, interesting characters, looks good, combat is better than Unity but my BIGGEST gripe is that you cant have your hood up when youre walking. Its only available in sneak mode which is utter rubbish. One of the main staples of this damn series is the hood, it was even said with regards to the film  very annoyed about that. Oh and the fact that cloth physics run at 30fps when the game runs at 60fps...but mainly the damn hood!
