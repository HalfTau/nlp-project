Do not buy this game for you PC or LT, it will not run, and if you can get it to work, it will always be laggy, clip, and crash when it wants to.  If you really want this game , go get the Playstaion version.This is a vista port to PC, only God him self can make a PC to run it one, and it would still crash !This game came out 6 months ago and still does not work on PCs
