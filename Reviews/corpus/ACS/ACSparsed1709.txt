An utter disappointment.  AC Syndicate is full of gamebreaking crash to desktop glitches, bugs, errors, whatever you want to call them.  Some have workarounds, but Im pretty sure if you bought a car and one of the wheels fell off, you wouldnt be interested in how you could tape on a barrel and have it be almost as good.  The story is horrible and clearly a kneejerk reaction to the issues over ACUnity and cries for we want assassins with t itties!.  It brings out all the tropes... crossdressers, women who were secretly super powerful, but  you know  just completely absent from any kind of recorded history, even foreigners who otherwise went by completely anglicanized names  personae.  The new hey, the whole ancestor thing is just blood samples now! like Nintendo game cartridges! is garbage, and the constant backandforth between two distinct siblings who, naturally, have a hardline split between which abilities they can use is just stupid.  Oh, and did I mention they level up SEPARATELY?  Because if theres one thing I wanted from the next AC game, it was to have to split my time leveling / gearing two separate characters just so Id keep progressing.  You know, when the game wasnt crashing because I dared use fast travel, or completed a main sequence.  Id say wait until they fix these issues, but frankly theres no sign they ever will.  I guess like FarCry, they just decided theyd go ahead and plough all of their successful IPs right into the freaking ground.
