Stunning graphics, great combat and item system similar to the batman franchise. The story moves a little slow but is quite decent and there is a lot to do and see. Great character customization and I like having two characters. I love Assassins Creed, but the last few have been sub par,  but not this one. Also dont forget to pick up the two free customs!
