God damn, the story of this AC was really bad. Nothing makes sense.Its basically about two Assassins that for some reason decide not to listen to the Order. Apparently the Order doesnt care, because they never get mentioned.These two Assassins start literally terrorizing the city of London, making gangs and breeding gang wars. Both do  ups all the time and their actions dont make sense. Jacob lets himself get used a few times and he just seems to not care, and it didnt make sense he helped those who used him in the first place.The templars are not templars, but just villains. They went from We need humanitys submission for their own good, to create order and lead them towards greatness to Har har, artifact? We want it, because reasons! WE KILL EVERYBODY IN OUR WAY har har!!!! !And the ending was soooo pathetic. I literally laughed at the final rendered scene. It was just so bad.The mechanics are really really fleshed out though and London is a MASTERPIECE! Seriously, if it werent for that terrible story and logic it would be an amazing and beautiful game. It had ALL the potential to be on The Witcher 3 level, but the story lacked in every way.
