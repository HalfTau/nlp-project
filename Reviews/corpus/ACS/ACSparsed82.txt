The story is trash. Couldnt care less about it.The combat is trash, you may have a knife but you need to hit the guy 20 times in ultra pace before you can actually use it.Controls are trash.The new sneak mechanic sucks ss. All you do is attract attention in a crowd instead of blending in. You cant walk normal when sneaking, you need to walk like an gunned down gorilla. Because apparently that is supposed to look less suspicious...Ubi is lazy af so they keep on using the exact same enemy characters over and over again. Dialogue is cringy, aswell are the characters.The game itself looks blurry and ugly. Somehow they managed to make the graphics worse than the previous game.Overall a boring trash game with a boring city that looks like trash. This is the worst and the least intresting AC i have ever played.
