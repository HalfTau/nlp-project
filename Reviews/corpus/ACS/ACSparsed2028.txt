As nearly usual by now it is a console portation and these still suck big time in terms of how the  do you uintend me to steer myself through here if my char gets stuck to walls, climbing areas, hiding spots and such?.If you can ignore the fact of the lousy steering an the poor story  even a shorter one than in the last few published parts of the series   you get a lovely most inner city map of London in a believable Setting.Some sidequests as usual take longer to succeed in than the poor main story.In short I am torn apart but in favour of satisfied customers the full priced product gets a no go.Worth the reduced prices if they are adequate.
