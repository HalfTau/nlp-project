Before Assasins Creed Origins, I had this game on my personal list of top 2 or 3 best Assassins Creed games. It features a strong storyline with elements from AC 2 and AC Brotherhood as well as new features and gameplay mechanics that make this game one of the best in the AC series. The protagonists are refreshing and unique as well. Highly recommend.
