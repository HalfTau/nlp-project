So Immediately after attempting to start the game I already have a problem. The game just gives me the Assassins Creed Syndicate splash screen, and doesnt even load the game. I tried everything. Ive tried reinstalling it on my main drive. I tried verifying game cache. Ive tried all the advice I can find online, my computer meets the system requirements. I know this isnt just me because its happening to many people.As far as Im concerned I shouldnt even be spending hours trying to fix a problem when Im the one buying the product that I expect to work when I purchase it and not have to spend hours trying to fix it, then shortly after I find out there is no fix. That may varyCongratulations on being one of the laziest game publishers/developers ubisoft, really fantastic job. You possibly wasted 65 of my precious Dollars , and many hours of my time. because of your lazy attitude towards your customers.If this is how you treat the continued loyalty of your customers and fans of the Assassins Creed franchise I honestly hope Vivendi completely buys you out and runs you into the ground.
