Open world games have become a joke. Just repetitive things to do, unlocking skills and weapons that are only there to dilate the time you spend in the game, collecting meningless.. Just give me a good history and if its going to be short Ill not care. Just dont charge 60 eur as its becoming a norm today.On the other hand, I love the Victorian era and the design of the city and all the people roaming, selling things etc, its very well done. Ambient is great and you can spend a few hours just wandering and admiring their work.
