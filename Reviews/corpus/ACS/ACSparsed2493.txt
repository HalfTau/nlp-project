Performance wise it runs pretty okay averaging around 3040fps Everything medium except enviroment detail which is at high Specs i5 4590, R9 270 Gigabyte windforce 2X 2GB and 16GB of Ram Now the game so far the characters are a lot better than unity and the game just in general is a lot better than unity. So I definitely recommend it.
