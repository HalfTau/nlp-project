Super game, admittedly I am only a few hours in but so far love it. Voice acting, graphics and music is fantastic, the story seems more than satisfactory so far and I have no issues with the pacing or direction. Its a huge improvement on previous installments and even they were of an enjoyable standard bar a few bugs and glitches.Only downside I have personally experienced thus far would be the limited feel to combat. I havent played Unity so I cannot say if they changed this for that previous title, but being unable to swap in and out of more variantions of weapons makes combat quickly feel samey and stale, who knows, perhaps I just havent played long enough yet to unlock this feature. If I do, I will be sure to edit this review.
