I have both AC Syndicate and AC Unity, and i would say that from those two, unity is a bit better. Both of the games are worth it and for assassins creed fans, unity is a better choice. But if you want a good open world, assassins creedlike game, I would says syndicate is better. your choice! Both are worth it!
