looked really interesting installed itplayed 50 minutes before the 10 fps was too muchhad so much fun playing  but wish the fps was a little kinderassassins creed should not make the graphic quality so high like in assassins creed rogue where i would get a wonderfull 60fpswhere in unity and syndicate it would never jump above 10fpsi would love to see a patch or something where to play a game you dont have to have a gtx 980 TI or gtx 1080
