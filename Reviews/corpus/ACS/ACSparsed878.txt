The game is extermely buggy on the pc. At important moments in the game, the game just crashes and stops working. I bought a compact disc  tried installing form steam  both lead to the same thing. I have a windows 10 64 bit OS. All the rest of the games e.g. Battlefield, Witcher3 work perfectly find on my alienware pc.This leads me to believe that this games code is buggy.Also the interface for gaming on PC is really uncomfortable. Ubisoft created this game for the console and without any changes slapped it on the PC environment   a really shoddy job.Even during gameplay I found a bunch of bugs just like unity. My character started to fly around after crashing into a enemy horse cart.The interface to jump around building is okay, but it so hard to get down to the ground a weird key combo gets you back to the ground which is really irritating when you are working with full blown enemy attacks.
