A lot of AC fans dont like ACS, but I LOVED it. The Victorian London setting is probably the most atmospheric of all the AC games Ive played. Granted, its a dark, foggy, industrial setting, but it is not as monotone as some reviewers mainly on Youtube might say. From the wretched backyards of Whitechapel, the busy, murky Thames to the cosy corners of Westminster with its caroling, its actually quite diverse imho.I liked Evie as a character, more than Jacob, who is rather a gangleader than a real assassin, as she is the one who drives the story forward as the true assassin in this game. Unfortunately the missions where you have to play a set character lean more towards Jacob.The story is rather straight, with very few surprise moments, but the characters good, and the main antagonists reasoning is actually quite comprehensible. More so than e.g. Cesare in Brotherhood.There is less parcour than in other AC games, as you will find yourself using the rope launcher most often, but its a good mean to traverse the city or to make a quick getaway.The combat as usual is rather easy, just press E or F in the right moment and youll never get defeated. But its fun to see some nice multiple takedown animations.I didnt encounter any bugs, aside from mission or train icon disappearing on the map twice, but a fast travel fixed it for me.The Jack the ripper DLC is a nice idea, but not worth it imho.All in all it is one of my favourite AC games, probably right after AC II and Origins, and if you like a darker, industrious, yet atmospherioc setting, and can deal with the usual AC flaws, mainly the wonky controls, it will be a game youll very much enjoy.
