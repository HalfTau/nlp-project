This game is very good, although not surpassing Black Flag  My opinion it sure is a favorite. The story was great, and, i havent even finished it yet. When you finish the game, you get a couple of more missions, which is allways great.Pros2 changeable main charactersPretty good storyGrappling hookTrainsCarriagesShipsConsSometimes the game starts freezing while driving in a carriage, the fix is simple, enable vsync.Not many cons for me.
