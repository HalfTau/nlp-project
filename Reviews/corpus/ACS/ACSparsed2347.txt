This game is an incredible comeback for the series, referring to last years release of Unity. The game runs smoothly, whith minor bugs here and there, which is essential for any game release. I am running the game on max settings except PCSS Ultra and HBAO Ultra on a desktop with an Intel i7 CPU, NVIDIA 980 GPU 4GB, and 16GB RAM, with pretty stable 60FPS.The main characters in Assassins Creed Syndicate are fantastic! I absolutely love their personalities, and they are defiantly competitors to the character we all know and love, Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. Jacob and Evie Frye have a houmoristic and great relationship, which makes it fun to watch every cutscene.The gameplay is something different from the other Assassins Creed games, but I like it. It is nice too see that Ubisoft take chances by changing the gameplay of the series, which makes it more fun for us to play the new game. Ubisoft has taken a step away from the usage of swords in combat, which makes the combat in this game feel fresh and new. They have also added the new hookshot, which gives the game an even more fresh feeling, bcs it gives you a new way of traveling around.I could write about this game the whole day, but I think you guys get the point by now. I completely love this game! 10/10
