I personally recommend this game. Out of all the games I played, this had good mechanisms and a balance between RPG and the traditional AC games. The story was good and the main missions was fun. I especially like the canesword attack animation with Jacob. I would have said this was one of the almost perfect game for me but then Robert appeared and ask me to compete in the races in london. That was hell but the rewardsLoyalty Level 5 was worth it.
