The game is really good so far, the fps seems stable but whats not new for me is the fact that the game crashes a lot. Unfortunately, I havent been lucky with absolutely none of the ubisoft games in this last decade.EVERY single game on pc I had to do some kind of workaround to make it run properly. Some games like Farcry 3 dont even run anymore, I thought it might be incompatibility with the OS Win10 here and I end up installing win7 but with no success  the game just dont work and with AC Unity I had to create a powershell script to be able to run the game at all, it still had crashes but at least I was able to play it.And now AC Syndicate is going on the same path, it started with resolution problems that was way higher than mine and the fact that I couldnt skip the intro video to choose the right resolution therefore I couldnt watch it the video again and I couldnt even start a new game I had to disable savegame syncronization e delete manually the save files and so on to be able to watch the intro properly.Its always something with ubisoft games, I mean, not even a NEW GAME feature? Cmon.Ubisoft really dont seem to give a FK about its customers.SPECSFX8370BE  4.9Ghz32gb RAMGTX980WIN10
