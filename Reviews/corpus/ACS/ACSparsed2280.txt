I... really like this game! It was one of the games I was excited about along with Fallout 4, which is also superb. Now when I first started it up there were some framerate issues so I tweaked around wuth the settings, now its all smooth. The missions are good, and the combat along with the vehicle combat Go on roof, shoot etc. is also really good although I enjoy the vehicle a little bit more, cuz Mad Max so overall the system is good. Another thing, you have the option to take the game seriously or not, and really, although the missions are fun, and the stealth is really cool, fooling around rammin into people is of course just silly entertainment, so dont be scared to sidetrack and goof around a bit. I like the gang concept along with the upgrades and the skill points, plus Ive played WatchDogs before, and I also like that game, graphics dont matter to me that much so I dont care about the E3 scale down, I just care about the gameplay. And some of the mechanics such as train surfing and skill points etc. also came into this game, so Im used to this system, and really its a nice system. The stealth is as I mentioned before good, I like using it, its comfortable, really.
