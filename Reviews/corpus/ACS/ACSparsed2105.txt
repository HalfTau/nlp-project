Assassins Creed SyndicateThis is one of the most underrated titles out right now.PresentationLondon looks fantastic and the music does a great job of creating the atmosphere. Sometimes I felt bad rushing through things and found myself taking walks just to enjoy the view.GameplayThe game play is pretty smooth, I didnt have to much trouble Jumping and climbing. The Combat is intuitive and fun,there is also a decent variety of weapons. You may switch between the 2 assassins at anytime and they share Exp, money and weapons but not armor so you dont have to feel guilty giving too much attention to either one.StoryI personally find the Frye twins enjoyable these 2 rough assassins have very different idea on how to free London. The premise of the main story is to free london from the templars and find a peice of Eden. I cant spoil too much but you will meet famous historical figures such as writters and inventors, and it is very cool to see how they were imagined in this world. But since I started playing I could not put it down.I give this one4.5/5  Very redeeming after Unity, Enjoyble and Guns are too much fun.AlsoThis only reason this game is underrrated is because it was released at the wrong time, with the release of Fallout 4, Star Wars Battlefront, Just Cause 3 and Rainbow 6 seige.
