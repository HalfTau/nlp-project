If youre tryna sieze the means of production then this game is for you. In my opinion this is the best setting of any Assassins Creed game to date. It may be because ive just binged Peaky Blinders but industrial era England is just beautiful. Its gloomy and rainy, filled with overworked people and cookie cutter buildings. The free running is just as satisfying as it always is but now you have a grappling hook which opends up more possibilities. Some hate it but its necessary with the setting. The main and side characters are the best since AC2. I find the writing witty and sharp at its best, but at times feels uninspired. The usual Ubisoft t applies though. Cut and paste side content, sync points that reveal items, and so many microtransactions. This game was a step in the right direction and if you have an itch for AC you will like it.
