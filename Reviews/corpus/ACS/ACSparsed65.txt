Not as much content than unity and honestly going back maybe unity is a bit better.I played this on console that was my fisrt time playing this game i thought not much of it. i was to busy trying to finish the game. Now playing it and putting the time on story i just found my self to finish it and be done with it. Just when i first played it.
