Syndicate runs well for a Ubisoft game, UPlay has been updated and redefined so now its much more like using origin, its less clunky and frustrating to play a Ubisoft game on PC now, well for me at least.The gameplay feels like a tradional AC game with the addition of a grappling hook so you can quickly make it from point A to point B. The melee combat is much faster paced and the takedowns are incredibly over the top, I bashed a guy in the head with a cane and he did a full flip and then I hit him again to kill him, theyre cool looking none the less but its a little too over the top at times.Jacob and Evie are probably my all time favorite protagonists out of all AC games, I played Rogue and I felt that Shay was an amazing character to play as but running around as Jacob or Evie is much more enjoyable this time around.The customization is nicely done, they still offer micro transactions like they did in Unity but it feels much less forced now, Ive been able to quickly get the equipment I want by just playing the game the way I want to, I dont feel forced to buy a package of in game money so I can upgrade my weapon. So thats good!One thing that bothers me is the lack of inventory and equipment, youre only able to equip your weapon in full combat as well as the hidden blade which really bothers me, the whole point of the cane sword is to have a weapon concealed in an average cane but you dont even get to see it! You fight someone and then you take the cane out of your coat pocket and then put it back in after the fight is over, I would like to be able to walk around with the cane hanging out in my hands like in the screenshots but nope. Maybe theyll fix it in an update.All in all Syndicate is great, it runs well, its gameplay is great, London is incredibly fun to be in, the characters are well rounded and have a good sense of humour, and the addition of being able to walk around the city with a gang following you is very cool, feels much like Peaky Blinders the game Great show if you havent watched it already!
