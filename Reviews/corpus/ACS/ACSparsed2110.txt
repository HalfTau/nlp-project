a mediocre 5 out of 10 reasons why belowok i had many gripes with this game1. outfits you wear are binded by stat boosts locked by that outfit the stat i wanted was binded to a super ugly outfit that couldnt even be unlocked until like sequence 9 thankfully i had a legacy outfit already unlocked to use that had the same stats it would have been better if you could choose the stat you wanted and put it on the outfit you wanted2. weapon choices there are only 4 weapons in the entire game but each had differant stats and looks assassins creed unity had waaaay better weapon customization and gear pistols a kukri cane sword and brass knuckles3. the bugs glitchy templars and falling down from edges that didnt exist are a constant reminder that the game needs some tweaking4. 2 assassin characters missed opportunity with internet coop or local coop it could have been waay more amazing with coop in it sadly its not5. the limitations of outfits most of the outfits in the game look pretty much the same as all the others not much diversity this is excluding the dlc and legacy skins which cant be painted or customized6. most of the city takeover activities are pretty much the same thing recycled maybe 5 in total with the same objectives only some had differances7. combat has drastically changed they removed the counter insta kill thing i would actually call this a plus thoughnot worth 60 bucks maybe worth 10 buy on discount not full price
