So far the only hitch I got was in the prologue mission when I take out a lot of the guards the game stuttered, got through it and now the game runs silky smooth maybe the first part just had a problem with the ragdoll physics definitely way better than Unitys launchPrologue issues aside, game runs extremely well for me so far
