Magnificent, realistic, atmosphererical masterpiece. What I loved about the game is that you had historical characters such as Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Alexander Graham Bell and more. The storyline aint at all times hipped but there are those moments where you go waaah. Levelling up to gain skill points and gaining new weapons and accessories makes you enthralled. Even when you complete the storyline you still get extra side missions. Ubisoft have made the time and effort to create an amazing Assassins Creed game. If you havent purchased this game, than damn you!!An absolute elegant, sumptuous Assassins Creed game that rewards serious stealth and brisk reactions.The best AC yet IMHO!
