Ubisoft has won my respect after Unity. This game runs perfectly, is immensely fun, and the story both past and present are remarkable. Great Job Ubisoft. AC remains one of my favorite game franchises, I cannot wait to delve into the next juicy part of the Assassin vs Templar dichotomy. Requiestcat en Pace.
