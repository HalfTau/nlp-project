Assassins Creed Syndicate is a really fun game in my opinion and has tons of fun missions to do. This is my favorite Assassins Creed game. This is a stealth based game and requires it  a lot of thinking. You can play as two assassins, Jacob Frye and Evie Frye. Overall I recomend this game to anyone who enjoys stealth and thinking games.
