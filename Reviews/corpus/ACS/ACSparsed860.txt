Loving this game! I couldnt get into the previous AC games as much anymore after the Ezio trilogy. But this one is my second favorite after Ezio. I love Jacob and Evie, theyre great with a more in depth storyline. The city looks beautiful, the story is interesting, Id say this one was definitely worth my money. The only minus point I can mention is that after a year there are still some problems. The game crashed quite a few times on me after every cinematic but after sequence 3 or so that didnt happy anymore. Apart from that, Im addicted and absolutely not disappointed. Would love to see more of Jacob and Evie!
