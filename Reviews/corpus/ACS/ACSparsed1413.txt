 it plays well. u dont find ur self stuck free running into the wrong spot or crappy fighting mechanics. its the same regurgitated AC. They actually managed to go back to the first AC with the amount of things to do and how u can do them. ull find ur self saving kids from slavery, killing a dumb Templar that walks around like a common guard, and kidnapping an enemy. OH! then u get to fight another Templar but this one u cant use stealth because its a gang fight... then repeat for each of the 5 ? districts... yay... at least they cut down on the amount of sync points for descovering the map.Only fan boys would give a thumbs up and let Ubisoft get away with such repetitive game play after this many AC games.
