I bought the game played it for about a weak had a lot of fun AC is still goin strong even after unity. However while I was playing the game crashed and wouldnt open after that. on start up itshows th AC logo and makes a sound and would just stop. people are blaming the new patch 1.5 frankly I dont know and I still havent been able to load the game. wouldnt recomend buying the game until they get it fixed
