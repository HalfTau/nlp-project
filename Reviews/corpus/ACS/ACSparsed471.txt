Aint this a roight right pafetic pathetic waste waste of me my toime time.Again a games for the MEH button.London is so much nicer than it is now at least.Fighting seems to have taken a step backwards for this series, buttons are clumsly combined. Double assassination seems to not work very well I find....which sucksOh, the stagecoaches...like a poor mans GTA. Seriously too many missions with them.And I see the kidnapping missions are the new tailing missions.Better than Unity, Black Flag still reigns supreme.
