It is a good game overall, got some new mechanics which are nice and the overall gameplay was better than in Unity. The side stories are nice and i liked the addition of carriages, it really improved traveling of semi long distances.But the story is really bad for an AC game. The villains dont seem like Templars at all, just a bunch of disconnect figures who somehow screw with the lives of the citizens of London. It misses the AC story like the AC2 triology had, and the gameplay isnt new/awesome enough to compensate for it, like in Black Flag.Overall the game is good, well worth your money, just a new fun AC game to sink some hours in, but it wont be one i will remember for long.
