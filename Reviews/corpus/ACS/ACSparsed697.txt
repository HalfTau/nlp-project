This was my first AC game ever and I enjoyed it a lot. Unfortunately, that means I cant compare it to the others at all, but I love the Victorian setting and the game mechanics. I didnt find it overlycomplicated to control or understand after a very short learning curve.It was the kind of game that I wracked up 75 hours playing in a matter of weeks, which is pretty heavy for me. I even found the repetitive sidemissions fun. I liked slowly conquering the city. It reminded me of the Mad Max game.My only criticisms I preferred playing as Evie, but they kept forcing me to play as Jacob for the story missions. The Jacob and Evie story didnt have a particularly strong ending. Its was slightly anticlimatic for me. I had no idea what was going on with the larger AC story outside of Jacob and Evie. I can only assume that having to summarize events with every new game would be annoying to most players who have undoubtedly been keeping up with the series, so not really a big deal there.
