A significant improvement over AC Unity but not without its flaws. Syndicate stars twins Jacob and Evie Frye set in Victorian London. As always with AC games, the world is beautiful and feels alive. The Frye twins are interesting protagonists and the game play aspect of being able to switch between characters for a slightly different play style is a nice change.Unfortunately Syndicate also shares some similar problems as previous AC installments, namely repetition. The world map is filled with side missions and collectibles, alas most of them are pretty much the same and once youve collected a few vintage beer bottles or pressed flowers theres not much fun in finding more, unless you want to try different color schemes for your outfits in the crafting menu.Speaking of crafting, the crafting system has been expanded this time around and youll be able to craft new and more powerful weapons and armor which is a nice addition to the game. Skills and perks have been improved as well but at only 10 levels max it wont take you that long to reach the highest level.Some side missions will have you encounter famous people from the Victorian era but game play wise these missions dont do anything new. The main missions do provide alternate ways of completing objectives, which is nice but in the end I found that it just didnt provide enough entertainment to revisit.As with most AC games, dont expect great optimization or a steady frame rate and be prepared to struggle with numerous bugs and graphical glitches, though its certainly not as bad as AC Unity.If youre a fan of the AC series then Syndicate is worth picking up. If not then this game will not change your mind as its really more of them same except in a different setting.
