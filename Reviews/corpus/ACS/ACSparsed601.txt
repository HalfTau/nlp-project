Right, so I gained 100 completion and Ill recommend it, but Im gonna say this  the game is definitely not a masterpiece, but a fine game in all. What makes me say that? Well, after more than 2 years since release and some patches, lets get through the cons Quality can be bloody frustrating at times  unstable engine an average of 1 crash/10hrs of gameplay in a total of 70hrs. Frequent spikes which make the game freeze for more than 3 seconds, guaranteed due to engine issues rather than rig setup I5 6th gen, GTX1060 3gb 192bit, 16GB DDR4. While trying to attain 100 completion, the client can go into an infinite loading screen when missions are loaded from the progress tracker menu. Other minor issues can be overridden.Its ok to have collectibles, but Ubisoft decided again to overdo it. Mechanic can be idiotic at times. So, this is a pitty because the title could have been so much more.The game itself can be enjoying at times especially if one liked the series/or similar parkour/stealth based games or if you happen to have a passion for London like I do.Carriage driving is not very realistic, but not that bad after all.PROS Graphics are good Having two characters to play with is welcome The story is fine, good diversity with side missions for assosiactes and borough conquering system. Nice WWI bonus content. The tools available are more than one could ask for.Anyway, you can give it a go, but be warned of engine quality and best to play it casually rather than focusing on full synch.
