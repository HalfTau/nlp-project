What a big change from Assassins Creed Unity. This is how an Assassins Creed game should play!ProsGreat GraphicsLess BugsDiverse ChractersThe setting in Victorian LondonThe new fighting system was excellentConsThe Story was MehI had drops in frames per second even though I had my graphics settings set for high.Still some bugs but not the worse I have seen.I hope Ubisoft continues the Assassins Creed franchise. This game was wicked fun!
