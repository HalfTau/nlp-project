After years and years of a working control system that really was nice, Ubi decided to just toss all that out of the window and completely change the way free running is controlled. Be able to control the speed of your horse drawn buggy? Naw full speed at all times or walk slowly until the horse stops on its own, but yet if you jump off it while in motion, the horse will just continue on until the ends of the earth. Really, really sad that this game was obviously designed soley for consoles and then it was just ported over to PC without any thought to keyboard keys not being pressure sensitive... Nice idea guys. Combat targeting is atrocious to say the least, counter an enemy while in the midst of attacking another enemy instead of being able to just use your direction keys to switch targets you have to physically look at them with the mouse or your assassin will just continue pounding on the same target. So, in a fight with 5 or more guys, unless you want to just stand in one spot and use counter all day long and watch the same 2 kill animations over and over and over again, you are going to have fun spinning your head around all day long. Really the last thing that finally made me just quit and uninstall. While free running if you encounter a lantern or other object that is no higher than your ankle or calf your assassin will stop infront of it or stumble and walk in a random direction istead of just stepping around or over something the size of a cat. The leveling system and gear and upgrades area are so disorganized in my opinion they are horrid. What happned with the awesome assortment of weapons that enemies carried that you could pick up and use?! So disappointed in where this series has gone in terms of user control and freedom. I shall just go replay Black Flag and actually have fun instead of frustration when I want my AC fix.
