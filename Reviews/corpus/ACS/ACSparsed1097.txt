When I first played this game, I was still incrediblythat theyd killed off Desmond. Ill be honest, I loved the 1st Assassins Creed, and it felt like Ubisoft was descending further and further into insanity with every additional game they released in the franchise.So I decided in five minutes that Syndicate was just as bad and I moved on.Well... many hours of Black Flag and Rogue later, I came back to Syndicate to see if Id missed anything and......Just woah. I missed EVERYTHING.This game is incredibly fun especially if youre willing to take some time and read all the animus/database entries as it adds the context and depth I felt were missing in Unity and all the other postdesmond games.Get Syndicate and take your time with it, its difficult not to love.
