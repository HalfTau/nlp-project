Really beautiful game, the graphics are amazing. Min out or Maxed outA lil repetive at some parts and some bugs/glitches/design flaws here and there.Overall, it is a fun game with some unique things added like gangs, a train hideout, and many more ways to kill Templars.9.8/10EDIT If you want to play this maxed out, it does take a toll on your PC.
