Unity brought a new combat system, new graphics, new physics and a amazing environment immersion.Well, this game is all that plus so more! Unity missed a good character and a good main story, here we go! The combat system missed a bit of dynamic, here we go! You take everything Unity did well and you do far better.The game is overall easier though because when you update your skills, you become the best assassin ever seen in the ACs serie... you can even become invisible... just saying thats a bit much but ok.This only thing I miss is Paris in French revolution, but this is very subjective.To be noted, this game crashes from time to time, at least its after some missions and not in the middle of them so thats kind of ok. You finish a mission, it crashes you restart. This is the only frustration I have with this game.
