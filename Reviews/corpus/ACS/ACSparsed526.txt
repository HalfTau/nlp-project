I bought this game a long time ago after it came out. I just hate the combat system in this game. I know the other games combat was predictable and genaric, but it was assassins creed. The combat is just weird in this game. Hate the story. Hate the characters. Put 5 hours into this game. Even revelations was better, and that game was pretty bad in retrospect.Dont buy. 4/10
