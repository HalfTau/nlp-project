Game itself is fun and a unique addition to the AC series  but the technical issues have become more of a nuisance than the enjoyment  factor at this point.Have been unable to play a single session in almost 30 Hrs that didnt have predictable crashes at most saving events in the game Finishing a Sequence, Acquiring or Upgrading gear, etc. As you will gain gear and finish missions often in this game, you can expect to crash and restart often.
