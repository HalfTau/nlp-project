Awesome Game! I rarely do reviews but after seeing some of the bad ones I feel like I should give this game a little justice. The last game in the series that I played was Black Flag and I loved it. I wasnt much of a fan of the eras following it so I took a break for a while. Six hours into Syndicate and so far the story is awesome and the gameplay is fantastic. It runs very smooth on medium level graphics on my laptop with a Geforce GTX 965M and still looks great. After a little practice and upgrades the fights feel better than any Assassins Creed Ive ever played. Ive found myself intentionally walking slow into dangerous areas to emphasize the level ofkicking that was about occur.The one downside that Ive found so far is the carriages tend to be hard to navigate and a bit clunky. Otherwise I highly recommend this game!
