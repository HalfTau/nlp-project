Ok game. Played some of the previous ones, this one is on the better side, and walking around in gorgeously rendered london is great. But this game is in now way worth its full price in my opinion, since the AC model is so repetitive and outdated now.So yes, good buy in my opinion if you can get it halfprice or so.
