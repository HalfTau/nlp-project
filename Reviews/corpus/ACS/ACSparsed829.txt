I  broke my teeth with AC with AC Unity.I was blown away with the graphics, the color, the city, the detail, the storyline and then went AC nuts. I bought black flag, which I loved, and then i bough Syndicate.The goodGraphics are steller, detail is gorgeous. I understand Englad wasnt built like France so there is more space between buildings etc.The badThe story line is slow and the leveling is grindy. Its the same four things one has to do over and over again to gain gang support  and then with that, all the gang members look alike. There is no variation beside the four different skins.When were in a storyline quest its great. When you are in a story line quest and if youve not accidentally overpowered yourself for the quest by having grinded your way through the game.....The hidden treasures, find this thing to unlock this other thing, etc. The game was so grindy I just didnt.Decisions didnt impact the environment at all, except for said four missions made the bad gang? go away.I dont like the idea of killing police officers  it felt weird and kind of y.The controls were frustrating. Zip line cool, rated E for every goddamn thing.I freaking loved Black Flag  pirates, pirate ships, sailing, there were boats in the Dirty Thames   uh huh, can ya really feel me?...but meh?The relationship between brother and sister story line just wasnt there.Final thoughtsThere wasnt enough there, there.Everything else was filler. AC Unity was better.
