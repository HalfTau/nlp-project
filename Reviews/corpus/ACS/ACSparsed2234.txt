I wanted to like this, I really did, but the amount of game breaking bugs and crashes made that impossible. When I can run MGSTPP and Fallout 4 at high settings there is no reason why I shouldnt be able to run this at least at minnimum. Maybe if Ubisoft can fix the issues I would recommend, But until they do dont bother wasting your money.
