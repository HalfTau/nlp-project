this is the very first AC game I have played and let me tell you, its a hell of a blast. The graphics are overwhelmingly impressive, somewhat an upgrade from Unity, the freerunning is more smooth and fluid, and the environment is definitely living and breathing, as promised from the very first Assassins Creed game. The story takes place in London, during the Industrial Revolution, with new allies like Alexander Graham Bell, etc.  Not sure if this is the first AC game wherein you can switch characters ingame but I have to say, this was a really good choice. Jacob and Evie have different expertise, Jacob being more confrontational, and Evie, of course, stealthier. The ability of leading a group of rebels, the Rooks, to aid you in fighting, transporting, and supplying is something unique that adds the opportunities that this game can offer. With the help of Aleck, you have access to a neverseenbefore tool mechanism in AC, a rope launcher. Its like Spiderman, but in 1868. Your main weapon is canesword, which is a perfect marriage of aesthetics and deadliness Side activities like carriage racing, fight clubs, and gang wars creates a unique blend of replayability. 100 recommend this game. Pick this up on sale. Never fullprice.PROS Evie Rope Launcher Fight Clubs CaneswordsCONS protectors horses birds children
