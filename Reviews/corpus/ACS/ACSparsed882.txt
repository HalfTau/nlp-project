Im a big fan of the series and the overall storyline but anyone can pickup this game and get in it because these is little to no focus on any of the backstory at this point aside from the odd disembodyied comment witch you can care less about.Now the actual game itsself is great, the missions, story and historical figures are diverse and captivateing and theres much much more the game has to offer so i definetly recommend this to any fan of the seris or anyone looking to get into the series.As far as gamplay is concerned, i rank it as the best one in the series to date.
