Wow. Just, wow. I had little hope going into this game after Unity. But in the first hour of the game, I was blown away.Story Likeable, funny characters and a nicely writen plot that keeps me on edge. 8/10Open World So diverse and big. Carriages, trains, and ziplines make it much easier to traverse the massive world. 7/10Fighting mechanics My least favorite part about the game. Simple and repetivie. Very dissapointing. 4/10Stealth So much more fun than Unitys stealth and makes you feel like a true Assassin.Skills and Customization Skills are very helpful and beneficial. Customization isnt as diverse as Unity, but is still good. 6/10Overall, I cant tell you how much I reccomend this game to you. This has to be one of my favorite AC games ever. If you have the money and are a fan of the series, this is a definite buy.8/10 overall rating
