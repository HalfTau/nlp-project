Performance decent enough and runs a lot smoother than Unity. 4550fps average but it stays there, Unity I dropped into the 30s and 20s quite a bit. the performance boost between alllow settings and allultra except for antialiasing and gameworks is again nonexistent, so I ran most things closer to their highest.Story Fairly weak, not as obnoxious as Unitys t excuse of a story.Gameplay I enjoyed it enough.This is what Unity would have been if it hadnt been a colossal nightmare.
