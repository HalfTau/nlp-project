Almost no difference with the other Assassins Creed titles, it becomes stale soon enough the time you approach the opening of the game. The only positive is the graphics which is top notch and one of the best looking game of 2015. Buy this only if its on heavy sale, otherwise dont bother. I have refunded this game.
