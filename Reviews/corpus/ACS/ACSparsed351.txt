Yeah look, I mean, if you have never played an Assasins Creed game, then you will enjoy it, but if you have played even one Assasins Creed game, then you have played them all. It doesnt matter how much they change the story, everything feels the same as the last game, and the one before. Still, this game is quite good, graphics are good. I run this on ultra, at 60fps as Uplay likes to lock the fps on different graphics settings.
