I bought this game about half a year ago.  Ive been an avid Assassins creed fan since the beginning.  Assassins creed has been going down hill since Assassins creed II, and I had heard this one was a return to form, so I decided to get it, but sadly it doesnt run at all.  At first I thought that it was my computer, and that it was simply not good enough to run a new game like this, but I updated my graphics card and still I have constant crashes, freezing when Im on a vehicle or ziplining, and horrible texture loading times.  I wanted to like this game so much, but sadly, it just doesnt work.  After half a year of waiting, I think that Ive finally lost hope in the series.  This may have cemented my decision to make this my last Assassins creed game that Ill buy.
