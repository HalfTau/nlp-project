A return to form for Ubisoft.I have played every Assassins creed since Assassins creed 2 excluding UnityA very enjoyable game with comedy, wit and plenty of action. A few bugs here and there but nothing like the reports from Unity XD. Ropelauncher is very useful and the Rooks is a new take on the Brotherhood of olf. Wouldve liked an overhauled parkour system Mirrors edge/Dying light but had everything an Assassins Creed game should have10/10
