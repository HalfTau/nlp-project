Like running around? Jumping across rooftops? Hanging from a rope and double assassinating two Blighters and then going on to stun four other enemies, and feel like a bada when doing a quadruple kill? Get this game.This game is fun. Yeah, I figured. As someone jumping into the AC franchise at the end of Ezios trilogy I played ACR and skipping AC3, Unity and Rogue, I thoroughly enjoyed this. In 25 hrs of gameplay, I experienced 23 crashes, and sometimes the framerate would temporarily dip very infrequent.ProsLine launcher is epic.Playing ACFrogger across the Thames.Ghosthunting with Charles Dickens, and looking like Sherlock Holmes with the Huntsman Outfit.Taking over London bit by bit.Jacobs hilarious quips and quirkyness.Having two protagonists.Grand Theft Carriage Jumping onto the roof of your carriage, jumping onto the carriage of your opponent, kicking them off, and taking it as your own.Voltaic BombsConsOccasionally jumping onto the wrong thing.That awful ending. No spoilers, but it was extremely predictable and cheesy as hell.But, even these small misfires cannot deny an excellent adventure through London.TLDR Good, but crap ending.
