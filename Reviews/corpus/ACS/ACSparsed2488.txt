I think this is a good port, great Performance, nice graphic. Ive played a few mission, it really great. I think Ubisoft learned many from Assassins Creed Unity and please give them a chance.For you who play AC Syndicate or Ubisofts game, just review about game, please dont complain about Uplay I dont say you wrong, I know Uplay is bad, but only to comment on game let others know it great or bad , thanks!
