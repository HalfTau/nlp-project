Well for starters, I cant get 5 feet into the game without it either crashing, or haveing tons of gliches. For example the sky keeps flashing I have no idea why, plus there are lines everywhere on the screen which doesnt help. I have all of the qualifications on my graphics card and with RAM and my hard drive. I really want to play this game, the last good AC game in my opinion was Black Flag, Ive been waiting for a good AC game for while. Im going to buy a new graphics card and hopfully the game will work properly. All in all, I would not buy this game unless you have DOUBLE the qualifications on your graphics card, not just the recomended requirements.
