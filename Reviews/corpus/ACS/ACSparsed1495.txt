I havent played much of this game, but here is my review. This is a third person assassin game. I really like this game and I am just starting it! The combat system is great! The controls are a bit complicated but understandable. Overall this game is really good and I would recommend it to people who like action and/or Fps games. It has great parkour. I would rate 10/10. What was that explosion? he says. What explosion? She says. funny lines and a great game!
