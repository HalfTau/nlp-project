This definitely was an improvement on the franchise after the travesty that was Assassins Creed Unity. I fully enjoyed running around Victorian England as it is a time period I enjoyed reading about in history class. I also liked the inclusion of the gang system. It was a game mechanic that I found useful.The missions were varied. There were the mini storyline with a few historical figures, such as Darwin, Dickens, and Marx. Bell was such a lovable dork. The gang missions were also varied in the sense that they required different strategies but evenually also got repetitive. Overall, the missions were still fun.As a fan of Sherlock Holmes and Ripper Street type of mysteries, I found the Dreadful Crimes dlc to be just as fun as the main story. Went about London with my invisible Inspector Reid hat and my Sherlock Holmes wool coat, solving crimes like a BOSS! The World War One content, however, I do wish was more fleshed out.Overall, I do recommend playing this game if you are a fan of the franchise.
