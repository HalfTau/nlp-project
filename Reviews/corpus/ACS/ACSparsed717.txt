Probably the best Assassins Creed game ive played.Syndicate is a mix of refined gameplay with an interesting premise.Both Evie and Jacob are likeable compared to previous assassins, cough Ezio, cough Connor.The gameplay whilst a similar premise to previous games introdces new mechanics and enemy types for to face.The world itself is gorgeous and represents London incredibly, however the borough takeovers get boring eventually.The regular side missions for historical figures are a lot of fun!Only downsides was the final boss being incredibly easy and boring, furthmore I encountered a couple of bugs with carriages but other than this, the game was incredible.Im yet to touch the DLC but I cannot wait.
