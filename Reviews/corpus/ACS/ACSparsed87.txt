Genuinely surprised. I couldnt stand pirates creed 4, pirates creed rogue. Unity was famously Unity. This game single handidly undoes thos past mistakes. Weapon upgrades felt like upgrades. This should have been AC 3. I wish 3, 4 and the other piles of crap never happened. Heres to looking forward to the future of the franshise.
