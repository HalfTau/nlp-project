It sucks that I have to give this game a thumbs down. I like the time period and the new gang system which is a spin on your pirate friends from black flag. I also think the grapling hook taking away most of the wall climbing is awesome too because it keeps the game at a quicker pace and the combat has been improved slightly.On the other hand most of the side missions are all the same 45 missions just slightly harder to give weight to their arbitrary level system. The twin switching is pointless due to the fact that with in the first few hours you will find out that one fits your style of playing more and you will never willingly play the other. also the story goes at such a breakneck pace your head will spin right off.
