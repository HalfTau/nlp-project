Although it has its bugs like any Assassins Creed game, Syndicate is a well written tale of liberation with a perfect ending.With subUnity graphics still good, and less lag, the game still looks stunning on high PC settings and is fairly well optimized. Each of the 10 main villians 8  Thorne and Starrick were very well written for the compartively brief time they played their roles. Likewise, the main protagonists, the Frye twins, share a dynamic that truely encapsulates their sibling rivalry and different approaches to missions. This is the part where I review the present day animus part of the story but honestly who really cares, still cool though. The grappling hook mechanic with the twins rope launchers also makes stealth and traveling much more convienient. Meanwhile, traversing the metropolis of Victorian London on foot, while sometimes clunky, can mostly remain fluid and works well with the combat most of the time. Its truely a shame that Unitys utter failure had a negative impact on this games sales but its a masterpiece in my eyes
