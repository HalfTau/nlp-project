Assassins Creed Syndicate really caught my interest. I bought the game without hesitation and proceeded to download it I was very eager to begin playing. Once it had finally downloaded the 30 GB files I was prompted to enter the CD key to activate the product on Uplay.I never had any problems with Uplay I have AC III and Watch Dogs and so I believe it to be Steams fault for not giving me the option to view the CD code for a product that I bought from them. Thankfully, Steam support was fairly quick to refund my purchase once I tried but failed to activate and play the game.I still believe that this game would be fun to play, and without doubt its likely a good game, but I wouldnt know since I had problems with it that prevented me from playing.
