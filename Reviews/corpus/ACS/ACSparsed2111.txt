phenom 955  3.8, 8bg ram, gtx 970ProGame content is beautiful.Interesting as much the rest of the AC saga is.ConsGame crashes randomly. I get 34 crashes per gaming session, during 34 hours.Most annoying problem is when it crashes as soon as you load a savegame.Crashes whenever it tries to update the achievements online, you need to start in offline mode after finishing each sequence, but this doesnt always work...Advise DONT BUY THIS!!! For at least 6 months. Let UBI fix their problems first, then sell functional software.
