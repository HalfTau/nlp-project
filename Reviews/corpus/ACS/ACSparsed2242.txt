So far Im loving this game!  Being immersed in London is awesome.  It takes a bit to get used to the controls, as I havent really played other Assassins Creed games much.  You do get the hang of it eventually though.  This one, is well worth it.  Quite an adventure so far!  Be warned  graphics requirements are quite high on this one  its taxing my GTX 660ti, but I managed to get it looking good by using SweetFX 2.0 and lowering the ingame settings which helped my FPS.
