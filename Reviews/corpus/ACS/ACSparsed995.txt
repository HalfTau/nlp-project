Absolutely terrible performance. My highend computer couldnt get a solid 30 fps even on high settings. This is the same computer that runs The Witcher 3 and Battlefield 1 at 4k resolution and ultra settings. I dont know what the hell is wrong with this game, but Im not getting it until it can run properly.Sad, because its far more interesting than the past AC games have been, and Im a huge fan of Victorian London.
