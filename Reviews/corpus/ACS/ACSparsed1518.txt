I am unsure if anybody else has had this problem before, but my game simply wont go past the Assassins Creed symbol displayed after you launch the game. Ive been doing research and found out that it may be caused by the sound files not working in a Windows Storage Space. This has only happened after Windows 8. I hope this may help anyone with this problem. Unfortunately I cannot play the game due to this because I have absolutely no idea on how to fix the sound files.
