While i am sure that the game itself is really good, judging by the many gameplay videos online, i would not recommend getting it for the PC over Steam. I spent about 30 on this product to find it got to the logo and ceases to work. Ive read through many comments from several others who have experienced this problem and personally feel that Ubisoft hasnt done enough to ensure this game can be played on a PC. Should this be fixed i might have better things to say about it. But sadly for now i must say this is not a good product on Steam.
