This is one of the best AC from this last years. The story is awesome and the fact that you have 2 playable character with different sets of abilities is never going to make feel like the gameplay is repetitive.Glad i bought this AC since im a huge fan of the series and was kind of disapointed at AC 3. I also really recommend the DLC Jack the Ripper.9/10 Fantastic.
