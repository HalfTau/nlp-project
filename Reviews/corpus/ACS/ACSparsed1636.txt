I know some people are getting tired of the Assassins Creed franchise, with the latest game Unity being bad and overall a very undone game. But I decided to give Syndicate a chance, and I didnt regret buying it!It is way more done than Unity, but of course the PCport couldve been better. The game itself is a very good Assassins Creedgame, one of my favorite in the franchise. I just love how the developers have designed the 1800s London, so much details and it really feels like the old London in so many ways.You play as two characters this time, Jacob and Evie Frye, with the ability to switch between them while in free roam. Skills and equipment is very similar to earlier Assassins Creedgames. The story was interesting and fun, the combat was as always enjoyable and as I said before I liked the city and the environment.
