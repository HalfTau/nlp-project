9/10You can tell within the first few mins your playing a polished AAA title.3.2 hours in and its still knocking my socks off with how much better it all is.Glitches  some but nothing that game breaking  runs sweet on my systemasrockz170extreme4s1151intelcorei76700ks1151skylakequadcore40ghz42ghzturbo8mbcacheCorsair 16GB DDR4 Vengeance LPX 2666MHz Memory Kit for SkylakeGTX 780Windows 10i highly recommend this game if your an avid assassins creederWell done devsupdate 26.11.2015have now played a considerable time to add the following.i like the story the two brother and sister thing works realy well.Sometimes the game will crash on the saving icon.  i have to go desktop and close it. in a whole day playing maybe happens onceI witnessed  a person on the train fall through the floor and his head pop just through the floor!Dead body in road causes massive tail backs in London.i think they made it way too easy alot of the skill is taken out replaced by easy combo kills. i was also rank 10 pretty quick after ranking up in the Fight areas.i do hope one day they do invent a better AI rather than this path crap.  Also killing a guy that was previously being talked to by another and the other guy doesnt alter to the fact his friend is no longer at his post is jolting.Found a bug in sequence 7 ACS Sequence 7 Escort Mission Saving Screen FreezePosted a video of how i fixed it here I still recommend the game it has some very comic moments and the above!
