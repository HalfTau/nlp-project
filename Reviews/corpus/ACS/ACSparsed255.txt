Recommend getting this game while on sale. It is your traditional Assassins Creed game, doest change much in terms of mechanics besides the addition of the grapling hook. Although not required, using the grapling hook does make it easier to travel across the city.The story is pretty mediocre, but still quite enjoyable. The one thing that I have always had a problem with is the way the Assassins Creed games take you out of the world and into modern times. If you are like me and dont much care for the modern story, then youll be glad to know that this game keeps it to a minimum. There is a few cutscenes but no gameplay during modern times. No need to walk around the Abstergo Lab doing repetitive mini games in order to progress the story.Overall, if you take your time playing through the main story without doing any of the side quest such as freeing the boroughs, the game is roughly 20 hours. If you want to complete everything and get all the collectables, then this game can easily be 40 hours plus.Good game, one of the more enjoyable Assasins Creed games released.
