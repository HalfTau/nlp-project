If you want lazy freerunning or none at all most of the time buy this. If you want halfcombat thats somehow worse than unity play this. If youre looking for a game that will make call of duty seem original in terms of story play this. If you want something good play black flag, or rogue, or any of the ezio trilogy just not this.
