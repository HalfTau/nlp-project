Pleasantly surprised by this title. I hated AC Unity because it was so buggy and had really unsatisfying gameplay, it felt like Ubi had stripped down the mechanics of past titles without replacing them with anything.This game is more close to the AC2 which is good because it focuses more on giving the player a fun experience than just having a bunch of monotonous activities that nobody wants to do. What I mean by this is that the devs knew that the strong suit of this game is the combat so you have much more missions that are actionoriented.The story is still really stupid, it hasnt been good since the second installment so no surprise there sadly.The game is still really fun though if you just dont pay close attention to the story.
