I am legitimately shocked this game has mostly positive reviews. While charming in setting and featuring two initially intriguing protagonists, the numerous bugs and clunky gameplay make this a really difficult game to recommend. Squanders a lot of potential by being, most of the time, genuinely unpleasant to play.
