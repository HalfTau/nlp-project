Just completed the game, and now Im being bored out of my mind completing the extremely redundant and tedious side missions just to unlock some higher tier weapons.I have to say, aside from the extremely worthless side missions, I absolutely enjoyed this game. The game is beautiful, despite not having an actual weather or day/night system. I love having 2 characters, and i love the outfits for them both. The combat is quite repetitive, but I think the new animations are quite cool. I guess thats just me, as I like these flashy and fast fighting styles over the traditional slow paced style.However, I am annoyed at Ubisoft for removing the free jump feature, which was present in essentially every single previous title. Being forced to jump down from buildings/obtacles, or just jumping off a ledge/bridge is a serious pain in the Completely negates fluidity, which I believe to be the sole purpose of introducing the jump up/down feature. Ubisoft has to know that this feature is quite good, but it is supposed to complement free jumping, not replacing it. Thus, I think this game is a step down from AC Unitys parkour system.Story and character wise, everything is quite predictable. The story is a tad bland at times, and we werent given an indepth story of the characters so its hard to be attached to them. However, I do enjoy the fact that theyre assassins right from the start, unlike other games where youre forced to play their preassassins life.There isnt much else to say really, but I do recommend this game, especially if youre a true AC fan. I have every game in the series thus far, aside from the 2D side scroller ones, and Syndicate is a game Ive definitely enjoyed despite having so many new features that Im not used to.
