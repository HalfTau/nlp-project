The game has bugs/glitches that you can notice during your gameplayThe combat,the parkour and the exploring,but the graphics dont bug and the bad things in this game is really outweighted by the good things in the game,amazing graphics,music and an environment that feels real and a combat system that is really cooli give this game 8.5 because im hardly done with the game,but ive seen much with my 24 hoursi say that buying the game on sale is best,but you can on full price and not be stupidThis game wasnt exactly what i expected but it didnt disapoint.
