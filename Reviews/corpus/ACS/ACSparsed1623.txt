Pretty much the best Assassins Creed game, up there with the Ezio trilogy and Black Flag.The grappling hook is a great new way to move around the huge city of London, a pretty decent story, no present day sequences, plenty of different styles of side missions, mix up the play style of being a brawler or a stealth based character.
