The first hour was great. Then I realized its gameplay is just as terrible as the others.Sure it is one of the better optimized engines. Also there are a lot of cool physics including the carriages. But other than that its just button smashing till the end of the game. Purchase Witcher 3 if you want a real challenge, not some game Ubisoft had to pump out as quick as possible.
