This game was really great. It had a really immersive lighthearted story with many very funny humorous moments in it. The implanting of historical figures into the game really adds to the setting and makes the game feel more immersive. The combat mechanics in this game are very easy to learn and very fun. Overall this is a great game but my only problem with it is its little replay value. After the end of the main storyline the game in a way becomes very boring and the side missions arent very fun. Its is still a really good game and I highly recommend it.
