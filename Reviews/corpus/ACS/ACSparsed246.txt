DISSAPOINTING. I really loved the original ACs, but this is a dissapointment. its like this was a phone app that was an attempt at an AC game.All anamation is lacking running, walking, fighting, freerunning, theres freaking in game purchasing which should never exist, the story goes nowhere, it doesnt tie into the previous ACs, the game dialogue is terrible.Dont buy this, its a dissapointment to the Assassins Creed games.
