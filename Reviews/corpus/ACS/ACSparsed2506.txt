I only have 2 hours logged at the time of this review however even from this moment it is clear that AC Syndicate is a very large improvement from its previous game in terms of gameplay, stability, and overall quality. Ubisoft knows they messed up last time and while I am actually in the minority that really enjoyed Unity, I was not blind to its problems, mainly its optimization problems. In terms of story or gameplay thats all up to the individual if they enjoy that or not, which I personally enjoyed quite a bit. However the most important thing a game, especially on PC, needs is stability and that is what Syndicate has that Unity lacked. I have a Nvidia Geforce 750Ti and have graphics set to medium quality and so far have stayed at 55 to 60 Fps through fighting, climbing, and just roaming around the large map filled with impressive visuals and large amounts of AI. I have not come across any gamebreaking bugs as of yet doesnt mean they might not be out there. The gameplay actually reminds me a little of GTA San Andreas with the gang gameplay, taking over neighborhoods and being able to recruit a posse of gang members to help you fight. I would say this game is a very good addition to the AC franchise and is worth trying out.EDIT I am also using an i7 processor and installed the game on an SSD. I am also set on 1600 x 900 resolution.
