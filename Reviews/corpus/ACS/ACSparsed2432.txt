The overall franchise which does include the game has went down. Better graphics can be found on unity and there are less side activities, and if there are, they arent entertaining. You dont have very many customization options, the weapons are just canes and machetes. The combat has went down a lot to Assassins Creed IV level. Theyve removed coop. The list is just endless. If youre a loyal fan like myself, you may find a lot of entertainment in the story for sure so there will be some incentive to play, but dont expect any ability to free roam much. Ill add one last thing, it doesnt bother me at all but it does bother others that the uplay program is needed. Better luck next year.
