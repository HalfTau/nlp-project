First the positive The combat has been greatly improved with it actually having a pinch of difficulty now, but the LMB mashing is still everpresent. The setting is nice and atmospheric, the freerunning flows nicely in most cases and the killing is fun. Even though conquering london was pretty generic I still enjoyed those missions and did all of them. The story is alright, nothing to write home about.Now, the negative What the hell is wrong with the ports for PC of this franchise? All the AC creed games I have played have had severe technical issues on PC. This title is no different and with no patches in sight, I am dismayed and hope I will never purchase another game from this franchise again even though Im a sucker for it. The game crashes and often freezes on my GTX980 and i5 for 10s of seconds at a time, the screen tearing is horrid even with vsync on and no amount of thirdparty tinkering fixed it for me.After all the t I had to endure to finish this game I cant possibly recommend anyone else to go through the same.
