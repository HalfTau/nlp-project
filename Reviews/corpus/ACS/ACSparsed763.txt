Really good! The story does feel a little vacant at times, but the game is a blast! The combat system isnt quite as good as AC2 but its really good and the combo system is great! The zip line mechanic is badass and makes jacob and evie feel like  victorian spidermen. The whole gng thing us great but I wish you could have a lot more people help you at a time. But seeing the conflict between the police, the blighters and rooks take place at random in the streets is really cool! I would recommend this game to anyone
