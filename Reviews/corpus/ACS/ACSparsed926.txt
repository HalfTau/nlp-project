Best AC game i have played. i thoroughly enjoyed Unity, but with all the lashings from the community, it seems Ubisoft took a few tips and made a better game. it has its flaws like every game before it, but i had a good amount of fun going about the rooftops and killing people with my cane. if your a fan of AC games where you play as an assassin and not a boat, then get this game.
