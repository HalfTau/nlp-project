Liking this game is like trying to enjoy Kix cereal. Its sort of good ... but it just doesnt do it for you.At least thats how I feel about it. It has all the things the other Assassins Creed games have, except there were a lot of other things that could have been improved. In one case, despite being an RPG, it lacked variety  in a lot of aspects. One being that there was limited customization in the gear you received, which is fine considering thats how most of the other games are, but it still would have been a nice touch. Second, the gameplay in general was fairly repetetive. The miniquests were the exact same quest but in different locations, which became stale after one or two gothroughs.On a separate issue, the switch between characters was an interesting application that made the game a bit more dynamic. The only problem with that is it took away from the game and made it less immersive. It also made the characters seem less personal and isnt exactly what the game needed.All things considered, the atmosphere was very nice. There were also a lot of new elements that played surprisingly smooth into the game.
