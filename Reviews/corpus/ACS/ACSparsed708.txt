All in all average game, missions are repetive and two playable characters are strange choice.Biggest mistake is probably the final boss who left much to be desired, grapling hook taken from batman fell bad and destroyed one of the fundamental thing in AC, which is scailing the towers and buildings for view points. Also with solid gun you have no need for stealth, or complex way of killing, just aim and kill.Modern era suits AC as bad and stinky suit.Game have some nice cameos of Qeen Victoria, Darwin and others,Starik feel as solid villain, until you face him and you feel that more disappointed.Next time I hope to see one solid hero intead of two mediocre ones and return into the ancient times.6/10 or 4/10 for fans of the AC.
