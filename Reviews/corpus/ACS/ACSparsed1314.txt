After the slightly depressing storylines of the previous games, AC Syndicate was refreshing, maybe a bit too happy, but if you overlook one major plothole, its a definite improvement. Fightings become a lot easier than it was in Unity, bit too easy if you ask me, escaping a fight, though, is now kind of a challenge. Im not sure if it was intentional, but enemies can apparently shoot through walls. Which is not cool. At all.The city is gorgeous and climbing Big Ben actually beats sneaking around inside Notre Dame. The carriages are rather fun, too, until you get to the carriage races, which are based less on skill and more on luck and get very frustrating VERY quickly. My favourite part of the game though, was meeting historical figures, because those in 19th century England are better than Leonardo da Vinci in AC 2.
