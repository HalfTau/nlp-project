Meh. Its another Assassins Creed. Another with a few tweaks here and there, a few regressive tweaks here and there and a few duh tweaks here and there. Crashes fairly often, decent performance, bunch of BS to collect meaninglessly, with a well animate but boring combat system. Gang system is kind of cool, I guess. Nothing can sum the game up better than Its another Assassins Creed though. Id only recommend this if its 1520 AND if you semienjoy AC.Oh and Ubisoft, PLEASE add some fing temporal anti aliasing. AC games have really needed this... forever. And youve added it into ALL of your other recent releases. The jaggies and most notably the shimmering are just atrocious in this game. Really, really detracts from the game for me.
