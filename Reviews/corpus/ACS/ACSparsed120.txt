I bought this game through Steam but they have pushed trough an update that has killed the game on my PC. Steam wont support the game saying that is Ubisofts job. Ubisoft are useless and offer no help at all. So Im stuck with a useless game with only 7 hours gameplay before the update came through.My advice  DO NOT EVER purchase a Ubisoft game through Steam because Ubisofts janky technology is not supported by the CORPORATE THIEVES AT STEAM. Steam is superfast at taking your money but as soon as you haev a problem, youre on your own buddy.Im looking forward to getting the new Xbox or Playstation and LEAVING THE STEAM / UBISOFT SCAMMERS BEHIND.
