Good Game for the most part. Controls are very unresponisve. Tendency to get stuck on barrels and buildings while enemies attack you as the controls just wont listen all the time. Ive been playing AC since it came out. This was by far the hardest one to control. Once you get it down you tend to do a little bit better. Stupid options like buying helix credits make it a little on the stupid side. Why do I continue to have to pay money for things when youve already charged me 5060 for a game? Why cant I just buy a secrets map with in game currency for 30 or 40k credits so I can get the suit hidden in a vault?If you plan on getting the DLC the Jack The Ripper pack is so buggy its stupid. Ive  been trapped in concrete buried to my head countless times while enemies slash my head until I die and have to restard my mission. Kidnapped Mr. Orwell and he bugged out and wouldnt walk it was like pushing a block around in Tomb Raider or something. Then I was spotted with him had to release him to kill an enemy went to rekidnap him and NO you cant hes a stationary block stab him so he dies...Just know the game isnt perfect or even near perfect and the controls and bugs are terrible. Adds onto the AC story well though.
