Love the game / hate the fact they never udate games like this to play on lower end pcs. I have played many better looking games with alot less distruction on my cpu/gpu. Talk about opening a window to let the smoke out. shewwee and no if it runs my older ddr2 / q9650 / gtx670 like that!!! I will not put in on my core i5 / gtx980. Thanks but no thanks. Ill wait on an update to properly adjust this game to run without starting a fire. a big 14 FPS thats sad.
