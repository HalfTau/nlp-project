Wow. I cant believe it. Im here recommending an Assassins Creed game. An Ubisoft game. On PC. The game is not without its flaws, but most of them have been part of the series from the beginning forgettable story, inconsistent controls and the occasional crash. The game manages to capture the good of the previous installments as well, getting rid of most of the unnecessary crap added since AC2. Hell...it almost manages to revert all the damage done by the games Ubisoft farted out since AC Brotherhood.
