ProsReally huge map.Storyline is interesting as there are two characters to play.Get to play as GUY and GIRL. Wow. TWO in one!ConsYour horse and his carriage is a tank. You cannot die.Controls feel really clunky, difficult to move about compared to AC3 and ACBFGet to play as GUY and GIRL. boo. Youll have to focus on TWO skill trees, TWO equipment customisation. This is terrible as I will tend to research fully before customising and this totally makes it so frustrating for some reason.OverallI will play this game if its on sale and less than SGD 20.If youre looking for a good AC game, Try ASSASSINS CREED BLACK FLAG. Pirates. Thats it.
