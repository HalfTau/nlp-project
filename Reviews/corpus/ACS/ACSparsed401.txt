The pros Decent storyline 2 characters at once plus one in the World War I event You can meet historical    characters such as Alexander Graham Bell Wide mapThe cons Whenever i switch the character, its quite awkward Minor bugs still existBut, I still love this gameIf you like historical events with some taste of Assassins Creed stories, go for it!!!
