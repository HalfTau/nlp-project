Great game. Like several others have said, probably not the best AC game but still satisfying. The difficulty tended to sit nicely in the Challenging but not to the point of Frustrating range, with the exception of a few optional mission objectives, ex. Dont get hit by this certain enemy at all during this sequence of getting punched. The storyline was interesting enough, and I liked having only certain missions be characterspecific. Both Jacob and Evie have a fair amount of depth to their characters. They also look fantastic. I cant currently play on the best settings bc my computer is a bit outdated but even lowerend settings come out beautifully. I personally find Syndicate to be fun and enjoyable with the exception of some of the detective DLC missions, but I still liked the whole style change even when the investigating made me feel like an idiot, and I think its a good game and a good addition to the series.
