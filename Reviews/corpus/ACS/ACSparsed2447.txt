After Assassins Creed Unity I am honestly surprised how well this game runs! I havent encountered one single bug so far which is something mentionable. Ubisoft made up for their Early Access AC title from the last year. The game runs smooth and has pretty graphics GTX970 and runs without any frame drops and I honestly thought this game will run like the pile of dogACUnity was though I liked the plot of Unity, the game ran horrible on any rig during the first weeks of release
