ok maybe its just me but im sorry this game looks like trash, i have only ever played black flag and it looked stunning, i have the 980 ti overclocked g1 gaming edition and the recomended settings put me at high, and not only that i get fps drops into the 40s, even 30s however i did over clock my card saw some improvment but not what i was expecting at all not to mention i do not feel like an assassin at all playing as the male character he looks like a homeless dude who has somewhopping skills but as far as games seem to be going nowadays its ok at best
