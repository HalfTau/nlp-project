The game is pretty good, not by any means a huge leap in the series or anything, its just AC but on Victorian london.The grappling hook was really fun and also kind of cheaty if you ask me, easily out of trouble. was nice to see historic characters such as Darwin and such but, overrall the story was actually pretty decent i enjoyed it, the present day story on this game at least gets some attention and it isnt that abandoned anymore, the ending was pretty bad considering what the story was about and how it ties to the present day story.For present day, other than the ending, it wasnt playble, just CGI cutscenes, id say its better than AC4 but those CGI cutscenes, by looking at them, its just obligatory that AC really needs playble modern day story like the old AC games before AC4, since desmond is no more, as this new assassin that was seen in some cutscenes.another downside, the combat was very repetitive.Visually the game looks pretty nice, not the best optimization but better than unity.the two main playble characters are really good and jacob is my favorite, they have different play styles. Jacob is more agressive and the other is stealth.overrall, ACS is the game i reccomend to be brought on winter/summer sales on price drop, not worth 60, AT ALL.
