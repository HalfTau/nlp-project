Its unity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Also I have 980ti i7 16gb ram and I cant max it out at 60fps in 1080p. I run Battlefront which is probably the best looking game ever made and in multiplayer  ultra with resolution scale  200  80plus fps. SOOOOOOOO yea this is not worth it in my eyes. Gonna wait a few years till I touch another AC game.
