crashes like crazyDont get it unless you can somehow figure out how to anti crash this thingOtherwise, its a fantastic game with fluid combat, just wish I could play it without crashing.Oh, and dont criticize me for having a bad graphics card, mines a GTX 1060. Works well enough for other stuff as well.
