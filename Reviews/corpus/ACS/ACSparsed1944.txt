Syndicate is not only a step forward from Unity, its a step forward for the entire Assassins Creed Series. Without a doubt Assassins Creed Syndicate is the best AC game since AC II. With newly improved combat, a grand and sophisticated map, the option to switch characters, and an interesting and intriguing story, I would highly recommend buying this game.
