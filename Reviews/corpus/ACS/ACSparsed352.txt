Stealth games are my favourite and this edition of AC is by far my favourite. Playing the majority of the game as Evie, her stealthy approach was perfect for me. The story was interesting enough and the map well sized with dozens of side quests and aquiantance stories. Graphics are beautiful and being a Brit myself it was nice to find a game set in London.
