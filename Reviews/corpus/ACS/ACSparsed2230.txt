Looks like this purchase was done with a gamble. Just when I was beginning to lose hope in Ubisoft they just released Syndicate to finish that beef I had with them for poorly optimized PC ports on a consistent pace. So far AC Syndicate runs like a charm on my SLI setup with Nvidia hardware. The game is fairly interesting in terms of gameplay elements with better gear for the Assassins. Overall better graphics though not much of an improvement to its predecessor Unity.
