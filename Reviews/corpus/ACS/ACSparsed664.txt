I love the Assassins Creed series, this game is great too.Nice graphics.Nice story.OK optimization.Could be more optimizedWater could look better.Pirated Ubisoft games You click it and game startsBought Ubisoft games You click it, Steam starts It might update too, Uplay starts It might update too, and finally the game starts.This bothers me a lot. If we bought it, EVERYTHING has to be better than a pirated version.
