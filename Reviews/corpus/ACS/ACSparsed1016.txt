This is the best one since assassins creed 3 in my opinion. great voice acting, lovely city scape, and two cuties to play as. Jacob and Evie are both adorable and hot so youll never tire of the eye candy.  the Horse drawn carts are infuriating to control but Ive always been crap at any driving game thats probably just a personal thing.The storyline itself is fun and doesnt take itself too seriously while keeping me engaged.
