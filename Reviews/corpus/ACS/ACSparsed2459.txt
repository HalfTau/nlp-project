GTX980 Ti SLI performance are terrible.Worse graphics than Unity and even worse performance, SLI works but GPU usage does not go over 70 so we cant say that it works as it should.Sometimes I have 25FPS with a 40 GPU usage.This game looks like the other mess from Ubisoft, unfortunantly I cant get the refund because steam does not let me refund the game. Guys, stop buying unfinished game from Ubisoft.
