I personally think this is the best in the series.The Spring Heeled Jack Boss fight is one of the best bosses in the series, if not the best.Hes not a templar, Not some first CIV Bullcrap just the one and only demon from hell.The Frye twins are far more fun than previous protagonists.London is gorgeous.The game works just fine.The combat is fun and the stealth is the best its ever been
