Amazing game!First time i saw the reviews for this game, i thought its not worth it, but apperently, the reviews arent really helpful at least for me.This game is totally playable, as i saw many guys saying that its not, but i could run it on high sittings with a decent pc, not that good, but i could run it on a decent fps.The storyline of this game is good, but its not the best on the serie. but the graphics, music and the map, i find them the best.A special thanks to the devs and i hope the next Assassins creed game will be awsome.
