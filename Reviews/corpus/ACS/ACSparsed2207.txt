Just finished the game and I would recommend it.The GoodThe Story is good until the end and then sucks.The BadThe controls are really bad at times. I do not know how many times my character just all the sudden went nuts and got me killed.The driving of horse drawn carriages in the game is downright horrible. To the makers of the game go play Red Dead Redemption and learn a thing or two.OverallGood story and bad controls, but the game was still fun to play.
