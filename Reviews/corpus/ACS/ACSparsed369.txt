Recovering from the how that was Assassins Creed Unity was surprising. I still however, feel a large disconnection from the story. Being called initiate barely allows you to create a relationship with the character outside of the animus as opposed to the Desmond era the past few games I felt like this. However the story inside the animus is fluid, exciting and feels good.Beautiful world, fluid combat.Con  I hate the grappling hook. Feel like it destroys a key element of Assassins Creed.Nonetheless I enjoyed this game.
