I hate ubisoft! I hate uplay! Im going to downvote this game just to be cool like everyone else!Nah, no thanks.  I enjoy this game.  I realize this review will be unpopular, oh well.You will see more of Buckingham palace in the game then standing outside the gate in real life, thats definitely something.
