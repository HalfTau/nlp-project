DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It wont work for anyone. There are patches, but it fails to fix the fails to launch issue. The problem is because the game just wont start because it cant tolerate sound files being on any drive other than C drive. Even then it still wont work most of the time. This is not an issue with the machine not meeting the requirements, this is a massive problem everyone is having. DONT BUY THIS GAME, Ubisoft seem to have no interest in fixing the problem. If you do buy it and you live in Australia, you can get a refund from steam, if you live somewhere else, well you just got screwed!
