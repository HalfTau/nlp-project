Its AC game again with some new gameplays and theyre good.Narrative style is fun and interesting. Really enjoy this.Ive experienced no techinical issues. Ubisoft have done their job really good this time.Plus, the performance is great. I played it on PC with spec of i3 1st Gen, AMD Radeon 7770 GPU at low preset and it runs quite smooth  30 frame per sec.
