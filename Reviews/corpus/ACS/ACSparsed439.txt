Honestly, its a good game. They focused more on the actual characters instead of those God awful restore server X found in Black Flag. I didnt have any bugs running it so no problem here. The WW1 sequence was amazing and was absolutely the most fun about this game. Although I must say, if you are new to the series then maybe hold off playing it until you play the others. If you love Victorian England and also acting like a dead body in order to kill a teacher in the middle of his lecture then i recomend this for you.
