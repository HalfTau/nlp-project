Pretty fun! Havent played assassins creed since free running was just holding A vs A up and B down so that was kinda weird to get used to. They also introduced the grappling hook which was kinda cool when it functioned. A lot of the times there was an issue with it, staring at all these ledges that i had connected to before and sometimes it just wouldnt register that it was something you could grapple to. but then 10 mins later it worked again, idk wtf.  Def worth a play through if you like assassins creed. Again this is the first one ive played since like 2 i think? so idk how the inbetweeners have been.
