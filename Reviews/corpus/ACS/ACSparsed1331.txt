bought game yesterday. Game hangs on opening logo. Contacted support and submited a dxdiag file and currently waiting for a resolve to the problem.Wonder if Im one of few who are having an issue? Or that it is a coincidence that most UBI games are buggy on PC and no one reports an issue? Have anyone found a solution?I dont want a refund, I just want to play the game. I just dont think its fair to purchase something and have to wait days to see if it works. UBIs customer service is great... Once they are on the issue... I think. right now, until the day in the future that they actually solve my problem, I cannot recomend this game to anyone on Windows 10 PC.Right now, I feel like Im at a Casino sitting at a broken machine that just sucks in my hard earned money ... But in this case, no fancy lights and sounds... Just a logo of silence.
