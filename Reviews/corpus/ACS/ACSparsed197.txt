Unity may have been the more gruesome wound to the series, but Syndicate was the one that showed that the series had massively lost its way. Saying its better than Unity isnt saying much, as true as it is, because Unity was a barely functional tech demo. Syndicate used the same tech, and proceeded to do nothing with it.How to describe this game? Confused. Disjointed. Aimless. Hesitant. All of these words pretty much sum up the experience. It feels a lot like the Yakuza series or GTA4, in that weve reached the point where the game seems uncomfortable with the fact that the main characters are assassins. It also feels like they had no idea what to do with the setting, in that it spends most of its time shamelessly ripping off other game concepts. From the gang takeovers from Saints Row, to the grappling hook from Batman, to the carriage stealing/racing from GTA, the fact is the game simply has no identity on its own. Its as if the game is ashamed of the fact that its about Assassins.This game feels a lot like Revelations, in that it feels like the game has simply run out of ideas of what to do. Its also why the series took a year off after this, and its clear why, because this game is the same way that London is in this game, a burnt out husk.Its bland in every sense of the word, taking from every other successful series, and not really doing enough to be unique or interesting. Its a decent playthough, but youll get more enjoyment out of other installments in the series.
