ok so this is my final review at 1st i thought the game was bad because i didnt had the nvidia drivers for ac yet but once i did i must say 1st its there best port on this engine so far and yes i am getting 60fps solid on maxed out settings not with nvidia work thing games fun the cutscenes are amazing basicly everythign that goes on in gangs are here and lets not forget that the combat system is very impresive almost like ac2 not easy at all and u can give yourself a challenge by going into places that your assassin level isnt high enougth for it n make it harder for you as an experience . i am a huge fan of ac bought every single one i am very happy that i bought this one as well . NO REGERTS D
