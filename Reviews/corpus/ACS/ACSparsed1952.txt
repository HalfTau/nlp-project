Perfection is a hard thing to accomplish especially after yearly releases in a franchise, but with that being said Syndicate hits that mark spot on. The perfect chemistry between the twins and beautiful additions to the series makes this one stand out above all. Not to mention a flawless release unlike its friend last year. I loved every moment of the game, the game play was flush and controls were perfect. Jacob Frye is one of my favorite assassins year to date. I cant say a single bad thing about any part of this game, the only wish was for it not to end. Perfect 10, Recommended to the highest of standards.
