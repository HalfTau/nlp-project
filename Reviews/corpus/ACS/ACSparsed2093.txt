Set in 1868 London, England you play as Jacob and Evie Frye, Twin assassins. While Jacob is a brawler type assassin who can be reckless at times, his sister Evie is a stealthy assassin who is kind and gentle. Jacob is fixiated on finding and killing Starrick, a ruthless and sadistic templar who looks to control london and live an eternal life using a piece of eden known as the Shroud. Jacob also starts his own gang called The Rooks and looks to conquer London back from The Blighters who are a gang assosiated with the Templars. Evie looks to take over where her father left off and find the shroud before the templars do.While you play as the two characters you meet historical figures in London such as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Alexander Graham Bell, and even Queen Victoria. You can go on side quests for these figures, who will reward you with new weapons, money, schematics, and materials. You can also do activities such as fight clubs, cargo hijacking, child labor liberations, strongholds, and templar hunts.Assassins Creed Syndicate feels less like Unity and more like a classic Assassins Creed game. It runs smoothly and renders well. Looks great and feels great.Only thing that i would say that i didnt find enjoyable is that the combat can become repetitive at times.Overall I would give this an 8.8/10
