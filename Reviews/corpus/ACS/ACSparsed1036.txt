Honestly dont know what everyone is talking about. I played this on PS4 originally and ended up quiting half way through because of how horrible it ran on the PS4. This review is being written as of 10/22/16 so the game I am reviewing is obviously not the game that originally came out due to a number of patches. I am running an I7 4790k OCd to 4.8 ghz and a OCd 980ti and the game is running smoothly. Granted that is a beast rig so my experience is much different than others with different hardware. The graphics are amazing and run pretty smooth at almost nearly maxed out. I have occasional frame dips below 60 but only briefly and generally down to only 56. The controls feel good with mouse and keyboard so far. Im liking the game but then again ive always enjoyed AC games in general. The free running feels awesome and having not one but two assassins to be is awesome in my opinion. All around a happy buyer and a happy gamer with this one in its current state. Hope others have and are enjoying as well.
