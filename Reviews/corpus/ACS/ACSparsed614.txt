Great game. Brings Assassins Creed back to its roots, like Assassins Creed 2. There was finally a good story, and a big urban landscapes to climb unlike AC3/4 and Rogue  which were still good nonetheless. For those who think the grappling hook ruins the game, it doesnt.One thing the game is majorly lacking is an unarmed/nonlethal combat system like in most predecessors. Many times for simple enemies I like to RP where I knock them out rather than kill them. For fighting cops in ACS this sucked as you basically have to kill your enemies when in combat. AC4 had a better combat system in my opinion because of the nonlethal combat system. It could have also used some different cities or landscapes. London got repetative after a while. Third, some parkouroriented puzzles could have been introduced like in AC2 as less focus was on parkour in this game.Other than that it was fantastic. I had a lot of fun in the final fight, and the story was really interesting.
