I just played through Unity and I think Syndicate is a significant step forward in the franchise. Despite the performance flaws in Unity which are well documented, It was just bland and uninteresing. Though Im only a few hours into Syndicate, the entire experience has been far better. Everything that Unity tried to do, Syndicate does in a fantastic manner. There are hardly any bugs though Ive heard of others having them and the graphics are beautiful. its a beautiful world they created and I love it.I love choosing between two characters to play. Its a nice change of pace. The DLC is really cool, too. Jack the Ripper is such a fascinating story so Im glad they got creative with it.The only thing I dont like about the game is that it got repetive towards the end. There really wasnt a reason for me to continue in the world after I finished the game.
