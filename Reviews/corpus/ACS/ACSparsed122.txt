Hey everyone lets review the London Assassins Creedif you are a diehard fan of the series you will proberly like this gameif you are a on again off again i might suggest you skippinga lot of my issues with the game are scaling, laziness and inaccurate finshersone of the newer additions to his game is the Batman Arkham esque combat which is a lot of fun to play with for the first couple of hours sadly the game doesnt give you many melee weapons to really show off a lot of brutal takedowns or fun weapons you either have Brass Knuckles, Cane Sword and a Kukricomparing to Brotherhood you hadSword, Dagger, Battle Axe, Beast Dagger with unquie finishers different from the normal dagger, Hidden Blade, Fists, Mace, Hammer and Halbredthey all had there own unquie blend of  style to them was it unrealistic to have that amount of weapons, yeah but it was fun thowing a battle axe across Rome into a dudes skullthis games combat tires out and i can see you becoming extremly op at the end game with Jacob having abillites to heal himself of damage and barely take damageon the Stealth side of things you play as Evie who is better at sneaking and has a abillity to turn invisable at max lvlone of the cool additions into the fighting system that when you have enemies low on health you can do group finishers, like double, triple and multi killsadly this barely works i rekon maybe a chance of 1 in 3 chance of it actually working but more so triple and multi callsso one of the best features barely works so thats not greatnow in the explorationyou get a grappling gun which is good and a plusbut its slower then a turtle on sleeping pillsso you shoot your grapple hook at the top of the roof but its like 3 pulls of yourself to get to the top so it can take a little bit and slows your movement down fastanother thing i have issue with is the kart battles where you can get shot at but its hard to actually dodge getting shot without carting around a corner suddenly but i dont see why you cant just duck like just lower your head a little to dodge bullets cause thats what i assume there hitting at least,The Side Missions are as followsBounty Hunt Track down a target for the London police, and deliver them to the local constabulary.Child Liberation Locate and free groups of children being forced to work under terrible conditions in the various factories throughout London.Gang Strongholds Find and exterminate enclaves of Blighters and weaken their hold on London.Gang Wars Once a district has been cleared, a Gang War will take place  the victory will gain control of the region.Templar Hunt Locate and assassinate a highvalue Templar target to gain control of one of the districts of London.now what this really needed was a couple more side missions that were more varied just because these ones get very tiresome very fastespically the bounty hunt due to them being pretty annoying with having to kidnap and then move them to a carriage then you move the carriage to the drop off pointbut the Kidnap part isnt the best part due to if u get to close to cops or enemies they start attacking you and the guy or girl will run then you will need to tackle the target knock em outBUT once you are carrying them on your shoulder they will die to the next hit a enemy does so in a lot of cases they will die.NOW THE NEXT ANNOYING THING I HATEis the money and exp dont seem to scale with how hard the enemy isso theres no reason for you to do something past your level because you arnt rewarded for the extra effort the only extra money you get is doing the optional objectives which some dont make sense one is burn the blighters raid plans but the area which it is in is surronded by bligters for the main objectiveso you kill everyone in the areaand theres a cutscene with your boys burning the enemys flagbut why would we need to burn there plans if we own that terroitory and wouldnt my boys just see the  raid plans and be like  oh we can use this lets give it to the bossstory wise it didnt really grab me you run around with a gang known the rooks and they are your cannon foddermeanwhile back to Brotherhood you summon a Assassin who kicksbrits a bit better then unity thou so thats something
