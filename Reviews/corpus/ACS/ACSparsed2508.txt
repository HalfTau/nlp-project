The new combat system as well as the likeable protagonists breathes fresh air into the Assassins Creed series. Runs smoothly at 60fps on GTX 970M. If youre a huge fan of the series like I am, buy it, because its gorgeous and fun, and thats all that matters. Ignore the hate trolls.UPDATEI think Im in love with Evie. Check back later.ANOTHER UPDATEYep. Definitely in love with Evie. 10/10 would fantasize about fictional character again.
