ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! Fantastic story, great characters you fall in love with easily, honestly minus the present day stuff which with what is actually going on in the world makes the overall feel a little too conspriacy theory when there are really  things going on already in reality, it is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. The Fryes and the people they meet and work with, are brilliant. If you havent already, you have to play this game.
