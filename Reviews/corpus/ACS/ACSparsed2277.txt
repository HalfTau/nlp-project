The best assassins creed game, it inheits all of the good mechanic that previous AC games had. Here are the pro and cons.ProsFluent combat experience and bullets can be dodged in this game.Great skill tree system. All of the skills have their own effective function.No manual lockpicking t.Useful gadgets.Assasinate mission offers even more freedom compare to Unity.Great character design. Templar in Syndicate are ruthless but also remain as the overseers of social security.Great Side missions. Crowd mission is back and improved.Great balance between graphic and system requirement, if you want a AC game with the best graphic and no concern of getting a  frame rate, buy a PS4 and play Unity, thats your one way ticket out.They spent some more efford on Modern timeline as well.Amazing Side SequenceWorld War IConsUnnecessary blueprint requirement upon crafting wearables and weapons.Small compatibility issue At least on my computer.Zipline deployment need some improvement.No WINCEST.10/10 Worth Buying, would sister again.Stop complaining about Uplay, this is a offline game and no harm would done unless you are too stupid to wtake note of your account information and save it somewhere then you forgot what your Uplay password is. Tkae a step back, Steam had already mentioned Uplay is required for this game, so why would you buy it if you dont like to use it or dont want to take the time to create a account anyway?I am glad sea battle is not considered anymore, and I hope that it would never come back. The only reason it existed is because Ubisoft Montreal got a excellent feedback about Sea battle in AC3 and they found they have no fresh idea anymore so they just improved sea battle and rereleased it as AC Black Flag, seriously it should never be considered as a formal AC game because the Assassin orgnization in that game in beyound ignorant. By the way I enjoy sea battle just as much as you do, but they should not add it into AC because assassin is not pirate and Black flag is a total failure.
