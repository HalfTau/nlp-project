This is a very good game. The AI is very easy to defeat this is one of the best assassins creed because instead of waiting a quarter of the game to get into the story properly but this gets right into the action and throws you into chaos in industrial age London. The AI is just to dam easy though like you could probably play this from 2 meters from your computer and still not get stabbed by the enemies.
