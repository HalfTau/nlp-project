Amazing game love it alot. It has basicly got all the good things from several other Assassins Creed, like Black Flag And Unity, And the parcore system has been inproved so you dont just jump of some tall building acendetly. There is alot of stuff to do, and it works really well. They readded back the abilty to whistle whitch is awsome, and the abilty the carry bodys so you can hide them from other enimies. And while loading in you can run around the that little area like in AC Black Flag which is more nice then needed, but It does help prevent boardem if your pc takes awile to load. My only complaint is that it is not very well optimised, and if you have a 4GB VRAM you cant run the game on max everything becuase the AntiAlising requers like 90MB more VRAM then most 4GB Graphics Cards, but other than that its Awesome!
