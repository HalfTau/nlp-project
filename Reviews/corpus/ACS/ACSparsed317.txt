Game is crazy demanding especially cpu heavy so if you have an older rig be ready to turn settings way down. I have gtx 1080/ i7 7700k and have between 7590 cpu usage at 4k with around 4852 fps consistently. Stunning if you can run it but faces look awful like wallace and gromit claymationNow for the game its self i havent play an ac since black flag and its awesome gang wars are fun and challenging the bosses are pretty hard. Enemies are scaled by level now so it makes you really focus on leveling and gearing. Theres tons to do the story is good so far characters are kind of annoying but not as bad as others in the series. Ill give the game a solid 8/10 will change if anything comes up thats bad enough to knock off points.
