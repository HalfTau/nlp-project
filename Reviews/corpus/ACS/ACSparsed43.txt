Best buy the game on sale, the bugs will frustrate you. The story is soso, but I do like the idea of having two main characters I can choose from, but maybe in future installments have game play mechanics that differ one from the other, and im not talking about the skill tree where I have to spend skill points, perhaps some skills available to the character, and only to him/her, from the start, or along the way, and doesnt require allocating points. I gave it a thumbs down because I love this series, and this installment was just not for me.
