to start things off, like most of you ive been playing AC for years since its first launch. where as the game is beautiful with many cool new means of travel, i will say this is by far the LAZIEST game i have ever played. the mechanics are pretty jankey at times, i bought the steampunk dlc and wouldnt you know hes wearing that stupid black and red top hat that completely breaks the color scheme. and as for gameplay, as i said the mechanics are really jankey at times however,  the knew weapons and fighting system are top knotch. but as for the story, i will say it is the most uninspired piece of garbage ive ever seen. i got thrown into a game with no idea what was happening. even 10 hours in and im still confused. the game is all about grind and  the leveling system is also garbage. it takes too long to get to a level needed for dlc i bought. GO INTO THIS GAME WITH LITTLE TO NO EXPECTATIONS.
