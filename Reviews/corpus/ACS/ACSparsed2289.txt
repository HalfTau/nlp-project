right this game is mega..i love assassins creed,  Unity should have been this good!the fighting style is best yet..no battering xbutton cos you can counter and the guards all at diffrent easy/hard levels so you still get abit of a better fight later on in the game when you have most of the upgrades,i like the fact you can play either of the Fry twins....the thing that bothers me tho...tryin to get out the river thamesand cant due to the flow, so takes ages then the boat you want to hijack is gone!!!I do miss sailing around in me big ship..just hope the next instalment goes back to the sea an islands like black flag an rouge.but well done UBI SOFT...least it worked from the off unlike batman arkham knight!!
