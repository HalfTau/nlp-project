This is my first AC since AC 2 and must say I am impressed.Pros1. Huge amount of content.2. Just excelent graphics. Victorian London just looks amazing.3. Nice mechanics. Stealth approach most satisfying.4. Has two main characters and you can easily switch between the two.5. Assassination missions are amazing.6. Great Antagonist character.7. Doesnt glitch. So you wont fall through the floor 8. Uplay is now much better. Doesnt intrude at all with proper settings. just play from steam and it directly takes you to the game with no further clicks required.Cons1. Repetitive character models from 5 basic types used on the enemies.2. Skill progression is just a choice of when rather than which. By the higher levels, you will have got all the skills in the tree.3. Becomes easy very fast i.e. not very challenging after initial stages.4. No tombs.5. The satisfaction of climbing tall buildings is missing because of the addition of the zipline.Overall I would score it at 8/10
