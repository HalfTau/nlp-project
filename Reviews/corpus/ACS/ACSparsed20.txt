I personally dont think you should buy this game, because within the 32 hours ive played, the game it crashed about 2326 times. And i personally think that the biggest part of the game is story which you can just watch for free on Youtube i definitly recommend a Youtuber by the name of Zevik who i really enjoy, because he doesnt have commentary over the gameplay making you able to get more involved in the story he also completes the game 100, meaning he completes all side missions which he uploads in separate videosSo in conclusion i would not buy this game, i do recommend buying the game. I however do recommend watching a complete playthrough of the game on Youtube, because the story is incredibly good!Link to Zeviks channel
