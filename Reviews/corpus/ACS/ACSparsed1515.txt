It a fun game. The combat and free running are smoother than unity. The introduction of the grappling hook is a welcome addition to your tool set to traverse the streets of London.On a negative note, I notice that I sometimes lose all control of my character and it takes them a few moments to react to anything going on around them  quite annoying in a fire fight.On a positive note, the graphics are absolutely stunning when pumped all the way up.
