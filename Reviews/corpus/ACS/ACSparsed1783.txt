The previous Assassins Creed Title Rogue put us in the role of an assassin turned templar. This game takes us back to the roots of being an assassin and fighting the pesky templars.However, major changes! Dont worry, no story spoilers here. Just the game dynamics!You take on the role of two assassins, Jacob and Evie Frye. Yes, you read it right. Two assassins!Dont like Jacob or simply tired of male characters? Play Evie! She is quite the blast. There are missions that require you to be a specific character, but in free roam you can be whoever you want and switching betweem them is as easy ad 123.The first time I saw the game world. I said, WOAH!. Well, perhaps I shouted it...I dont know. I did have a literal nerdgasm though. The recreation of London is phenomenal! Wait until you guys see the Buckingham Palace or climb the Big Ben. Its simply fabulous.The combat is still nice and easy with a mix of firearms and throwing knives. Both Evie and Jacob have a set of skills they can train and they have 23 unique abilities exclusive only to them. Whatever you decide to level make sure you grab lockpicking for opening chests! The locked ones are a guarantee to acquire schematics for cool weapons and garments.Fighting is fluid, climbing has never been easier, voice acting is great, the story line feels flushed out, and the world is marvelous. However, its not about being the assassin anymore as it is about saving London. The player will fight rival gangs, free children from corrupt factory owners, and save city district by district from the Blighted rule of the Templars.I wish you luck on your adventures and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did for every second of playing it.
