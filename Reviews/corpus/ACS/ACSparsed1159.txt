The game is nice but it is really laggy and I hope I can refund it because it is not worth the hefty fee. Dont buy the game because youre just wasting your money on a really laggygame and the story doesnt make much sense. I was lucky and got the game at a cheaper price in the steam sale. DONT BUY THE GAME UNLESS THERES A SALE!
