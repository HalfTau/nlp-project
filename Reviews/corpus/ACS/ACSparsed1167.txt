Just finished the game at around 100 completion. Great game compared to Unity. The graphics arent better, but they optimized it. The story is certainly not the best compared to AC II and Black Flag, but its great...If you are a fan of Assassins Creed games you wont be disappointed, the gameplay is still the same whether you think its good or bad and the story and characters are wellwritten. London is tons of fun to explore and the main characters are one of the best in the series. If I had to give it a score it would get a solid 9/10. Its absolutely worth a buy!
