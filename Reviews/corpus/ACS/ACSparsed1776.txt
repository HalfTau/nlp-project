have to have a  good computer to play. I have a pretty good computer and on the lowest setting it was slow and I mean RELLY SLOW. This made me Very sad as I was looking forward to this for a LONG time and seeing the gameplay and how beautiful the game was made me want to play. but  the graphics ON THE LOWEST SETTING still ran slow. I can not recommend it unless you have a good computer. I like the story, the items, and graphics you just have to have a good computer to play it.
