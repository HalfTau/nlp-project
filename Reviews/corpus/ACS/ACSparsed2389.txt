I feel like i payed 60 for 10,000 bugs and glitches loosely tied together. seems like EVERY mission is bugged in some way. just had an entire carriage dissapear during a templar hunt, and the templar that was in it was floating in midair. i dont even think i can re do it. during a marx mission marx himself dissapeared, i was stuck in the mission unable to do anything else. i had to kill myself to reset it, was the only option. and every bug in unity seems to have been carried over bad guys that see thru walls, guns that wont reload. bad guys that will continue to see you from across town, ensuring you can NEVER become anonymous. along with all the everpersistent control problems. if the game worked right it would be awesome, but it NEVER works right. Ubisof FIX THE ING BUGS!!! till then, i want my money back!
