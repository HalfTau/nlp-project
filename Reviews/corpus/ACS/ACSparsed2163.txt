8 / 10 . pretty good game . even though i didnt liked or even hated Jacob .he was an idiot not in a funny way , not a cool guy from my point of view .at least Evie is smart and composed .the melee fighting here is harder than what it was at AC Black Flag , which is a good thing .the fight club is pretty good new thing  from fun point of view , gaining XP or even money ............heck ! even to train for the real missions the skill tree is good .the Gang Upgrading ..... i loved it .the weapons , clothes , etc  were pretty pretty awesome ,beautiful designs and Coloring .Spoilerthe last fight was annoying , i mean really ...........switching between the twins every half a minute .the lazer pushing u back . the last boss should be the lazer not that last guy , he was too easy  he didnbt even put up a fight ...............AAAAAAnd one last thing , Too much Bugs Crashing  . the only game in Steam that crashes right now . it crashes MORE THAN ONCE everyday .you make the people hate the game little by little by doing so .sometimes even the voice when they talk not LipSynced . he moves his mouth THEN the voice comes . its 2015 .FIX IT !! !
