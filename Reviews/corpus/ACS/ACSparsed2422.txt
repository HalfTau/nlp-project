not a bad game once you get past the linear opening missions........nice open world. i will say however my perfomance ironically has been better in Unity vs this game, even though this game has downgraded graphics to mae up for the issues in Unity ..apparentlyi really wish they had stuck with the simular graphics. the graphics are nice but the lighting during the day in my opino could be better  i think to me other then the perfoamnce actually not being quite as good ironically i wish the graphics were better one of the few sequals i ever came across where the graphics of the previous game were actually betterdont get me wrong running around london is nice but at 1440p just Unity felt a bit more sharp so to speak more of a wow factor.i give this a recommedation but i recommend having a good pc for it. pretty cool though running around london though feels a bit like grand theft auto victorian london so to speak wiht the carrages pnot a bad game just wish they had tweaked the graphics better and all. and elimated some of the frustraations with the opening missions. !another thing its just one big city. would been nice if it had countrisde areas or something like that......you know?
