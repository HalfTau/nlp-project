There is a glaring difference between propaganda and creative story telling...This game glorifies the founder of an ideology that has resulted in the death of more people than any other belief system in human history.Karl Marx is not a historical figure to be admired.He has inspired the likes of Mao Zedong, leader of the Peoples Republic of China who is the biggest mass murderer in human history with a kill count into the hundreds of millions.Karl Marx also inspired the leader of the United Socialist Soviet Republic Joseph Stalin and founder of the National Socialist party Adolf Hitler.The inspiration behind the three biggest mass murderers in human history is glorified in this game.ConsThe voice acting of the main male protagonist is over exagerated and not believable.Quests dissapear on the minimap Im not reffering to zooming, they dissapear entirely.Unable to walk off of a knee height box on the ground level without a button press combination.Some missions have reset while doing them.Zipline targets are fickle and rarely ever highlight where you want them to for no apparent reason.You can do an entire NPC escore mission 100 undetected but the moment you enter a carriage, enemies in carriages spawn to persue.Roughly 20 of the missions are NPC escorts in an Assasin game.Unmanned mission specific carriages spawn 50200m away for escort missions that must be used when there are countless around in the immediate vacinity.Due to the close proximity of the destination of carriage escort missions and NPCs persuing in carriages you have to drive VERY SLOWLY for them to catch up so you can ram them because even if you are a few blocks away, it will not allow you to finish the mission until theyre dead.On foot NPC enemies magically slide to the side avoiding damage when you try to run over them in a carriage.Its faster to travel the map by carriage than by any other means.Mission dependent NPCs sometimes dont spawn, forcing you to leave the area and come back later.The respawn rate of general enemy NPCs is rediculous, you can clean out an entire area only to turn around the corner and have them all respawn.In general the game feels unpolished.Pros.Decent graphics.Scinematics are nice.
