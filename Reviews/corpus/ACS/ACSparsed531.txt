Assassins Creed Syndicate is currently the perfect form of the new things introduced in Assassins Creed Unity, and in my opinion, the perfect form of the Assassins Creed series at least until they release Origins. Assassins Creed Syndicate takes everything that was good about previous games, and makes them better, and takes everything that was bad about previous games, and either fixes them, or removes them entirely. If youre a fan of anything from previous Assassins Creed games, play this one!
