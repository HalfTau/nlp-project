As a fan of the series, I enjoy playing this game.Much better than Unity, still a few bugs but definitely less than Unity had.Storyline is nice too, but I dont know what to thinkof the two split storylines for the artifact and Starrick /But I have to recommend this game for fans of the series,its worth a try and I would say the best since II
