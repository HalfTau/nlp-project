This Assassins Creed was one of the best Assassins Creed games in a pretty long time. It took the engine from Unity and smoothed it out and added new features to make the player feel like a badass assassin duo. The graphics are beautiful, the sound production is very well done, and the game plays smooth as butter. The game is very satisfying and gives you plenty to do in your spare time.However, I cant recommend this game, because the game COMPLETELY requires you to pay an extra 10 in order to 100 the game. Thats just a  thing to do, and I really dont agree with that kind of t. Unity did something similar to this, but it was relatively excusable considering there was an actual way to 100 the game without having to pay extra. With this game, theres no way around it. What. The. ? Is that even legal?P.S. Get the Jack the Ripper DLC if youre gonna buy the game. Its just ing awesome.
