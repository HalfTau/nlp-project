So I had never played an assassins creed game before and I sid not know what to expect. Now I want to play all A.C. games I love how the stealth works and the weapons are all good. The only thing is I wish the grappling hook sorry rope launcher would target better. It wont fire at what I am looking at instead something behind me. That has caused me to die plenty of times or what I blame for my deaths9/10 great game
