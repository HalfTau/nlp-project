I typically dont take the time to write reviews, but felt I had to for this one. I feel as if Ubi really learnt from Unity and this game is truly a thing of beauty. The changes and the setting really resonate with me as the player and I am truly enjoying my time in London. Only issue I have is that I cant buy helix credits through the eshop. Thank you Ubi for this great game and not giving up on us PC gamers.i73770k 4.316GB RAMAsus Sabretooth Z77MSI GTX980Ti OCdSamsung 850 EVO
