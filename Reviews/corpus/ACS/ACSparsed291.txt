Buggy to the point where its almost not playable cant believe there hasnt been a patch. At this point, youd be much better off getting any game that isnt touched by Ubisoft and Uplay as they do not care about issues their customers are having. I cant launch the game full screen no bug, no fix. All fast travel icons disappeared from the game, rendered fast travel impossible. Playing this game is literally bug after bug after bug. Gameplay is alright its AC, but the main male character has some awful voice acting. Would recommend you get something elsethis isnt going to be a relaxing experience for you.
