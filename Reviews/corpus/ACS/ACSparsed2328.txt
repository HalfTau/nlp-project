Syndicate is great. Not perfect, not a best game since ac2, but pretty great. City is vast, detailed and beautiful. Main characters are charming and make a good duo. Gameplay, as always, somewhat the same, somewhat new and interestingfirst time I saw rope launcher I thought Oh, theyre making it easier, thatll kill parkour, this series is done for!, but 5 minutes later I found myself joyfully zipping and zapping on that thing all over the place. Quality of the story is subjective, but I enjoyed it. A step back from epic battles and worldshaking revolutions felt nice. Modern time storyline is still told through CG cinematics, but actually kinda matters this time. The game looks gorgeous too, just as good as unity, but optimized a bit better this time, havent encountered any terrible fps drops or a single bug.You couldve skipped Unity, but you should buy Syndicate. Its well worth it.
