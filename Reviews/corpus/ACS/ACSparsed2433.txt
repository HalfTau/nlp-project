Just got Syndicate thought it was going to be fun and epic to play during my free time. Loaded it up was enjoyable and fun. Than started a new game noticed, minor lag the cutscene occurs, its nice then gets to the typical assassin creed loading scenario. Where your running on light which than gets very weird and flashy then stops and the game crashes to desktop. I have a skilled pc that ive never had problems with any graphics before my guess is this is due to some bug yet to work out. Though once they work out the bug that keeps crashing people I will recommend this game. Please if you know the fix reply thank you and have a great day.
