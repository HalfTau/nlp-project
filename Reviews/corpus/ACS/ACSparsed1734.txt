i love Assassins creed im a HUGE fan and i have to say next to AC3 this was one of the best AC ever.there was so much to love about it.i didnt think it was boring at any point of the game.getting skills to level up was much eaiser than unity. over all the game was super fun with little to no glitches at all. i recomend this 100/10 D
