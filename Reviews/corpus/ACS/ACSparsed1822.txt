Ive played all AC games but I really enjoyed this one, stunning graphics, London looks amazing...its just fun!! and Jack The Ripper is a must play after you finish the basic game!For The Last Maharaja there are no voices and main character dissapears in the middle of the game when he finds Kohinoor diamond so yoiu cant finish the game  PLEASE FIX IT ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
