I spent several days trying to get this game to start. Went through various forums and spent some quality time with Ubisoft support on the phone. Nothing ever worked. I could get to the first menu and the white room but the game crashed every time the black loading screen came up. The 41 minutes of playtime are me trying different drivers, safe mode, compatability modes, and random fixes that never worked. The best part was when I was on the phone with Ubisoft support and the person trying to fix my issue says that they fix thousands of these problems every day but then five minutes later procedes to tell me that Ubisoft games have no bugs or glitches or else they would be getting calls constantly. Your support ticket list says otherwise. Thanks Ubisoft.
