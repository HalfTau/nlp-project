From the perspective of a PC game this game was a sigh of relief. This is probably the most polished AC on PC and is very well optimized. The story is intriguing and innovative. This is surley something AC has never seen before and Ubisoft did a spendid job. If they keep making games like this the series will never die. Combat was polished and simplfied from AC Unity and handles much smoother. A character selection based on different playstyles was created praising the player for their style of play and not punishing them, Overall a great game. I wish I had picked this up sooner.
