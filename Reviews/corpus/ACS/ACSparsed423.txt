I think this is a great game compared to many of the previous AC games, since there is so many features, and they reworked the caracter movement which was way too only and overused. it is also a beautiful game, and i really like that fact that the map i so similar to how London is today, besides that the map is placed over 100 years back in time. The missions is pretty much exactly the same  as all the other AC games, so doing the main story and other quests is pretty boring, although the story in itself can be pretty interesting sometimes.TLDR Its not really a great game. but if you like the AC games, this is in my opinion better than the previous games if not couting the first games, up to revelations
