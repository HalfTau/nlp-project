pretty enjoyable playing experience, except for the ton of bugs that make it frustrating It happened to me already 3 times in the fight club, the the last enemy was stuck outside the ring and didnt come in... you cannot attack him. Bad idea to have them jump the fence... you cannot interrupt the fight, so I had to quit the game The mission with the hypnotist , If there are some rooks nearby, they will attack the guards and block him... cannot kidnap him. when starting a new mission, during the cinematic, I get a sudden frame drop to 8. Alt  Tab and then back to the game solves the issue instantly. I am monitoring the Graphic card and it is actually not overloaded, so its not a computer performance issue, as usually in the game I get between 40 and 50 framerate. cannot explain itbut all in all, an enjoyable game
