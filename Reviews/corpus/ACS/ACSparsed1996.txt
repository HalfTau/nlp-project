This game was awesome for the hour I played it before i refunded it. I refunded it because I didnt have a good enough graphics card and the graphics were messed up. It was also very laggy. That was just my problem. If you dontt have a good enough card, I dont recomend this game. If you do, you will have an awesome time playing this.
