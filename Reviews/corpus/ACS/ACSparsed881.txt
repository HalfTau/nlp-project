This game has too many missing necesseties. Everything from a structured story to balanced combat. The Story in peticular is extremely unstructured and lacks purpose, which is a buzzkill coming from a highly narrative game. The game is waaay too simplistic and not nearly detailed in the right areas. It seems there is only three different NPCs, even in gang lords, its ridiculous.Now, the game strives on stunning visuals and the ingame environment, which it does strive on. Although, it seems like they focused way too much on visuals rather than what really matters, gameplay.
