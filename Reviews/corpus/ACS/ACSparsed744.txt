I see a lot of hate towards this game. Its a bloody damn good game! The mechanics have been revised so well comapred to others in the franchise, from freerunning to wall climbing, you name it. The story, at times, felt rushed, but the content and the side missions you can do with historical figures such as Charles Dickens, the Queen, Alexander Bell etc really do make up for it. Got the game from the Winter sale 20 and for that price this game delivered and more.A definite must play in the Assassins Creed series.
