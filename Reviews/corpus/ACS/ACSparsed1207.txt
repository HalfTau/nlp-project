over all a good game for the series, enjoy coming back to play it even now. although the combat and weapons arent as good as its other borthers and sisters, people complain about AC 3s weapons and say there is too many but i always liked the variety in style. in this you have basically three, knuckle duster, kukri and walking stick blade which i never use as the animations for it are in a loop of 2 animations which get boring VERY quick. so i stick with kukri and knuckle duster. i do think you have to have a good pc/laptop to run this game as mine is running witcher 3 and ultra all settings and i run this on medium high which causes fps drops quite abit when running across rooftops or carridge driving. the last complaint is the DLC in one word pointless it adds nothing to the game no new areas or new weapons for you to use in the main game and no extra outfits which can even be said for AC UNITY. jack the ripper dlc quite frankly bored me very quickly having to start again as an old evie where all your hard work building a gang is gone!, so renndered your hard work building it pointless. the second DLC the last marahajara cannot spell it was the most poinltess and waste of money i have spent on a dlc. it was 10 mintues and added not one thing new to the game. it had its chance to show some connection to the chronicles inda story but failed in every way to make any connection. and not only that it was embbarasing to the point i cringed at its acting and animation. it was like watching a ps1 cut scene the sounds was out of sync and everything seemed very rushed and poorly done. However the Main game was fun and fresh and im still playig it now as i love the story, the characters and perioid. so id buy the main game but no dlc. hope this helps you
