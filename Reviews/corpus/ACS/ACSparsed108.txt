I really liked what Ubisoft did to ACSyndicate.First of all, ACS no longer has the parts where you have to control Desmond/Initiate in the current time like in ACBF didnt buy that game, tested it on a ps4. I felt that it was really good as now its only a bunch of cutscenes.Secondly, the games story has a few plotholes here and there but all in all, its pretty good.Thirdly, I liked how Ubisoft made this game feel like an RPG, which was really bold.ConsMicrotransactionsI like this game too much.
