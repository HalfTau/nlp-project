I enjoyed both the base game and the Jack the Ripper DLC. The game is quite different in comparison to the other AC games Ive played so far. In this one, you can use a grappling hook to climb buildings which saves so much boring time climbing, and also the game has use of drivable carriages. The combat has some nice features, such as the special takedown in the Jack the Ripper DLC. Its a mass knife slaughter and this creates a really fun experience as Jack the Ripper.Although the game is quite different to the AC games Im used to, I would recommend this game. Its almost a mix between Assassins Creed and Grand Theft Auto... sorta.
