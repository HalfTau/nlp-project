Assassins Creed Syndicate fixed almost every problem that was in Unity. Except syndicate doesnt have amazing story like old AC. This game has great optimization, graphics are amazing as usual and the gameplay is really good. The fighting doesnt feel boring like it used to in Unity. As you have lot of skills to unlock and lot of crafting to do, you will find yourself playing side quests alot. Even though the side quests doesnt have story. Side quests you kind of do the same thing again and again but it doesnt feel boring tbh. Main missions are pretty fun and doesnt feel repeatetive. And few different unique skills for both characters makes the game maore interesting. You can do side missions in a different way every time.If you like stealth then ACS will give you the stealth feeling even tho the AI are not the sharpest tools on the shed. Overall the game looked really good to me.Some people skipped it thinking its another unity was a mistake. I enjoyed the game and im playing it again while waiting for the new AC. Hope this review helps you atleast a little bit.
