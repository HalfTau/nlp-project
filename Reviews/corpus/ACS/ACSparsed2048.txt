TL DR This game is worth playing, because it is different from the other assassin creed games. It is unique, because you can switch between two characters most of the time and you are given a batman like grapple tool... What more could you ask for right?This game is also less tedious than the other assassin creed games Ive played. Its not like theres over 70 view points. Its not like you have to kill guards all the time, etc.This is one of those games that looks amazing, has a great story which may even teach you a thing or two, is historically accurate, has decent combat which you for the most part cannot just faceroll  at least not until you get the best gear in the game... and even has enough rpg elements without feeling like a grind...I usually get bored of tripple A titles in less than 40 min. This is one of the few games Ive played for about 5070 hours and gotten 80 completion in. And after all that, I can confidently say it was worth the time.
