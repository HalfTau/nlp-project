There are so many glitches with the side quests that its almost unplayable. An entire series of missions where the audio is cut out, unable to finish missions because of some random glitch. The game could be very interesting if I didnt have to replay everything almost 20 times to actually move on.5.5/10 simply because it holds potential. Play the game on PS4 or XboxOne. The coding was probably done properly for those formats and not PC.
