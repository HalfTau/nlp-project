It really pains me to do this,but i cannot in good sense recomend this game anymore.Or atleast not after what Ubisoft did! So ubi just released the last Piece of DLC for the game.The dreadful crimes missions. Though Ubisoft made no promises of giving this content free,it is a given because it was a part of the game at launch and exclusive to one consolePS4.Now not only is it paid,it is also not included in the season pass!So great job at ing us up Ubisoft!Usually iam not one of those idiots who would jump on to the all hate Ubisoft bandwagon,but this is completely unacceptable!
