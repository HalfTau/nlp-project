Great game, bit glitchy which can get frustrating when youre trying to ninja the crap outta someone and get stuck on a twig. And what is up with the hundreds of bad guys in one tiny area? I counted 30something guys in a sngle graveyard with the target poi in the middle. No stelath on that one, I can tell ya.Overall, 8/10. Parkour, carriages, you name it, Londons got it going on.
