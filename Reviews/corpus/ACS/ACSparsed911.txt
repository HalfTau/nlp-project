Its not the best Assassins Creed game out there, but it is enjoyable. The story is interesting, despite the lack of character development and I never really feel like I get a connection with either of the main characters in the game. Otherwise it is good game.The reason why I cant recommend the game though, is the constant crashing ACS.exe has stopped working which UBISOFT has failed to fix. Youll find multiple threads on different forums about the error, but none of the proposed solutions actually works. The error in my case occurs when youve finished a mission or a story arch, which happens often.Buy the Ezio collection just released in late 2016 if you want to really experience Assassins Creed at its best.
