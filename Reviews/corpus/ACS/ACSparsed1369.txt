Well,I can definitely say Syndicate is the best AC game since black flag.Compared to the previous one,Unity,it runs much smoother and its graphics are much more optimized for pc use.Story is immersive,even the side missions,which every one of them has a different story line.With no upcoming AC games until 2017,I suggest that you buy this game even as a pastime game,since it gives you the entertainment you want even in brief gameplays.
