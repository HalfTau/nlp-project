Personally, I loved this game, as someone who greatly enjoys the series, this one was a lot of fun for me. Some of the new mechanics in Syndicate are very interesting and quite fun to mess around with, the zipline in particular. While it does make scaling buildings and getting across rooftops too easy sometimes, in such a large world it is a useful tool nontheless. Syndicate has a larger focus on hand to hand combat than previous installments and I enjoyed this very much. Its a lot more satisfying for me to be able to beat your enemies down with your fists rather than just whipping out a big sword and slicing your enemies like soft butter. Having said that, I did quite enjoy the kukri as a weapon as well. Stealth and parkour mechanics have been improved on since the last installment of Unity, which to be honest I quite enjoyed after the majority of the bugs were fixed. I did enjoy the fact that you could switch between Jacob and Evie, instead of being limited to just one protagonist. Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and I probably will continue to do so, I would highly recommend.
