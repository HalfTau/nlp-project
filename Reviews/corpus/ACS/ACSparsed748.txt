This Game brings back the feeling of the old Assassins Creed games without feeling too repetetive. If you love London, Sherlock Holmes, Industrialisation or English Culture you will not be disappointed. While there are some missions that feel like copypaste, most missions tend to have a unique atmosphere. Even the most boring tasks are made enjoyable simply by the character of the part of town, in which you happen to be. Almost every aspect of London or England you can think of can be experienced and immersed into. Although I hate the DLC policy of Ubisoft I must admit, that Dreadful Crimes and Jack the Ripper perfectly round up the game and you should get them, if you like the vanilla.My Recommendation Get the Syndicate Gold  Dreadful Crimes when it is on sale. I had most fun playing by mixing up story, side and dlc missions. Also i can recommend playing Jack the Ripper after finishing the other content.
