I may write a longer review later, but for now its sufficient to say Syndicate is a good Assassins Creed game.  However, its still the 9th major entry in the series and not going to revitilize your interest in the series if youre burnt out on its mechanics.Having skipped both Unity and Rogue, I felt I could play at least one more and Im not regretting that decision, but nothing about it wows me.  Its simply a competent one of those games.  So if youre up for another AC game, go for it otherwise, skip it.
