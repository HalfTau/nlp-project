14 hours into the game I can say the following things.Progression and upgrading your characters during the course of the game makes the it a bit more complex and feels better than previous games.Evie and Jacob are interesting and fun charactersHowever the rest of the characters are incredibly underdeveloped and uninterestingAs such, the story is very weak and boring. And the modernday story is VERY lacking. Do your homework and come up with something interesting, Ubisoft, geez.Missions are incredibly repetitive, and the  AI make them OH MY GOD WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME DO THIS levels of frustrating.The game is clearly better optimized since Unity......but this is Ubisoft so the game is still filled with bugs and glitches.AND FINALLYNot A Hideo Kojima GameId say pass on this one for now. Youre not missing on anything very interesting, so save your money for something really worth it. The game is pretty average, at best.
