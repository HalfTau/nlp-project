I loved assassins creed unity and my biggest fear about syndicate was that it would just be the same game but different setting and for the first hour or so it felt exactly that. The new features of grappling hook and carriage driving seemed a bit gimmicky. However playing more and more each new part fits really well. The best thing for me is having two main characters. OK the play style between the two isnt that marked but it really works. My main problem with open world games normally is that all the side missions take you away from the main story. In syndicate each twin has a story and they intertwine throughout keeping the pace of the narrative high.
