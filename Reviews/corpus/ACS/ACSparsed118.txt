Its good fun, though it seems to lack in the same departments that other ubisoft games do too. Its somewhat monotonous. Theres little to actually do in the world.Personally Id like to be able to play only Evie, but I suppose this is tolerable.In all, its an interesting diversion and the world is very pretty. Its the standard ubisoft recipe which misses out on anything truly spectacular but is still quite enjoyable on the whole.Id get in on sale, its not worth full price.
