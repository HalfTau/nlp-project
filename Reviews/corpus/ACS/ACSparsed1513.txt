So i have played the early Assassins Creed games 1, 2, brotherhood. I bought Revelations and barely played it because i just found the game was boring. Assassins Creed Syndicate is good. The setting is amazing, the graphics are amazing and the characters are pretty good to. The game is packed full of stuff to collect and do. It is almost impossible to walk five metres without going Oohh what is that there! The only real downside i have is that the game is demanding on hardware, but the graphics appear to mostly justify the performance.Overall, a good game to buy if you stopped playing Assassins Creed but feel like coming back to the series or want to give the series a go if you have not played it before.
