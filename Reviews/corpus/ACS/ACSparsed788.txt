It is just another assassins creed. Wow effect for the city, and thats it. game mechanics are as bad as we know them from the ac games, so nothing new there. Theres a grappling hook now, so you dont have to do all that buggy climbing anymore yay. All in all, quite alright for an ac, with 50 off on steam you pay what it is worth, sorry for all the guys who payed full price.tldr just another ac.
