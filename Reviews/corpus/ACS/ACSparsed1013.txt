This game has some significant changes in play that make it one of the good additions to the franchise.. You can tell unisoft actually listened about their last blunder.  So far I really like this game.  I think its too easy to level up and get good weapons so fighting becomes too easy.  I think ubisoft should make gearing/leveling a little harder than what it is.  But then again... its a ported console game for peasant gamers without any skill.
