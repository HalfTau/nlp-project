ACS was a kind of game, what i expectedPositive impressive graphics believable City huge playground more than one way to solve a quest interesting combat system great parkour improvement to the titles before ! not much weird future AC, means you stay much in the past time without getting interrupted.Negative some minor bugs to much shooting solutions for problems not so cool story and final ending in my opinion maybe something else  but i dont know much more not so complex skill systemI am quite happy with the game.You get some humor and can play as female and male assassin. This is great in my opinion, you can play with a character of your choice. Sure you have to solve specific quests with a specific character, but you are allowed to have more control of your favor character.I like the new and fresh idea of driving through the town, explore the inside of a building and have a very unique aproach to a quest.It feels much more like an assassin, to have control of your personal playstyle.Also i have to admit that shootings become very strange in here. It is often a easy way to solve a complicate situation.But maybe thats just my opinion.I was not bored by some quest. of course some quest are not easy but i was suprised by making choices such as taking a hostile and try things out.You get not punished for doing that so much, what is great imo.Anyhow, i am sure, if you like AC you will be satisfied by this title.Just be open for a new technology time and everything will be fine
