My specs are on my profile page with that outta the way I can say with my GTX 970 I get 50  60fps with the occasional dip to the mid to high 30s. Which Im 100 fine with. I have all settings maxxed but I set Shadows to High and Antialiasing to FXAA. I found that by setting the Shadows to High that made the frame rate WAY better. Now the gameplay is great, the new fighting system is fun and fast to learn. The new Free Run Up and Free Run Down is nice but some people think Ubisoft is pandering to the noobs. I believe it makes it easier and somewhat funner. But if you go back to playing another Assassins Creed game youll find yourself trying to play Syndicate style cause the systems are so different. Eagle Eye can now be used while walking for as long as you want versus being stationary and moving. Also the dynamic of Jacob and Evie are really cool. Theyre easily the best characters so far in a Creed game. They make me hope and wish that Ubi uses these characters again. You can switch on the fly between Jacob and Evie by pressing the Start Button and then clicking the R3 analog stick. All in all it appears Ubi has in fact learned alot from the Unity incident.
