So far im enjoying the game i play it here and there. now i havent played rouge yet nor i have i played unitywhich i heard im not missing much but this is one of my more liked in the series. Black flag is my favorite because who doesnt want to be a pirate. The enviroment looks amazing, the free run mode is awesome. I like the character we meet charles darwin, alaxander graham bell, ect. really a good game as far as i can tell havent really run into many issues or glitches that make it a game breaker. If your a fan of the series i would pick this one up
