My Lenovo laptop can run it with highmedium texture quality graphic quality over 40 fps. Much more better than ACU. More fighting actions added, and more beat up skills. It is not hard for you to gather money, it is rewarded after every single mission with xps to upgrade skills. It is great to play as the leader of the gang Rooks. You have members nearly everywhere. Got so much to say after 8 hrs of gaming. I LOVE LONDON!
