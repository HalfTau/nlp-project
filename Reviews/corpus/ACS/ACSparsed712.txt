If AC 2 and 4 did not exist this would be my favorite Assassins Creed game, theyve learned enough from Unitys goods and bads to make a decent balance in this one.The only downside that bothered me is the fact that the gaps between buildings are far too wide now so youll NEED to rely heavily on your rope launcher.
