All around great game and beautiful too, Just wish there were more weapon styles other than 3, or even the abilty to switch weapons during combat like in the older games, but still an improvement over unity where you had to go all the way to a shop or your hide out to switch weapons, I implores yall to disconinue this singular weapon nonsense... I just really like killing people in several different ways. But anyways I believe combat is now perfected, unity came close but this system is very fun and makes sense and a challenge and now with the ability to do multi kills all the way up to a quad kill also gives me an even more fun side challenge, the animations even match up unlike unity, and people with guns seem to take in consideration who is around before they start shooting up the place. one annoying thing tho it doesnt happen often a dead enemy that has not fallen just yet will pretty much be a brick wall and even stop me from attacking or countering by standing between you and other enemies. I wish I could just shove them to the ground or something like using them as a meat shield in the counter, and also npcs seem to have allot more poise and dont seem to get pushed out the way as easy as before unless of course you are running them over with a wagon. and oh yeah npcs have real conversations now instead of random crowd noise so thats pretty cool, some of them dont match entirely like a woman arguing with a man that was serenading her, but that was funny lol. But anyways I recomend this game to bored people everywhere who cant stand all that money they have burning holes in their pockets and what not. Im writing this review after completeing the main story and conquering all the gang territories, barely played any side quest yet or collected most items and that was about 30 something hours of gameplay, and I really look forward to getting into that especially this world war 1 time rift thing.
