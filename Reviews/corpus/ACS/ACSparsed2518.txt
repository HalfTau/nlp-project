As most British will say, I love this game being in england!The characters are acted really well nice mix to the gameplay to have good characters, I love all assassins creed games, this one really must go down as one of the best games for me!Infact I would go as far as saying this is the best one they have made! such an immersive city and as i already said great gameplay and characters,The combat feels a bit sluggish but when you unlock new ways to fight it just gets better, the story is fun and enjoyable, the combat is my only negative and its not even a bad thing to be honest.The city is so well built with many new things to do in it, and the future story is intersting too. its a must own to AC fans.
