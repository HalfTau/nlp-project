You smash people with a horse and buggy, swing between buildings with a grappling hook, Victorian London is literally your playground. The story is relatively simple yet the character development is fantastic. Eve and Mr. Green are wonderful, and Jacob is a total . The other NPCs also have great personality and its simply a joy to do quests with them and learn a bit about them. I also highly recommend the Jack the Ripper DLC, its a cool continuation of the story of the characters while adding a surprisingly dark brutal element to the game.
