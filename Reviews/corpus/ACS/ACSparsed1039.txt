Suprisingly good game, especially after the failure that was Unity. The controls are, thankfully, responsive and the gameplay is smooth. Theres some issues, like unskippable opening credits, microtransactions in the single player mode, and it crashes a lot after mission completion for me, but everything else is done well and the story is fun. Im not sure if Agnes could possibly become as obese as she is in that time of London, and I seriously doubt there were as any women with any reasonable power back then as there are in this game, but I guess Ubisoft must cater.
