TLDR Syndicate is an improvement over Unity, but still offers less than Rogue and Black Flag.ProsFairly stable and good performing port although small bugs do rear their heads now and then like... whats up with the safe man?Combat is the best Ive seen in an Assassins Creed game youll know what I mean when you perform a quadruple kill, although still a little too easyThe zipline feature helps so much in getting aroundEquipment looks better than UnityThere is some crafting, but it still seems limited compared to Black FlagYou can once again call in allies to help you during fightsLots of sidequests to reclaim the cityFight ClubsYou can improve your gang and charactersThe option to choose between two characters for most missions, even if the characters themselves really arent as interesting as previous games I miss Desmond, taking him out was a mistake, theres almost nothing tying Unity and Syndicate togetherSome realworld story content, even if it doesnt suck you in much or go anywhere meaningful and youre missing the interaction, exploration, and investigation you had in Black Flag and RogueConsThe story pace is slow and seems really disjointed, maybe because theyre running two storylines in parallel, and trying to tie them togetherMicrotransactions, totally out of place in a singleplayer gameNot as much ability to change the world or build your base as in previous games, I miss Ezios fortressYou do not have individual Assassins working for you that you level up, rather you get nameless random gangmember cannonfodder in prior games I used to worry about losing an assassin on a mission, now... who cares? I can hail a coach full of them on demandYoure restricted to one city yes, driving a carriage is fun, and the city itself is amazingly detailed, but the open world of Assassins Creed III was way better.... sailing the open seas and exploring the frontier... naval battle... how cool would it have been to visit old castles in the UK countryside or visit places like Stonehenge? Missed opportunity.No trading missions at all like they had in Assassins Creed III and beyond youre an underworld boss, seems like you would be engaged in some kind of tradeCrafting is there, but it is incredibly simplified and lacks depthInability to dye most outfitsIts worth picking up when it goes on sale. Its not worth the full upfront though.
