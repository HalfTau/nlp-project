Do not buy!! This is the worst pc gaming experience,  steam is great but uplay is just terrible. Ubisoft dosent think before they make a pc game.Firstly it NEEDS to be on your c drive to work, or even launch I figured this out after 3 separate hour downloads Secondly if you can get past the first issue your graphics cards NEEDS at least 3gb of ram and ubisoft determines how thoes are distributed so for example if you have a msi gtx 960 with 2gb expect to play on the lowest setting and get about 3fps, which is just unplayable. How is this when the same card can handle everything else out there at 60fps with settings on ultra  fallout 4, mgs 5 phantom pain , witcher 3 for ex. It just a waste of money unless you have both a large C drive and a graphics card with 3gb or more.Lastly I cant believe how many good reviews this got for the two reasons mentioned about it took me hours to figure thisout because no one will give an honest review. Eff uplay and eff ubisoft Im not giving them even a dime of my money anymore. It seems there only focused on getting your money and not the product their pushing out which is subpar and shotty. Enough said, back to gaming.
