Victorian London is indeed on of my favorite settings for AC.  Overall the game is good and the story is really interesting especially how it incorporates the Industrial Revolution concept into gameplay!What is also interesting for this installment of AC is the gang mechanics. I really enjoy conquering areas in London which gangs are holding. Also the grapling hook is really very handy and how you use the environment in gameplay is also one good aspect.Combat is good but kinda repetitive and combos are the same when you try to observe thoroughly.Would really recommend this game out! Congrats to the developers of this game! Really enjoyed it
