So i had a long a fuing time downloading the game and was so excited to play it, i get to all the Uplay Bullsht and on to the first loading screen after it tells you to press any key. After almost 3 seconds the game crashes. I tried it in Windowed mode but it doesnt help. I wish they fix this soon!needless to say Im pised.
