This is pretty good for being a assassins creed game not like lets say unity if anyone remebers like for me unity just crashed when doing the first mission alot and even in the credits it crashed but let that slide away for now the game in diffulicty was to easy for me since I rarely died but when I did was when I failed following a person because that counts as dying and when I killed civilians and atleast one thing I rember doing was getting chased by a police and after while the motherfocker took a horse and drove over me. so my word is that if you dont mind the easy diffulicty and dont mind  then you probaly think 8.5/10
