Spent an entire day trying to figure out how to create an account on the UPlay thing. In the end had to go to their website and do it there. Then the connection constant times repeatedly. Now that Ive got passed that the game doesnt go pass the initial warning screen. have tried to resolve this by verify the game download but it came back clean. Apparently I could   edit a config file to fix it but I aint going to do that as the game should be working after spending 10 hrs downloading it. Going to get a refund.
