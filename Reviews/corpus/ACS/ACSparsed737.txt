ProsLondon as a map is great.Atmosphere of the game is good.Historical figures were good. Darwin, Marx etc. Optimization is better than Unity.Assassination missions are cool.Character outfits are nice.Changing through Jacob and Evie is nice.Contrling a gang was good.Rope launcher was good. London has a lot of building and rope launcher makes it easy to travel and other stuff.ConsThe game is full of bugs and glitches.Cheap story.Freerunning is bad. Unity was way better at freerunning.DLCs are rubbish. I played Jack The Ripper and I can say that previous AC DLCs are way better.Game is not muliplayer.Dont buy this game. Its not worth it. If you want the story, watch it from youtube but this game is not a good game.
