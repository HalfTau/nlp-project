This barely makes a thumbs up for me.  Unity was the worst assassins creed game, this is the second worst.consBoring as hell story.CoD characters have more depth.Same terrible enemy level mechanic as Unity.No leaving the animus.Theres like one puzzle in the whole game.mehNo open sea battles on ships.prosThe zipline really is a good addition to the game.As far as gameplay goes, it is a total assassins creed game.They returned to the main plot with Juno and all that.The atmosphere and graphics were really good.
