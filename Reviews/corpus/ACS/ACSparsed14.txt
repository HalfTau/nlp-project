There are some good things about this game. I wish I could enjoy them more.Bugs happen. Bugs get shipped. Its unavoidable. Making a game is complex.But actors missing from cut scenes? Progression blocking bugs on the main path? Thats not acceptable.Its impossible to enjoy this game when Im afraid of breaking it.This game isnt very immersive when youre forced to relaunch it every 30 mins.
