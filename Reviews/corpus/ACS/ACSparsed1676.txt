look, youre not going to get 60fps at ultra, I dont care what your specs are youre not.Story is very good but  I suggest playing it twice so the story makes more sence.Graphics are amazing, beards are amazing, voice acting amazing and the best free running of the series, I was able to beat the main missions and get level 10 at around 45 hours, im now trying to get all the helix glitches and chests which by my surprise is actually very addictive,I have a gtx 970 and a i5 3330 and at very high to ultra and 2xmsaa i get 40fps which is playable for this kind of game.however the microstuttering when driving makes me stay right away from any horse and cart but that could be because of my CPU not being up to par
