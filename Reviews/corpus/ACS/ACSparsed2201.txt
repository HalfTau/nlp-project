If theres one good thing that came out of Unity in retrospect, Syndicate is it.I havent encountered something as severe as the infamous texture collapse so far. Game runs smoothly too although its still incredibly taxing and will ate up almost 100 of your rigs resources, unlike in Unity where I got stutters every 10 minutes.Almost everything thats hated in Unity, they fixed it in here, especially combat. Jacob and Evie are powerhouses, as was normally expected for main characters in AC series now, a far cry compared to that wimp Arno. Now you can have more confidence again when you got swarmed by mooks, although you still need to be careful around highlevel ones.
