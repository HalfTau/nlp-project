This is my first Assassins Creed game... ever. I did however play Watch Dogs on PS3 and this feels exactly like it.Overall, its an okay game I wish Steam would give a neutral button because this would fit perfectly between dont buy it and buy it for a nice mediocre buy if very cheap. I got it when it was 30 or else likely never would have bought it as with most games. I really feel cheated that there are so amny things you can pay real money for and what an unfair advantage that creates for some people. Personally, unless its insurance of some kind for ingame assets, I prefer to earn thigns the old fashioned way. By playing the game. But UbiGreed takes it to a whole other level by incorporating things you can only get by spending extra money. Im so disgusted by the amount of things like this that I sincerely doubt Ill ever buy another one of their products.After playing for a few hours I quickly began to appreciate jsut how much Rockstar puts into their games and how different all their characters and locations look from one another. This, like other Ubibroke games starts to look so incredibly redundant that you want to stop playing for a while even if the story is fantastic. There are literally 4 types of enemies... thats it. All that changes between them and your allies are the color. They say the same thigns over and over, wear the same things over and over, and do the same things over and over.TLDR buy it if its really cheap and go into the game expecting things to look the same, sound the same, and act the same throughout the entire game... and if something breaks that monotony spelling? you better believe it will cost you real life currency.
