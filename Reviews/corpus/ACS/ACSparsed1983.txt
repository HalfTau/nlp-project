Purchased a Steam Creed pack Creed to Liberation while back and they didnt really keep my interest with the exception of Liberation which I just got about 1/2 way through before quitting.However, this title is amazing and for me clearly made up for all my previous purchases. London looks and feels outstanding especially from above. I could sit high above for hours  the city is soo alive and crazy detailed. Same goes for the gear love the look. It just goes to show you skimpy isnt always the only thing that can be hot on female characters, Evie looks great! More corset would have been cool though.Being able to switch between Evie and Jacob during gameplay is a huge plus for the title. Ive made a stealthy Evie and a combat Jacob makes gameplay is so much more dynamic. Ubi most of worked their tail off developing so you can use both. Mostly, Ive found their sibling relationship very entertaining which just adds to the story. I like the gameplay so far it feels random and fun unlike most open world rpgs that feel like work. I know, Im just a bit into the game but already its been well worth the steam deal I got for xmas.
