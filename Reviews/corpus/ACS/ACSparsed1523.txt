The counters are clunky and the game feels forced, both in gameplay and in story.  With not much of the free running as smooth as it has been, it now requires more to do the free run instead of the usual Assassins creed of only two buttons to hold, now its an awkward three.  One positive addition in this game is switching, on command, in and out of stealth mode to change your pace, and to become harder to detect. I loved Black Flag, this just leaves my Assassins Creed itch to be remained unsatisfied.
