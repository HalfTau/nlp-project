The game itself seemed fairly good for what time I played it. I had to stop playing it though when after each time I closed out Id get an advertisement plastered onto my desktop. Had this happen once too many times and then I uninstalled the Uplay Ubisoft junk and told them to delete my Ubisoft account. I have tolerated DRM but I will no longer tolerate ads.I will select that I recommend this game because the game itself isnt bad.
