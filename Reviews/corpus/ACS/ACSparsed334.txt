This particular installment of Assassins Creed has some of the best gameplay of the series  in essance, you have the oppertunity to become not only a master assassin but two master assassins, and you get to be the master of the criminal underworld to boot. However, I cannot in good concience recommend this to anyone who would like to avoid tearing all of thier hair out. Why you may ask, simple answer, Uplay. Uplay is the cancer that infects all of the games made by Ubisoft. Why is all the world they feel the need to make a steam knockoff with no dicernable purpose other than to frustrate is beyond me. All that this poorly implemented and maintained system can manage to accomplish is mix up accounts, have an extra loading screen and another useless window open in the background. The only advantage you can possibly find would be the tiny tid bit rewards you can get. Which is not saying much as you can usually never get the chance to use them in the first place because Uplay mixes up your games with an account you deleted years ago, which in my case it did, to all my Ubisoft games on Steam. Do I say do not buy, no it is a terrific example of the franchise, just be  careful to save your refund in case Uplay skrews you.
