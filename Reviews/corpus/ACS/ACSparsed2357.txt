PositivesAmazing SettingsImmersiveLikeable CharactersThe Ability to switch to the character and playstyle you preferThe StoryNegativesThe Portrayal of the Templars after Assassins Creed Rogue is confusingThe Graphics have been noticably lowered probably because of the shock after UnityOverall I would really reccommend this game to anybody.
