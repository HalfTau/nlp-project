First impressions Combat is a mix of hit em enough and they die  im a boss killing everything with one hit. Its not that great if you ask me.First hour of story Cool, just in the beginnig, but I like the style.Lay of the land Cool! like the feel!NPC People Im not saying that women shouldnt lead gangs, but when almost every gang leader is a female and all the pawns are men, it makes you wonder if the devs overstated their point.Movement Its not as crisp as Id like, but its not bad.Outfits Dank. Still cant bring myself to say dopeControls The standerd AC style. I prefer a more crisp style, but its still not that bad.Expectations vs Reality The Industrial Revolution feel is all the way there, but agian, the lack of crispness in controls destracts me. I did expect that though, so I would say its well made.How I feel while playing I do not feel like a boss, which Im good with, and I dont feel like I have no health. I feel more like a guy used to playing games with a PS4, and then playing a game on XBox. The coolness is there, just Im not used to the controls, so I cant preform to the max.What I wish was diffrent Hands down the controls. Make everything more responsive and crisp, and then make the combat easier to grasp.What I like The enviroment, the story, the assassin awesomeness, and the outfits. They really did a good job with the outfits, they really caught my eye.Everything I just said lumped together into a couple of numbers seprated by a dash 7.4/10Great game, unique controls.
