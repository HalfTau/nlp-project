DO. NOT. PURCHASE.THEE LITERAL WORST GAME, WITH THE WORST ASSASSINS I HAVE EVER SEEN.Henry Green cant fight to save his life and doesnt help at all in halve the missions he is in and just sits back and watches you struggle.Plus you can keep enemies in infinite hit chains, so the level of enemy doesnt matter at all as you get them in a hit chaim and youve won, even if other eneimes get involved you can you parry there hits and carry on hit chaining the enemy.The map is oversized and has zero intresting locations to visit, it actually feels alot like they have copy and pasted the map from Unity and changed the textures to suit Britian more, as youll find instances of the exact same structures everywere.READ THE OTHER REVIEWS AND YOU SHALL SEE,FOR WHAT A REPETETIVE GAME THIS IS. That is better dialogue than youll ever encounter playing this game. Youll probably hear Im going to come over there, and wipe you nose! more tham youll hear the punches you endlessy throw.
