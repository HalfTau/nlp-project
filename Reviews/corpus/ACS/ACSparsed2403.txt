Great game excellent visuals, fun gameplay. Player can play as he/she wants, allows much freedom in playstyle and how to approach missions. Fantastic openworld environment and stunning scenery.Game runs very smooth on my GTX980ti. Runs with all graphic settings maxed out including all Nvidia Gameworks features with more the 60FPS. Uses more then 4GB VRAM when maxed out so youll need a card with enough VRAM to cope with that. So people with a GTX980 or lower specs have to lower some graphic settings.Missions and game play are more diverse then the previous AC Unity game. Also being able to play female and male is a nice bonus. Yes you play both I did not have any bugs so far, probably there will be some like every game has, but overall nothing to worry about. Make sure latest Graphic card drivers are correctly installed. Better do a clean driver install and let the ingame settings overrule the driver settings.Hoping this was useful for someone.
