TLDR  Hurr durr previously free and accessible collectible maps are now micro transaction bait hurr hurr.TLBRIA  You know the drill guys...its a Ubisoft sandbox thirdpersonaction game. It looks pretty, well made albeit with the usual Ubisoft brand of bugs, you know, the small ones that annoy you persistently but not enough to raise a huge cry over?We have all been here before. Many many times. Watch Dogs, Far Cry, Assassins Creed..so many times...But this time is different. Because this time, Ubisoft has finally done it. Locked the collectibles maps thats right! MAPS! Plural! there are two sets of collectibles map! behind a microtransaction .And the cost has risen since Unity as well, the Helix Points needed this time is 1000 which doesnt come by often in this game.In sum, Ubisoft has made sure that an active part of its already available content is made that much harder to find unless you cough up 10 euros for EACH map. Look, DLCs always been part of the Ubisoft package, but its always have been adding something extra or giving you access to some high level gear early in the game. In this case however, a DLC actively takes away your 100 unless youre willing to comb thru the huge open world for them or stream a video guide on the side. All of which actively takes away all the fun in a game.Maybe this is an unfair gripe and some people might say yeah, you think all collectibles should appear as blazing neon icons on the map everytime? How privileged are you???. All fair points. But this is a Ubisoft game. With their usual brand of collectibles which always have been accesible to those of us who think paying a fair price for a game is enough to enjoy its content. Not this time.
