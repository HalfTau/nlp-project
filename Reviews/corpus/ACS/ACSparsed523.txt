Yeah, it has some glitches. But it is one of the better AC games. It has a lot of flow, it is fast paced and addictive.I finished it, then decided to complete the silly races and income challenges, just because I liked being in the skin of EJ. Even though I am not a completionist I played on after the main story line. The game genuinely has hidden surprises, and maybe even 10 extra hours of fun stuff outside of the main story. The Season Pass on summer sale added a few more hours, and I enjoyed the ripper. I am 100 satisfied that Ubisoft entertained me for the money I spent.
