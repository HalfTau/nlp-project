I give this one a thumbs up as i more enjoyed it then didnt.The goodIt plays like an AC game.I really enjoyed the exp/upgrade skills system even if some of them felt manditory.1st AC game where i feel like cash weapon upgrades item upgrades and items all flowed well. I was rarely flat broke or so flush with cash that money didnt matter.The DislikeThere were some terrible moments with AI, and hijack quests.I was saddened by a lack of out of the annimus moments, and very few encounters with the precursiors.Shifting focus between the two twins felt like neither of them got deep story development.The main villian, while it was great you get to see his reactions to most of you chapter ends, he felt removed from the heros, if he was present more that could have helped.overall 7/10, if you enjoyed past AC games then youll have a good time.
