Edit By the way, I am Sorry for any grammar or spelling errors you may find reading this.So, I thought I would love this game, I love Assassins Creed, I love England and I love the aestic of the Industrial era as well. As I did not have enough money for it, worked in the garden for 1,25 hours just to earn the last money i needed. The opening sequence and the first few minutes of the game looked lovely and ran smoothly, and the more I read about it, the more I liked it. However, after about three minute it freezes for a second, and then does a CTD Crash to Desktop Now, I do have a slightly worse graphics card than needed, however, since the game ran smoothly, including the graphics, I do not belive that is the real problem.I really Wanted to play the game, however, can not earn enough money for a new graphics  card, and as I do not believe that to be the problem, refunded it, even through, as i have said almost far too many times by now, I really really wanted to play this game.So, right now, I am hellbent on building a timemachine, because, if I can not be an assassin in Victorian England in a game, I can become the only Assassin in Victorian England, and more specifically in London, with an as of yet unknown identity instead, and play the game in that way instead. Which assassin? Just look at the top DLC that is not a season pass in the store.By the way, there is no need to call me a whiny kid. Yes, indeed I am one, but as I already acknowledged this, I see no reason for it to be brougth up.Conclusion Great for the First three minutes Sighes Sadly
