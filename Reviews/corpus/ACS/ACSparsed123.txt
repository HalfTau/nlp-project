This game is fantastic!It does have micro transactions but you dont need then to progress in the game normaly and it doesnt really effect the game as a whole very much either.It looks amazing, the combat is fun, and riding rampaging carriages on a sidewalk safari has to be one of the most hilariously awsome thing I have come across in open world games!10/10
