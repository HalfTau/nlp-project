From what i can tell the game would have worked great on my computer... If the 1.5 update hadnt rendered it useless on my computer. It likes to boot up but stop at the preliminary loading screen. Please Patch this fix! And i know that you might think that it might be that my computer doesnt meet the minimum system requirements. It is stronger than the recomended settings... Please patch this , I realy want to be able to play this game.
