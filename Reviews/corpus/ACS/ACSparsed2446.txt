I do not have much time yet playing this game, however it is very clear to me that this game is absolutely beautiful. The graphics are very impressive, and the lighting is amazing. If you have played other AC games, then you will recognize some of the voices as some of the voices are nearly identical to those used in past games coughcoughBlackFlagcoughcough. Overall, I am very happy with this game. The mechanics are good, gameplay is pretty smooth, and this is one happy gamer.
