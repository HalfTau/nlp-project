I love the graphics, story, and being able to play a female protaganist, but these two things are making it unplayable constant crashing with this message  ACS.exe is not working when Im driving a carriage, theres really bad lag and then it crashes related to first issue I guessVery frustrating. I guess it doesnt matter how great the story/gameplay is, if you cant play it, so Im disappointed to say I cant recommend this one. One would think, after so much time has passed since release, and so many people have been experiencing the same problem, there would have been a fix by now.
