This game is well worth picking up at a steep discount when it is on sale.The movement system is more annoying than in AC3 and AC4, due to the zip line mechanic.  Theres a meaningless Grand Theft Auto mechanic, and everything to do with the vehicles is annoying.  In one of the previous Assassins Creed, there was a note in the Abstergo building about avoiding time periods with vehicles because players dont like it  Ubi should have taken that advice.Unitys broken stealth mechanics have returned.  Leaving the ghost shadow behind makes it mind blowingly obvious that the mechanics are broken  you can actually see that theyre broken, because of the shadow  and so its possible some of the earlier ones were broken as well, but because they didnt leave the ghost, it wasnt obvious.When you are writing a stealth game...a franchise with a reputation for being good......the stealth mechanic needs to not be broken.Running horizontally without breaking line of sight should not leave a shadow.  Running up a slanted roof should leave the shadow at the peak , when line of sight is actually broken  when the raycast from head to head fails.  At times, it feels like the raycast for sight is being cast from foot to foot, and not from eye to eye.  It feels like any little pebble can trigger stealth, and so on.There is a lot of repetition in the side missions due to uninspired building design.The rewards system is totally screwed up, and the crafting system is designed to force participation in some of the worst content in the game.  When you have a crap vehicle system, you dont want to pull people into it more.However, despite all this negative statements  the game is not terrible, and well worth a play if you enjoyed AC3 and AC4.
