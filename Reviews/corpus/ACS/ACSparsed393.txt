Syndicate is in my Top 3 Assassins Creed games of all time.Yes now and again it has its bugs but all games have them occasionally, and they can be fixed with reopening.The storyline is fun, the protagonists are great and the character storyline are also fun.A must boy for AC  fans especially whilst your waiting for Origins.
