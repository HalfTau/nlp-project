Game looks to have potential, but unfortunately literally crashes after pretty much each mission. EDIT looks like the crashing has become less frequent, but it still happens every now and thenAlso theres a gamebreaking bug in the first gang boss fight on the train. The game crashes each and every time during that mission. There are workarounds on the internet the trick is to immediately go towards the boss and kill him as soon as possible, when you get on the train.Not sure if this got patched with the 446MB update.Definitely do not recommend until the crashing issues have been fixed.
