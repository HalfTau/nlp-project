Although it has a fun story, its basically like unity where it isnt related much to the other stuff. Furthermore, being modern, it does not impress me like the older more interesting Creeds. The Ais are extremely done and the combat is a cross between punching at most and counters. The view in my opinion is very uncomforting and it seems to low. Im not sure if first person is possible but I could not find the option and would rather prefer it in first person, or at least have the ability to change view. I just hope the things like sneaking and the Ai minds get improved and I may reconsider this game.
