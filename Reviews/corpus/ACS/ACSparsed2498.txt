After playing Fallout 4, and now Syndicates, there is such a shocking contrast that it has opened my eyes to how much Ubisoft is streets ahead of their competition!This game runs brilliantly on my GTX970  the attention to detail in these games is truely incredible.It makes Fallout 4 look like a bunch of amateurs! Their cities are a couple of houses plopped in a field, here is a detailed city that sprawls endlessly where every location is still unique and is alive.I cant recommend this game enough!Its fun, London is amazing, the characters voices and motion capture are awesome Ubisoft really is amazing at this.And to anyone contemplating Fallout 4, go buy Dying Light which is a much much better game than Fallout 4.
