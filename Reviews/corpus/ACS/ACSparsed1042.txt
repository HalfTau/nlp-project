10/10, Jacob sucks, I hate him and the fact you guys tried to do a redemption arc literally the last chapter of the gameEvie is great, Henry x Evie was greatThe landscape was great, the missions are great. End battle made me wanna shoot myself in the head.ConsCrashes sometimes during cutscenes, but its ok I dont really mind since I mostly skip them anywayThe controls can get confusing at times???? Ive experienced multiple glitches where horses would literally just FLY into the sky like a ragdoll then land on me. Very annoying and it does damage to my health
