So, Syndicate.Twins try to wrestle control of London from the Templars. We learn that in the first 5mins and nothing changes till the very end.If you like the Gameplay or like poking around old London and meating real historical characters, great.If you like a good story ala Black Flag this is woeful and abysmal. No story telling because there is no story.Dc
