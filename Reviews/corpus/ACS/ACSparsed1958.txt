i hate to give it a negative review, but the game crashes so often that i had to. /had high hopes for this one but well, it was all put down by how often i get crashes and the time spent on fixing them, which cant be helped.tried for a refund but they said i spend more than 2hours playing it which mostly was used to fix the problem. good luck buying
