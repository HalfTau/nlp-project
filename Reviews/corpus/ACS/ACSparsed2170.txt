Let me start out by saying that I loved Unity. This game is basically a reskin of Unity, but it doesnt have all of the performance issues many people were having. It runs really solid even with high settings.The story in this game is not as solid as some of the previous games, but the game makes up for it with the characters. I havent had this much fun with AC characters since Ezio. Jacob and Evie are the best thing to happen to the series in my opinion.There is lots of variety with missions and lots of ways to accomplish things. Combat has been made easier since Unity which opens up the possibility of going in guns blazing or picking one of the other methods. Speaking of which, I really love during assassination missions that there are multiple different ways presented to the player to accomplish it. That was something from Unity that I was glad Ubisoft kept, its a great mechanic.The ending was a letdown, but I dont think it could have outdone the ending in Unity.All in all, I wish I could unplay this game just to play it again for the first time. I laughed a lot during it and really took an interest in the characters. The gameplay was fun and smooth. Besides, who doesnt love hijacking carriages from someone and leading police on a lowspeed chase?
