Havent played that much so far, but the performance is much better than Unity postpatch.I get 55 FPS pretty consistently on my GTX 780 with high settings no Gameworks stuff.It controls nicely so far, looks great, is really funny so far. Jacob and Evie are great.I will update this review once I finished the main story.Edit Now after 8 hours, Im really happy with the game. Definitely recommended, especially if you are fan of the franchise already.Edit 2 After 55 hours of playtime, I 100ed the game.I really enjoyed the main story and the side missions were quite good.Collectibles are also much better than in Unity and most have a purpose.Helix Glitches unlock really interesting Reconstructed Data trivia.Music Boxes unlock a dope outfit, Flowers further the storyline.The beer bottles are probably the least interesting collectibles.I encountered a few minor bugs while playing and my game crashed a few times, at the end of missions. Never lost my progress though.This is definitely one of the best AC games in a long time. Reminds me of AC2, quite a bit.
