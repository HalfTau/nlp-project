Riddled with mirco transactions, XP boosts for a single player gamer? Combat is literally just mash a button, hitting the same man 20 times then occasionally push a diffrent button turns out lethality is a thing, but the combat still never gets advanced. Combat doesnt feel fluid or satisfying its all rapid swinging and jerkyness. Performance seems not great and Uplay is still garbage.I really miss the ability to gently push past citizens without disturbing them. I also miss being able to temporarily use large and diffrent weapons, kept the combat fresh. Gets kind of stale without it.Almost all of the cutscences and dialouge is cringy as all hell. I can feel from playing it for a hour that the story wont be good and the characters wont be fleshed out. Im honestly getting a little upset, i keep hearing these twins go on about this father character over and over. Yet i sit her 8 hours in and still know nothing about him, they havent expanded to his character at all. They just keep mentioning him over and over. Its bloody annoying.On top of that I get very frequent freezeing and crashes. Awesome.It seems to just get worse the more I play. I have had quite a few instances where i would go to jump off a building or a ledge and i just get stuck or glitched in it. Very distrubing, very disapointing.The whole gang concept seems pretty cool, and some of the cosmetic choices are cool. But thats it,Other than that, it seems like yet another unpolished release to milk a long running franchise.So far Awful dont even want to finish the game.1/6
