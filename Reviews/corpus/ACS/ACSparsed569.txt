I love the characters so far and I want to experience the story... but..The grappling hook you get just a few hours in killed the game for me. And the combat is FAR from what we knew in every other Assassins Creed game since AC2. There is no real choice in weaponry and the animations are stiff as hell. Remember the smooth motioncapturelike combat from every other AC game? Not here.This is basically an Batman game with that grappling hook and cartoony combat. And If you think the grappling hook is optional like it was in a game like Dying Light, it isnt. They have you use it in main story missions.To me Assassins Creed has been held up by three distinct pillars Free Running, Combat, Story. If one doesnt hold up, the game is screwed.They improved the Free running from Unitywhich to me was notoriously bad, but made free running obsolete with the grapling hook gun that can pull you up Big Ben in a matter of seconds. Why? And why force us to use it?A good story is really all just preferential anyways. but I havent played an AC story I dont like.The combat. Well its terrible. It is nothing like what Assassins Creed was all these years. As I said the animations are stiff and feel like they are stuck in fastforward mode. And you get practically zero choice in weaponry.If none of these issues bother you then be my guest and grab Syndicate. Otherwise this is the first Assassins Creed game and Ive played nearly all of them I could NOT recommend.MakeAssassinsCreedGreatAgain
