When compared to Unity this is a good improvement in terms of the Port Job. Impressive visuals and beautiful atmosphere. I am 4 hours into this game and it looks like they have given lots of importance to the core gameplay and the city London. I am really starting to like the FYRE twins and other characters. I will not reveal anything about the storyline but its definitely better than Unity. Also till now there is no Out of Animus gameplay like the Ezio/Altar series, Lets hope there is something later in the game.I will definitely recommend this game to all Assassins creed fans.I5 3570k, 16gb ram, 2gb GTX 760, HDD 1 TB1080p  Environment  Very high, Textures  Medium, Shadows  PCSS, HBAO ULTRA, MSAA 2x  FXAASolid 3540fps  Feels smooth and am using an xbox controller.
