Im honestly quite disappointed in this chapter. Ive been following all the AC games except for ACU and while ACS seems to have fixed quite a few problems everyone was talking about from ACU, everything didnt quite flow as well. Firstly I know its alot to expect such a rich game to be optimised for PC but even on low settings it cant seem to run smoothly on my dedicated graphics card. That totally takes away from the experience. Not to mention how glitchy some scenes were.The new open world and multiprong approach is interesting and I love the new stealth options but some elements of smooth combat seemed missing. Combat feels rather disjointed most of the time you seem to be able to handle only one dude at a time unlike the multiple assassination combat in ACIIIV.The most disappointing part was actually the plot which was neither engaging nor satisfying  you dont actually feel like you want to find out more and I find myself playing just to complete the game. Most of the time plot points dont link up very well and overall it just felt like you are completing minitasks instead of an overall plot.Overall ACS should still be better than ACU but still a stretch even from ACIII and Black Flag. WHY UBISOFT! WHYYYY
