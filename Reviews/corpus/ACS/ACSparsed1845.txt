Writing this review from an experience of all the series of assassins creed.From the start till the end i was there,i saw the greatest hits of the series,and i saw the worst times when the title broke down with a big dissapointment of both story and gameplay.Unfortuntly,i can say that like many,i lost the hope in Assassins creed series over the years,i gave it a chance several times,and i had a hope in me that probably the yearly title will give me a hype again when it comes out,i lost that hope once in the day of unitys release.i can say that i did not expect much from the new title Assassins creed syndicate,i did not spend time reading news and watch trailers,also i did not preorder it but bought it on winter sale for half price compare to the last titles i used to pre order.i can say that after spending 10 hours of this title,i know that its not the best title but i can say that yet,its the best title i played since Assassins creed 2.and heres why ProsStablize performance and amazing graphics Big and living city as londonthe exploring is more attractive now since you get a new tool to move from one building to another in a quick time,which makes it easier to travel to long distances. there are many objectives to do on the map,and the combat system is hard if you like challenges. you play two characters who both represent different perspectives and ways of gameplay.Cons  it feels like the missions are quite similar,the idea is same the switching between characters is quite annoying you can find several bugs in the parkour/combat actionsso,i was surprised for good this time,and i heard that the next assassins creed will be released only in 2017,which means ubisoft finally tries hard to make us satisfy with a well made game,theres a hope fellas.
