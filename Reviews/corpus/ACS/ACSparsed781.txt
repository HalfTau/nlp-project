Well, after the release of AC Unity and Liberation, I thought the series is about to die, but I guess I was wrong.ACSyndicate has changed my opinion about Ubisoft again.The game has a very nice story and no glitches as far as I have seen. Compared to ACUnity, this game is 10 times better.The movement system is pretty fluid and you dont get stuck every now and then. There are a lot of side missions, and it is really fun to conquer the Boroughs of London.The story, follows the life of Jacob and Evie Frye, the twin assassins, who have come to London to help the assassins liberate it from the control of Starrick the Grand Master Templar. Rest, I guess you should get to know by yourself! Go buy one and imberse yourself in this great game!
