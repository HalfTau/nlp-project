Assassins creed syndicate isnt fun to me, sorry ubisoft.The story for assassins creed is going downhill. To me it used to be one evil corporation fighting another almost as evil corporation, to shape the outcome of the human race, because of humanities past mistakes.Now that dark cool story has turned into a bunch of ninjas who are fighting a video game company.The assassins are a slowly turning into a to cool for school clichAnd the Templars are a jokePeople think Unity killed the series. I think Black Flag killed the series, I am not saying black flag wasnt fun I am simply saying that black flag took the story down a path that it shouldnt have went down and now its going to be hard to come back from that.I just miss Desmond miles becoming the ultimate weapon who would take down the future Templars with the help from the memories of his past. I really dont like playing as a 95 so and so with an ipad and no spine. Hey you, yea you go hack this company because i said so...   Yea ok...
