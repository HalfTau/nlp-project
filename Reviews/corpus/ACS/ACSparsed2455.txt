Graphics on AMD R9 280DirCU apparently crash atm, couldnt find bugreport on Ubisofts homepage, Ill change this after the first update!Ok, ATi made an update so it is now playableFirst impressionsNo backstory  I really miss that. They just jumped in the story not knowing why are they doing what they are doing. Cutscenes are ing everywhere and it takes down playability. It was one of the best things in AC2 and 3 and 4 and even Unity to see what drew them to become assassins and the cutscenes where farely short but held a great message. Really only thing what to do is to do the same missions over and over, collecting smalleverywhere and progressing way to complicated. Also the modern day story is just too vague and not that imersive, one of the main things I do miss in AC, some people like it, some dont. I dont like just watching some cutscenes and expect to actually call it a game.Graphics are nice, Getting good performance at high settings, even though I have a min spec comp. Some issues earlier but it sorted itself out.Gameplay is kinda cool, but knowing actual factual history, women were not even allowed to drink or smoke, not allowed to vote, so how the  are they the hardest enemies? It may sound misoingIdontknow but Ubisoft, dont cater to ing Femfreq orlike that. It takes down on the whole francise and the game isnt developed freely.Other than that, very repetitive, cooland good graphics, no microtransactions or buy to win or multiplayer, seems that Ubi actually improved from Unity. I do want to recommend the game, but only to the extent if you do like the series, you do like the game. Idd give it something along the lines of 9 GFX, 7 Story and 6 Gameplay, so around 8/10
