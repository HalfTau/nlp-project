Honestly? I had just lost all hope in the Assassins Creed Franchise, especially after AC III and AC Unity.But from the looks of it, it appears that Ubisoft finally set the foot back on track! Especially storywise, this game unravels things of absolute importance. Ive played the whole story, most of the side missions, and even though theyre pretty much the same, the freedom of approach and the fact that you can play with 2 different assassins makes the fun all the double.The personality of Jacob is just hilarious Guard Weapons?  Jacob No thank you! Ive got my own! LOL and on the other hand Evie, serious and careful, rapresents how and Assassin really should be.Of course you will be most certainly experiencing some major glitches as carriages on one another and your very own character getting stuck between two cars of your own train, but over all, this game is finally one Assassins Creeed worth buying ps Im in love as most players by now with Mrs Evie Frye  play the game and you will too D
