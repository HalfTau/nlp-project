Breathtaking world design, interesting main characters and gameplay innovations werent enough to bring glory to this franchise that it once used to have, but it certainly is a step in the right direction.Rough around the edges, but with the great core set in, latest installment in this series brings us a story of brother and sister, two assassins fighting against the corrupt and unfair who take advantage of the less priviledged ones.Assassins Creed has long deviated from being a game that was once very well known for intriguing story and lore to the point where the story is rather unpolished and uninspiring. Following the path of Jacob and Evie, the main focus will be on character development discarding the usual story that Assassins Creed was recognized for.On the other hand, while mainly focusing on character buildup, its the first time in a while that story has a certain direction. Modern day while minimal, leaves rather interesting story left to be explored.Gameplay is the reminiscence of the good old Assassins Creed 2 gameplay, that brough novelty to the series. Combining exotic animations that Ubisoft games are well known for, new tool to travel called Grappling hook that offers troumendous help in covering the large parts of city jumping from one building to another, lots of gameplay variations and approaches to the target, Syndicate leaves nothing more to be desired. Gameplay although feels fleshed out and redefined is unfortunately crippled with atrocious AI and standard openworld syndrom that most of the Ubisoft games suffer from. Although vital improvements have been made in this part of the game, certain segments of the game are yet to be improved upon.Technically improved over the mess thats called Unity, but visually downgraded, Syndicate doesnt bring nothing very interesting to the table on this aspect. Optimisation is far better in this game, which is the result of far less interior areas and decreased crowd volume.Soundtrack on the other hand is amazing and brings unique charm and vibe to the London area.If you are fan of Assassins Creed series, the answer is yes with finally some direction in mind regarding the story and fleshed out gameplay. If you are not, this game offers nothing that would sway your opinion in the complete opposite way so maybe you should rethink your purchase.If you liked this review, please consider subscribing to our curator page here
