Great Performance on a GTX 980 and an i7 4790K with 8GB of Ram! Well I mean if you wanna max out Nvidia style, well good luck maybe youll acheive 60fps in 2016. The game will drop to 40fps in the first mission with GW on. So do yourself a favor. Use only HBAO because HBAOUltra takes 10fps, yeah you heard right. And Turn off PCSS/PCSS ULTRA. With PCSS you loose 20fps and with PCSS Ultra 35fps. So basicly Im running the game with PCSS off, HBAO , 2xTXAA and everything else on max. Averaging 7080fps with ease.Id say its a great optimized game so far. The only bad thing once again is Nvidia and nothing else. So just turn those features off and enjoy a great game!
