Assassins creed syndicate is a gorgeous looking game with some very good gameplay ,but is it a series reviver? NO. After the terrible fate of unity which almost failed in all departmentsexcept graphics with game breaking bugs, glitches and not to mention its terrible story and characterisation i can see why ubisoft made a game like Syndicate. Through this game the developers just wanted to please the fans and to tell them that the series still has some hope. They have achieved this through some various cool aspects such as the new gameplay mechanisms and adding some very good humour to the characters and story with a beautiful open world . The story is so forgettable that at times you wont even remember the reason for assasinating a person.Pros Jacob and Evie frye the twin assassins Humour The open world architecturemost accurate depiction of victorian london in industrial evolution Gameplay Brutal, Fast and responsive, awesome kill animations PC Port is great with very minimum bugs and glitchesCons Story It doesnt truely have one.It just tells you to assassinate random people with little to no reason at all ,again its typical useless ubisoft mission design. I dont know what kinda meds the writters were in during development of the story , Because the story is what made the game series popular in the first placeThe Open World Itself It is just a big beautiful and dumb open world with nothing much to do, It would have been better if they had concentrated more on story telling other than this dumb open world.Mission designVilliansLack of diversityThe rift missionsMotion blur i see what they did there, it makes you care less about the texture pops and you cannot turn that offCloth animationThe ending N0, i dont wanna talk about it. It was that badIt is just a fun game with no replay value . It is not worth the full amount but if you find it on a sale you can pick it up . It offers you some good gameplay. The franchise which gave great games like AC2, brotherhood, revelations, black flag offers a mediocre game. The series does not deserve such games.I recommend it because it is surely worth  one time play. Overall a fun filled game which offers some cool moments.
