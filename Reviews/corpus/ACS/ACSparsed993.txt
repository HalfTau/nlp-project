I will start off by saying this is in no way the best Assassins Creed game. However, it is a huge improvement from Unity. Being a fan of the series I was disappointed by Unitys performance. This game is what brought me back to the franchise, its the old AC game I enjoyed but with a few new elements to make it seem fresh and new. Definitely would recommend to those who have already experienced the Assassins Creed games.
