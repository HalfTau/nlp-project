Seriously the whole idea about having to play twins is completly unexiting. The perks are usless and in general game is boring. London locations are repetitive I feel I will need to force myself to finish this game. It is much worst than Black Flag. Missions are just boring and there is literaly no fun. On a top of that you need to install uplay. I got it from 50 sale. Not worth the money. At most 7 euro/8 dollars. Oh and there are also glitches.
