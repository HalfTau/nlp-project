Assassins Creed SyndicatePublisher  UbisoftDeveloper  Ubisoft Quebec and other Ubisoft entities.Instalment number major releases in the Assassinss Creed Series  9thReview by a very casual gamer Even if I declare myself as a casual gamer, Assassinss creed series is something which is very close to my heart.Right from the days of Altair/Desmond to Ezio/Desmond to various other protaganists of the series, it has left me in an awe and asking for more Im saying this keeping in mind the epic failure of Assassins creed Unity!.Jumping straight into the enviornment  London, right from a classic Victoria Era painting. The buildings, roads, pavements, clothes, horsecarriages, steam engines and every other freaking thing in the game has written London over it. I personally feel this is the best reproduction of the game after Ezios Rome.Into the gameplay, I will say it is a great improvement from its predecessor  Unity!Bugs are almost extinct and the end result is a smooth and fluid sandbox game. Apart from the usual parkour mechanics of Assassins creed, Syndicate introduces a new equpiment  Zipline. Yeah a freaking zipline!. This is a great shift from the evergreen climbing the buildings. You can also use it to zipline from one building to far away building, also hanging in the middle of the zipline to admire the view of the city and also wait for your target to arrive below to air assassinate!Story  You play two characters  Male and Female  Brother and Sister combo Spoilers  No GoT action in the game Thank God!. Charracters are well written and the dailogues between reminds me of typical fights and coversation between siblings. The game also have few famous historical characters like Charles Dickens, Queen Elizebath, and many more for whom you have to complete missions to progress.Overall this game is fantastic. A must play for every gamer irrespective of their alligances towards particular type of genre or series.
