I just cant................Ive played Brotherhood, Black Flag, Syndicate.Im done with these wonkycontrols.You know that feeling when you are playing a game with a friend and for a split second you think you are the wrong character and are like WHAT THE  oh I was looking at the wrong character thats how the AC games play, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much potential, but the ENTIRE TIME im playing an AC game i cannot shake that ragequit inducing feeling like im looking at the wrong character.Theyre never gonna change it. I would play every AC game for life if they didnt have these quicktime event controls lol.Its like an abusive relationship, i keep giving them a second, third, fourth, fifth chance and they never change, but they got the good stuff so i try over and over to put up with it.Well thats it, im never coming back...this time I mean it..
