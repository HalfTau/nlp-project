Although the enviroment is amazing, gameplay is awesome. Enough to do inside the game....IF you can actually play it without crashing at the thames.Alot of people have this problem and nothing was done about it.So basically you buy a broken gameDONT  BUY IT, unless you are absolutely sure you can play it without the damn thames area bug!
