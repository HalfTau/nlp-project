This is probably one of my favorite games, with a really well done redesigned parkour system along with the amazing look and feel of the game gives it to the aspect of real life london.The game starts out simple, but as you progress finding more and more about how the game works, it pushes you to thrive for more, this being the first assassins creed that has two players that you can play as, and the first to offer the Grappling Hook.I deffinantly reccomend this game for being overall amazing.
