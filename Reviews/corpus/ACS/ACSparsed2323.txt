This is only a first impressions review for now, but I must say I was very much pleasantly surprised with this game.Performancewise, especially. I have a GTX 950, so not that beefy of a GPU, but I was able to run this game smoothly with medium settings, and the game still looked great. Often with games the lower settings always ended up being significantly uglier, but this game is still quite the looker even in medium graphic settings. I had around 6030 FPS while playing, and it never dropped below 30, even in the denser areas. Mostly stayed around 60 to 50, which was totally fine for me and gave me a smooth enough experience.What also gave me a pleasant surprise was the gameplay itself. With AC games I usually get bored within the first hour or so, but I can tell Im going to be investing a lot of time into this game, because its such a fresh new take on the AC franchise. Im obsessed with the stealth system this time around, especially since Ive always found the stealth aspect in the AC games to be lackluster, ironically. And the combat is so much more fluid and fun.Even the characters I already like. Evie and Jacob each have their own personalities, so theyre not just wooden planks like whoever was the name of that main character from Unity.I was strongly against buying this game at first, but now I honestly dont regret doing so. I havent been this thrilled over an AC game in a long, LONG time, and frankly I thought I never would be again. But so far, Im loving what Im seeing.
