Assassins Creed Syndicate is, so far, the best game in the series. It definitely trumps the likes of Assassins Creed 2 and Black Flag. The London environment feels so lifelike and the combat is extremely satisfying. I found the story to be primarily engaging, running around London helping out the likes of Alexander Graham Bell, Charles Darwin and even Queen Victoria, but at some sections it felt a bit lackluster. Syndicate adopts Unitys revamped parkour system, making movement seamless and fun. If only it had used some other assets from Unity, I would have liked to see more customization when it came to costumes  they all kinda felt the same to me.Assassins Creed Syndicate is a fantastic game and is definitely worth your time.9/10
