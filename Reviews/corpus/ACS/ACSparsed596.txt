A box was floating around and being carried by an invisible person during a cutscene. 10/10, wish I could watch that again.One of the best games in the Assassinss Creed series. The setting is nice, the city is alive and gorgeous, I havent finished the game yet but so far there is little to no real world t that you have to play through, there is a grappling hook and you can be batman, you can rob trains and boats, there are tons of things to do and level up, fighting and stealth systems are great.There are bugs, there allways will be bugs in AC games but the game is so immersive that a couple bugs here and there shouldnt bother you.
