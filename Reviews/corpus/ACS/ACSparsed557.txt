This is a great addition to the Assassins Creed franchise and a great step forward in terms of functionality and controls. After the trainwreck that Unity was, this game was a breath of fresh air. Having a setting in London was a perfect next step also. Great graphics, compelling dynamic between the twin brother and sister duo, great leveling system and a ton of other great improvements. Though, this game isnt perfect. The storyline couldve run together a bit more logically along with that, the ending left a sour taste in my mouth, but I dont want to spoil anything for those who havent given this game a chance. Still a great buy!The assasinations do get a bit stale in the mouth after extended sessions, but the inclusion of a great deal of side quests and more collectables than ever make for a great passtime after completing the main storyline. DLCs are relevant and a ton of fun, exploring the giant space really lets you be immersed in the game more easily. Overall, its a great game that solves more than a few problems I had with previous installments, while also staying true to the theme of stealth, quick decisionmaking and most importantly Skill with your weapons.Action/Gameplay 8/10Story 7/10Graphics 8.5/10Controls 9/10 Vast ImprovementCharacter  Weapon Upgradability 9/10Atmosphere 8/10Overall Score IMO 8.5/10
