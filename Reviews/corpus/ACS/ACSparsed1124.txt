IMO, It is one of best assassin creed games in series.Regardless how other people think about this game. I like it most.You are an assassin in Victorian Era, which is most unique game ever Ive play.I do really enjoying it alot, I mean they do include scenes to show that you can perform special executions to different targets which are awesome!
