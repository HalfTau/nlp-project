A good Assassins Creed game. Like all AC games it as just a bit too much filler and collecting rubbish but story missions are pretty good and the characters/story engaging enough to keep me going.The game crashes an awful lot though. Crashes seem related to the Uplay achievements. Crashes didnt affect my enjoyment of the game. No save corruption or anything so no lost progress. Just irritating.
