UbiSoft have definitely learnt the hard way from the release of Unity. Syndicate brings back the addictive game play of its predecessors. While theres still some minor bugs such as character turning invisible during cutscence, the game was great. Steady frame rate of 60 fps. And also there are some frustrating moments where you get spotted and cant achieve a full synchronisation, but that should be the whole point of the franchise. Stealthy and quick kills or hide till the next small window of opportunity opens up.8/10
