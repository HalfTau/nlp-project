Cant get it to run. Keep getting ACS.exe has stopped responding. For me this also effects AC Unity. Ive verified files, reinstalled games, modified firewall settings, compatibility settings, run as admin, modified antivirus and malware programs, reinstalled PhyX. Seems to be a problem a lot of people are having. I have newest drivers for all my hardware and my computer could run these games at Ultra no problem. Sure hope someone figures this out before the game stops saving Black Flag wont save anymore.UpdateA suggestion of a gaming app interrupting the game and causing ACS.exe to stop responding seems to be a source of the problem. Disable any gaming app and try the game again. For me, disabling Rapture AMDs gaming app has allowed the game to run and I was able to play for over an hour with no problems. I exited and restarted a couple times and no problems with the gaming app off. When I turned it back on, the error comes back.
