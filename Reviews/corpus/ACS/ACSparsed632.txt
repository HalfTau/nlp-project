locked in a city, perpetual dakness. every skill, wepon, armor must be bought with level points... not working youroff in the first 2hrs to buy the best like most games. worst AC since 3. if i haddent gotten the deall i did buying this game i would ask for a refund. 20 is still to much for this horrable monument to ubisoft and there willingness to produce ANYTHING expecting us to buy it. in short if you like black flag and rouge this is not the AC for you. DONT BUY.
