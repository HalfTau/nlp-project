Amazing game in the assassins creed series. Most interesting characters since Edward Kenway. They had some awesome mixtures into the other games in the franchise as well with kenway having a small part in the main story, and the potential for desmond to return at some point in time. I just hope that they make a good modern assassins creed at some point. This game didnt come with all possitives though, I had some issues with the game being that is has a very generic open world collection system, the leveling system seemed to be unbalanced as you would take a very long time to obtain certain items, and by the time you do you already had something better. There was also a depressing lack of difficulty in the objectives placed around the map. End game is just as boring as usual, where in Assassins creed black flag they had an immense amount of end game content this game doesnt offer similar experiences. All in all it is an absolutely brilliant game if you focus on the story and the enjoyable side missions.
