Best AC yet, in my opinion. Victorian London is absolutely gorgeous, Jacob Frye is hilarious havent played Evie all that much yet and the whole gang mechanic is a nice new feature. I totally love it. The fact that you need UPlay doesnt bother me. I dont like it but its not affecting the game play at all.
