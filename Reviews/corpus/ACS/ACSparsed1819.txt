Im not going to say that this game is bad, because it isnt. But its bugged. The PC port is not as good as it should be. There are obvious pathing issues. You can run down an open empty street and not get through. Jacob is at this time still wearing his hat during stealth mode /. Small things like that take away from the experience alot. Like Unity, Hidden Blade fighting is gone. You can only Assasinate with hidden blades which makes no sense. The sibling assassins use discreet weapons during this era so why no hidden blades for fighting? Combat isnt as fun as it should be in AC. Looks a little cartoonish with pull and slap. Missions are repetative and grinding. Bigger areas means more grind, a lot more. London looks great. The enviroment is one of the best parts of the game. Have a high end computer, otherwise you will be playing the game at slowmotion including the cutscenes. If you are a AC fan, wait until there is a sale.  Cheers Pathing problems mentioned before solved.
