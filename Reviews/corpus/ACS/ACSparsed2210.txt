The story is empty and hollow. The story that normally takes place in the real world, as in out of the animus, is entirely cut scenes and uncontrollable. The fighint in game can be won by smashing the X button alternating with A. And there is absolutly no benefit to stealth. Infact you never need to blend into crowds anymore. Its honestly difficult to blend in, the mechanic doesnt work well.Everything in the story is predictable and boring and you play two characters who are as deep as paper.The typical assassins creed glitches are infuriating.The home base, which you normally build up, is automatically updated and renovated after some missions. Pointless.Everyone seems to think this game is good, but they keep saying that its better than unity. This game may not be broken like unity but the story is crap, the characters are crap, and the world is crap.Maybe there will be a Shamamamamlama twist at the end, but that wouldnt redeem the pointless nature of the whole game.Im going to beat it, because I am close. But I wish I didnt buy it. Not worth it.No puzzles of any difficulty, no stealth of any difficulty, no combat of any difficulty. The whole game is played by heading to brightly colored HUD icons, zipping around like a  batman, and beating any and every combat scenario by smashing a button to see one of a handful of highly repetitive kill sequences.This game sucks
