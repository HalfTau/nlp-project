They took AC Unity and unruined it.My only problems with it areIt hates SSDs apparently as reinstalling it on a hdd got rid of all the bugs I had.They mapped the free running strangely. Shiftspace for free running up places, shifte to run down. I miss the AC 4 contexual free running based on camera direction but now Im getting used to this new system.
