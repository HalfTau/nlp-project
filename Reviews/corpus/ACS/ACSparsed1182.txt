Game will not launch. Apparently many others have had this problem. I have seen some posts noting the need to move files around and create symbolic links using a freeware application, but installing mysterious freeware to make a triple A title run is not an acceptable solution. Steer clear of this or risk a 100 waste of your money.Frankly, after seeing their best efforts shine through with this and AC Unity, maybe just steer clear of future AC titles all together......or maybe with the underwhelming products that we have seen in recent games like Watch Dogs, The Division, Far Cry Primal, AC Unity, and others we just let Ubisoft fade into obscurity and let other, more capable publishers/studios have our money.
