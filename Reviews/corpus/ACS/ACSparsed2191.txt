I would like to say that Ubisoft really improve the AC series. Well, I can play it all day. You dont have to think much, just buy it and try it, this will never disappoint you. With the interesting upgradeable tools, skill, and THE ROOKS! So much things and places are waiting for you to discover. Beautiful landscape also. About the mission, the main mission looks interesting, but the side missions really really make this game a lot more fun. I could say,  ACS is the best AC I ever played since AC2 and AC4 Black Flag.10/10 no doubt for ACS
