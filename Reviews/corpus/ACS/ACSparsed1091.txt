Assassins Creed Syndicate is a very fun game, but a terrible port. About 97 of ubisoft ports are garbage. But the only bad port stuff about this one is that when you are on a train, or driving a carriage, the game stutters like hell, and when you get off, the textures look like playdough, and take about 5 seconds to go back to normal. But besides the stuttering on trains and carriages, the game is very fun, and I am enjoying the game alot. Bought it for 40, and bought a few DLCs, so for the price of 60, I am pleased with the amount of content in it.Final Verdict If you dont mind stuttering when on carriages and trains, then buy the game, it pretty fun. 7.5/10
