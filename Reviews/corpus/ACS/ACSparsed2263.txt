Assassins Creed Syndicate brings once again another perfect city to play in for the AC Franchise. It is full of excitement without a dull moment. I found it very interesting and fun to be able to ride in the new carriage, and also cant forget the awesome roof to roof rope launcher. It seems as if there is always something to do as you walk across the London streets. I loved conquering the gangs with in the city, it reminded me of the fortress you had to take down in AC Brotherhood.As for the graphics... you dont have to worry, its an absolutely beautiful environment.And last, the story. I loved the two main protaganists, Jacob and Evie Frye. They gave a new and refreshing element to the story with with their both very unique characteristics. The other characters that you meet along the way are also very nice. I enjoyed the connection Henry Green and Evie had with eachother, they would be a great couple . There is only one thing I didnt quite like with the story. I wished we would have met Starrick at least a few times before the battle. Oh and the fact that the modern day story is absolute CRAPat least better than Unity in my opinion! But besides that, I found myself loving the game.Final Rating 8/10  JUST BUY IT ALREADY!
