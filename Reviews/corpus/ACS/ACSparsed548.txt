I had to do a mission where you capture a hypnotist, he kept hypnotising me and being an all around annoying littleso I when I brought him to the police station I immediately freed him and he walked out, the police didnt care for some reason, so when he was out I kidnaped him and took him to the river to drown him. When I got to the river I was attacked by some enemies, he was still in the carriage when all of a sudden some random guy hops in the carriage and drives away with the hypnotist still in the back. Then I decided to blame a random enemy for his escape and pushed him into the river. When all of a sudden he started walking on water and tried to fight me.10/10 would blame Jesus for prisoner escaping again
