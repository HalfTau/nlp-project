ACS.exe is not responding. Ive tried many fixes online, reinstalling Which takes ages with my connection. And yet, it still fails to run for very long without crashing. I do not recommend this game, its two years old and people have been complaining about this for that length of time. Given that this problem has still not been solved, they do not deserve your money for their broken game. Do not buy this game.
