quite the lettdown. Story skips to many times and is not intruiging enough. You stand as a question mark a few times since the story makes no sence. Gameplay is mostly the same old, not much new but still funny and feels like the old ACsyou spend to litle time with any chars to actually get to know and feel the char. few bugs though and the micro trans are just pure bs and there is a big system for it aswell. short gameplay and now that i have 2 missions left i only feel the rush to complete this game so i can be done with it and never touche it again....
