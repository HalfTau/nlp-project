Despite me giving ACSyndicate a thumbsup, its probably not the best AC game ever. Since its probably the closest relative to it, Ill be comparing ACSyndicate to ACUnity.ACUnity had much better customization. ACSyndicate removed all the flair from your assassins clothing, instead giving you a handful of clothes that you honestly only pick from because their stats are higher than your old ones. Gone are the choices between having cool chainlinkwoven assassin hoods, now you can only choose between having a brown leather trenchcoat or a satin lined trenchcoat.Not a lot of fun weapons to use this time around. Brass Knuckles are cool, cane swords are cool, kukris are cool. That being said, thats ALL you get. No more sabres, viking swords, muskets, or shortaxes with a cannon on the end of them. It would be nice to have more variety in the weapons that we are packing, as they all just feel like some variation of weapon that hits really fast.Gameplay is more or less the same as what weve seen in previous AC games. They brought back gangs from Brotherhood but without the lame minigames, which is nice. The only major innovation this time around is packing a grappling hook.I got it on sale for like, what, 15? Yeah its good for that price. If you havent, try ACUnity first.
