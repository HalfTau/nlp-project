You can play it with a PC in the minimum with everything at low and at 720p, which isnt that bad for me, AND get a stable 60 FPS which is not common. After a while it becomes repetitive but all AC games are pretty much repetitive. The atmosphere of recreating a vintage London is perfect, specially if you ever read a novel by Charles Dickens, F.H. Burnett, A.C. Doyle, etc... youll kinda feel at home playing this game. Also worth mentioning that the child character can be a Sara Crewe on her own Totally recommended IF you like AC games and its on sale. UpdateMy systemFX 8320, 8 gb RAM, Windows 7 64 bits.R9 270 2gb
