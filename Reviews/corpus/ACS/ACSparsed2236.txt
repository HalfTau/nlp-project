Finally. This has such a good mix of fun, systems and style. This game is a lot of fun to play. Fighting is more brutail, more bare knuckle. Less style than swordplay of the previous. Story is great so far. The time period is one of my favorites, and the fact that your home base is a moving train adds an element of immersion. Being able to even sit back and watch the sights was a cool treat as well. The gameplay is great. Less buggy and more stable than Unity. The rope launcher is awesome. Its nice to kill a templar surrounded by others blinded by smoke and zooming out of there in a moments notice. Its more automatic and adds to the excitment. And latesly the timescale is a welcome change. It was odd in previous games to have to set the time of day via the options. Seeing London at night was my favorite. 9/10
