BEWARE WINDOWS 10 USERS!!!Now that I have your attention, this game wont start. It gets as far as the intro screen right after it asks you to press a button, goes on for a few seconds, and then crashes. I have been at this for an hour andit is reallyme off. I read up on it and I am currently attempting a fresh reinstall on my C drive instead of my D drive. Apparently it is a common issue with Ubisofts products that they only work on the C drive. I will update this review whenever I finish the download which might be tomrrow. The first install took me 16 hours because of my crappy wifi.UPDATEIm getting a refund to this game. Ive been trying to fix this piece offor three days now. It ran for about a half hour untill I restarted the game, allowing it to crash again.
