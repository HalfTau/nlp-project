Filled with boring collections and the same repetitive gameplay, this game is not worth 60. Uplay DRM with cloud saves only allows one save game at a time. This means nobody else in your household can play unless you want to delete your save and start all over again. Ubisoft has reached the point where their antipiracy policies treat us all like criminals. I will not buy any more Ubisoft games if this is how it is going to be.If you do buy the game, dont look for anything new. Wait until its on sale for 10 or less.EditI am currently on the Driving Mrs. Disraeli mission. While driving her in a carriage, the screen goes black and displays the save/load icon. Nothing happens, nothing loads and I cannot proceed with the game, its stuck. If the Ubisoft server is down or undergoing maintenance, can you play a game with cloud saves? I know there are local save game files, but from what I have read, the cloud save always take precedence.Guess Ill try later, hopefully it will work, I sure do not want to start the game again after being at 77 syncronization.Edit After some brief Googleing, it looks like there is a known bug in the Driving Mrs. Disraeli mission with a workaround. For the sake of not displaying any spoilers, if you get stuck on this mission, just Google assassins creed syndicate stuck on driving mrs. disraeli. The workaround does work.
