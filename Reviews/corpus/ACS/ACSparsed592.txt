I dont have too much to add that other reviews do not. I like the game. But, there is one real thing that bugs me.You see, I like when a game provides difficulty through requiring the player improving his/her gameplay. Instead of leveling and providing a hardlocked difficulty Craft/upgrade your gear to have a chance at killing these enemies in a fight, I prefer when each enemy offers a twist here and there that a player must understand and know how to exploit in order to defeat. There are a couple variations here, and good ones at that. But it really irks me that its spoiled by the need for levels.In Assassins Creed III, there was the Jagers the supposed Badasses of the game. You could not just attack them outright, you had to wait for them to offer you the opening.That type of combat which persisted up to Black Flag  granted I never tried Unity combined with the /much/ more fluent combat system presented here more than one enemy tries to attack you at varying points in combat, it feels more like an actual fight over some kind of dance would get my gums drooling.BUT, thats just the one thing that really bothered me about this game. I cant really pick at anything else revolving around the core of the game aside from the usual collectors hunt, wheres muh multiplayer.But if/when we see another assassins creed, can you just not give me a tophat. Nothing actually wrong with it, but I hate that hat.
