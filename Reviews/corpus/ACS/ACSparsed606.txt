Its cool being able to switch between two main assassins on a whim. Gameplay gets a bit repetitive and you cant just walk around with your weapon out like you could in some of the previous AC games. Endgame boss was a cakewalk and the special armor you can get looks odd as well as only being available for one of the two main characters.Bottom line  if youre really into AC and just wanna play a new AC game, go ahead and get it. If youre new to the entire AC line though please go get Black Flag instead so you dont end up thinking the entire series is like Syndicate.
