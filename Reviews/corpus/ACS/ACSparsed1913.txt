Im going to give this game a 6.8/10.It introduces some pretty great mechanics that havent been seen in the game before, and I had a lot of fun playing it. The story, however, is extremely bland. On top of that, this game crashes so frequently that it had me pulling my hair out. There are also numerous bugs, one of which meant that I couldnt even complete a mission because a talking sequence refused to start.I have a more detailed and spoilerfree review here
