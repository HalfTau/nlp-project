This is a fun game with alot of content how ever imo i find that it doesnt quite grasp the feeling of an assassin. I love stealth games and play them alot but this is a beat em up at best the stealth here is almost none existant taking out 10 guys at one time. I will admit the start of the game is a challenge but level up abit and by level 3  4 you can easly take out a pack of level 10s no problem.Compaired to past games i have to join crowed in saying while it does hold up against other past titles, it by no means an improvement by an stretch. i switched of almost all hud bar the weapon counter just to make it more challenging.How ever i do recommened atleast a one play through just for story sake while its very obvious what is going to happen i love the detail into the characters. Make them fun and amusing. Plus i love the DLC of jack the riper Its what the main game should have been like. all and all id say its a solid game with flaws but if you can look past that you can easily get 15 40 hours depending if you rush the story or do a few side things.
