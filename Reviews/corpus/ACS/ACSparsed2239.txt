It worked for 1 day and then started to crash every single time that I opened it. My computer has the recommended setting and updated videocard software and still the game will not go passed the intro screen without crashing. The game is awesome, unfortunatley I have spent just as much time trying to get the game not to crash as I have playing it. Some missions must be avoided because they lead to a certain crash of the game. Get the game on a different platform.
