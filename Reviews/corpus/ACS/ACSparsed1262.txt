After becoming disappointed by the series after the two games before this, I was pleasently suprised.  While I still feel the game struggles with a story due to trying to force some sort of modern day explination for why youre in the time period, the story in England is somewhat intriguing and not as hard to follow and keep track of as previous entries in the series.  The city is large, but unlike Paris, you actually have quests spread equally throughout, and each neighborhood has its own unique flare.  I felt like the design of areas really helped lead you be try to be a stealthy assassian, instead of just run in swords blazing, as I have felt I was forced to do in previous entries.  Overall this was a major improvement on what AC has become since Black Flag was released.Ubisoft does seem to be reaching with their microtransisions they have tried to force into the game, but I never felt the need to buy anything, and was still able to reach top end equipment by the end of the game.
