Although I played Unity at 30fps or less...i had more fun with it than with this one, in my new machine.WWI was a nice touch graphics are cool, carriages and trains are cool....But the story could be more fleshed out...the characteres are great but are also wasted completely...could have been better.And though London is big the sidequests and activities are...boring...I enjoyed Paris more.gameplay is as smooth as ever though.So if you have 20 or so hours to spent i would recomend this, other than that this one does not advance any story.
