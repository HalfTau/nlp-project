I have a very high quality computer can run any game at high graphics most at extreme graphics. For some reason whenever I load this game up works fine untill I get into a mission then it starts bugging out to a point where the walls are shown in the sky. After about 10 mins of this my game crashes and says my drivers have shut down. Im sure its is a good game on console but not even playable on pc. 0/10
