A huge letdown to the series. Freerunning is near uncontrolable due to poor clipping and mapping, and annimations are jarring/laggy. Combat similarly suffers compared to previous titles and the story feels like it was added last minute to vaguley tie various missions together. NPCs frequently walk around with objects they are supposed to be holding floating three of four feet in front of them, or else glitch through walls.If you like flying seemlessly through cities, swooping in and out of combat, using stealth for assassinations, or tangible plots, avoid this game and just replay the first 3 or 4 Assassins Creed titles.
