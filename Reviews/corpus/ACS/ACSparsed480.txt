One of the best Assassins Creed games so far AC2 is still the best with possibly the best soundtrack Ive heard. The story takes only about 1011 hours to complete if you just focus on completing the game, incredible voice acting, gorgeous city, and tons of side missions and activities. I would definitely recommend this game.
