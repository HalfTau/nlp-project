I like the game, I really do. The story is completely forgetable, but the gameplay is fun, the map is nice and the typical assassins creed mechanics work better than ever before.But goddamn, this game does not perform well. I can max out most games at a stable 60 FPS with my system i7 7700k, gtx 1070 and 8 gb of ddr4 ram, but I can barrely hit 35 fps on max settings in syndicate. The game does look pretty nice, but Ive seen better looking games performing a lot better on my rig. There should have been a lot more optimisation done by ubisoft.edit The game changed to 1440p when I selected the ultra presets. Turning it back to 1080p makes it run decently. Still nowhere close to a stable 60fps though.
