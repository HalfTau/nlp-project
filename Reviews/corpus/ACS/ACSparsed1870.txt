Rollicking fun with a beatifully modelled London. The dialogue clips from NPCs arent so varied and the redbad, greengood enemy gang motif is a little obvious but  its fun nonetheless.The adventures are, apart from an introduction mission, located entirely inside the main suburbs of London. Its at first glance a large city but get in a speeding carriage and you quickly cross it. I guess we are seeing engine limitations here but even on max details it performed well at 1440p, not a very demanding game compared to GTA V or other recent titles.Challenges are fun and the missions often too but the lack of environmental interaction becomes obvious once you complete those missions without the gang challenges or the other missions the city is an empty expanse.The player is able to pursue their own agenda and choose to enjoy the incidental missions instead of adhere to the main plot in fact I was able to clear the entire city well before completing the main plot sequence although this made later missions laughably easy, which is probably just as well as the finale with the piece of eden is pretty dumb.Of note is the games marked efforts to not only introduce a female character but to make her arguably better and more capable than her male assistant. Evie is capable, makes sound decisions and has a strong stealth skill tree whereas her brother is feckless, dumb and has a skill tree related to flashy pistol moves that arent terribly useful. Women also occupy more central plot roles, with not just Queen Victoria but a female entrepreneur and others. Still not 5050 but a big improvement over the flimsy roles of previous titles, on the other hand bear in mind this is still a flimsy plot so dont expect too much Its good but not perfect, the lack of any countryside outside of London and the limited interactions with the city and its denizens make it feel less openworld and more a box of bits but this is nothing new for the series and I would argue that only 2 and perhaps Unity broke this mould.
