I played AC Revelation, AC3 , AC black flag my personal favorite and this one.Okay, maybe UNITY was soo bad, and fail. I watched it on Youtube and played it once on my PS4...It is badBut...This game, Assassin Creed really come back from the groundSyndicate is a beautiful historical story action game.It is currently my 2nd best after Black FlagMap is soo huge and it is a London. Come on, who doesnt want to jump over Big Ben and watching Thames river?Maybe it is not as huge as before Black Flag, but it is big enough4/5Graphic? Well damn, it is very very beautiful.I am using GTX 980, when i launched the game on the first time.It dettected me to 4K resolution with lowest setting because i am using 4K monitorAnd i didnt know it was Low until i checked the setting.Lowest setting is still good in my opinion, and on Ultra setting, damn its very beautiful5/5SoundGreat music and ambience arround london, and voice acting are good too.5/5PerformanceYeah you know, Ubi....There is some glitch maybe one or two each sequenceAnd yeah, ACS.exe crashed happen to me time to timeUsually after changing sequenceBut after i disabled Uplay and set it to offline, thank god it is gone right now.Havent found any map bugs... yet3/5Overall  8/10Great game, perfect for christmass holidayand it is very very fun to run at London city in the middle of 18
