Industrial age London setting is absolutely amazing and beautiful just to roam around. Its good game except its way too easy. There are no large patrols of enemies, you will have your gang to help you, you have a semiauto pistol, and its too easy to run away.The game itself is pretty well optimized and actually runs smoother and requires less hardware to run at 60fps than AC Unity.
