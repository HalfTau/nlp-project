Even as an AC fanboy of the first hour, I could not really enjoy Syndicate. Even Unity was more enjoyable. The characters of Jacob and Evy are so flat and meaningless. Even after playing through the game, I cannot tell you their motiviation for doing all this. They are not introduced at all. You jump right into the action. They are nothing compared to Altair, Connor or Edward Kenway.Same for the bad guy, Starrick. Hes incredibly exchangable. The same boring, undercut wearing stereotype weve seen a thousand times in the last years. Come on Ubisoft, you can do better. Youve done it already, for example Rodrigo Borgia from AC 2.Another thing that bothers me is the crowded city. Its often frustrating navigating through it. The grapling hook doesnt really help you with that, as it often doesnt do what you want. And running over the roofs a signature feature for AC is nearly impossible, because there are so many steps, chimneys and other stuff.Summing this up, this is the most boring AC ever in my opinion. It makes me miss the good old times of Altair. For the next installment in 2017, please either go back to the roots or create something completely new. Otherwise, Im out.
