This game is just what i was looking for ina an AC title, no more annoying lockpicking vertical bars, man i hated that. Just buy the skill and use it. Also the game itself is just like previous titles very fun to play and i love that you can switch back and forth between the twins. Evie for assassination and infiltration, Her brother for the heavy stuff. Good job
