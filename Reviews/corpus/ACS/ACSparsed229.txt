This review does not include DLC.This is probably the last AC game with the old formula/gameplay thats actually very good. Id still recommend picking this up, even if you have played Origins.No.No. Combat can be a bit finicky at first though.Yes.Yes.Could go both ways. Depends on your stance with UPlay. Unless I missed something controversial about this game when it came out.Yes.I wasnt hyped at all and thought this game would be trash. It surprised the  out of me.Its very good. The brothersister element works extremely well and is extremely well done. The characters in this game are brilliant.Everything I would change is changed in Origins. If you are looking to buy this, it has all the normal annoyances from mostly every other AC title. It IS still a very good game though.Old AC formula but I loved it, especially the combos and finishers and weapons.Its a massive upgrade from every AC before it. It could be great but there was too much grinding that I needed to unlock certain things and just a lot of elements I found boring or just didnt care for, plus all the usual things you might get frustrated at in an AC game. Everything else was spoton. Its.
