Im going to recommend this game whilst thinking its not actually very good and heres whyFor me this is a game I turn the sound off to and play while listening to podcasts or something else and mindlessly collect crates and grind to get all the items.If youve played previous AC games it really doesnt change much apart form perhaps the addition of the grappling hook and change of other items. The open world ubi gameplay is actually amongst the most uninspired I can think of.Additionally the save the poor enslaved children to prove how much of an amazing person you are questsme off. both the design of the buildings they are in and the whole motivation of them was really poorly thought through.I didnt especially like the build your own faction /gang system and thought it was unnecessary and shoehorned into theFor me this is a game I turn the sound off to and play while listening to podcasts or something else and mindlessly collect crates and grind to get all the items.plot.The world is quite nice looking and designed nicely in lots of places, but the issue is that the architecture is incredibly repetitive and becomes ubiquitous. Whilst one street or courtyard looks nice it also looks the same as the next.As a Londoner I feel simultaneously at home with the streets but also irritated by the myriad of inaccuracies and ridiculous stereotypes. As well as the fact my native borough apparently has about 30 houses in it. In fact the size generally annoys me.Its also fairly buggy with respect to getting caught on stuff or difficulty targeting enemies during fights, and personally I sometimes find the climbing controls annoying.So onto the less negative stuffThe lighting and weather effects can combine really well, the sight of a foggy gaslit street at night is lovely.I really liked the detective DLC, felt better than all the investigating stuff in arkham / witcher games.Jumping between boats, trains and carriages is quite fun.The grappling hook is a massive time saver and adds to the general silliness of everything.Story missions are actually not that bad and I liked both the twins acting and their interactions.Has a pantomime villain with a fantastic moustache.VerdictI dont think this is a good game, its uninspired buggy and repetitive. Despite all this I still enjoy making a big cuppa tea, listening to something more interesting and jumping about the rooftops of victorian London with a grappling hook and revolver in the rain. Get it on a sale if it goes under a tenner as long as you know that what youre getting isnt amazing.
