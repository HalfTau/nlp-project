After a huge disaster with ACU i had no hope with ACS . Actually the franchise is died after AC4 so i went into it expecting unity 2.0, but what I got ohhhhhh boy was so much more, its fast paced action and nice story . Jacob and Evie are such a warm welcome back to the series, the implementation of two characters gives us the gamers more......personality, the chemistry and development between the two is impeccable. The gameplay on the other hand is also fantastic, a bit overwhelming at first but after you become numb to it, its amazing!! Where once I was concerned that the technology would ruin this franchise it only added to it, grappling hooks which at first I was worried about, trains, carriages, revolvers, etc. All added something that assassins creed needed. In all this year was the shake up this franchise needed the only flaw is....take a guess...... The modern story.... But I honestly dont think it will get any better in games to come, but that aside the game puts life into a dying franchise and definitely adds an apology for unity.
