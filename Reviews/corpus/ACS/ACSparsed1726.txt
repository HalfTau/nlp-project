What needs to be said about this game has been said before, so Im just going to comment that this game is totally worth it for its engaging storyline, delightful comedy, character development and interactions between the two protagonists, Evie and Jacob Frye. I absolutely love the Frye twins and it was a delight to play as both of them throughout the game. I hope this isnt the last we see of Evie and Jacob!
