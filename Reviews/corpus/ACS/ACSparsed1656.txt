I like this one. I went in fully expecting to have a decidely meh experience and I ended up enjoying myself. Its definitely still AC with all the same issues that come with it. I wont say this completely changed things in how I view the series or anything. I just really liked this world, and the characters were fun. Really fun. I liked the sybling rivalries. If you like AC its not one to skip, if you hate AC it wont change your mind.
