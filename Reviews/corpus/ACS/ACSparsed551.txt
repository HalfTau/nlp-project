Graphics are amazing, story is fantastic, combat is awesome. Id say that there is nothing bad about the game, even though i think that the game is amazing i would like to say that the stats to outfits isnt something good.I was like Oh this outfit has 20 in kukri damage... But it looks like a person died on it, released his bowels and then deteriorated. The game is really fantastic but that is something Ubisoft should take away in Origin.I totally recommend this game!P.S I have a pretty  computer and made me get lag spikes every 5 second or so but i still wanted to continue...
