I havent played an assassins creed game since 3 and that was the one that ruined it for me but i saw how bad ac unity did and was glad i didnt get it. now on to syndicate i am writing this review with only an hour into the game and its actually really good. i like the combat flow of this one more than the previous titles. if youre not sure about this game because its assassins creed and ubisoft so far the only flaw i have came across is microtransactions
