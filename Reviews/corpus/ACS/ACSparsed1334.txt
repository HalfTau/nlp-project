The amount of effort developers put into making of this game is amazing. Unfortunately game has minor annoying shortcoming that prevent it from being truly great.The interiors, for example. In the previous game, Unity, you could enter almost any building. In Syndicate the whole center of London is just copy/pasted boxes a la GTA III instead of houses with detailed interiors with the exception of mission related buildings. Which are few.The graphics certainly are amazing, the architecture is significantly better looking and more interesting to climb and explore compared to GTA V, but if you compare it to Unity, its definetely a step back. The controls are typical for AC series and thats annoying that developers fail to make an enjoyable combat mechanics for the 9th bloody time. For example, I was aiming my revolver at the charging enemy and just as I was ready to shoot game switched me to melee mode and I had to use a quickshot with a separate button. The story is abysmal. No character development, no twists, uninspired cameo appearances of Marx, Dickens and few other historic figures become a boring routine. Youre just told from the start that Assassins are good, Templars are bad, and you stab them in their backs one by one til the end credits roll.Overall game feels incredibly solid and leaves pleasant memories.
