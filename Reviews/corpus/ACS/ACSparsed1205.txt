I personally thought it was a decent game, though not the best. When I first heard that Syndicate was going to a thing, I was a bit sceptical because of the trainwreck that Unity was, but I wasnt disappointed when I tried the game myself.Pros One of the main gimics of Syndicate was liberating zones in London, similar to liberating Borgia territories in Brotherhood. Visually impressive nice attention to detail to the players surroundings. The new gadgets, such as the grapple hook, were really cool to use throughout the game. The game wasnt excruciatingly hard like Unity was.Cons Not the greatest story, especially the ending. I even thought Unitys ending was better. The fight against the headmaster of the templars got repetitive. The Queen Victoria missions were boring and sometimes even harder than they had any right to be. While I thought it was really neat to play as Evie Fryes grandaughter during World War 1, I see quite a few plot holes even after reading about her in the archives. I was fine with having to level up to get better materials, weapons, armor, and et cetera, but it should require much less XP to level up.If youre a fan of the series, then you might like this game. However, I understand why many people dont like this game.
