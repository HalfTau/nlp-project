If youre using NVidia be sure to turn off MFAA in the NVidia Control Panel if you use it AND be on Driver Version 359.00! Without doing those two things you may run into issues that myself and others have ran into which range from buildings not appearing, graphical glitches everywhere, some textures looking like its straight up Missingno from Pokemon. However with the drivers  no MFAA the game runs flawlessly!I guess since this is a review I should also add in my general early thoughts 2 hours in. The game itself feels like a step forward in terms of art design and the way it handles side quests. Opening up a map doesnt seem overwhelming anymore. You just have 5 or 6 clear objectives in every section of the map. Its not 1000 little collectibles marked all over. The pacing is on point. The story is also quite good so far, I especially love the skill tree added in. Gameplay wise it seems to be a step back. Unity went for a more open ended mission structure Syndicate could still go this way considering how early into the game Im in where you were given a target and a general location and all you had to do was figure out a way to kill the target. This one seems to lead you down a direct path to your targets leaving little creativity to how you dispose of targets So AC14 style. It also feels like the combat is a step back. Its a counter fest again. So if youre down with the old gameplay style for another entry then its fine. However, if you really enjoyed Unitys approach to mission structure and combat then you may feel a bit disappointed.
