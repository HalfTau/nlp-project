Picked up the gold for 20 on the recent sale. Honestly I cant see paying more than this. I had it crash on me several times in the first two hours. I fixed that by disabling anything involving the horrible uplay service and the automatic cloud back up. This isnt a new game, this should have been fixed by now.Framerate remains faily high but Im getting a lot of screen tearing that gets pretty noticible at times.Combat tends to be clunkier much like unity. Starting out youll spend about 1020 seconds a guy just hitting them in the face repeatedly to be able to take them out in open combat.Standard ubisoft collectathon with at least a fair spread of missing types to do.Already have several stealth missions ruined thanks to the idiotic gang members that just start randomly attacking enemies in the mission area.I was hoping to enjoy an AC game again but its already gotten tedious and more annoying than fun.
