As a long time AC fan, Unity left me bitter and jaded, even cynical about the next entry. But after such positive feedback from the console crowd, I decided to give it a go, and boy am I glad I did. Assassins Creed Syndicate is a solid PC port and is a ton of fun to play. The story is the best it has been in years and the visuals are beautiful. If Ubisoft can keep this sort of effort up they may be able to dig themselves out of the hole theyve dug.
