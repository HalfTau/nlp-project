All of the reviews Ive seen for this game have been ravingly positive. So, I guess Im the only negative reviewer here. I was never really a fullfledge fan of the Assassins Creed series, but I couldnt put my finger on the offending culprit in my dislike taste untill now.While playing today, I found that I had gotten bored with the game when I reached part three as I was driving the stage coach through old London.I started asking myself Why am I getting bored with this game which is touted to be so super duper great by everyone? I reasoned that Ive never gotton bored with FarCry 4 nor with FarCry 5. I can play those games for many hours and never get tired or bored.Then I started to face the truth about the Assassins Creed game, which is as followsI. It is insanely repetitious.2. It is humungously and totally unrealiticPeople are climbing walsl without breaking a sweat for instance. Afeat that not even squrells with their littly magic claws couldnt do.I dont know if there are difficulty settings since I havent check that as yet, but the missions are extremely easy to do with no real challenge whatsoever.The repititiousness and the unrealisticness got to me in the end that I had to quit playing and came to write this review.I have put it away for a while. I guess I might come back to it some day when Im super bored. I dont know.But for now its just left hanging there in my library.
