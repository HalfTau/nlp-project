Fun game, Almost on par with Black FlagNinja Pirate  not an assassin. I believe they could have done more with the game but all and all I am very happy with my purchase.Runs okay with NV surround some FPS drops even running 780TI SLI and 47770k.Review DisclaimerI am NOT an Assassins Creed fan. I am a Black flag, Syndicate, and Rogue Fan.Ive played AC1, AC2, Brotherhood, AC3 and Unity via rentals these games didnt lure me in or keep my interest enough to play longer than an hour or two max.
