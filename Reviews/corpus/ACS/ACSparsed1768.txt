Ive never played Assassins Creed series and this is the first Assassin Creed game that I played!!! I like it soo much that I played nonstop!!! But I have some little problems, is that my game crash when I finished the main mission the main story line mission not side quest thats the only problem that I have!! The equipments are beautiful!!! The Story line is interesting and I fall in love with british accent!! Evie and Jacob twins they are really funny, charming and badass!!! After I spent enough time on this game, I really like it and I enjoy it! !I would rate 9.5/10!! !
