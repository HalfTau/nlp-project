This is just a warning for people who have their games on a different drive from their system C drive. So if youre running an SSD for Windows and apps, while installing your games to a mechanical drive, you might not be able to run it without moving the audio files to your system drive which seems to be the only fix or installing the whole game on your system drive. To me this seems a bit sloppy not to test something like that in this day and age.Childish idiots, please feel free to downvote and find funny.
