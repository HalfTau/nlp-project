Its been forever, I said, They have to have fixed the bugs by now! I thought.  I was wrong.  The game is poorly made, after three days of messing with settings and updating video drivers, the best I could get was that it would let me play sometimes, with a 50/50 chance of crashing my graphics card.  Not my computer, my graphics cardAnd as my card can run Fallout 4 with its eyes closed there is no excuse.  I have been an avid player of Assassins Creed games for years, but considering they have been getting more and more buggy every year, and they still expect us to pay full price, it is just not worth it any more.  I will no longer be buying Assassins Creed games, and I advise you to do the same.
