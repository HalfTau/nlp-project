Just finished the campaign. Wonderful experience. Had enough of nice cutscenes to tell a decent story. Nice to be able to swtich character most of the time. I loved Elise from ACU, and Evie Frye didnt disappoint either. Did I mention pretty as well? AC series has such strong female characters. Nice to have a happy ending in contrast to ACU. The ending brought a tear to my eyes. Alas, all good things will come to an end ... a memorable end, though. Will remember Elise  Evie for a long time. Technically, this PC version is sound. Had a few occasions where the game either hangs or have some glitch. None too bothersome though. Restarted and everythings fine again. This game is much more optimized and bugfree then ACU. Nice to have automatic saving too while RPGs often require you to do tedious manual saving every now  then. Well, the animation of the fighting action impressed me too. The character models are nice. The crowds are there on the streets, making London a lively city. Was not able to buy Helix  XP points with real money though. Just got an error message. Well, nothing that cant be solved with a bit of grinding. Overall, looking forward to next years game.
