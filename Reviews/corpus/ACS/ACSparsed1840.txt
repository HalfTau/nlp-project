One of the better assassins creed games that ive played and Ive played them all since the start. Story was kind of meh but the assassinations actually feel legit. You can get satisfying stealth kills for once that it seemed like the previously games strayed away from, which is weird because theyre games about being an assassin. Usually dont have to worry about someone being too far away or just at an annoying angle where youre just sitting there like wtf do i do. You can actually set yourself up for the perfect assassination which is awesome. Id rank this game at 3rd best in the series, after the 2 trilogy and black flag.
