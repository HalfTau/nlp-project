It all started well enough. I got through the first stylish menu screen listening to a very nice piece of music, and the little intro cinematic wasnt too shabby either. But after that it was as if Id somehow caught the fast train to hell. Through all the smoke and graphical glitches I could, with some effort on my part, perceive child labour and mediocre living standards. The whole experience was a bit vague since the walls, and the floor keep flashing out of and into existence.So after several crashes and a complete reboot of my computer Ive come to the conclusion that this game is not to be recommended. Period.10/10 would get my money back again!
