Fairly speaking, the gameplay has improved a lot since Unity, I was really into it.Syndicate is an adorable game for both AC fans and people who just interest in the historical background, tips in the loading screen did great job teaching players not only gaming skills but also historical imformation.I love the idea that having a train as my base of operations, its makes the gameplay so different from any AC game in the series. I also love the idea that having two main characters Switchable and each has sepcialized skills. Evie was good at stealthy assassination with her elegant attacking style. Jacob was a real badass which actually reminds me of Connor and Edward who can handle a bunch of s alone.If you think AC Unity ruined the series, then Syndicate is the game to restore confidence.
