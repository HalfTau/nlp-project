yes what should i say about this game?first things first, I am a big fan of assassins creed and the only assassins creed that sucks is liberation.This game is realy realy gread it is a step forward in the assassins creed series after unity who was actually great to, after they fix the bugs.my Experience with this gamepluses The graphics are really good. lots of missions and side quests the two awesome characters named evie frye and jacob frye.those twins are realy awesome together, choose jacob if you want to DIE in a fight and choose evie if you want to DIEduring a stealth mission.  the new combat system which is realy great and great finishing moves too!!! new features in the game a great map to explore, london with all his brilliance and glory and bad guys who owns almost all districtsnegativesIn my opinion this games has no negative points so, now ubisoft has up to 75 off buy assassins creed Syndicate right now and start a new great adventure!!!!
