Fun! I played AC 1 ages ago and AC2 before I grew tired of the franchise. A female lead made me interested in this one. And its fun! A refreshing change of pace. The best part is most definitly Evies voice acting. Love it 3.DLC arent worth it. Maybe Jack the Ripper. The others, IMO, arent worth your time or money.
