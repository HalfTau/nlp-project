Still playing through it. Fun so far. Still glitchy though. If youre just running around playing, trying to unlock perks, do side activities, or other generally inconsequential things, it will work fine.However, the second you finish doing anything of large, overarching importance missions or gang wars, be prepared to hit CTRLALTDEL soon. Freezes everytime.
