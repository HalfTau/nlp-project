This is a pretty good game, the combat is solid eventhough is not the best in the series, the main missions are interesting and fun to play, it has great characters and London is beatiful.I recommend it, specially if you like the seriesP.S Eventhough the parkour is not the best, that wont matter because you will be using the rope launcher most of the time.7/10 pretty good, but it has glitches and the story is simplistic
