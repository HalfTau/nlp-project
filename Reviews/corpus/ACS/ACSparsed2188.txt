Well.. They completly scraped the idea of a Multiplayer both coop and versus.. And i got to say this is one of the better Assassins creed games.. Clearly seens as there lack of focuse havent take place here and the singleplayer has a big world for you to enjoy.. With exploration, Plenty of interesting missions.. Small side tracks to take on.. Even the upgrade has interesting features..Only thing I dont seem to like is this whole GANG.. Idea.. Not that its bad just that.. Your never declared leader of that gang.. You never talk to anyone in charge of that gang.. That gang kinda just exist.. And you all of a suddenly after beating up a guy got everyone following you with no cutscene or even voice over explaining why they suddenly went.. Yea hes our leader..  And this is freaking the hell out of me.Other then that.. The combat has been vamped up a bit.. Adding level.. And health bars and gone away from this.. Press E to kill t.. you can still one shot Low lvl people or with stealth.. Also the Stealth system is diffrent.. Better? Worse? Its depends on what it ask of you.. Some times its awesome.. Sometimes your seen even tho you clearly are hidden..Two playable main characters.. They are a little diffrent but in general i felt almost the same playing them.. They got some special skills only they can pick and some extra dmg with specifc weapons..I like this game.. Its a 7/10.. Could been a 8/10 perhaps even a 9/10 if they had a good coop.. I know if they added a coop perhaps the game be broken as unity.. but i still want it.. And this story had potential as you play as two characters.. And both characters are pretty much involved in every cutscene and mission.. Just that you become the one you accepted the mission as.. Some missions are specific for the character but not that many.. Still if you liked Assassins creed games before.. Like blackflag, Brotherhood.. THen this will probedly spark something you like as well..
