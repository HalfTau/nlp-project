this game has a lot of bugs it feels like its not polished at all. keeps on crashing . dead bodys dropping out of the sky in the cutscenes .free running bugs like not able to move. story is shity aswell . i bought this game on a 50 off sale. and still it is not worth it .it has less content than unity .the AI are terrible aswell.Ubisoft AAA game developer steamfacepalm
