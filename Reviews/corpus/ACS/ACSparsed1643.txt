Wow...I think Im in love, with the series, again. Ok, I admit that I was never out of love with the series at all, but there were definitely some games in the franchise that were way better than others. I tend to see the positives, much more than the negatives, unless those negatives far overshadow the others.And with Syndicate, thats just not the case. Likeable player characters, likeable NPCs finally, as well as a decent story make this one of my favorites since the AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations trio that I judge all AC games against. Yeah, I thought those were the best 3, but I still like the rest of the franchise as well. Even Unity, which I got well after all the dust had settled and was able to play pretty much troublefree except for some minor inconsequential issues.Syndicate makes me love the series again, though, like I did back when the best ones came out. Even though Syndicate has dumbed down a lot of the combat, its still fun and exciting to undertake, rather than dread it, and even the finishing moves are kinda cool, although a tad repetitious after awhile.Its a fun game, feels like Assassins Creed again, and I just love the history and ambiance that I can just immerse myself into. I love reading all the history, and like AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, Im intrigued enough to start researching into the history on my own to read more about it. Ive always loved reading about other time periods, and AC Syndicate is pretty amazing.Music is great, graphics look amazing, the character detail is phenomenal, and the architecture is really cool to climb on and sightsee from. Unless I just havent come across them in the game, I do miss the crimescene investigation mechanic from AC Unity that was a lot of fun. What little investigation is to be done in Syndicate is just a followthedots type dumbeddown process that leaves a lot to be desired.
