The camera in this game is unbearable. Its bad enough that you get a top down view but it fuking swings all over the g0dd4mn place whenever you are trying to turn your vehicle. Thats the game breaker for me. Its really too bad because Im sure if they just kept the camera in a fixed position I would have been able to enjoy this game, or at least not give up on it after driving a car for about 30 seconds.
