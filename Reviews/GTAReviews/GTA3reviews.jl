And if you already had played it do it again for old times and fun's sake!\nP.S.: I would recommend installing a fix for the Steam car colors as they are much darker than non-Steam versions.\nOverall score (8/10)\nBreakdown of the score:-\nGameplay (8/10): PROS: Fun and challenging storyline missions, though it is not the case with the very first set of missions as they're boring and easy.\n-Entertaining, not as good as its sequels, but was a 10 back in 2001.\n-You can still have fun testing how far you can survive the onslaught of a 6-star wanted police level, with a medium-sized decent map, and numerous hostile gangs as you progress with the storyline.\n-Decent amount of side quests.\nCONS:- No bikes, driveable planes & helicopters (aside from the Dodo which is hard to control), and melee weapons aside from the bat.\n- You can't swim, but it is trivial and I don't mind it though it is annoying because it could make you lose on some missions.\n- There is nothing much to do after 100% completion aside from a couple of time/checkpoint-related missions which you already have to finish before becoming permenant.\n-Odd jobs side missions (especially Paramedic) become excruciatingly difficult to complete after certain points in the story.\nStory (7/10):- Nicely progressing story about a silent and strong ruthless protagonist who works for various gangs and organized criminals.\n-Some parts of the story reminds me of the Sopranos and Goodfellas, but there aren't much notable references to films or shows.\n-Most characters are not very memorable unlike the sequels.\nEnding (8.5/10)\nGraphics (8/10):- Decent for today's standards, awesome back then.\nArt Style (9/10):- Beautiful aura and setting. Only thing that is holding it back is the few pedestrian models, low quality trees, and how some characters look.\nCharacter emotional development (6/10):- the only thing we can observe is the body movements of the protagonist during cutscenes and his decisions which we execute, but we can easily relate. Other characters aren't very interesting too except for a few.\nCustomization (5/10):- the only thing you can customize is Claude's skin, a car's color and planting a car bomb, though customization wasn't meant to be very important in the first place, but they are relevant to the gameplay.\nAbility to modify game with ease (8/10):- fairly easy but no built-in platform to assist you except for the player skins and mp3 folder.\nVoice Acting quality (7.5/10):- Great voice actors such as Frank Vincent, Michael Madsen, Guru, among many others.\nMusic & other soundtrack (7/10):- very entertaining the first time you hear it, but gets old after a while.\n-Homage to Scarface as an 80s music station with songs from the movie. Appropriate with the presence of the Colombian cartel.\n-Hilarious talk show station, and some advertisements.\nBackground noises (10/10)\nFinally, give some patch-like mods a try like \"The Leftovers Fix\" to get some fixes, graphical improvements, and PS2 features back.\nAnd if you liked this game, buy GTA Liberty City Stories as it is newer and its story is a prequel (set in 1998 while GTA 3 is set in 2001).

Having dipped into\n, I decided to give the series a try, starting with\n. You play the role of minor gangster who works for various criminal organizations, going on missions to steal and/or kill, and usually driving around the city in a stolen vehicle above the speed limit, through red lights, through pedestrians. Although the game is a bit dated in 2017, it introduced me to many innovative, calling-card features of the series. Although the crass presentation and heavy emphasis on stereotypes is not intended to be taken too seriously, I can understand why some players might be put off. For my part, I found the game entertaining and humorous (in a rated R kind of way) and even challenging at times.\nCombat and movement on foot were a bit awkward in this game but also in-line with other games from the same time period. On the other hand, driving around in the city was surprisingly fluid and responsive, aside from a few glitches and camera angles. Most of the game involves undertaking tasks from various gang leaders, and these tasks frequently involve driving from one location to another or performing tasks while driving around the city: the kind of stuff you would expect a low level gangster to do on behalf of Tony Soprano (plus the token stolen vehicle). Although the missions are pretty basic on the surface, most are actually quite fun, perhaps within the greater context of the story and the setting. And quite a few missions are downright challenging, which can be an issue since there is no way to adjust difficulty.  I was able to complete all the main missions (and phone missions) in the game, albeit with some help from the internet for the more challenging ones.\nThe protagonist, Claude, is a low level gangster who is hired by a number of shady characters throughout the game to do their dirty work. If you want to get picky about his story, you argue that there does not seem be any real motivation for him to do these favors for them (except perhaps a long game of revenge), but he does them nonetheless, perhaps for the money, except he doesn't really buy anything in the game, except weapons and ammo (and new paint jobs for his vehicles). So, yes, he is pretty forgettable - I probably will not remember his name next week - but there are other characters voiced by Hollywood stars, but I would not call any of them particularly memorable either, even if you recognize the talent behind their voices. The best characters in the game - by far - are the DJs on the various radio stations that you can listen in your car. And while some of the music does get repetitive after 27 hours of play, the songs, commercials, and soundbites are surprisingly catchy and entertaining.\nThe story is set in a fictional American city that is subdivided into three major areas connected by tunnels and bridges. The city design is phenomenal. There were times when I was hoping for a map that I could pull up beyond just the minimap, but over the course of the game you become pretty familiar with the layout. It is effectively an open-world setting. At the start of the game Claude is betrayed by his partner during a heist and is sent to prison. After he escapes, he continues his life of crime by working for various gangsters. The city, the gangsters, and the radio stations cover the whole ethnic spectrum of American society where each group is represented by its criminal stereotypes (e.g. Japanese Yakuza, Italian Mafia, Colombian Cartel, crooked cops, etc.). There really are no good guys in this game.\nGraphics are a bit dated in\n, but the sound and especially the music are excellent. There were a few visual glitches here and there but no gamebreaking bugs that I recall. I did apply one of the unofficial patches through the Steam community.\nThe cities of\nare basically an open-world setting, and you could just go drive around, mess around, even after completing the main story. My Stats say that I only completed 42% of the content, so clearly I left a lot of optional challenges and content undone. But rather than stick around in GTA III, my plan is to move onward to Vice City.\n7/10", "hours": 27.6, "user_id": "76561197973644224", "username": "Keln", "products": 279, "early_access": false}

Ignore the amount of time on my Steam counter as I probably have between 700-1300hours in this game. For the past 4 years I have played this on Android, PS2,PC and Xbox. On PC I used to have this pirated but as the R* bundle is only 80 cent on HumbleBundle, I bought this.\nI remember always wanting to play GTA as a child, so 11 year old me got a GTA Advance ROM and emulated that on a GBA emulator. Of course, that didn't satisfy my open world 3D sandbox needs. Like anyone else I had a phone and I saw four GTA games to choose between. I chose Grand Theft Auto III because I thought Vice City and San Andreas were spin offs and III was the main game.\nHowever, being 11 years old bought its problems and even if I wasn't, I didn't have a payment method. So I pirated GTA III, and enjoyed the hell out of the game.\nOf course a couple years later I bought GTA III on Android, and actually bothered to complete it this time. But lets get back to 11 year old me. I absolutely adored GTA III, its open world enviorment, its map, story, characters. I loved it. This was all on a small screen with touch controls though and of course I eventually heard of the Dodo and Ghost Town etc. I wanted to be successful at flying the dodo and my goal was to see Ghost Town in its 2001 polygonal glory. I knew a friend who had GTA III on the PS2. The same year I bought a PS2 with Shadow The Hedgehog (which for some reason I actually enjoyed at the time) but that game didn't matter once I had my sights on GTA III. So we did a trade. He got the hedgehog game and I got sandbox driving 2001 simulator. I flew the Dodo and saw the easter eggs on the mini-map but still had no success with Ghost Town. Something unfortunate prevented me.\nI lost the disc.\nI used to hide the disc under my matress because as I was 11 I wasn't allowed such violent games. One day I looked and it wasn't there. I still wonder where it has gone to this day. Fast foward a couple months to the point we're in 2015 and I buy a PC. Its a small compact office PC but of course in this era you can run DOOM on a printer so why not run GTA III on this. I had no internet at the time and used mobile data so I downloaded a cracked version of GTA III for PC off Tesco's Wifi (yes, tesco) along with a beta for Sonic Xtreme which only just surfaced around the time. I got home, installed GTA III and my journey to PC gaming started there. I got into modding GTA III. I downloaded the Liberty Unleashed mod which enabled multiplayer and of course made friends there. One of which flew me to Ghost Town. I played Liberty Unleashed for nearly 2 years. I ended up getting distracted from single player. All this time and I still hadn't completed GTA III's campaign. So in late 2016 I bought the Android version off the Play Store (this time with a payment method, tesco got Play Store cards in stock) and you're damn right if you guessed that I completed the game this time.\nIts now May 23rd, 2017.\n16:19:19AM.\nI finished the first mission of GTA III, \"Luigi's Girls\" on my Playstation 4.\nIn February of that year, I was able to use my PS4 as I got a monitor which accepted HDMI inputs, the PS4 which I bought in August or September of 2016. This was around the time I started not playing GTA III as much due to GTA V consuming me. I was obsessed with the game. But that didn't stop me completing GTA III a second time.\nOn May 28th, 2017 at 19:40:49PM I completed the last mission of GTA III on my PS4. The next goal was platinum.\nBut that story is for another day.", "hours": 6.9, "username": "WheatleyDotJPEG", "products": 131, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

However, even in comparison to its spinoffs that are Vice City and San Andreas, it did not age well at all. I did 3 playthroughs of this game - in 2002, 2009 and 2018, and only on that 3rd playthrough I've been able to notice its glaring issues.\nThe lack of a full map makes exploring Liberty City and completing missions very uncomfortable; the weapon balance is thrown out the window - M16 and the pump-action shotgun are very overpowered, which results driving through hostile areas utterly infuriating. Exploring Liberty City is rather boring and its depressive, gray atmosphere doesn't help. The radio is rather forgettable, except for Flashback FM and Game FM, personally. Sure, typing in cheats and spend an hour mowing down everything is fun, but VC and SA simply have more toys to play with. The game itself is rather short - if you're not a \"100%\" completionist and only play through main and optional missions, you'll most likely be done with the game after 9 to 13 hours. Notice that I haven't written anything about the story, since it clearly wasn't intended by Rockstar to put much effort on.\nI understand that AT THE TIME, all this stuff was completely new - I myself spent quite a lot of time on it with amazement back in 2002 before I was able to play Vice City a year later. Even though I still have fond memories of it, a lot of time has passed. GTA 3 earned its place on the gaming history, but it should be played as exactly that - a piece of history.\nP.S. No comments on the Steam version since it's objectively a pile of hot garbage.

Arguably the most controversial game of 2001 and the first massive success in the video game industry of a post 9/11 world, GTA III is a game about revenge, murder and chaos. Set in the fictional New York-inspired Liberty City, you take control of a mute named Claude. He and his girlfriend Catalina are escaping from a bank heist when she turns on Claude, shooting him and leaving him on the ground for the police to find minutes later. A few days later while on a transfer to the city's detention centre a car intervenes with the convoy and frees the prisoners while also managing to destroy the bridge the event took place on.\nThe game contains a great open world that was extremely impressive back in the year of release. It has a good story but admittedly it's not very in-depth. The soundtrack is full of fantastic songs from the main theme's relaxing piano to the various radio stations filled with a selection of liscensed and original tracks. The graphics are still pretty decent by today's standards but the character models have not aged that well. There is oodles of activities and situations to get yourself into in Liberty City.\nOveral this game is a masterpiece that will keep you playing for a long time and it's something I can reccomend even to detractors of the sandbox genre.", "hours": 54.4, "username": "Super Cosmo Pines!

Then when you boot up the game the text is invisible which means you cannot play the game. I began looking through forums with people saying that they had had the same problem. There was a patch you could download but it had been taken down from Google drive so I began looking elsewhere. i downloaded the patch off of Mediafire and placed it in the games directory folder and the patch worked, the text was clearly visible. I booted up the game and controller support was limited (not knowing then that you configure the controller settings in big picture as I have done for other games since) and I felt a keyboard and mouse for a game like GTA was unnatural as i have played on console for most of my life (I still play FPS games with a mouse and keyboard i'm not a complete noob).

For a while.\n\nThe story:\nA mute guy named Claude gets shot by his girlfriend, Catalina while robbing a bank. He's arrested but breaks out with his boy 8-Ball. Claude works up the ranks trying to make money and find Catilina. He works for the Mafia, the Japanese, an undercover agent and a business man. He eventually finds Catilina and shoots her down out of her helicopter and Claude walks off with his new girl, Maria.\nThe gameplay:\nSome clunky driving. Horrible driver AI since they crash into you constantly because they switch lanes with no warning.\nBad Shooting. The gameplay is heavily outdated. Most missions suffer because of this. It's either the driving or the Cartel mows you down with their M16 that will kill you in a literal second. More on this later.\nThe graphics and cinematics:\nThe graphics in GTA 3 are meh. The game is 15 years old (holy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 so the graphics aren't going to be that great. Even though, the game still looks good. If you get the resolution fix mod, the game looks less pixeled and you can experience the game PS2 style. The cinematics and cutscenes are alright. Although it feels really awkward when Claude walks into this guys house, he tells Claude what to do, and Claude just nods his head after doing so. Claude has no real interaction with characters, which makes them feel flat. Only in missions where two other characters interact, is where the dialogue writing shines.\nSoundtrack:\nMost of it was awful to me. I'm the type of guy that can listen to mostly anything, so that's a lot. I liked Game FM and Flashback. The Jamaican and classical music didn't fit the environment and got annoying. Even on stations, I liked, there were only 6 or so songs. So you're constantly hearing that one song that goes \"We're gon give this all that we gooooooot, keep on risin to the top!\" and it gets really annoying. Most of the time I actually just listen to Lazlow talk about stupid\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nThe missions from hell:\nThe last about 10-15 missions are so ball burstingly hard, I almost skipped this game and went to Vice City.\n-Donald Love's Missions - Liberator\nSave some old dude from Cartel. Sounds easy until they tear you apart with M16s while shouting \"you want the chainsaw, gringo!?\"\nDonald's Mission - Waka-Gashira Wipeout\nKill Kenji, a leader of the Yakuza gang (also the guy you worked for) to start a gang war between Yakuza and cartel. You can't leave your car (since it's a cartel car and your identity will be revealed if you leave) so if the car is on fire, it's over. They shoot at your car with M16's which will destroy it in seconds, while you must drive by ONE GUY and if you fail to hit him, it's over.\nDonalds Mission - A Drop in the Ocean.\nPick up some packages that a plane drops, while each package gives you one star. There are 6 packages. The boat controls are clunky and the water feels really weird. And when you're driving to the paint n spray (THAT ISN'T MARKED ON THE MAP) you're getting rammed with FBI cars and SWAT trucks.\nDonald's Mission - Grand Theft Aero\nGuess what, that last mission didn't matter. It was just a decoy, lol.  Drive to another island you've never been before, then drive back to the other island and kill Cartel members armed with M16 that will kill you damn near instantly. They're hiding around tight corners and the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665aiming doesn't help.\nThe rest of Donald's mission isn't bad, the Akuza's are.\nAkuza's mission - Bait\nYou drive around the new island, leading Cartel death squads to a Yakuza hid out so they're killed. Yeah, except the Yakuza are garbage and you have to kill them yourself at the death squad, or else they get away.\nAkuza's mission - Espresso 2 Go!\nOne of the hardest in the series, trust me I've played them all.\nYou drive around THE WHOLE MAP in 7 minutes. AND THERE IS NO FULL MAP ONLY A MINI MAP AND YOU HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND BEFORE DYSTORYING THE COFFEE STANDS BECAUSE THEN THE MARKERS DON'T SHOW UP \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 THIS MISSION!\nAkuza's Mission - S.A.M\nAnother one of the hardest in the series. You blow up a plane mid air in a boat. You have to STOP the boat. And aim your rocket launcher, if it misses, try again. Or you could cheat in a tank and blow the cartel and police to Kingdom \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and get it over with.\nBut what there's more!:\nThere are some nice side missions in GTA 3 that are nice. Hidden Packages that give you weapon pickups outside your safehouse per 10 collected out of 100. The map is small and easy so it's now that bad.\nFirefighter Side mission - Put out fires. Once you do enough a Flamethrower spawns at your hideout. Not bad.\nParamedic side mission - Pick people up and drive them to the hospital in a time limit, and you can't crash. If you start the mission while the Mafia hates you, good \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing luck since now they got shotguns that blow you to kingdom \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\nVigilante side mission - kill criminals.

I've resound to play & beat them all and chronicle it in a series of reviews. Today we are looking at Grand Theft Auto 3.\nWe all know by now the pedigree of Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto series, so I'll save you the introduction about how revolutionary Grand Theft Auto 3 was when it came out 16 years ago. This review isn't about that, or it's historical value, far from it. We're here to answer a simple question, is the game worth playing in 2017? Is it worth the full price of 9.99 on Steam?\nIf you had asked me when I first stepped out on to the bridge in Liberty City, Portland, hearing 8 Ball's line about how he couldn't drive because his hands were all messed up, that would've been an easy yes. Having only prior played this on Playstation 2, playing on PC with a mouse and keyboard made it feel\nalmost like a completely different game. Gone is the need to lock on to enemies with a button inaccurately, and in it's place is precise mouse control and the ability to strafe.\nIt plays like a proper 3rd person shooter.\nMissions early on that had frustrated me I was now easily dominating. I could downright say I was enjoying myself as I blazed through the first island's missions and moved on 2nd, Staunton Island (the games version of Manhattan)\nBut it's at this point the good nostalgia vibes end and the glaring wart of this being the first \"modern\" Grand Theft Auto game comes into play. The developers didn't have a grasp on how to ramp up the difficulty.\nBy late in game the missions turn from fun 3rd person shooting segments to race against the clock challenges with 5-6 star wanted levels... and while yes, we all remember how fun it was trying to escape the suicidal police smashing into your car until it goes aflame, it stops the game from being about skill and throws it up to sheer luck.\nAnd I can hear the hardcore crowd screeching off that wail that I should gitgud, however I'm an old man at this point. I'm playing games for fun, and when the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t to fun ratio gets out of whack that's when I start thinking about better games I could be playing, and trust me, as I slogged from the save point back to the mission point after each failure I was wishing for the greener pastures of Vice City and San Andreas.\nBy the way, the far biggest sin in this game and the thing that ultimately broke me was the final mission that proceeds to completely stack the deck against you by taking your weapons away. It was here I broke and finally made use of cheats, and the game wasn't fun anymore. It was something to be completed.\nultimately, however, I can't deny that fun was had playing Grand Theft Auto III but nothing that warrants the full price of entry even with the added nostalgia.\nBuy it on sale or not at all.\n(OG Posted at TheOatSodaFactory Dot Com)", "hours": 12.4, "user_id": "76561198092300724", "username": "UncleLono", "products": 247, "early_access": false}

On his adventure to the city Brazzaville, of Congo. On a lone job to catch a beloved local tiger, he is caught by rights groups and is sent to prison. He is bailed out by a mysterious benefactor known only as \"Jade\". She strikes a deal. If he catches 2 female tigers and a rare male albino, his debt is considered repayed. The first poach goes smoothly but he miscalculates the sedative. The tiger escapes his van and runs through the city until it is captured by a woman in a green dress. The benefactor tells him the catch was close enough and the tiger is now in her custody. The next poach starts with a rival gang, the Wet Vipers, in the downtown area sabotaging his gear. After all his gear is defected, Angus is forced to kill the co-leader of the Wet Vipers using only a sharpened ivory toy and then abduct the tiger barehanded. Suspecting trouble, Jade sends the girl in the green dress once again. This time they take down the tiger together and she kisses Angus before flying away with the tiger in a helicopter. Angus demands answers from Jade. She declines but the assistant calls his cell phone anyway. They arrange a date. She discloses her name: Angel. She knows about his debt and would like to help him capture the albino which is now in captivity. They go back to Angus' apartment, filled with supplies and they have sex after planning the next job. The next morning they both gear up and head to the enclosure housing the albino tiger. An elaborate plan to sneak in as a animal caretaker and a vet goes as planned until the Wet Viper leader arrives posing as another vet. A shootout in the tiger enclosure leads to Angel shot in the arm and the Wet Viper leader dead. Viper goons begin entering the captivity and forcing staff out at gunpoint. Angel asks him to take the albino tiger and leave her. He declines, stating that he is in love with her. He picks her up and shoots his way out the back entrance. In a wild car chase they lose the Vipers and police. Angus takes his new love to the hospital where she recovers fully in 4 days. When she is able to leave, Angus admits they cannot be together because he did not capture the 3rd tiger and thus cannot pay his debt to Jade. He walks away and returns home, quickly packing to flee the country. When he arrives to his most recent stolen car, Angel is sitting in the passenger seat. He tells her let him go. She grabs him and kisses him, revealing that she is Jade and that the debt is repayed because he saved her. They flee to Nigeria and start a new life.\nAlso the steam moderator who deleted my last review can eat my\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665", "hours": 26.7, "user_id": "76561198059193121", "username": "Jedi Master Barack Obama", "products": 129, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

Also since there's no option to jump out of a moving car, you can't escape in the last moment like you can in VC.\n- It's pretty short and the story is just good enough to not be atrocious.\n- Absolutely no memorable characters\nOverall this game was a good entry into the 3D universe but it's not necessarily worth playing even if you're a GTA fan. It was probably a 9/10 back in 2001 but gets dragged down by parts incredibly awful mission design and definitely didn't age as well as San Andreas or even Vice City.\n5,5/10.", "hours": 18.8, "username": "Rabbi Moshe Aryeh Friedman", "products": 424, "early_access": false}

Like, say, the Playstation Two version, for example. I tried playing it with my wired Xbox 360 controller and let me tell you, the controller support for this game sucks.

The story is really great, the missions were awesome, the characters have great personlities, and the best part about this game is that you can freely do whatever you want.

Using a Dualshock 4 works but the only problem is that there's no option for you to control the camera on the remote.

You play as Claude, a common crook arrested for being part of a bank robbery gone wrong. After escaping from the prison transport van you begin to do jobs for the american italian mafia for a range of characters which include helping hookers get around the city and being the driver in a bank job. The game continues like this as you get given objectives from various weird, angry, stratigic and manipulative characters; there are a wide range of mission types and mission objectives through out the game.\nAlthough this doesn't mean that the game does not have its faults. As I said before, I know this game is limited by technology of the time however this does not change the fact that the gun mechanics are cancerously bad; It is some times a struggle to aim correctly at people and kill them quickly with anything other then a pistol or micro uzi. The npc's can shoot and drain your HP way to fast before you can pin point the cross heir on them.\nThe car physics are obnoxious and the slightest bump will spin your car out if you are going at any sort of speed. Furthermore the cars seem to just melt; if you crash once you might as well just get a new car because it won't be long untill that car is on fire. This is not helped by the fact that everywhere you go random gang members will shoot at you which makes no sense at all and it very frustrating.\nThere are some bad missions that are just plain dumb, or expect you to get somewhere on the other side of the map in 1 minuet or are made to take on the entire world on your own.  Also there is no large map in a pause menue so you can either memerize the entire maps layout, which you end up doing anyway, or having a map of the game in a different tab.\nEven though there are all of these terrible, down right annoying things wrong with the game, there is a massive variety of missions and brilliant voice acting in this game; not to forget the okay sound track and talk radio show, not the most extensive radio selection and you will definitely hear most songs over and over again, if you want GTA with a good soundtrack, get GTA Vice City, or San Andreas or V, IV's is meh. Finally it will work on almost any PC made in the last 10 years so it's an alright game to play if you are limited by your computers power\nTo conclude:\nCons:\n- Buggy cars and driving physics\n- Bad shooting mechanics\n- No large map in the game\n- Annoying missions\nPros:\n- Some great missions with a large, diverse selection of mission objectives\n- Some good songs on the radio\n- Good map design with interesting locations\n- Humour is layered through out the game on the radio, in cut scenes and on the streets of the city\n- Modding community with skins for the player among other things\nSo I would recommend this game but take it with a huge grain of salt and understand that it will have it's limitaions and you will get annoyed at times but overall it is a good game.", "hours": 10.2, "user_id": "76561198098252655", "username": "Maarzie", "products": 68, "early_access": false}

After 20 hours of play time (story completion plus a few bits \u2018n\u2019 bobs), running on Windows 7, an AMD graphics card and a Dual Shock 3 control pad, I experienced no glitches or game breaking difficulties. Furthermore, after adding in a couple of mods (a controller mod and silentpatch), controls were no problem at all, effectively restoring the game to its original state. Textures and colour were all as expected with no unexpected glitches or rendering errors with the game or menus, and once the resolution was adjusted in the game options GTA 3 worked fully.  There are many more mods available to enhance the PC experience, some more recommended than others, but with a couple of minor tweaks GTA 3 was 100% playable. However, Grand Theft Auto 3 is 15 years old, the series\u2019 first foray into 3D and it really shows.\nGTA3 tells the story of silent protagonist Claude, who is betrayed whilst attempting a bank raid and subsequently arrested. With things looking grim for him, a stroke of luck sees his prison transport attacked by a Columbian cartel, and Claude makes a hasty escape onto the streets of Liberty City. And so begins Claude\u2019s ascent through the various criminal elements whilst he seeks revenge against his double crossing partner. In its purest form GTA 3 is a crime sandbox with variations upon the now established chase/destroy/escape/escort mission format. This being Rockstar\u2019s jump into 3D many of the modern conventions are missing or present in an incredibly crude form. Whilst Liberty City is an impressive construct for a game of this pedigree, exploration is strictly limited to outdoors, with entry to buildings something that would follow only in later entries to the series. Graphically what was once a marvel to behold clearly shows it\u2019s age, but going in with few expectations they are more than serviceable and do not impact upon enjoyment of exploration.\nWhat is infuriating is the incredibly limited mapping system present in the game. Landmark Icons are all but absent, with markers arbitrarily disappearing as the story is completed, and with no in-game map available (a mod is available to correct this) sometimes navigating through the city, especially in time limited missions can be incredibly frustrating. Whilst vehicle physics are dated, and at times almost comic book in their over action, once accustomed to the at times \u2018floaty\u2019 handling driving around the city is mostly pain free with around 50 different cars available. Piloting the boats is somewhat less satisfying (although there are very few missions that require this), and the only available plane, the Dodo, is nigh on impossible to use effectively. Furthermore, swimming is not yet possible and Claude is unable to make a hasty escape from damaged cars, requiring them to be virtually stationary to allow egress. Radio stations, whilst somewhat less stunning than in the newer games, breathe character into the city\u2019s population, and giving the player such an easy way to manipulate their in-game soundtrack was a masterstroke, although not yet the finely polished feature that it would become.\nPerhaps the most frustrating thing for a modern gamer is the targeting system utilised for armed combat. With no player controlled camera, and only a rudimentary lock-on system, combat becomes more luck than skill, with hasty target shuffling in vain attempts to knock out as many threats as quickly as possible. Whilst later GTA games have become known for their storytelling, here, with a silent lead, it can be difficult to adequately track the what\u2019s and why\u2019s of what\u2019s going on. The plot is shallow and barely satisfying, but nevertheless is adequate in dovetailing one mission to the next. Given the mission structure, progress is often incredibly frustrating, with large elements of trial and error. The difficulty is pitched at a relatively fair level, with few missions acting as a barrier for very long, although the occasional timed objective, in conjunction with the absence of map can be soul destroying for its duration.\nIt\u2019s a shame that Steam has no neutral rating because that\u2019s firmly where I feel GTA 3 belongs. As a snapshot in time it\u2019s an experience worth having, but as a game that\u2019s worth committing time to it has long been surpassed by its successors. Personally I don\u2019t regret seeing the roots of 3D GTA, but unless you have a similar desire I\u2019d recommend that you skip forward to Vice City, or better yet where the series really came together, San Andreas.", "hours": 19.6, "username": "x-st", "products": 683, "early_access": false}

Back then, it was awesome.\nNow, not so much.  Many cars have high centers of gravity such that they easily roll over when making turns, the surfaces result in your car crashing from the slightest of bumps, and cars are very fragile such that they blow up relatively easily not to mention they catch on fire and explode if they're rolled over which can kill you very easily, especially if a gang is shooting you and the police decide to shoot at you because you ran over a gang member.\nThe compass doesn't show points of interest outside of mission origins such that you have to pause the game and refer to an online map to catch your bearings if you want to find health, armor, gun shops, pay and sprays, or safehouses.  The targeting system the PS2 version came with is broken since you either use standard controls which don't target or classic controls which do but don't allow your mouse to freely aim.  A lot of the missions are ridiculous as well in that they're timed while you have to weave through congested traffic and the computer gets insane handling.\nLastly, many players complain of launching bugs.  I had a few myself, but thankfully got around them.  The menu button labels start transparent and gradually fade into appearance.  The game itself will freeze you computer in the intro screens unless you launch in compatibility mode as an administrator.  The game also defaults to poor resolutions that many players are unable to play without.\n15 years ago, this game was the bomb.

It's running extremely stable on Windows 10, have not experienced a single game crash in 20 hours of playing - very nice! Final mission: rather simple, but satisfying enough, surely. Works for me.\nWhat I didn't like is the fact that GTA III does not have a complete built-in map, only the minimap on the radar, and how the game expects you to know your environment better than you usually would, such as having to find out where the tunnel from Staunton Island to Shoreside Vale is to be found - very tricky when having to escort a police officer in merely three minutes.

I played this game mostly on the phone and later decided to buy it on pc. There are a few differences that I noticed while playing the steam version like:\nThe car textures are all dark. Yeah it's not a big problem, but it could be annoying.\nThere are a few glitches that I encountered, pretty big ones like cars being stuck in air and cars being stuck in buildings. There were a few crashes when I tried to skip the intro sequence but that's about it. Keep in mind that gta 3 is an older game so you will probably encounter something like that  if you are playing the game the on a modern system.\nNow about the game itself.  Gta 3 is an open world action-adventure third-person shooter video game developed by DMA Design and published by Rockstar Games. And the question is it is worth playing it ? The answer is yes. Every gta game should be worth playing even though you got gta 5 and 4 this stills holds up well in my opinion. The characters, the atmosphere and the city itself is memorable. But those things could be the only good things about the game. Because it doesn't have much to offer nowadays. You can't customize your character, there's not lot of weapons and you can't even swim ! The funny thing is you will receive a lot of money. Already for the first mission in the game you will get 1500. But you really can't spend money on a lot of stuff. But something about the game to me is just magical and I don't know what it is. You will probably hate this game if you have already played more advance gta games. The game does get difficult especially in the end but you once played that mission enough times you will get good at it. But it's not the mission that are difficult. It's the side mission and collectibles that are required for 100% completion in the game if you are the guy who wants to get everything out of the game. Exploring is fun even though you can't do much in the city it's still fun to find a weapon or a collectible of which there are total of 100 hidden collectibles in the whole city !\nSo that's about it.

The cars in this game flips over really easily and you can't flip them upright no matter how hard you try so that might ruin some gameplay and missions for you especially if gangs and police are chasing you and ram your car over.

Around 1999, shortly after the release of the top-down GTA 2, Rockstar decided to cash into the trend of 3D gaming, and started development of GTA 3. What was once a cheesy, cartooney 3D city evolved into the living monolith the 3D Rendition of Liberty Ciy was. Taking place in 2001, while robbing a bank, an unnamed thug (known as Fido in game) is fatally shot by his girlfriend, Catalina. This man goes through various friends, enemies and betrayals to get to his goal of killing his girlfriend at a dam in a dramatic final mission. Liberty City is a giant. Consisting of three large islands and a huge green inaccessable countryside, Liberty City is stunning visually. The game has a decent array of weapons, with some of these weapons being an overpowered shotgun and Carbine Rifle, a sniper rifle, an undersized AK-47 and a well rounded Micro Uzi. With these weapons come mechanics. Though GTA 3 has generally solid mechanics, it does have setbacks, like inaccurate auto targeting (Classic Control Method) and the inability to crouch. Driving mechanics are quite good, with a big heavy army truck being hard to spin out following a fender crash, and a Viper based sports car spinning two 360s as the result of such collision. GTA 3's radio selection, while not nearly as good as the one in Vice City, is still decent. I was often listening to Head Radio, Double Clef, K-Jah or Flashback FM. If you loathe the entire game's soundtrack, this PC version supports custom radio stations, which can be accomplished by dragging your mp3s in the folder of the same name in the game directory. Additional PC features include choosable skins for the player, and full aiming with any weapon, something the PS2 version of the game did not support. There is alot more content and easter eggs in this amazing game that will keep you busy. Though you will find more fun in Vice City, that is not putting down GTA 3 at all. Even if you do get bored of the main game, the PC versions of both games support major mods, like the RealGTA mod for GTA III. No matter which way, GTA 3 is worth the wait and the money.", "hours": 171.3, "username": "\u0136\u039b\u040c\u012c\u0398\u040f\u03a7", "products": 18, "early_access": false}

The world is big (not as big as new GTA versions but it was at the time), the options are seamingly endless, the sand in the sandbox is deep (again not as much as new GTA games but was very much so for the time).\nThe fact that the character you play speaks no words is in itself, a very interesting dynamic to the game. It makes you more aware of the other characters, the missions, the world; everything is embellished with great detail because of your silence. You carry out bloodthirsty murders, arsons, and robberies with cold indifference to your actions. It's kind of chilling to think about.\nThe violence of the game was disturbing to lots of people and it is pretty bloody. The concept of a free-range murderer is kind of frightening, but the game is very much a game so there is nothing to worry about. Have fun blowing cars up. It's just a game.\nThe story is very obviously borrowed from gangster movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas and such. This is a bonus though, as everything seems very familiar to you, like you are already a made man.\nExcellent game, and playable all the way through.\n10/10", "hours": 21.2, "user_id": "76561198073097275", "username": "Azar", "products": 35, "early_access": false}

I've always played it on my PS2 when I was a kid, but never had the chance to actually beat it.\nGTA III is a fantastic game. It's one of the fathers of 3D open-world gaming. You can see elements of this game in current generation open world games, like GTA V or Watch Dogs 2. It plays a big role in videogame history, for sure.\nIt has some limitations, but I think that's exactly what makes this game special and different from the other titles.\nFor example, GTA III lacks a map - yeah, you just can't pause and open the map so you can mark and travel wherever you want to go. In order to go to an Ammu-Nation store, for example, you need to know your way to the store before going there, without the help of a map or a blip. It's a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665sometimes, but I actually think that's lovely. In the last missions of the game you probably already know Liberty City better than your own real city and that is pretty much fantastic. The game lacks many basic functions that were later introduced in GTA San Andreas and other titles, but this doesn't turn the game into a bad game. Not even close. Its limitations create a unique and pretty nostalgic feeling.\nAlso, it is locked on something like 25FPS. And no, you can't unlock it to 60FPS without breaking the whole game while doing it. If you disable the built-in frame limiter, the game simply goes nuts. Physics, cars, AI, pretty much everything breaks up. There's a simple and functional workaround for that, I'm writing it on the next part - so let's talk about its flaws.\nThe PC version have some flaws when played out-of-the-box. Wide-screen resolutions are stretched 4:3 and man, it looks like\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 You need to patch it with a fan-made fix in order to play it in real 16:9 Widescreen, then it gets lovely.\nAlso, PC textures are not very good. They're pretty much the same as the PS2 version and they're kinda ugly IMO. But there are patches fixing that without transforming or changing the game experience.\nThe original XBox version of the game had way better lighting effects, textures and pretty much everything enhanced. There's a fan made patch that inserts these XBox upgraded assets into the game, too, so you can play the DEFINITIVE version of the game without modding it and changing the experience as a whole. It stays original and as a bonus, way more beautiful.\nAlso, this mod also fixes the stupid framerate lock. It upgrades the 20FPS slow\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665experience to a very smooth, beautiful 35FPS one. Yeah, I know you must be laughing at me right now, but trust me. I mean, please, trust me. This game is absolutely fantastic at a locked 35FPS, man. I really couldn't believe I was playing something so smooth at that framerate. Really, frame-pacing is ROCK SOLID and the smoothness is great.\nYou can check how to enhance your game experience with this game on PCGamingWiki. They have a very good article just about these patches and fixes.\nTo end this long, tiring review, I must repeat that GTA III is a AWESOME game. It's legendary and every videogame fan should play it because it plays a gigantic role in videogame history.\nIt may not be as good as San Andreas or the modern ones like IV (which is the best, IMO), but it still packs a lot of nostalgia and a great experience. I truly recommend everyone to play it, because it is simple, PLAIN AWESOME.\n7/10, legendary game.

It can be compared to other genre defining games like Wolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 before it.\nThe core foundation that GTA3 rests it's hat on is simplicity. It has a very simple premise, after being betrayed during a robbery you set out for revenge in Liberty City. The story is full of mostly entertaining characters and mostly fun missions. That simplicity works double for the gameplay.\nGTA3 introduced and perfected a gameplay loop that the franchise has still kept for the most part. There's a set of story missions you undergo inorder to unlock further parts of the game and see what happens next in the story. Alternatively you can ignore the story and explore the city at your leasure. While doing sidequests like driving a taxi cab or looking for hidden collectables. This core gameplay loop of missions, sidequests, collectables with a freely explorable open world wasn't a common thing at the time, and it blew people away with how impressive the whole experience was. At the same time though because there have been so many games based off it, it occasionally feels like it lacks an identity compared to the glut of sandbox games that came after it.\nThis is fundamentally the base game that all future sandbox games jumped off from. It's a game I like to go back to every so often to remind myself where it all started.

Beyond it being the first fully 3D Grand Theft Auto game, and one of the first games to do 3D open worlds well (being a massive improvement over Driver and Driver 2 before it), there's very little here that was not either also done or done better in GTA Vice City and/or San Andreas. Beyond the main story (and the payphone side missions), the only things left to do is collect hidden packages, cause general mayhem and do the police, firefighter, and taxi side missions.\nContrast this with GTA Vice city where you have all of that with better and more weapons, better and more cars, better gang distribution (seriously, after a certain point in GTA 3\u2019s story, one area of the map becomes impossible to drive through without a tank, as gang members who wield shotguns in that area will shoot at you and will blow up your car immediately upon entering their territory), better and less linear\nstory line missions, MUCH better music (Beyond the station with the Scarface OST and the Rap Station I distinctly remember the music in GTA 3 being pretty awful) and a more interesting city with better aesthetics. All of this remains true for San Andreas, which managed to improve it beyond what even Vice City improved upon, making it that much more significantly better than GTA 3. For the most part, the liberty city of GTA 3 was depressing to look at, with a lot of grey in the colour palette, whereas for both of its successors, this was significantly improved. What I will say in GTA 3's favour is that its simplicity makes it good for a mobile game, compared with the more complex controls of Vice City and (especially) San Andreas.\nOverall, don't buy this, at least not on PC, and instead buy GTA San Andreas or Vice City. Unless you're replaying it for nostalgia purposes or on your phone/tablet, there's nothing here that hasn't been done better in other 3D open world games since.

{"product_id": "12100", "page": 60, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-11-26", "text": "Introduction: I find myself typing this review thinking more about the conceptualization of existence, than the anime itself. Above all, there are two standards I hold true for anime. There are anime that simply entertain for the sake of enjoyment, and there are anime that stretches the boundary of human imagination. Serial Experiments Lain falls in the latter category and for this reason Serial Experiments Lain stands out as a true classic. Serial Experiments Lain pushes the envelope of what the perceived notion of what can be done with television as a medium. The show doesn\u2019t just provide entertainment; it provides insight, and profound views and beliefs about technology and the role it plays in society. With that said it's time to get on with the review.\nStory: Given that Lain\u2019s story progression is very disjointed, if the execution were to be even off by the slightest, the show would have been ridden with plot holes. Lain however doesn\u2019t need worry about plot and story in the same sense as other anime, but instead relies on the atmosphere and the characters to tell the story. What little plot Lain does have, the show works with it fabulously. Now some may argue that Lain is completely plot driven, but to each his own. Personally I believe that Lain strays as far as it can from bland episodic story telling, and in essence is similar to Citizen Kane in the aspect that the story has little to do with the show. Lain above all is a character study, and the plot only moves forward under the characters.\nArt: Despite the art being off center in terms of traditional anime, it hardly deters from the overall enjoyment of the series. It is important to note that the series actually benefits from the unique art style presented in Lain. Art is not a big pulling factor for Lain, so if you are a fan of high quality art, you may be in for a rough ride.\nSound: The series relies on a minimalist approach to sound and music. Dialogue is sparse, but very profound. Sound effects are seldom used but with brevity, and has a lasting impact on the viewer. Once again, this lack of a quality that would normally be detrimental to an anime\u2019s enjoyment, but becomes one of Lain\u2019s strengths. The sound of the electricity running through power lines, the empty sound of Lain typing on her keyboard, and the scarce use of music. These are all memorable pieces of sound effects that adds to the overall impact of the show.\nCharacter: Now this is where Lain shines brightest. In a vast wasteland of mundane same-old, Lain sticks out as an anime that takes its characters to a level that most anime can only dream of achieving. The character of Lain is perhaps the most deep and relevant characters in anime today. To explain upon this point, one would have to watch the series and comprehend the various themes and motif\u2019s on one\u2019s own. But in order to be brief, Lain\u2019s character can be summarized as ascending from human status, to near God like power through the prowess of the internet. Ahem, I mean, \u201cThe Wired.\u201d It\u2019s a simple concept and seems like it has been done before, giving credit to the argument, and it probably has. But the beauty here is the cast of side characters that surround Lain. Her sister, her father, mother, and friends, are all extremely deep characters, that although don\u2019t appear to be, are actually extremely poignant in their own right.\nEnjoyment & Closing: If watched with an open mind, Lain will do more than simply entertain. It is truly revolutionary anime for its time, and the amount of depth in the show is utterly staggering. Never in my years of watching anime have I seen a show as thought provoking as Lain. If one were so inclined to contact me, we could talk for hours upon hours of the religious symbols, and religious references that run about the shows course. We could then change the subject to comparing Lain\u2019s character to that of philosophy of the Jungian Shadow. We could converse and discover deeper and more universal meanings as time progressed. Lain is such a show that the viewer doesn\u2019t just watch it. The viewer must be pushed to think, and who doesn\u2019t want to do a bit a of thinking once in a while?", "hours": 29.1, "username": "Stimos boyfriend", "products": 142, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It was undeniably rushed, with a plethora of bugs popping up left and right. They didn't even bother to put a roof on most of the buildings, assuming no one will see it (they were wrong)... These are actual complaints frequently repeated back in the day.\nAnd yet, this game has redefined the term \"sandbox\" into what we know it as today. It didn't excel at any aspect... but it just made a darn good use of all what it had. It really felt like the most complete and realistic simulation of a gangster yet. Wreaking havoc has never been so satisfying before.\nAt the time, the possibilities appeared endless. The city seemed huge beyond imagination, I could spend hours just driving around listening to the radio. There's nothing you couldn't do - you could have multiple apartments, save cars in a garage, fly a plane, drive a boat, annihilate surroundings with a tank, work as a cab driver, paramedic, firefighter or even a cop (!). Not to mention the map was filled up to the brim with collectibles and other minor secrets.\nMany people despised the dull and grim looks of the Liberty City. To me, it is fitting. Unlike many of the sequels, in this entry the city is dark and often shrouded in fog. This really makes for an distinctive atmosphere.\nEven though the graphics as a whole failed to impress, there were so many little quirks it really caught your attention. You could rip out car panels. Doors could open on impact (which would then flap around as you drove in the corners), and the protagonist would attempt to close them. Cars could spawn in several variants, for example as a cabriolet or hardtop. You could dismember pedestrians - a feature that was removed from the subsequent games. There were leaves and old newspapers floating around. Rockstar has also implemented a day and night cycle and various weather conditions, making the virtual world ever so immersive.\nThe soundtrack is superb, it's definitely one of the things that made GTAIII so special. I love the fact that the radio stations were composed mostly from music produced specifically for this game. It's really a shame that Rockstar has dropped this approach in the newer games (aside from Liberty City Stories, which also featured a truly unique and memorable soundtrack).\nAs with any GTA, this game doesn't take itself very seriously. The humour is spot on. I especially love the chat radio stations, they always end up talking about such nonsense crap it keeps me in stitches.\nIf I had to pick one thing about this game that has aged the worst, it'd definitely be the plot and missions. The main storyline is just a typical \"betrayed man who seeks revenge\" scenario with little to no unexpected plottwists. The missions mostly revolve around transporting the item/person, collecting items, killing someone, driving from point A to point B... This was perfectly acceptable at the time, but now it feels barren. Even the big finale doesn't really stand out from the rest.\nAlso, the main protagonist is completely silent. While I like that it makes him much more intriguing and mysterious (and some say this makes him easier to relate to), I really do feel like this was a wasted opportunity. Take a look at the sequels - characters like Tommy Vercetti, Carl Johnson, etc. are unforgettable. Claude just isn't.\nAny way you look at it, it's a classic, a truly groundbreaking title. For me, this is by far the most nostalgic entry in the series. No other game made a bigger impression on me and none ever will. To be honest though, Vice City improved on pretty much every aspect and if you've never played III before, I doubt you'd enjoy it today. But if you can stomach it not being as good as Vice City, it's definitely recommended.", "hours": 8.1, "username": "2A03", "products": 1247, "early_access": false}

Either way, some years later the curiosity about this title started to grow on me so eventually I decided to give it a chance. The first thing that I noticed is that the navigational resources that we have avaiable nowadays can really make everything much easier. In that game you can't really get to rely so much on that so you gotta pay attention to the map to realize where you are, where you're heading to, what's the best way to get there etc. The graphics are quite outdated but that's not much of a problem if you're more concerned with the entertainment value instead of the looks. The story is quite simple: You start from the bottom and every mission you complete makes you climb another step of the ladder, allowing you to meet some people with influence, unlocking stuff etc. There're some radio stations available but the songs get old really quick, trust me. Besides, there're some missions where you need to race against the clock that are simply unforgiving. In other words, it's the kind of game that was made specifically for Duke Nukem (yeah, because he got balls of steel).

Native Widescreen support is poor, and skews your crosshair, but the widesreen patch fixes these issues. Remember to leave the frame limiter ON, it caps your game at 30 fps but its needed to not break the physics and prevent other bugs. Disable Trails if the \"motionblur\" is too much for you as well.\nThe combat system is alright, armor, cover, and shooting first is a MUST to win firefights as the game gets pretty difficult, especially if you screw up. Remember to save often as well.

Its a city torn apart by crime(one mission has the city in a blown-out turf war by two gangs), but that won't stop you from getting revenge.\nThe story isn't as complex and well thoughtout as other games, but  the setup is really awesome, and there are great moments through out the story.\nYou are a criminal named Claude (last name may or may not be Speed) who was just betrayed by your girlfriend, and left for dead during a bank robbery.

This game is seperate in both story wise and game play to the first two games. Even if you never played the first two games, you will still be able to play this game as its intended as the start of its own series. With that said, now to talk about the plot, the game opens up in Liberty City, the arm pit of all the shady cities in the world. The city is a cross between New York & Pittsburg. One day a silent robber named Claude attempts a bank heist with his girlfriend named Catalina. They were about to make a run for it, however Catalina betrays Claude and leaves him for dead for the cops. Some time later, Claude is en route to prison, only for the police van to be demobilzed by the demolishing of a blown up bridge. The man responsible for blowing up the bridge is 8-Ball a trusted crime partner of Claude. 8-Ball helps Claude in a getaway vehicle and heads straight to the nearest safe house. With new clothes and new weapons, Claude is ready to get revenge on the woman who stabbed him in the back. He knows she's some where in Liberty City and the only way to hunt her down is by taking up odd jobs from various people to accomplish his quest. Made by Rockstar Games the makers of the Bully game. Grand Theft Auto 3 was the pioneer in open world environment games back when roaming in open space levels was a novelty for its time. Tons of games since then have mimic this concept including the Saints Row games which took inspiration from this franchise. Because this was an early 2000's game, expect the graphics to be a little polygonic and occasional glitches to be spotted. The concept of choosing which ever missions and exploring to collect items was something that facinated gamers at the time this game was released. The use of changing weather and cars containing hours of radio show dialoge and copyrighted music gave this game an atmosphere to it. Most of the voice actors are prolific screen actors instead of casting just voice over actors. The cast consists of Frank Vincent(Goodfellas & Raging Bull), Joe Pantoliano(Memento, Matrix, & Empire of the Sun), & Kyle MacLachlan(Twin Peaks, Dune, & Blue Velvet) just to name a few. The first two games utilized the top perspective camera mode. In this game its a third person perspective to put the gamers into the the enviroment better. As the game progresses, you will find additional items and weapons to help you out in various missions. The missions have certain rules when activated, but there are plenty of options in how to succeed depending on the situation. With the abundence of pros comes and abundence of cons. The healing items are only collected in certain areas which prooves a problem when shooting down enemies and loosing health at the same time. The fighting mechanics are a little off and its not a recommended approach when fighting enemies with guns and bats. Using guns works best for almost all situations. While you do gain the ability to store more weapons at safe houses, however vehicles are limited to only one car being stored in a garage. And because certain cars can be easily damage, get use to escaping burning vehicles and stealing new cars for replacements. And lastly on the cons is the map, the map system does high light missions, safe houses, and shops but you don't have the option to look at the whole map or place any trackers to get to certain locations. Unless you spend time memorizing the layout of the land, you might find yourself lost when trying to do vehicle based missions. With those flaws aside, this game proved to be fun to play. Challenging at times, but a very rewarding experience when achieveing the missions. Grand Theft Auto 3 helped paved way for later installments of the franchise utilizing the same concept and game play as this title. The game was even inducted into the Museum of Play's \"Video Game Hall of Fame\" which is a real honor there. Most young gamers might not see anything spectacular about this game, but it should be noted that it was one of the first open world games of its kind so ignore the clunkiness and play it for what it is.

Instant explosion and wasted, not great.\nMovement and shooting are generally acceptable, just so long as you're quite slow, careful and don't let enimies get behind you cos if you do then the outdated, awkwardness of the controls will rear it's ugly head...badly, as long as you keep on top of them you'll be fine little jimmy.\nMission variety and general 'stuff' to do are pretty good actually, (yet again especially for a 15 year old game, back in 2001 it felt like you could do almost anything!) they managed to incorporate some reasonably interesting scenarios despite the extremely limited ways to interact with the world, then there's a number of side attractions, apart from the now GTA staple of simply running/driving around tearing everyone and everything 'a new one' there's a few races, GTA 1 esque phonebooth missions, police car, ambulance, fire engine and taxi challenges, a couple of off road driving challenges, hidden packages to find, (which actually have a useful reward) garages for collecting rare vehicles, stunt jumps, rampages, RC destruction and probably something else I've forgotten about, now that I think about it there's probably more 'side' content than main story content, a trend which would DEFINITELY continue as the series progressed.\nNow here comes some issues, ya know little things like LARGE PORTIONS OF THE MAP BECOMING STRICTLY OUT OF BOUNDS AREAS!! Thanks to the idiotic choice of giving all the gang members which you've upset, which is most of them by the later stages of the game by the way, some of the most powerful weapons in the game and terminator like scanning systems to pick you out and blow you to pieces in 2.5 seconds despite you zooming by at 110mph in a banshee.\nAnd then there's the four, five and six star wanted levels, it's...indescribable at times, it can truly feel like a glitch sometimes, it's just so much no, that's all that needs to be said on that matter.   >:(\nOn a more positive note however, even when you're getting your\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ripped open at least you get to listen to the still great, eclectic mix of music, talkshows and adverts on the radio, GTA always nails the time period it's going for and III is no exception, it's basically become a time capsule to the late 90's/early 00's and it's still awesome, social commentary 'n all.\nFinally, I just think this is an important game to play, like games such as Super Mario Bros. and DOOM before it, it was a cultural and sales phenomenom and spawned countless 'clones' as everyone tried to jump on the bandwagon but at least in terms of impact and popularity no one ever really came close.", "hours": 42.4, "user_id": "76561198070057557", "username": "weaselbandit", "products": 176, "early_access": false}

GTA III, the first 3D release in the series still plays incredibly well 15 years after release. Playing it is like going back and playing Doom after a while away - regardless of the passage of time, it's still an immensely enjoyable experience. I'd even argue that this game is a tighter and more polished than Vice City, even though VC is perhaps viewed as one of the best in the series. The cutscenes are slick and well-presented, and the cutscene character animation is perhaps superior to both VC and SA, the voice acting and sound design are all fantastic, and the gameplay is tight and fun. It's still a wonderful experience when the second island opens up and you can cruise around the big city for the first time.\nThere is a degree of nostalgia affecting me here, and I can't say for sure whether the experience will entirely translate to those migrating back from V or IV, as this is the most arcade-y of the PS2 GTAs, but the gameplay, the characters, and the controls still hold up really well.

I don't know why it took  me so long I just never felt the need to play through the entire campaign. Then as a result of turning towards being a completionist I believed this would be an easy game to complete for the list. Boy was I wrong. Not to say the game is overly difficult like a game such as Dark Souls but there are certain aspects that lurk up on you making the process of any mission you try to do more difficult than it needs to be. For example one of my least favorite missions in the game is a street race on the very first island where you do one loop around the city. Seems easy enough. But no if you do this mission after doing some triad missions the men in blue (the triads) become hostile and it just so happens the start line for the race is heavily populated by this gang. This doesn't help the fact that almost every car in the game feel like trying to drive a tank at full speed (which you can do by the way) and it honestly seems the cars are made of paper mache at times as hoods, doors, and trunks come off with ease. Besides these facts I ended up just going to the start line, avoiding the triads of course, and right when it says go I leave my vehicle stare at the huge wreckage the poor street racers have made and enter the words BANGBANGBANG. Immediatley every vehicle on screen explodes. At this moment I am far enough away from everything so I did not get hurt. After this I spawn a tank and complete the race with the now non existent competitors. Things like this can happen very often in missions. Things that will them overly difficult to the point where you just start using cheats through the games just to beat it. After all is said and done I really can't reccomend completing this game as it is not worth while and there is no reward for doing so like other Grand Theft Auto games. I will still reccomend this game but only to those who really enjoy the Grand Theft Auto series and those of course who played it as a kid.\nOutsiders: 6/10\nVeterans: 8.5/10\nIt is still undoubtedly a very revolutionary game for its time but unfortunately has not aged well.", "hours": 24.6, "username": "Newtbludger", "products": 307, "early_access": false}

The city where the entire population doesn't knows how to swim, the police force specializes in aerial stunts. and going around stopped vehicles is unheard of. You play as Claude, the mute who might as well be blind. Claude has relationship issues, his girlfriend unexpectedly broke up with him, and Claude is doing what he can to get over it.\nSTORY & ATMOSPHERE:\nThe story isn't something too spectacular. You are a criminal rising up through the ranks, and as your rise up you unveil enemies and get into a bigger mess. However, one thing to mention is the superb voice acting. The voice acting fits the atmosphere of the game very well, even on the radio.. The city feels like a cheap filthy restaurant filled with rodents. Everyone is on their own, or against you. Rats everywhere. Also, the radio stations have a diverse and interesting soundtrack. Varying with Reggae, DnB, 80s' classics, Opera, eccentric hipster Rock, and many more. Not to forget the humerous talk show hosted by the beloved Lazlow. However, radio stations get repititive after a while.\nGAMEPLAY:\nHit detection is nearly non-existent and cars are very fragile, but the difficulty is great.The game can get very frustrating at times because of this. There is a considerable arsenal of weapons, from explosives to fire to bullets. But I found myself resorting to mostly sniping from afar (for the AI can't sense others' casualties), and running down enemies (as you are safe as long you're inside a vehicle). And thatis because most of the guns have terrible hit detection, deeming you almost  a sitting duck with heavy weapons, and a waddling penguin with light weapons. Vehicles get damaged so easily, bursting in flames and switching vehicles during a mission becomes a standard. The combination of being shot at and rammed into does not make it any better.  The difficulity rises as you progress, and so does the harshness of cops as you gain a wanted level. I'd say the difficulty is quite balanced for what it is.\nFor its time, this game was a masterpiece. It opened doors for many developers to go through, and Influenced many of the open-world games today. It has its issues, but I cannot deny how this game changed the gaming industry, and how it was truly genre-defining. If you are looking for a crime-based open-world classic game, try this.

Soon enough Rockstar North (then known as DMA Design) delivered. It was truly revolutional, one that put open world genre to the map. Interesting dialogs and story that was inspired by many gangster movies and characters voiced by actors such as Joe Pantoliano and Michael Madsen surely left an impact in the gaming industry.\nGame was phenomenal when I played it for the first time, and didn't lose its charm when replaying it many years later. You can blindly follow missions and slowly unravel story or you can choose to do one of many side activities that are present. Driving taxi, chasing criminals in police car, save wounded as paramedic or putting out fires are all an option. If you feel like discovering every corner of the Liberty City (loosely based on New York City) - there are 100 hidden packages to find. Want to unleash some anger - find rampage tokens and try to kill certain number of people for a given time. You like cars and driving - you can search the city for a rare models and big payoff in the end when you collect all of them. While doing that you won't be bored, radio stations with 3.5 hours of material are there to make sure of that. Choosing between big music hits and talk radio stations will often be a hard decision. Dark humor is omnipresent and is surely one of the series trademarks.\nCity is pretty small compared to ones in future instalments, but at the time it was more than enough. There is no map (except mini-map) and learning shortest route to some locations will be a must for certain missions. I always liked this aspect; no pausing all the time and carefully planning every turn. You play as silent protagonist and throughout game will encounter Italian Mafia, Yakuza and Colombian Cartel.

Although open world games existed before GTA III, this game put the feature right near the top of the list from where it went on to become the most dominating characteristic found in almost all of today\u2019s top of the range games. In this game you play the role of a wronged criminal on his quest for revenge. Betrayed by your own (very hot) girlfriend, you find yourself right at the bottom of the pile, from where you must rise up through the ranks\u2026 by doing petty crimes and driving around mob bosses in the beginning, but assassinations, heists, auto theft, racing, and every type of criminal activities you can imagine as you progress along the game. The setting is Liberty City, loosely based on New York City. You can drive cars or boats. You can roam around freely. Some parts of the city will unlock based on your progress through the story-line. Missions are given out by characters strewn around the city. Apart from missions, there are plenty of side-missions which will net you lot of money as well as excellent perks that are very useful for the story missions. If you are fan of open world, sandbox style gameplay, and do not mind challenges, you aboslutely must play this.\nGameplay \u2013 Gameplay is not GTA III\u2019s forte. Very quirky and sensitive. Too many \u201cinsta-fails\u201d. Too many missions are based on the \u201clearn through failure\u201d policy which I do not like. While some such missions have to inevitably exist, a good game design should have enough missions following the policy of \u201cplanning ahead through clues\u201d as well. That goes on to give better immersion and realism. Then there is the annoying aspect of hostile territory which makes sense during the main story-line, but after the completion it should not persist, or else what is the point of completion. And this  aspect is an immense barrier towards the 100% score due to its interference with the paramedic mission, which in itself is an extremely unrealistic mission. But then again on the brighter side, the open-ended nature of the gameplay is commendable. Wide variety of options available to complete the missions with lot of room for out-of-the-box thinking. Considering everything, I would give 50-50 rating.\nTIP: If you complete the various types of side-missions, then some of the most difficult missions will not appear as impossible they can otherwise seem, in fact some of them will become a walk in the park.\nTIP2: In some missions you will have to think out-of-the-box and not try too hard.\nGraphics \u2013 Revolutionary 3D graphics for 2001. Human figures look a bit weird, but the cars, buildings, city architecture, etc. are very nicely done for its time.\nPerformance \u2013 Good grade toaster can effortlessly run it. Modern systems might cause some trouble like stuttering or freezing.\nEntertainment \u2013 One of the most entertaining games you will ever play. Set the tone for GTA to become entertainment king of gaming. Whacky humor, crazy events, ridiculous ways to complete missions, a nice plot, colorful characters, pretty much everything you can want from a game.\nPlot \u2013 Very entertaining plot.\nReplay value \u2013 Quite high. The game being extremely difficult and at the same time very large, replaying can give you lot of fresh enjoyment and satisfaction which you might not be able to derive on your very first play-through.\nImmersion \u2013 It can\u2019t be called immersive in its truest sense as it is not a real RPG, and nor can you customize your character in any way. Nevertheless there still is a sense of immersion quite deep due to the sandbox gameplay and the setting of a modern metropolis.\nOverall a superb game with the dated graphics being its only drawback. Mods are available to improve on that account. Although caution should be exercised about using mods in case you want to hit the 100% completion mark. Mods and cheats are known to be interfering with that.\nReposted from my site", "hours": 65.5, "username": "aureliussr", "products": 921, "early_access": false}

After a bank heist his girlfriend Catalina shoots Claude and leaves him for dead. After a prison break Claude escapes and so begins his quest for revenge towards Catalina.\nThe gameplay is pretty identical to every other GTA game, but I'll explain if you want to know. The game is a sandbox title where you are free to explore at your own pace, you can travel by foot, by car or by boat. No air travel just yet. It's fun driving around and seeing the sights in Liberty City.\nThe gameplay is very stiff for this title. The driving is very hard to control and requires a lot of time getting used to it, but once you're used to it, it's not big of a problem.\nThe game also has a mission structure and every mission requires to do a lot of different stuff, ranging from racing, to hitman missions and a lot more stuff. A lot of the missions can be fun, but a lot of them are incredibly difficult and here is the biggest problem with the game.\nNow don't get me wrong, when a game is challenging that is not bad, but when it's so hard it's next to the point of being unfair is not good. GTA Vice City and San Andreas has a good mixture of difficulty where the missions where possible no matter what. GTA 3 however is incredibly difficult due to the very confusing objective placements and really punishing missions where a few good placed shots could blow up your car.\nThe soundtrack is also really lackluster. Every radio station only has 4 songs each ( at least from what I remember). But a lot of the songs are good, so I won't go too harsh on it.\nThe story is really great, while not the best thing of all time, it helps to push you to the conclusion and it really satisfies you after the end credits start rolling.\nWhile playing, I had zero issues with the game. No crashes, no game breaking bugs. Apart from minor AI glitches, I had no problems.\nThe game took me 13 hours to finish, after you're done, you also have races and packages you can collect all over Liberty City.\nOverall GTA 3 is a good game, but it has not aged well since 2001. It's a revolutionary game and I won't deny the impact it had on the world of gaming, but I highly suggest players to buy either Vice City or San Andreas.\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Worth Purchasing on Sale\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page\n- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "hours": 12.6, "username": "Snort Cannon", "products": 1915, "early_access": false}

There's no real variety to the way in which missions can be approached--you have to try and die and restart multiple times to discover the way in which the game wants you to complete a mission.\nThe mechanics are still relatively smooth and work well, save for some weapon gripes such as the grenades which can't be aimed accurately and only thrown blindly.

I mean it is smooth and responsive. Incredible how well it actually holds up. From a modern pespective the game is limited in terms of objectives. There is not a whole lot of things to do and the missions can be very frustrating at times because of the lack of checkpoints. The structure of missions is dated too. In retrospect the map is still feels big and it is quite impressive for its time. The characters lack personality, but for their first 3D game, it's not bad.\nThe colors are very depressing to be honest. A lot of grey, and black and white. I only remember the game for its rain. It has aged pretty well and still perfectly playable. There is also a lot a texture popping, which was very common for its time. Despite all my complains the graphics is still amazing.\nQuite amazing for it's time. The voice actors are very good. The most memomable thing must be the radio stations. You listen to them all the time. There is a lot of variation from DnB, opera, 80's music, raggae and hip hop. The songs are so good you can listen to them multiple times. The real charm is coming from the radio station hosts.\nI love to go back to GTA III now and then. It holds a lot of nostalgia value for me. Unfortunately, it never got its claws on me.

I had to use both SilentPatch and the DDraw patch\nto get past the Unhandled Exception c0000005 error and crash after the intro movie. EDIT: These patches also fix a bug where menu text is either invisible or very faded.\nThis is one of those old games where physics are tied to framerate. If you turn off the 30FPS limiter, car friction, jumping and running up stairs are totally broken. This is one of those things where someone at Rockstar could fix it in an afternoon but it's still broken after all these years. As far as I know, there's no mod or patch to fix this. You can limit the game to 60 with a graphics driver tool but the physics problems are still there.\nThe HUD doesn't scale well for widescreen. There's a \"widescreen\" option in the graphics menu but it doesn't work. You need to use a community fix\nto get the game to look as expected at resolutions like 1080p (or anything bigger than 1024x768).\nThe Steam version of the game has a bug where lighting doesn't affect cars if you're running it on a modern version of Windows. The SilentPatch I linked earlier fixes this bug, but the widescreen patch I linked breaks it again. The best way to fix this bug is adding\n.\nGTA3 has decent support for DirectInput controls and that's good enough for me. There's plenty of people with Xinput controllers though. San Andreas recently got a patch to support them but GTA3 hasn't had that patch yet despite using the same engine.\nis a mod that adds support along with the correct HUD buttons.\nIf you change mouse sensitivity in game (which everyone would, since it's designed for monitors with like 8 DPI), it only changes the X sensitivity while leaving the Y axis to go wild.\nis a patch to fix that bug.\nThis one isn't a big issue (I don't use it) but this game was designed to take advantage of the PS2's hardware with stuff like real-time car reflections. They couldn't be bothered to port any of these enhancements to the PC version but there is a mod that restores PS2-like graphics to the game\n(Read the instructions though!)\nIf you're a completionist, the in-game stats aren't useful at all. A member of the community made a 100% checklist that hooks the game (\n) and tells you what you still need to do if you're trying to complete the game 100%.\nAnother not-huge issue but something to keep in mind before playing. As\npoints out, their huge game with 3 different islands has no in-game map, so you either have to memorise where everything is or follow their suggestion and\nlike it's 1999.\nJust a final tip to top everything off, once you've got the game running you can delete the \"movies\" directory from the install folder and it'll no longer play the intro movies. A little nugget that will save you a few seconds after spending 20 minutes or more getting the game running.\nI do love this game but I can't honestly recommend GTA3 to anyone until they fix some of these issues.", "hours": 31.8, "username": "Rossco", "products": 627, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

One fix I found, and this applies to GTA Vice City and San Andreas as well, is to ENABLE Vsync.  The games aren't really meant to be played at today's ridiculously high framerates, and as such, this can fix a lot of timing and control related issues.\nBut if you can get it to run, just, holy crap.  There is elegance in this game's design and relative simplicity compared to the later entries that makes it enthralling like few other games out there.  IMHO, it still holds up extremely well, even compared to it's sequels.\nEven if this game doesn't work, you can ask Steam for a refund, then use that money to get the PS2 version for like $2 new on Amazon or something.

It only falls behind because the other GTA's improved on this one, but being the first 3D GTA, it was very impressive at the time and still today. The story is simple, being a mute guy that mostly just takes jobs from other Liberty City residents. Gameplay wise, the on-foot and shooting sections are a bit clunky, but it seems that Rockstar Games was aware of that, and most of the time you'll be driving, with simple but responsive gameplay. And the missions feel surprisingly varied, and aren't too hard with some exceptions. The music is good, but the soundtrack is a bit short. And of course, free roaming is as good as ever, especially while driving a tank! In the end, if this was the only GTA out there, it would stand the test of time for me, but the others put this on a bit on the shadows. But definitely a classic, especially because it's one of the roots for all sandbox games today.\nNote: Even if you don't like mods, there's 3 that i would probably recommend.\n1 - SilentPatch, an unofficial patch that fixes many bugs and issues.\n2 - Widescreen fix, for adjusting the image correctly for your widescreen.\n3 - GInput, if you want to play with a controller.", "hours": 34.9, "username": "jpsf91", "products": 636, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Despite this convenience, GTA III, forgiven by the fact this game is over a decade old, does not work with Windows 10.\nEncountered problems (that I do not consider just a bug):\n-Cutscenes freeze and can cause the game to crash\n-Entities appear in the wrong place (glitched) in cutscenes\n-Controls frequently become unresponsive or get stuck (I have sticky keys disabled)\n-Main menu text can become invisible until Steam overlay is viewed (possibly just a Steam overlay bug)\n-Possibly other bugs that I have not yet encountered, and do not wish to on the risk of not qualifying for a refund\nI do not know if any of the above is encountered with Windows 8, but I have played a standalone copy of GTA III on Windows 7 and can confirm that it works fine. If you think that this review is misleading, please let me know and I will delete any genuine bugs listed and so on.", "hours": 0.3, "username": "Rhyzeless\u2122", "products": 183, "early_access": false}

The only gta game ive ever completed at the time of this review is gta 5 which is the easiest by far but these older games are still really bloody fun and deserve good scores, they are really difficult to complete too especially this one.\nI first played this game on the original xbox at my uncles house and i was about 4 or 5 years old and this game didnt seem all that violent and i hardly ever did missions i used to just run around a kill people and have fun but now that i have the steam version and around 10 years later im actually old enough to play it and i understand the game and enjoy it even more, i havn't yet completed it but will eventually (hopefully) and man this game is worth buying.\nI recommend you buy the bundle with GTA3, GTA VC, and GTA SA. Otherwise you aren't getting all the value you should be getting. play each game for about 3-5 hours before you judge them because even though they are old they are still amazing gta games. i havn't played a gta i havn't liked although ive never played VC Stories, and LC Stories or Chinatown wars or even GTA 1 but played all the others and havn't completed any (besides 5) and ive gotten close on pretty much all of them. but anyway im just yacking on now.\nPros - Interesting characters (besides Claude the protagonist who doesnt talk), big map, nice cars, good weather effects, decent graphics, fun missions, money is easy to make but easy to spend too, really good soundtrack.\nCons - Terrible combat system which got me killed many times, not a whole lot of guns, some pretty hard and frustrating mission were in there, lifeless protagonist, cars felt too slow sometimes, cops were hard to lose, poorly explained mission objectives for some missions, soundtrack is good but not many songs.\nGood outweighs the bad here but could be much better. By the GTA 3 trilogy for GTA 3, VC and SA and its well worth it.\n7 out of 10. could be 8, 9 or 10 but the missions are unbalanced and some required about 20 retries for me and really annoyed me and im not even halfway yet but its still pretty awesome.", "hours": 13.8, "username": "Zodiac011", "products": 189, "early_access": false}

I haven't played them, I have a really old computer....\nSome missions are really hard, if you are not used to  play fps games... It can be very annoying to aim, and you have to be quick too (which I am not)...\nAnyway ... I like the way it can feel casual, you can cruise around all you like.

You can even grab a policecar or ambulance and go on vigilante-missions, while listening to the 9 different radiostations, or your own mp3 player ... This was so original, back when the game released...\nYou start the game on an island called Portland, the bridge to the other areas are closed due to repairs... First time you drive around in Portland can be very confusing, but as you learn the map, you can easily make you way around.\nWhen you have completed like at least 10 missions the bridge will be repaired. That means there is a whole new area to get to know, it is a pretty big map, and you can get lost pretty quick. There are new cars, new secrets and some new weapons I think-\nSome CONS:\nI have completed half the game, but got stuck on a really tough mission.... Some missions have a timer, but most don't. There are usually multiple ways you can complete the missions... It would have been awesome if you could skip the missions that are too hard, and I wish I could just save the game at any time...

Too bad it didn\u2019t age nearly as well as the next two games.\nWhen it came out, GTAIII was heralded as the first great step to a brand new era of Grand Theft Auto games. In retrospect, it is more of a mixture of new elements that later defined the series, and old ones left from the first three games. The location (Liberty City, an alternative New York), many characters, and things like the top-down driving camera, car crusher, bomb shop are all relics of the past, all forgotten in later instalments.\nThey fit nicely alongside the new additions though, like third-person gameplay, the cinematic mission briefings, the new car physics, and the weapon handling system. These all made GTAIII not only accessible to a wider audience, but did so without dumbing down the game too much for the plebs.\nExploration and running amok randomly were always part of GTA, and GTAIII is no exception. The return of the rampage challenges and the collectibles also support the free roam aspect, but the real strength lies in the missions. The loose collection of jobs is replaced by a massive storyline about a mute small-time gangster who has to work his way up in organised crime to take revenge on the woman who shot him in the back.\nThe plot is grim, but the execution isn\u2019t so. The series always had a hefty dose of dark humour and liked to satirise the consumer-oriented society. This is even more apparent here, where human lives have no meaning, and you may cause mayhem for the silliest of reasons.\nThe gameplay and controls by today\u2019s standards sadly lack a lot, and the engine isn\u2019t really suited for post Windows XP systems.

You play the role of a bank robber named Claude, and you become entrapped in a world of gangsters and corruption very quickly.  This was the first GTA game to change from the topdown view of the previous titles and move to a third person view - which combined the a new third-person and driving experience in a new game engine.\nIn GTA III we have the main story line, in which you can pick and choose which missions to complete for certain characters. Many of the missions are not mandatoy to move the story forward however. You can carry out smaller side activities such as being a taxi for the night, or hijacking an ambulance resucing people and dropping them off at the hospital.\nThe graphics are dated but it is over ten years old, what were you expecting? You can get graphically enhancing community made mods to increase the fidelity a bit too. I personally really like these dated looking graphics.\nGTA III will challenge you at points; more so that you will probably end up dying quite a bit. Some missions require a lot of shooting and evading police, while others involve a little bit of parkour and trying not to just kill yourself in a stupid manner. The re-spawn system is very good in GTA though; you loose all your weapons as well as having to pay a fee for the hospital having to patch you up.\nAs you can see, I have over a hundred hours in GTA III, this is through having multiple playthroughs, as well as completing the game 100% on a number of occasions; however this past week I did a full playthrough of the story and a couple of the side activities and this took me almost twelve hours to complete. There is a ton more content to play in that playthrough too, so you can easily get about fifteen plus hours out of one playthrough of GTA III if you desire.\nOddly enough I had no real game breaking technical issues with GTA III, the only one I did find is it is not recommended to play this game with more than one monitor activated at a time, as your mouse will sometimes wander out of the game window and you will end up minimizing your game all the time. To be honest though; just the one issue on a ten year old game is pretty good going if you ask me.\nIn conclusion, GTA III is a land mark in gaming history; it is the game which revolutionized the GTA series, sparked media controversy, and most of all, gave us one of the best games in history. Most will have already completed this game; however if you haven't - I strongly advise you dust your copy off and give it a weekend of your time to play.\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Both Vice City and S.A have solid gameplay and story that hold up to this day, this game however does not. Every single critique of this game I have is fixed in Vice City. The story is weak, it\u2019s a revenge tale and yet the main character Claude shows no emotions nor speaks throughout the entire game. You feel empty at the end because it never seemed as if Claude ever cares about anything. You betray characters at a dime for no reason. There is no map, and the mini-map doesn\u2019t tell you where the pay and spray and ammunition are so you have to literally learn the streets. You have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on nothing (except guns but good luck finding the ammunation). There are only 3 hideouts and they all look like\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 for a millionaire Claude sleeps on the floor on the concrete. Every single gang in the game except one is out to kill you and have laser sharp aim. The camera is terrible and will get you killed. The crosshair is not correctly calibrated, bullets go outside of the circle and to the right in the exact same position always, so it is not a glitch but poor programing. The music is terrible, and theirs only about 3 1/2 hours of radio for a 20 hour game. A single station will only have about 20 minutes or about 5 songs each game so it gets extremely repetitive. The map is sectioned off by three bridges, each island is incredibly small. The reason why this is a problem is that there is no map and the game will have missions where you have to travel across islands against the clock. Since there is no map you will fail missions simply because you can\u2019t find the bridge. Cars die in 5-8 hits. The best way to restore your health is to kill yourself because hookers take too long and finding health power-ups is at best random since there is no map and they are not labeled on the minimap. There is armor in the game but I never in 17 hours found it, not once! The handling of the cars is awful and will get you killed since cars can only take 6-8 hits. I played it to see the story and in all honesty it wasn\u2019t worth it. Stick to Vice City, and SA, they are much better games by far.

Basically, the game is locked at 30FPS unless you disable the frame-limiter in the video options for the game. This will make the game run a hell of a lot smoother, however disabling it causes a lot of bugs (most notably backing up while in a car it goes EXTREMELY slow).

But I cannot reccomend that you buy this version.

Setting that aside, GTA III's story is not original but it's only a pretense for the crazy missions you will be doing. You will always have some people (you get to work with the mafia, yakuza, etc) your character goes to, to receive a mission, then on and on until you complete all of them.

{"product_id": "12100", "page": 125, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-04-22", "text": "Every legend begins somewhere, and Grand Theft Auto III is the game that laid the foundation not only for the entire GTA series as we know it today, but in many ways for the entire open-world sandbox structure of games that continue to enjoy popularity.  It's been said that this game pales in comparison to the games that would come later in the 'GTA III trilogy', namely Vice City and San Andreas.  While it's true that those games further refined and expanded upon the GTA experience in important ways, the essential building blocks for those changes were created here in GTA III.\nI've trumped up the historical importance of the game a bit but the question remains as to whether the gameplay in GTA III has held up, especially in relation to the later iterations in the series.  Thankfully I can answer that with a resounding, \"Yes!\"  So let's talk about some of the things that make this game tick.  First and foremost, we have the story.  In GTA III Rockstar was pinning down some of the aspects that would come to be regarded as the Rockstar style of storytelling.  The story here is basically a love letter to latter day crimeland movies like Goodfellas, Heat, Donnie Brasco, Reservoir Dogs, and the like.  In this capacity all the requisite pieces are in play, including the Italian mafia, Japanese yakuza, Chinese triads, as well a healthy assortment of street level thugs.  You are a mute protagonist (who we would later know as Claude thanks to GTA: San Andreas), making a name for himself on the back of jobs from all these various criminal factions.  Naturally there are betrayals, double-crosses, hits and feints between all of these organizations, and Rockstar handles its authorial pen deftly enough to keep the story moving at a good pace.  The whole story has the tone and feel of a pulp crime movie you might see as part of a matinee crime movie marathon; nothing of great substance, but a whole lot of fun nevertheless.\nIn GTA III we also see the beginnings of Rockstar's tendency to include well-known actors performing voice work in their games.  Here we have Michael Madsen, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Rappaport, Debi Mazar, Kyle MacLachlan, and gangster movie legend Frank Vincent all playing supporting roles in the game.  The caliber of voice acting in this game really does some great things for the conveyance of the story.  In the hands of lesser actors, certain aspects of this story might have come off as laughably cringe-worthy.  As it is we are treated to voice work performed by old pros, particularly where crime drama is concerned.\nHere we are also treated to the first GTA game to include an absolutely killer soundtrack complete with genre specific radio stations, distinct DJs for each radio station, and some great licensed music.  It had been quite a few years since I played this game, and these tunes (as well as spoken dialog) really filled me with a sense of nostalgia.  In truth it's the radio stations that give this game its comedic timing and fantastically dark sense of humor.  As an added bonus, the PC port of this game allows you create a custom playlist of mp3s which can be imported into the game.  I really had a great time importing my own tunes into the game.  Once you do so, the 'MP3 Player' becomes selectable in any vehicle just like a normal radio station which plays your tracks on random repeat.  Let me tell you that you haven't lived until you've gone on a drive-by rampage with Electric Wizard's Funeralopolis blaring from the sound system of your Patriot.  >=D\nThe gameplay mechanics are admittedly somewhat long in the tooth at this point, but even still they are pretty darned enjoyable.  The drifty, somewhat floaty driving mechanics that are a hallmark of 3D GTA games make their debut here.  At first the driving might seem a slightly off, being that I don't know of any other driving game that handles quite like the GTA games.  The handling is a bit loose, but once you get that part dialed in it's a real blast.  Of course the looseness of vehicle handling depends a lot on what vehicle you're in at any given time.  It does need to be said that there are no motorcycles in GTA III, which for me is perhaps one aspect of the later games that I missed the most here.  There are also no helicopters, and only one (notoriously difficult to control) aircraft.  That said, the variety of vehicles available here is suited well to the game, and I feel that the slightly limited selection of vehicles can be forgiven being that we are talking about the first GTAs first foray into full 3D.\nThis was my first play though of the Steam PC port of GTA III, and I will say that I found some relatively minor issues with the port.  First and foremost, the aiming mechanics were \u2026 problematic for me in this version.  In the 'Classic Control' scheme, the relatively responsive nature of the auto-targeting feature found in the console version of the game just doesn't carry over very well in the PC version.  It fails to reliably switch between targets, and in many cases it fails to\nany targets at all (despite the fact that said targets are in the process of filling you with lead).  Furthermore, when you're using the Classic Control scheme the right thumb stick puts you in first person look perspective rather than adjusting the 3rd person camera as one might expect.  Others may have had a slightly different experience with Classic Mode controls, but for me the combination of the above factors made this option a non-starter.  The 'Standard Control' scheme makes some marked improvements to the above, but in this case you're stuck strictly with free aiming.  I tend to prefer keyboard & mouse controls for games that require free aiming, and indeed given that strafing features prominently into the Standard Control scheme in GTA III, one might assume that KB+M is what the developers had in mind here \u2026 except that KB+M makes driving nearly impossible (although not\nimpossible as I do know at least one person that beat this game entirely with KB+M).  Using the Standard Control scheme, I ultimately ended up ruling in favor of using a controller to better facilitate driving, although I did find a helpful mod that made this option a bit more feasible.  The\nallows you to fully utilize an Xinput device in GTA III which makes using a controller in the game a bit more palatable, and has the added benefit of additional customizable settings.  It even swaps out correct button icons for onscreen prompts.  So there's that.\nOn my (Nvidia-based) gaming rig there were also a couple of graphical glitches present in this port.  Most noticeably I encountered the 'dark vehicles' glitch, in which all the vehicles appear to have a much darker tint than they should.  For this issue I applied a second light weight user-made patch to the game which resolved the issue promptly.  If you find yourself with the same problem,\nis probably worth your time as well.\nAt the end of the day, the question is whether or not this game is still worth your time.  Given the popularity (and occasional notoriety) enjoyed by the GTA series, you probably already know whether the source material is your cup of tea.  Dark comedy, violence, and debauchery abound!  If you're already a fan of the series, or if you're looking to get into the 3D era of GTA games at the ground floor, I would say that this game still holds a lot of enjoyment even today.  It had been a number of years since I last played this game and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected I would especially given the historical perspective of subsequent GTA games.

Blew my mind that a game existed like this as early as 2001; the amount of attention to detail whether it be cars, npcs, or the fact that its a very open world amazed me. For anyone that hasn't played it yet, i highly recommend you do.\nStory: You play as Claude, a mute protagonist of the game. The story of GTA 3 tends to branch itself out with the various interesting characters you meet. I didnt really pay attention to the story too much until GTA IV but i can tell you that 3 does deliver some interesting story telling.\nGameplay: The gameplay is in Thirdperson, but you can switch to first person while using certain weapons. You are able to run, sprint, jump and crouch. There are many cars to drive as well as boats and flyable vehicles.\nMusic/SFX/Voiceacting: The music to GTA 3 is usually heard via the radio, Rockstar knows how to pick out good songs; its on par with the music selection for Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. The sound effects are also really well made. The voiceacting is pretty good for its time as well.", "hours": 6.8, "username": "Blargman", "products": 142, "early_access": false}

Wounded but not dead, you find yourself arrested and transported to prison but you evade from your transport when the colombian cartel makes an attack on the patrol you are stuck into to help another prisonner to escape. You use this opportunity to beat a police officer, remove your handcuffs and evade from your transportation truck. You learn about 8-Ball and he helps you with his contacts.\nRoaming around Liberty City to do missions for the Mafia, the Yakuza and some independent names, you are thrown around to do the dirty jobs like the handyman you are.\nThe map is huge and the game looks good when you think about the games that came out around the same years.\nIt's in the veine of the GoldSrc Engine, Unreal Engine, id Tech 3 but with a big map made with free-roaming in mind. Driver 2 would be a better comparison. Restating that GTA3 was the first attempt from Rockstar to make a 3D game, They didn't miss their shot.\nThere's a lot of things to do.\nThe missions are non-linear, you always have the choice between a mission giver or another, there's the phone boot side-quests, you can do Taxi, Ambulance and Police missions when you get the specific car and you can always free-roam in Liberty City causing carnage for fun and giggles.\nThe sound effects are great, you always feel like you're in a real city with the car sounds and pedestrians talking.\nA gunshot disturbs the peace of the moment when everyone start screaming and running.\nThe game is immersive, you feel like you're there, walking/running around in Liberty City.\nThere's enough weapons to have fun the entire game. There's not three different sets like in San Andreas but the game isn't that long either. Everything is well balanced for its size and for it's date of creation.\nThe physic in the game is alright, not perfect but very good for what it needed to be.\nThe driving physic is sometimes weird, you feel like in a pinball machine when you start hitting everything around but otherwise, handbrakes, quick turns and donuts can be done easily. Depending on the car you have, controlling it is never that much of a pain unless it's a really bad car which was obviously a choice from the devs. Bad cars roll badly.\nThe shooting mecanics are archaic to say the least, it's kinda hard hard to deal with when you are in a fire fight, mostly when you are surrounded. The game was made to be unforgivable in some ways.\nWhen you try to play wisely, you get into cover and you try to step a little bit outside of your cover in a way that the AI doesn't really see you and then you shoot. ... or you try to stay in front of the enemies, hoping that you will kill everyone before you die. Good luck if they have decent weaponry. It's not impossible and it's still a lot of fun.\nYou can only shoot and walk with the UZI or pistol, every big weapons are used as if you were a turret which is kind of annoying sometimes but the bullet effects are eye candy though. It's always fun to make your own justice anyway.\nI don't have a lot of negative to say about this game.\nMost negative points would come from a comparison with the futur games which wouldn't be fair at all.\nEvery futur installments added stuff to what GTA3 was. GTA3 doesn't lack stuff, it's just the next games that are even better than what was this awesome game.\nThere's obviously some glitches and bugs since it's a first attempt at a 3D game but nothing gamebreaking.\nA problem I had was that the game version I have was censored for whatever reason.\nI'm not from a country renowned to ban such games and I bought the game in the official Rockstar Pack with every other GTA games directly on Steam. The problem is well known though so yeah, there's not a lot of things more to say about his.\nTo end this straight : GTA3 is a classic, it's a game that you must own if you understand what gaming is all about and if it's your kind of game to start with.

These can include weapons at your hideout as well as other perks.\nAs for graphics, the pc version i would say looks alot better than it did on ps2. You can find extra in world objects, some game mechanics work differently. But there are pro's and cons to the pc version in comparrison to the ps2 version. There are some good videos outlining this on the game hub page if you are interested in the differences.\nEven though this game is now over 10 years old, it can still bring fun and laughter; especially with the radio stations, missions, backround dialogue and mayhem.\nI dont think many people would regret having this game in their library.

I have 100% the game twice on other platforms. GTA III changed games as we knew them. This game brought violence, grit, pure unfiltered satire of out modern society into a massive openworld game.\n-----Story 10/10-----------\nYou play as someone who has been cheated on. You are double crossed during a robbery by your girlfriend and left to rot in jail. Luckily you dont make it that far. Your convoy is interrupted and you manage to escape. You need money to climb the ladder and get revenge on the people that wronged you. The characters and people you meet are the seediest of their kind. Mobsters, pimps, dealers, the common criminal. You do work for them to get the paper.\n-----Gameplay 8/10--------\nFor a game with nothing to take ideas from this game works surprisingly well. The guns are weak at first, but as you unlock more the shootouts get better. Cars play the biggest part in this game. The city is pretty big and you will need to get around quick. The handling is a bit unrealistic and there is nothing as annoying as flipping a car and having it blow up on you, but speeding around the city is amazing.\n------Graphics 5/10------\nWhat did you expect for a game from 2001. The people are blocky and the terrain can be muddy at times but in its time it looked damn good.\n-----PC Port 5/10---------\nI originally played this on the playstation two and a bit on the iphone for the mobile edition. Honestly the PC port is pretty bad. You will probably need to run it in compatibility mode to get it to work at all. Even so it does crash from time to time.\n-------Overall game is 10/10 (This version gets a 7/10)-----\nI would reccomend this game to anyone looking to have some fun.

Trust me, I didn't even know what I was doing because I had just arrived in America at that time and my computer seemed to have a problem with allowing me to play it normally cause the screen would go black every 5 minutes and I'd have to change the camera view to get it back to normal. Suffice to say, I've managed to reconcile the problem since then (15 years ago) and it works beautifully. I suggest modding it a bit to make it look and play like a more modern GTA of today. (OnePiece's HD Cars and Tri-Pack plus some much needed improved HD city textures will allow it to look a bit more fresh) It's a classic and one of the best GTAs to try and get 100% in since it's one of the easiest to do so in. Also, I recommend switching out Steam's EXE with a regular 1.1 version if you want to avoid the dark colored cars problem. Editing the TXD file works too but changing the EXE won't break the game. If anything, it'll allow more mods to work since some don't work with Steam's version.

Eventually, a mob guy named Luigi helps you out and you work your way up. I won't get into the rest because I know most people have played it. I mean, it's even on phones. The story, though simple, is great.\nThe missions are a blast, some are super short driving tasks, others are all out adventures. None of them are too long and are great for killing time if you got 30-45 minutes to spare.\nSome of the best moments are when you're simply trying to end a mission, but manage to get stuck with 4+ stars on your wanted level. Can't end the job? Well, killing off cops and raming through their forces in hopes to lose them or hide is incredibly fun. Thrilling I would go as far as to say.\nWith the exception of the horrible looking people, this game actually doesn't look too bad. Even though it came out in the early 2000's.\nThe controls could be better, as could gamepad support, but some tweaking fixes it.\nAs for the soundtrack, it could be better. Vice City has a better one, and I'm saying that as someone that doesn't really like 80's music.\nAs for how this game runs, oh god, if you're on Windows 8... It is hell.\nWindows 8/8.1 users beware: The game will crash, with only about a 2 out of 10 chance of making it past the R* logo. Because the W8 developers had this \"wonderful\" idea of \"out with the old, in with the new\" games that were made from this era tend to not work. It could be worse, I mean at least it occasionally runs. But seriously microsoft, Windows 10 better run this game, or I'm buying the classics version on PS3.

The game itself was based in a fictional place called Liberty City, which supposedly resembles New York. Thanks to the engine, the city is dynamic, having a 24 hour day cycle and weather changes.\nDuring the game you will be playing as Claude, a mute protagonist. You get betrayed during a bank robbery by your girlfriend, which ends up with you getting caught by the cops. You escape and you seek out revenge.\nAt first you will be working for the Mafia, helping them out with a rival family and the Triads. Then, after them betraying you, you start working for the Yakuza (Japanese). Eventually, you do get revenge on your girlfriend, who is a member of the Colombian Cartel. But to do that, you trigger a war between the Yakuza and Cartel.\nBy the end of the game, 5 out of 7 gangs total, will be hostile towards you - attacking you on sight. This can become extremely annoying, considering that some gangs have shotguns which can blow up your car in 2 shots. For comparison, by the end of the game in GTA Vice City, you had only 1 gang that would be hostile towards you, and while in GTA San Andreas, you could completely wipe off all other gangs.\nI also feel that Rockstar didn't care much about the story, cause in this game your protagonist pretty much backstubs everyone to get his revenge, which is why so many gangs will be against you.\nUnlike other GTAs, majority of the game involves using cars:\nIn all honesty, there been like ~ 5 missions that involve genuine shootouts, and i sort of understand why.\nAll GTA 3 era games were harsh, but the thing that set GTA 3 apart from the others, was that you weren't able to crouch. In other GTA's starting with Vice City, you could crouch behind any cover. Most objects would fully cover your buddy when crouched, and when you start shooting, your character will rise a bit above his cover.\nThe other thing that this game is missing, is a map. Only the minimap is present, but you can never view the whole map. The city is broken down into 3 islands, and each time you reach a new one, the game will show you the icons for Pay'n'Spray, Ammunation, but only for the first few missions, then they are gone. So if you are gonna play it, you better memorize the necessary locations.\nAlso, you can't shoot tires or break windows of a car. You can't even damage a car with a baseball bat. These features started appearing in Vice City.\nIt is fairly low on content compared to other GTAs.\nThere are no motorcycles or fly-able vehicles.\nAmounts of songs in the radio - 8 radio channels, each having about 6 songs on average. Compared to say Vice City, which would have 15 songs per channel, that's pretty low. Also, majority of the music isn't very popular. In fact, if you start searching for most of them, you will only see them under GTA 3 logos. Not that they were bad or anything, but clearly it shows that they had budget problems.\nAlso, unlike other GTAs, there is only 1 weapon per tier.\nThe PC port itself is quite bad. Mouse issues. FPS limited to 30 fps.\nI suggest using SilentPatch. It fixes most of these issues, but unfortunately, if you die or get caught by the police, the game will crush. I hope you all do remember that during the GTA 3 era, we didn't have quick saves and only way to save was to go to the hideout.\nWell, if you are interested in the story, then you may buy it, cause all GTA 3 era games are connected. Chronologically, plot wise, the games are set this way:\n1986 - Vice City\n1992 - San Andreas\n2001 - GTA III\nOr in case you wanted to see how much the series has evolved (like me), then you can get it as well. This game has quite an impressive lift bridge.\nOr maybe you would prefer to play it in top down view?

The second was pretty much identical to the first except for the \"loyalty\" system and has been largely forgotten but never mind. They were fun games, and whilst they weren't the first to let you be the bad guy, it was somewhat satisfying the way the city seemed to work around you to clear up your mess and try to restore the status quo. Unfortunately however I never actually finished either of them because there didn't seem to be much progression. Yes, you'd get a new map to play on every now and then, and some of the missions could be done in different orders, but there wasn't much personality. The missions were just a means to an end - namely collecting enough cash to move on to the next level.\nUltimately I think they could have been largely forgotten in years to come, save for the \"controversy\" aspect.\nThen this gem came along. Rather than just moving the same games into a 3D environment, the game has been designed entirely from scratch. It might as well have been called something different for all the similarity it has to it's predecessors. Not only do we have full voice acting by many household names which flesh out the characters and add that much needed personality, but the city itself feels far more alive and real than ever before.\nCorners are no longer all at 90 degrees, there are literally hundreds of bonuses, secrets and extra missions you can do on the side whenever you want, you can backtrack at any point to visit previous areas of the game and see what's changed (although be careful of straying into the wrong neighbourhood if you've been upsetting people), full radio stations with a good selection of licensed music (and the ability to play your own MP3s on the PC version - nice touch), fully working public transit systems and a fascinating storyline of betrayal, loyalty and trust make this something that has to be played by everybody, no matter what your view on the violence aspect. Come on. Even if you don't want to complete the missions themselves you can spend hours just riding a taxi around town. Yes, this game even managed to make \"Crazy Taxi\" almost entirely redundant.\nWhilst many people could argue (and with good cause) that the later games in the series such as Vice City and 4 are better in nearly every way, for me this will always be my favourite simply because it was such a welcome surprise - were it not for 3 then GTA wouldn't be the multi-million dollar franchise it is today.", "hours": 23.0, "username": "Hamakei", "products": 2375, "early_access": false}

Instead like the pauper child I was, I had to go around a friend's house and 'play' the game. You might be surprised to find out that when I say 'Play' I actually mean mess about, such as the innocence of youth.\nSo visiting the game 10 years later, as an older, wiser, sillier man with the hindsight of GTA IV's version of Liberty City has been a great experience. There's actually a really good story within GTA III, something that I never appreciated or cared for back when playing at a friend's house (all I wanted to do was steal cars and shoot people). The story that is complimented well by some pretty fun missions and voice acting with one voice stealing the show - there aren't many games out there with Japanese American Accents with a strong double lisp.\nIn general GTA III has aged well, which I don't always find from those first wave of 3D games ~2000ish. The soundtrack has held up well, and it's nice to visit the early days of Lazlow on Chatterbox, and I'm sure some of the stations have even been remastered .\nGraphically the game looks pretty solid even if I did have a few issues, but I think that was more my fault than the games (I had installed the Xbox Mod). There is a generally known 'issue' with the Steam gtaIII.exe file which can be resolved with an easy to install TXD file on the official forums and Steam forums (it'll fix the dark coloured cars).\nThe one criticism I might have would be an improvement to the camera controls, but I can forgive the lack of control (and the frustration that can sometimes be caused). This issue really comes to head during the gun battles, which at times can be awkward to aim due to a general lack of free aim mode.\nGTA III might not be as vast or as epic as GTA V, but it captures the reality and craziness that I suspect GTA IV was attempting to offer. The blend of comedy within the serious tones and themes works well, most of which coming across in the now trademark radio stations, but also within Liberty City.\nThere are a ton of easy to miss signs and shops that hold double meaning and spoof popular icons and culture (most of which still relevant today). So while there aren't any real random encounters in GTA III, it's still worthwhile exploring Liberty City as the Sandbox Nature can still reward you with a few laughs due to ad-lib citizen remarks, billboards, shops, and funky AI.\nIn short...\nGTA III is a blast from the past that's still well worth checking out, especially if it's cheap during on the Steam Sales. As long as you realise this game is over 10 years old, and can appreciate the early attempts of a sandbox game I think you'll enjoy it. If nothing else it's nice to see the genesis of what we know as modern GTA.\nCheck the Steam Forums/Rockstar Forums for the fix for the Steam version before you play, and enjoy.", "hours": 18.1, "username": "Chris", "products": 1902, "found_funny": 11, "early_access": false}

Amazing, truly amazing.

Easily the shortest GTA game clocking in at 14 hrs with full mission completion. While it may have been revolutionary in 2001, it pales it comparison to later titles in the series. The characters can be best described as one note and underwritten. Claude is easily the least compelling protagonist not just in the GTA franchise, but in gaming in general. Having him silently take orders and essentially betraying anyone and everyone, the story leaves off with most gangs in Liberty City hating you. Rather than rise to the top of the criminal pyramid, Claude elects instead to kill and betray anyone at the slightest suggestion.\nThe controls for driving and shooting are solid, especially on PC. However, any mission involving AI can become frustrating very quickly. Some missions feel completely unrealistic and contrived, with fail states that can only be described as nonsensical. Most of this game's length can be accounted for by repeatedly failing some of the tougher missions. In almost all the firefights, the enemies simply camp around a corner and wait for their cheap shot. Death can come from myriad unfair game mechanics and can lead to some genuine frustration that is not to be found in later titles.\nIf you are interested in the GTA franchise, this is not the place to start.

Ray at some point leaves Liberty City and leaves you weapons and a bullet-proof Patriot. You are introduced to Donald by Ray.

{"product_id": "12100", "page": 149, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-08-10", "text": "Recommended - with caveats.\nControls: A major hurdle.  For a while I was prepared to give in and call the system broken.  After working through it, I eventually began to find a work around.  I spent most of the game using a 360 controller because, as the title implies, much of the game is spent inside vehicles and the mouse/keyboard vehicle control is dire.  However the combat controls are much easier with mouse/keyboard, where you have the option to point directly at a target and move the camera at will.  When using a controller, one has to rely on the faulty targetting system which will rarely aim at who you wanted it to and is in general quite clunky.  I could also find no option to turn off inverted y-axis aiming for the controller.  The upshot of all this was that if I was using a first-person weapon, I would have to grab the mouse to aim, and if a particularly challenging foot-based mission cropped up, I would have to change the control scheme entirely.  Workable, but flawed.\nGameplay:  I thought this game was exceptionally well structured but first I should add that this is not a good sandbox by modern standards.  It was probably the archetype for the modern sandbox 'genre' but things have moved on a lot since then.  GTA III is just not able to compete with more recent games in terms of scale, scope or variety.  This does not mean however that the game cannot be enjoyed on its own terms.  One specific example from my experience was my initial frustration with the lack of any kind of overworld map - something that would be unthinkable in any modern-day open world game - but this merely led to me developing a more thorough knowledge of the city streets than possibly any other game I've played.  The areas are large enough to become immersed in, but never so large that you feel lost or overwhelmed and each street almost feels like it has its own unique personality of sorts, which aids navigability and adds to the charm of the experience.  If it had not been for the quality of the gameplay, I would not have had the patience to stick with the controls that I described in the previous paragraph.\nStory:  Behind a minimalistic mission-based story progression, there is actually quite an intriguing plot going on in the background.  Nothing particularly special, but more than I was expecting.  On a side note, I'm not sure if our protagonist is a soulless mercenary or just a bit dim, but either way he seems more than happy to go along with whatever maniacal schemes his employers hatch for him.\nGraphics:  This is not a pretty game.  I don't believe this to be particularly pertinent, but it's worth pointing out.  The best that can be said for them is that they are functional and I was able to tell what everything was.\nSound:  Very good.  There is no background music in the game besides the intro and credits sequences, but the soundtrack to the game is provided by radio stations which can be accessed while in a vehicle.  These cater to a diverse selection of musical tastes, and most players will find at least two favourites which they will keep coming back to.  The scripts for the DJs has also been artfully written and it's clear a lot of effort went into creating a cohesive aural environment that acts as a reflection of the city you drive in.  This applies tenfold to the talk radio station, Chatterbox, which bears several repeat listenings.  The sound effects are also of top quality and you can get a feel of the car you have just entered merely by the sound of its engine revving.\nOverall, I do recommend this game to anyone with the patience to work around a poor control scheme and somewhat archaic design to see the unpolished gem that lies beneath them.  I do not think it still deserves the piles of praise that were heaped upon it on its initial release, but equally it is impossible to deny its merits, and the irrepressible charisma with which it flaunts them.", "hours": 70.8, "username": "LINK3", "products": 297, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

In 2001 Rockstar games released this title and made history and pretty much everyone has played this game and knows what's it about, but the question is - while being a ground breaking title more than 10 years ago, is it worth playing now and how it has aged ?\nSo game looks pretty good, for the time and even now-days  the graphics feels tolerable. It features day & night cycles and dynamic weather. Environment is pretty huge and worth exploring, you'll find some hidden weapons, side missions etc.\nVoice acting is done pretty well, however recordings them selves are at pretty low quality, game has several radio stations with different styles of music and tracks, however I disliked pretty much every soundtrack, but maybe thats just me and for the time that music was actually pretty cool.\nStory is really generic, with you leveling up and making name for yourself in underground crime scene. Game had descent number and variety of missions, starting with some more simple and ending with some quite creative goals for the time, sometimes even involving whole map. It took me about 13 hours to complete the story and do about 40-60% of side stuff.\nOne aspect where game have aged terribly is the game play it self. Car handling is good, but physics sometimes are just awkward and bizarre and sometimes slightest hit can make your car flip and spin like in first flat out game. Gun controls also are pretty weird, were you have to often aim at where bullets are going not where crosshair is pointed.\nMissions themselves are quite challenging and more than often i found myself replaying same missions more than 3 times in row.\nAt the end i would recommend this game if you somehow missed this title, to see where sandbox genre has started. If you want to go and get some nostalgic feel than it's a mixed bag, with some things cool and fun to play while others just being aged and a bit frustrating.\nI guess at the time game was mind blowing and had earned a lot of 10/10s, but today for me game feel's like solid 7.0.\nThanks for reading.", "hours": 14.5, "username": "ic", "products": 297, "early_access": false}

It may be a little dated and all but there are mods for that. This game has a great introduction introducing the main character (Claude Speed) and his friend (8-Ball) who comes into the story again much later. You start doing minor jobs as a driver for a pimp/club owner. Then you do jobs for the mafia from heisting a bank truck, to delivering a corpse to cover up a murder. Again the graphics and A-I may be a little dated but the initial freedom does certainly put a smile on your face. The game has two paths you can go on: progress through the story, or just explore. To start you probably want to explore to get used to it. I'd suggest stealing a taxi and doing the taxi oddjob, which after you complete 100 fares you unlock a special taxt called the Borgnine. The police chases are endless fun as they are in any GTA game. I grew up on this game so it may warp my vision of its age a bit with nostalgia but still it is a great game. It does lack in several elements that are key in GTA games today, such as the lack of a full map and not being able to rotate the camera around your vehicle in angles that aren't 90 degrees, and the aiming is a little off but you'll get used to it. There also other versions such as the PS2 version, Xbox, and mobile Android and iOS devices (these versions do not support cheats but are easily modded). I'd heavily suggest that you play the PS2 version first to get a feel for what your getting into. The main differences between the PC and the PS2 are that PS2 has an auto targeting system and the camera isn't consistantly behind the player.

{"product_id": "12100", "page": 163, "page_order": 4, "recommended": false, "date": "2014-03-18", "text": "I must emphasise that this review of Grand Theft Auto III is from a 2014 perspective, and it should be noted that my opinion in 2001 was remarkably different. If I consider how I felt when I first picked up the game when it was released, it was a total breath of fresh air to the gaming market and redefined the much taken for granted \u2018sandbox\u2019 genre. Graphically impressive with a fluid control system, the gaming world seemed huge with endless activities to do and a thrilling narrative populated by great characters. Although some of these aspects still remain true, I would honestly suggest remaining with fond memories of this game as opposed to trying to relive its glory, as out of the three PS2 GTA games (III, Vice City and SA) it has aged extremely badly (by far the worst) and is only just about playable.\nThe main issues are the controls and the targeting system. Much like other gamers, I am accustomed to using a controller for the GTA series. Although it can be difficult, it is possible to get your PS3/Xbox controller to work in sync with this game, however the thought of having to map the controls or download specific programmes yourself may put gamers off from the offset. If you get past this hurdle, you\u2019ll notice that targeting in the game is extremely difficult. There is not an \u2018auto-lock\u2019 target option, which is highly inconvenient and makes missions that involved killing enemies who can target you very easily frustrating. Aiming with rifles is obviously manual, but to point a tiny aim reticule using the right analogue stick/mouse at a cartel enemy gunning you down from 5 yards is nearly impossible, meaning that you have to take out most enemies from range using the sniper rifle or grenades/rocket launcher. When the action is so fast paced and often in close proximity to the protagonist, it\u2019s very easy to fail a mission because you couldn\u2019t kill an enemy at point blank range.\nAlthough it is not apparent at first, the lack of a map is also a frustration. You do have a mini-map, but if you want a more global view of where you need to be, or where the closest ammunition store is, it really is a case of drive around and hope. During several missions, the enemy/location markers span all three islands and it can be confusing where to go, or at least, where the quickest route is (as many missions are timed), if you cannot get a global map view. If this happens during several missions, you will quickly get fed up with the experience and quit prematurely.\nThe graphics are still acceptable, especially since we consider that this game was released over a decade ago. The main aspect of the game that is never lost is the humour and pop culture satire, which may make the game playing in itself. The radio stations in particular are still hilarious to listen to, Chatterbox and the commercials specifically. If you can get the game cheap enough on a sale, perhaps just reliving some of Lazlo\u2019s best lines would be enough to justify the purchase.\nThe gaming world compared with any game in the last five years is tiny. It should be noted however that I thought this was a huge game in scope when it was released, however the whole main storyline can be completed relatively swiftly, barring any mission fails based on the bad targeting/map system. The three main islands can be driven across in the matter of minutes, yet on a positive note the vehicles still seem varied enough to make the process fresh and enjoyable. However, it does of course seem limited in comparison to its sequels. Furthermore, vechiles that we may consider certainties in Vice City and SA such as bikes, flyable planes (the Dodo does not count) and fast boats are void here, and the lack of a mission \u2018replay\u2019 option that was so well received in later instalments is obviously non-existent in GTA III.\nIt is very difficult to click the \u2018do not recommend\u2019 option for this game as it offers so many good memories combined with great humour, however it is better to remember this game how it was. Other than for a quick nostalgia trip, the gameplay missions are tiresome since they have been done and done better since the newer instalments of GTA, so many of them have been done a hundred times before. That, combined with difficult controls and no larger map, means that this game has sadly not stood the test of time. It is important to remember of course that GTA III redefined these sorts of missions and gameplay style and should be celebrated as a landmark game, however I\u2019m not sure if playing this game start to finish will give gamers much joy.\nThanks for reading this review and all comments are welcome.

Pack your self allways with bodyarmor and try jumping around against those cartel \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s. And whats all the shooting when i stroll around the city feels like everyone hates me.

I played this game back on the PS2, and repurchased the game for Steam so I could have it in perpetuity. All modern sandbox games owe everything to this series, and this game in particular.\nIn case you've never been exposed to a sandbox game before, you effectively are dropped into a city which \"lives\" - you can go around to various contacts looking for missions to accomplish (usually involving driving and shooting), explore the city looking for sights and items to collect, or even accomplish random missions like running a taxi or putting out fires with a fire engine. This game marks what was effectively the first time this sort of freedom was in a 3D game.\nThe game's story puts a low-down person fresh out of going to jail into a criminal underworld where he slowly climbs his way to the top to get revenge. I've played through this game multiple times and while it's ultimately the least of the trilogy, it is the giant whose shoulders the other two stands upon.\nI have not yet dabbled in the mod scene for this game, but searching around seems to imply there's a fairly healthy number of them to pick from, so if that's your thing, it's worth a look.

It was cool seeing the world in a new 3D perspective rather than a top-down 2D view. But my recent playthrough of this game made me realize that this game suffers from quite a few problems that makes the game almost unplayable past the 2nd half. The first thing you will notice is that you do not have a map. You actually have to look up a map on the internet if you need it. All you have to help you navigate is your minimap. Which would be fine, but nothing useful is marked on it (Like the gunstore and pay n spray). So with no overhead map, or markers on your minimap (Your safehouse and missions are marked). Navigating the city can be difficult, especially to new players. There is no GPS or anything else to help you here. All you can do is memorize your way around the old fashioned way.\nAnother issue is the AI. The enemy AI in this game is very unfair, especially on the later missions. You can be driving around minding your own business or on a mission. Then enemy gangs instantly open fire on you regardless of what car you're driving or if you're on a mission. How do they know where I am at all times and what car I'm in? I just stole a new car and they instantly know its me. They don't even have to be facing you, you just see their arms lock onto you and start shooting. That means your car will always take damage even if you don't crash into things. (They start to carry more heavy weaponary later game, so expect some cheap deaths while driving)\nLet's talk about the vehicles. They don't feel like metal cars, they feel like some paper mache creation my little brother made in 3rd grade. The cars are not durable. The cars in GTA and GTAII felt more solid than this. If you can't keep yourself on the road and not hit traffic (And not get shot at all the time) then you are going to have a huge problem keeping your vehicle, especially if it's a sports car. They handle okay for the most part, although some of the vehicles feel like you're driving on ice.\nThe weapons in this game are cool, but there's 1 gun in particular that made me almost throw my controller through my wall. It's the Carbine Rifle (M16) While this gun is probably the best in the game, it will be your death on the 2nd half of the game. Remember the unfair AI? Well, imagine several of them gunning down your little paper mache car with M16's while you're trying to beat a mission. It's a nightmare. The M16 shoots very fast. I was able to blow up a fully repaired sports car with only 16 bullets from the 60 round magazine. You can also be killed by about half a clip of ammo from it with full armor and health. Sometimes you can't even react fast enough. You just drop dead and have to reload your save. There's a reason why they changed this gun in the later games, because it's unbalanced and broken.\nThe missions can be very difficult at times. Especially the later ones. Most of the missions have either a time limit or a waypoint you have to travel to. SInce you have no map, it's hard to plot the best route to save time. Often times, you'll turn down a wrong turn or a alley with no exit costing you precious time. This game is not generous on mission time either. You can't mess around. You have to be quick to do what it wants. The missions on the first half of the game are not bad. A couple might be a little hard, but for the most part it's okay. But as soon as you start to work for Donald Love, that's when the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665starts to hit the fan.... And it stinks. I think his missions were the hardest in the game. His and Asuka's. *Shudders*\nThe soundtrack is also unimpressive. GTA is known for having pretty good soundtracks. When I first played this game, I didn't even know that the songs ingame were actually real. I thought they were just made for the game, if that can tell you anything.\nI think the metascore of 93/100 (Higher than GTA IV which got a score of 90) is a little too generous. I'd give it a 6/10.\nIf you're new to GTA and wanna start with the older ones, I do not recommend you start with this one. I recommend you start with either Vice City, or San Andreas. Both are excellent games. (And guess what! The main character actually talks in those games. Wow!)\nAlthough if you do actually decide to play this one, don't be afraid of using the cheat codes for those unfair later missions.

As most of the players know the GTA series, the only thing with GTA3 is the crude \"PS2-like\" GFX, as it was originally released for PS2 in 2001 but the disappointing part for the PS2 version is the lack of compatibility for the later revision model of the PS3 and PS4. The Steam version however may contain some GFX colour errors when you play in-game like the vehicles with a distinctive yellow glow; plus your saves from the PC Retail Version - that if you choose to transfer into the Steam Version may corrupt it.\nOverall this game is enjoyable, and it's generally for over 18s only, plus it does contain some racist stunts and footage: like the Italian Mafia going into Mob Wars with the Chinese Triads. And if you proceed after going into Mob Wars with the Triads and siding with the Diablos, then your chances of survival in the city will be reduced, due to the mobsters trying to take revenge against YOU! So, if you do want to make a 100% complete stats, then I recommend you stay away from other jobs except Luigi's. Because those Taxi/Police and Fire Engine jobs will be impossible if the mobsters start severely opposing you. And don't fail and save when you play on those \"Kill Frenzy/Ramage\" missions as those are a 1-way ticket.\nSpeaking of 1-way tickets: If you approach near Mission \"Bomb Da Base - Act II\", then be aware of Luigi's, Joey's and Toni's jobs, because if you not finished them all, you will never get the 100% completion. Same goes when you reach Staunton Island if you not finished the Jobs from Kenji when you get Donald Love's Jobs. And when you get a Mission from Shoreside Vale, except the PayPhone from Southside Hoods, DON'T buy anymore weapons. Trust me you need the cash for the final showdown.\nNow I believe this game appears to be the only game in the GTA 3D series onwards that don't reduce your Criminal Rating stats, so you can cause some cheating mayhem as you want. But don't use them for the newer versions of GTA as those Stats will be ruined.\nOne final thing, you can download some fixes like the Long Distance enhancement and some of Silent's DirectDraw fixes for this game.

This misconception is: In GTA you can do whatever you want. Any fan of the GTA series will tell you that there really isn't that much to do in GTA, because it's meant to be an arcade styled open world driving game. And this is pretty obvious in GTA III, the main character doesn't speak, which honestly... I've come to really prefer over some of the other characters in this series. GTA III didn't try to be this game where the map was meant to be explored. But it did reach out for things like an open world, and a story. I love this game because of the driving, and the fast paced missions, but I won't sit here and act like this game excels in anything other than the driving. The setting is pretty dull, and uninspired. The map was just really lifeless, and the radio station didn't help that at all. I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing hated the radio station to death, except for lazlo's station which made me laugh uncontrollably.

Alot of betrayal in GTA.\n5) meet another gang in an unlocked part of the map (game basically restarts at this point)\n6) work your way up in that gang\n7) You do jobs for a bunch of shady people\n8) These shady people set up a gang war between your original crew who two timed you, and the crew you are two timing now.\n9) You do all the missions\n10)  Uhp, random girl is kidnapped.. I oughta go save her from my arch nemesis.

I was a huge Grand Theft Auto fan but after this debacle, I completely got off the series.\nOver ten years later, on a modern computer, the game doesn't lag.  Much.  Maybe in another decade computers will be developed that will be able to run this poorly-coded garbage.  It's otherwise a fun game at times.\nPwninator score: 3/10", "hours": 1.6, "username": "Pwny McPwnPwn", "products": 65, "early_access": false}

The game itself is overly dark, Taxis are in a really dark tone of yellow, you can barely see colours of cars since they all seem almost black.\nLike I said, this game hasa really dark atmosphere, and this is what makes the game better than Vice City or San Andreas.\nFurthermore, this was the first \"3D\" GTA, so it was the beginning of a new era  the old top-down-camera is still available though).\nAll in all, the game is really worth its money, you should definitely pick it up, maybe wait for it to go on sale to do so.", "hours": 10.2, "username": "DatWut?", "products": 267, "early_access": false}

Being the first open world 3D GTA it has it's fantastic but not a perfect game. The City is Liberty City (Same City as GTA IV but more more different)  and is parody of New York, you play and Claude Speed (Who has no voice) after being betrayed by your now ex girlfriend and being put in prison you escape after your police van is attacked and now you're on a revenge trip. The City is large for being the first 3D GTA game and not as alive as Vice City (Vice City only came out not even a year after GTA 3). The Radio is decent having Push it to the Limit otherwise there is only a few recognizeable songs. The Story isn't too great. Your character doesn't talk all he does is go to a person and get a job and then execute it. Not much more than that just rinse and repeat. The jobs range from Assassinations to picking up hookers and driving them to the local Police Ball. The Combat is something I want to touch on too. Not too great. The camera can be wonky at times and the shooting seems clunky (Much more improved in Vice City). There is side content to do. Like Taxi driving and Vigilante Missions though both aren't too interesting but at least they are there for people who like to do that kind of stuff. The Driving is practally the same throughout all the 3D GTA's so theres not much to say except the driving is good but not like a racer and it feels arcadey but fun (Considering it lasted 3 games each being a little more refinded). All in all GTA 3 is still a fantastic experience. Does it still hold up today?

There's a lot of fun to be had tearing through the city on  your own personal crime wave. Offensive, yes, but the game doesn't take itself seriously. It's fun precisely because you do stuff you would never do in real life. Arcade action.\nWhile fun, the game doesn't hold up well against modern open-world games. Some missions can be difficult, so be prepared to try and fail multiple times. Difficulty isn't a problem, though. I like a challenge. Poor controls on the PC, limited camera control, lack of in-game map, and overall fragility of your character/vehicles cause a lot of frustration. Half the time I feel like I'm fighting the game itself, rather than overcoming a challenge. The costs of failure is high, and you are more likely to just reload a previous save, meaning you'll need to visit your safe house to save between every mission. I may eventually finish this game, but I have to take it in doses. I'm hoping Vice City and San Andreas are less frustrating.\nAbout controls... I like to use keyboard/mouse on foot and an XBox 360 controller while driving. The game does support controllers, but it doesn't recognize all of the buttons. If you want to use a controller, save yourself some grief and spend an extra $10 on XPadder. It's still not great, but at least you'll be able to use all buttons.

Sure I had seen it at the store and had even picked up the game to look at the artwork and screenshots but for some reason I never bought it. That is until a co-worker of mine, at the time, did a story on violence in video games. I worked at a TV News station at the time and the story was definately NOT pro game or pro GTA. After watching someone bring in their PS2 and played a bit so they could record some footage I was hooked and went and bought the game.\nGTA III is a sandbox game and very non-linear. Actually if you want to visit the rest of the areas in the game you do have to complete the threshold of missions to unlock those parts of the game but you can take your time and do other things in the mean time.\nToday the graphics look a bit dated but back in it's day the game was pretty cutting edge.  The controls were pretty easy to pick up though aiming the weapons needed some help. Driving the cars (which is the gist of the game) is straight forward too and all the cars have different capabilities. A sports car drives like a sports car while a truck drives like a truck.\nThe game has plenty of controversies to be sure. One of them is the ability to pick up \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s to \"heal\" you.  After you are done with your tryst you can, though are not required to, kill the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to get your money back. Critics lambast the game for the ability to do this but realistically the game presents you with a moral choice and it's up to you to do, or not do, bad things in the game.\nI do enjoy this game though it's harder for me to play it now then it was over 10 years ago. I tend to be the player who only wants to unlock stuff to explore and when I do I get bored with the missions.  I guess in reality, I never did finish the game. I unlocked the last island and did a number of quests but I spent most of my time driving around in cool sports cars and exploring the game world.\nThis was a defining game and because of that it should be checked out.
