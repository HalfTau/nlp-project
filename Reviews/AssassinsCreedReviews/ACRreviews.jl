He now must seek the aid of Subject 16 (who hacked and programed himself into the Animus before his death) to find a way to break out of his coma. However, in order to do so, he must relive Ezio's last mission.\nEzio Auditore da Firenze, now Mentor of the Italian Brotherhood, having removed the Borgia once and for all, now has become old and weary. The constant war between the Templars and Assassins has now taken its toll on him. Now he only seeks wisdom, wisdom that has been left behind by the Master Assassin, Altair Ibn-La'Ahad. Ezio now travels from Rome to Syria, leaving the Brotherhood under the guidance of his sister Claudia to search for the Great Library that is locked inside Masyaf Castle. However, upon arrival, Ezio finds Masyaf garrisoned by Templars and the library locked behind a strange door and learns that the keys have been taken and hidden in the city of Constantinople. There, Ezio arrives and finds himself welcomed with open arms from the Turkish Brotherhood. However, Ezio learns that the Templar presense in the city is strong and the Turkish Brotherhood is in need of a wise and experienced leader. Ezio must now race against the Templars for the Masyaf keys and aid his fellow Assassins in foiling whatever the Templars are plotting for the city. Ezio must now put aside retirement for a little longer and prepare to fight his last battle.\nI personally enjoy this title dearly, because it gives us closing terms for both Altair and Ezio. We have been with Ezio since birth and have been with him through victories and defeats. Now we go with Ezio as he embarks on his final mission. The gameplay is identical with Brotherhood, being limited within a single yet vast city. Constantinople is very colorful and bright if compared to Rome. Gameplay mechanics are still the same, but graphics have been improved. The economy system is still the same, like in Brotherhood, by renovating shops and landmarks to increase your income. You would also have to clear and secure Templar dens in order to free a district.\nWhile Revelations share very similar gameplay as in Brotherhood, it has also added some new and welcoming features. New gadgets like the hookblade to climb faster, and crafting a nice variety of bombs to kill or distract your enemies. Also, the Assassin Recruitment system has been improved, now you can assign Assassin Recruits to oversee districts of the city, unlocking mission in which you aid your recruit to hunt down a Templar agent (the missions are not repetative which are a great welcome). Also, the Templars have the ability to launch a counter-attack and reclaim a den that you have liberated to keep the fight for the city interesting. A new gamemode has been added which is Den Defense, basically, its like a Tower defence minigame in which you and your recruits must hold and stop the Templars from storming the den. Also, with the recruit missions (the ones which you send recruits to other cities to complete various tasks and generate income and experience), you can also liberate cities and send recruits and resources to reinforce and hold the city from the Templars. The more resources and recruits you put into a city, the more likely it will not fall back into Templar hands.\nDefinitely one that you should never pass. This is Ezio's final chapter and it must be experienced by all Assassin Creed fans. You will also learn what became of Altair, and share his final memories. The ending is a perfect and emotional send-off for two of the best Assassins from this entire franchise.", "hours": 29.1, "user_id": "76561198013190443", "username": "justdiscoveredfire", "products": 83, "early_access": false}

If you are familiar with previous games then there is very little challenge in trying to get around - if you see a white cloth, you know a climbing sequence will be ahead.  The fight system has been improved though, with new moves that make combat a little more unpredictable and some much stronger bad guys who can really do damage.\nThe looting function still exists but is now mostly redundent due to useless prizes.

These men are members of a secretive brotherhood of Assassins that fight for the free will of humanity in opposition to the Templar Order, who seek to steal it away.  In the distant past, you have the 12th century Assassin, Altair, and his quest to unite his brotherhood in the wake of their mentor's betrayal and defeat.  Following his story is the 15th century Assassin and mentor Ezio, who is using special artifacts to view important moments in Altair's life in an attempt to track down the keys to his long locked vault.  The artifacts themselves are memory recording devices left behind by a civilization so old that it is ancient to ancient history.  This civilization of those who came before perished after a sun burst cooked the planet, and now another sun burst is threatening to cook it again in the modern day.  The modern era brings us to Desmond, a modern day Assassin using a special machine to relive the memories of his ancestor Ezio.  Desmond has been using the machine too much, and his comatose mind has become scrambled with the DNA memories of Altair and Ezio.  So he must see Ezio's story through to its definitive conclusion in order to regain order and control of his own mind; lest he can't help his brotherhood avert the incoming natural disaster with the help of the techonology left by the earlier civilization.\nOn the whole, Desmond's story takes an absolute backseat.  Players will primarily control Ezio in his quest for the keys, and each key will unlock a small memory of Altair's in turn.  Altair's story is far too scattershot to have any emotion or satisfaction.  Meanwhile Ezio's is too devoid of any solid plot line outside of his quest for keys.  There's a background plot involving a fight with the Templars, politics in the Sultanate of Constantinople, and a girl he fancies, but characters leave as quickly as they show up, and those that do stick around are woefully underwritten.\nRevelations is a grab bag of multiple mechanics.  At its core, the game is an action and melee combat adventure with stealth mechanics and a robust climbing and free running movement system.  Ezio can buy a massive variety of armors, weapons, and other tools.  A large amount of attention is spent on bombs, their ingredients, and customization of crafting them.  However customization of bombs is less than impressive, using them can be awkward thanks to the controls, and more often than not other tools are better suited for any situation.  Combat is far, far too easy.  Counter-attacks are easy to trigger and can be strung together into an endless chain of instantly killing blows until every enemy lies bleeding at the player's feet.  Underneath the adventure game is a city renovation and small time army management game.  Ezio can recruit fighters to his cause and they can be used as assistants in the already too easy combat, or they can be shuttled off to other cities in an attempt to establish a foothold throughout the Mediterranean.  This latter gameplay is achieved entirely through too many menus and all comes down to simple ratio of success measurements based on their Assassin level.  Taking over cities and renovating them in turn will see Ezio receiving a kickback of cash and bomb ingredients.  Another optional gameplay mode sees players reliving Desmond's and his companion Clay's abstract memories in a sort of first person platform puzzler with somewhat janky jumping and miserably slow movement.  Also scattered throughout just about every mode in the game are hundreds of coin chests, bomb ingredients, system glitches, and other collectibles if player's have the stomach for that sort of thing.\nSet primarily in the city of Constantinople, Revelations doesn't really stand out.  Ezio certainly looks the part of a wizened man who is still more than capable of putting up a fight and he is quite detailed and well animated.  But Constantinople quickly blends into the same jumbled mesh of slum wood, rich metal, and middle class stone that swirls in the mind.  Its one defining feature is the river separating the primary southern city from the small district to the north.  While probably historically accurate, the river only serves as a means to waste more time whenever you need to cross it.  There's a real lack of detail on just about every character in Altair's story for some reason.  Large articles of clothing like a bag worn by Abbas have few enough polygons to be counted on two hands.  Overall the game gives off a rather middling impression, and I experienced a few crashes, constant frame rate stutters, bugged quests, and a camera so broken from the start that it required me to dig through the game's files and delete one just to fix.  The music, however, is absolutely stellar.", "hours": 37.6, "user_id": "76561198004162646", "username": "connordavisj", "products": 424, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

No matter what refresh rate I have the game set on, it seems to dip about 30-40 FPS every 30 seconds. (144 down to 90, 60 down to 30). I also tried turning off 4 of my 6 cores, which does help quite a bit, but was still a little iffy which left me unsatisfied. Probably should note I have heard of rolling back the drivers of your graphics card can help, but I'm way too lazy for that.\nSo I got a refund.\nBut if you're committed to fixing the performance issues, the game is 100% worth it in terms of gameplay, story telling and a fanstastic bow out to a character with an amazing story arc.", "hours": 2.0, "username": "Bolstaaa", "products": 51, "early_access": false}

We play the end of Ezio Auditore in the trilogy that gave us one of the most defined characters in gaming history. From playing him as a  baby, using buttons to make simple actions such as kicking or crying to the end of his days as the Mentor of the Brotherhood of Assassins.\nI can confidently say for the first time that I have been through it all with him. From riding Da Vinci\u2019s machines in Roma to throwing bombs in the streets of Constanopoli. From dancing and playing is Venezia\u2019s Carnavale to visiting the tomb of the greatest assassin to have ever lived in Masyaf. To watch and be the character as he grows from a boy who knows not what the world around him entails to a man of such great wisdom that even books or philosophy could only try to compare. To define such a fictional character so well, that I feel my heart-strings being tugged every time I think about putting down this game.  There is not much that I could put in words other than that of the Assassin\u2019s Creed itself.\nNothing is true, everything is permitted.\nNothing is true tells us how everything around us is so fragile anything could break or die and it must be kept alive with the ambition and the will of people. It defines how we must move forward as \u2018shepherds of our own future.\u2019\nEverything is permitted shows us that all that we do bares a reaction. It allows us to take responsibility for those actions whether they be good or bad and lets us live with them.\nThough a game, it is a lesson to all people, and it carries no lesser message that we should be who we want to be.\nWe see the message pass from Altair to Ezio, and through him to Desmond. About the great solar flare that wiped out the First Civilization. We see how Altair\u2019s bloodline continues on. Everything is closed up, just for a few things to be reopened in the next games to come. One chapter closes as another begins.\nThen gameplay and introduction of the hook-blade and the bombs, are a welcome sight. Ubisoft takes something that they have been working on since the first game and polish it even further. They make the free running and climbing much more fluid and even are able to work out that Ezio is old, there are some things I guess he can\u2019t do anymore either.\nFor its time, as with every game in the series, the graphics are uncanny and hold up well even now. With only minor errors that you barely notice, I got through this game with beautiful glances of the cityscape and the fun ways to run around the rooftops to avoid guards and the like.\nI had never really thought this game to be one of the better in the series until now.

The first bug happened when first starting the game. The screen is flickering rapidly and I cannot move properly. This is fixed by deleting systemdetection.dll from the game folder, which I found out via research. The second bug, happens in Sequence 7 Chapter 3 right when a fight starts out. The game crashed every time the fight started. I thought I was screwed because I couldn't access an older save and the game became unplayable. However, though more research, I fixed the bug by only allowing the game to use 1 CPU core during the fight, instead of all 8. This was done via Task Manager > Details Tab > right click on ACRSP.exe  > Set Affinity > Only check one CPU core. After completing the mission, you can change it back. It sucked becuase the game runs at about 4 fps with only 1 CPU core, which is a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 obviously.\nIt also sucks that I have to dig around on the web to fix these flipping bugs Ubisoft has not fixed. I found the solution to the latter bug on a fourm post from 5 years ago, Ubisoft. Seriously. ON YOUR OWN BLOODY UBI FORUMS. It's crap like this that reminds me why people give Ubisoft so much hate: poor QA and misleading advertising.\nFor this BS I will be changing my positive review to a negative one.\nNow back to my previous reviews:\nImproved graphics and sound design over the previous 3 AC games. That's about it. Very glitchy and buggy. There is some copy and pasted content here from AC2 and AC:B. Combat is the same. AI is still horrid. Good music, like the previous games. Altair missions aren't that great. Story is just meh. Worlds are fun to explore. Viewpoints are very, very limited and repeat the same structure way too many times. Decent amount of stuff to do. Bombs are fun.\nOverall a somewhat decent title that Ubisoft has put a lot of work into, but should have been fully QA'd and further fleshed out, but I'll still rate it with a thumbs up (CHANGED), mainly because I feel bad for rating AC and AC:B with thumbs down, after really enjoying those games on console. They just didn't do it for me on PC. I didn't enjoy them and their flaws seem much more stronger today than when I played them years ago.\nSo, In summary: The main improvements in Revelations are in visuals (excluding popins and lip sync) and sound. They havn't improved anywhere else. Combat needs an overhaul and so does AI. It does get better in newer AC games but tends to be the series' weakest links all the way through AC Origins. Game is extrememly easy too. Wish they would put in difficulty sliders.\nI get 90-120 fps with a laptop 1070. Game capped at 120 fps internally. Occasional frame drops. When playing certain special missions, the game does look like it exists then opens up a different Revelations file to play those missions. It's weird and hard to explain. It does look like the game crashes when this happens, though, but it actually doesn't. It even brought up a firewall warning on my PC.\nUplay: I do hate Uplay as much as the next guy, but it hasn't caused me any issues in this title. Uplay achievements do pop up but Uplay doesn't seem to affect performance or make the gameplay or experience worse. Yes, DRM sucks, but thankfully it's not a huge issue here.\nHavn't tried multiplayer.", "hours": 13.3, "username": "patzivota", "products": 96, "early_access": false}

This game will still satisfy those who are familiar with AC and enjoy the overall gameplay and storyline.\nBasic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.\nGameplay and controls 6/10:  Still the same from the last game, even though I had pretty much mastered the tricky mouse/keyboard by now, simply because it was rather difficult to aim bombs if you couldn't take your time to get it just right. It wasn't like you had a fast-fling option that allowed you to chuck it like a grenade. You had to actually lob it up in the air and figure out where its arc would make it land. This was great if you had the time to set up a shot like that, but otherwise, if you were in the heat of running or a battle, you had no chance to try and throw one unless it were something like a smoke bomb or blood bomb to distract people and get them off your tail. Another thing I didn't really appreciate was the fact that improvements made to the city (e.g. investing in shops or monuments) would raise Templar awareness of your activities. I accidentally raised it all the way once without realizing and had to quickly go and lower it again before one of the assassin dens was attacked. That actually discouraged me from investing in shops unless I needed to in order to gain gear. The Brotherhood system of recruiting assassins was still in place and was actually improved, in my opinion. That said, however, I found the side quests you could do for each of the den leaders to be a bit much. I only got partway through a couple of them before I realized that it was detracting from my experiencing the main storyline. Otherwise, the controls were the same, combat was effective and great, and you could pull off some great kill streaks. Best addition to this game? Ziplines!!! (And the hookblade, which made ziplining possible, of course. But still. ZIPLINES!!!) :D\nGraphics 7/10:  Okay, I'm not going to lie. The biggest thing that ruined the graphics for me was the changes they made to Ezio's face. He looks like a totally different person from the first two games in which we find him! I understand that sometimes they have to find different face models for a character because of payments or contracts or whatnot, but they really did a bad job finding someone who looks like Ezio would have looked at that age. At least in AC Brotherhood the minor changes they made were just that: minor. Ezio still looked like Ezio, just maybe a bit older and more mature. When I was watching the trailer for Revelations, I actually had to go back and check to make sure that I hadn't misread and that it was actually part of the Ezio storyline because I thought at first that I was going to be playing with an assassin that I hadn't experienced yet. (They also made major changes to Altair's looks, which they attempted to explain away by saying that a software update to the Animus resulted in a more accurate depiction of what Altair actually looked like in this game, but to me it was just jarring.) Besides that major disappointment, the graphics were still rather good otherwise. Probably on par with what I found in AC Brotherhood. It felt a little \"cookie cutter\" at times, especially when I would see completely different characters (e.g. Sofia Sartor and Yusuf Tazim) using exactly the same facial expressions, gestures, and overall body movements. That never seemed to happen in AC II, so both Brotherhood and Revelations were just a slight step down graphics-wise in that regard. The animation for the cities, on the other hand, was once again breathtakingly gorgeous.\nStoryline 6/10:  The storyline in this game was about as coherent as that of Brotherhood, but it actually ended up feeling less so because we kept having to play through bits and pieces of Altair's storyline from centuries before. That could have been done differently, in my opinion. Besides that, it just didn't draw me in as much as the previous storylines did, and there were several points, although shortly lived for the most part, during which I felt that the game was rather tedious and was prolonging itself unnecessarily (which is saying something, considering that to play through this game takes about half the time as that required to play through either AC II or Brotherhood).\nCharacters 9/10:  The characters were actually better than those in Brotherhood, and were closer to the quality of those found in AC II. They felt human and were enjoyable to interact with. Plus, there were enough of them besides just Ezio that it actually felt like Ezio had friends again, which was nice. (I mean, Machiavelli was okay in Brotherhood, but you never really wanted to go up and hug him, you know? And after she was rescued, Caterina Sforza just kind of disappeared. Even Da Vinci, much though I adore him, only gets cameos in Brotherhood.) Both Sofia Sartor and Yusuf Tazim are great characters (Yusuf is so great, that he's pretty much as good as Da Vinci was in the other games, in my opinion). Even Suleiman, though he's not a major character, leaves a great impression. Each of them had unique personalities and made the world feel more complete.\nOverall Rating 7/10:  This game is a pretty solid addition to the AC franchise and was fairly enjoyable to play. A few things could have been done better or differently, but they were not gamebreakingly bad.

By the time you finish the game, you can't help but think of what will happen next. The hookblade is definetly a welcome improvement to the rather lackluster climbing system that features in all three previous games, but the climbing system still feels like a little bit of a chore. The bomb crafting, while very unique and interesting, feels pretty useless when compared to the arsenal of tools at the old assassin's disposal. Do not play these games out of order, start from the beginning. Yeah, I'm talking about AC1. Even though AC1 is EXTREMELY mediocre compared to the rest of the series, play it for the story. Play AC2. Play Brotherhood. Then play this. I guarantee that if you really take your time with each and every game and really get all you can out of each while still going in order, the fluidity of the story and the experience feels absolutely amazing. Honestly, the next game couldn't've asked for a better base. Revelations and all of it's predecessors will still hold a very, VERY special place in my heart, now and for many years to come.

{"product_id": "201870", "page": 16, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-08-22", "text": "Assassin's Creed Revelations is the fourth entry into the open world, parkour-laden RPG series, although it is the third and final entry into the trilogy that follows the suave Italian known as Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Released in the same year as its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, this title features a few new gameplay elements and various tantalizing side-missions that extend the storyline of the franchise's original assassin, Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad. If you are planning on playing the trilogy, it is highly recommended to do so in order, beginning with Assassin's Creed II.\nSaying that Brotherhood left audiences on a cliffhanger of an ending is a major understatement; while things wrapped up in Ezio's world with the villainous Cesare Borgia being thrown to his death from some battlements, the modern day events took a turn for the worst. Desmond Miles, in posession of the infamous Apple of Eden, was forced by the artifact to impale his fellow current-era assassin Lucy with his hidden blade. Afterwards, Desmond collapsed and fell into a coma-like state, which is where Revelations picks up... at least in the 2012 world. In Ezio's world, he is now an old man of 52 years of age, and he finds himself in Constantinople, present day Istanbul, in 1511 AD.\nThe most drastic change in Revelations are the more cinematic inspired action sequences that start right from the beginning of the game and last all the way until the end. Although many of these areas feel linear, it's a welcomed change of pace that offers a dynamic feeling to the title. The switch up of locations from Europe (Italy) to Asia (Istanbul) is a drastic one, but also a breath of fresh air in a trilogy that came very close to wearing out its welcome. The scenery is alive with bright, vibrant colors, interesting culture, and relatively tight streets. Of course the latter also means that there are no horses allowed in the city, unlike Roma from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. However, there are numerous fast travel points that are unlockedf rom the start of the game, making it easy to travel the large landscape quickly.\nIn comparison to the two other entries of the Ezio saga, Revelations suffers from a severe lack of things to do. Its forebearer offered up a large sum of side quests and unlockables, but the best that is given here are four temples to explore; each that house a Masyef key, and when found they unlock another part of Alta\u00efr's story. To be completely truthful, the Alta\u00efr storyline is far more impressive and interesting than Ezio's in this release, which is unfortunate. That's not to say that the title is lacking solid protagonists, as Ezio does meet a couple of intriguing individuals, but they still pale in comparison to everything that has come before. The antagonists in particular are total write-offs that will not be remembered after the game is completed.\nThat being said, there are a couple of new mechanics that are introduced within this entry; the hookblade and bomb crafting. The former allows Ezio to utilize ziplines, as well as extend his reach while climbing and jumping, and the latter adds the element of crafting which was previously unknown to the Assassin's Creed series. However, in my personal experience I found myself rarely using any bombs, or experimenting with the crafting at all. I typically stuck to the tried-and-true smoke bombs, while every now and then using a noise distraction such as a cherry bomb to lure my enemies away when no courtesans were available. It feels shallow and tacked on at best, and annoyingly enough the landscape is littered with respawning boxes of crafting materials.\nMoney is also much harder to come by, despite rebuilding Istanbul early on in the game. The progression here works similarly to that of Brotherhood; one must relieve certain areas of Templar influence, and then repair broken down shops with money. The more shops that are rebuilt, the higher the every-20-minute income is. However, the in-game timer seems to be broken as rather than getting income every 20 minutes, I would sometimes play for an hour before an amount was deposited into the bank. In general, I relied on my mini-assassins to complete missions and bring me back coinage more than anything; another gameplay element that is brought over from Brotherhood, by the way.\nWhen it comes right down to it, Assassin's Creed Revelations is a bit of a let down. The entire Ezio portion of the game feels unnecessary, while the modern-day Desmond story arc is very much needed. It seems as though the latter portion would've faired better as a DLC. As stated previously, the Alta\u00efr memories are far more enjoyable and memorable than any portion of the Ezio story, which is truly a shame; though it must be noted that the end of the game is very conclusive and well done. At the end of it all, Ezio feels tired and stretched very thin, and players will be happy to move on to newer and better things. Revelations is entirely skippable, but to get the full effect of the series it's not recommended to do so. If you have a console, it's highly recommended to grab The Ezio Trilogy, since the textures, character models, and even colors are redone, bringing these games back to brilliant life.\nThe Horror Network\n|\nClick for Gore", "hours": 16.9, "username": "The Horror Network", "products": 2621, "early_access": false}

For me it was mostly fun. There was a very small amount of frustrating missions, but the overall gameplay fun was as known from the previous parts, only slightly improved here and there.\nThe map and the locations are wonderfully detailed and very enjoyable as usual, but the buildings to climb in freeroam are not as fun and versatile as known from AC 2 and Brotherhood. There are parcour levels like in the prequels, but not as many and they are rather linear (not bad, but not as big and challenging as in the prequels). As usual, there is much to do in freeroam like refurbishing shops, before they can be used, buying points of interest, capturing areas, training assassins and more. The story and the characters are well designed and left good memories behind.\nIt's not so much about the present storyline unfortunately, mostly about Ezio's time in Constantinople and you also get to play Altair in Masyaf a few times. It is not necessary that you have played AC 1, but if you did or at least know the story it's more fun, because you can relate and connect the stories to each other. DO PLAY AC 2 AND Brotherhood before, though. They are both bigger and have things I missed in Revelations (like these puzzle minigames, more secrets, present story, gorgeous parcour levels, ...). If you don't like them, don't try Revelations.\nThere are also some very abstract puzzle-platform levels for Desmond and, if you own the Lost Archive DLC, for Subject 16 (these levels are completely optional and do not integrate into Ezio's gameplay). They are quite challenging at some points and tell you about Desmond's live before AC 1 and about Subject 16's live. These are recommendable if you like experimental or indie puzzle platformers or if you are interested in the story.

Sure they added bombs that you can throw but the millions of \"treasure chests\" carelessly placed through the map are mainly just bomb ingredients now and are thus no longer as fun to search and explore for.\nThe addition of the hook was more gimmicky than anything else. It can marginally speed certain things up like climbing but it slows me down more often than not and can also get you into trouble since you can no longer sprint and bump into guards (you use the hook to go over them which triggers an alert amongst all guards in the vicinity)\nThe posters are gone now and simply paying to refurbish buildings (armorer, tailor etc) creates notoriety which makes it significantly more frustrating and time consuming to \"buy everything\" if you are the collector type that has to complete everything to 100%. In other words, when building up notoriety it is painstakingly more challenging to bring it back down again. To make matters worse, when you get the notoriety to a high enough level the Templars attack one of your \"dens\" which leads to this absolutely awful mini-game where you motionlessly stand on a rooftop and direct a battle in the streets.\nThe combat is still as fun as Brotherhood however the addition of occasional slow-mo kills slows things down. The one improvement though is that you can choose what your sidearm is so you can use the smaller daggers with a pistol.\nEven the story seemed less interesting and the maps slightly smaller.

Start with 4 if you dislike Desmond Miles, running through cities, and enjoy the pirate life.\nMy major issue with this game is that it was just a rebranded version of the 2 before it. 40+ hours between the Ezio games and you either don't know enough about the characters to engage with them or the few things you do discover feel like bad exposition or a plot device. Remember in 2 when Ezio's family was executed? You'll actually be hoping for more of those moments.\nThis game was worth the price on sale and the time spent on it. I did not go for 100% completion because there are other games to play and dragons to slay. I would not say it holds up as stand alone title as you really do need to be aware of where the story is at in the continuity of titles.\nI do have to say though, it was nice to have closure for the Altair character even though I feel like some more information about his lineage would have been gratifying. It's almost like they left out just enough of Altair's life to make a decent movie with but then the film studio said, \"naaaah, let's get Magneto on a twirling arm thing\".

Kind of old game but a good assassin-ish game.\nLong review:\nI do not have the new assassinss creed gamess but i can compare 1,2 and brotherhood.\nFirst game is altair story and a good game stroywise but below average game overall. I have read the book before playing the game and the book was more exciting :D\nSecond game is ezio auditore story and a good game storywise but below average game overall. I have read the book before playing the game and the book was more exciting :D\nBrotherhood is the next chapter of ezio auditore story and a good game storywise but below average game overall. I have read the book before playing the game and the book was more exciting :D\nI don't think i will ever play 3rd game.\nAfter the Black Flag, the assassinss creed gamess got a whole new perspective. So i do not think i can comapare those with these first 4 games.\nSo what i mean is, first 3 games can be enjoyable and they have considerable work and effort, congratulations, but this game is better.\nRevelations is the next next chapter of ezio auditore story. This time i am playing the game before the book. Revelations is an action and strategy filled game and strikes a good balance between them. I haven't finished the game yet and i have the impression that no matter how the game ends, i will not need to change this review.\nThis game starts with some sort of glitch with animus. So there is not much technological things to consider or to be bored with. First game have too much desmond factor in them. You will start as an asassin and play most of the time as an assassin. The story give you glimpes of earlier games and stories. If you are a story freak, you wil have to play the first 3 games to fully understand this one but i would suggest you to just read the books. When you understand the story and get used to game dynamics you will quickly feel like a master assassin.\nThe game has strategic elements and the missions can be completed by using different methods. For example, you can throw a cherry bomb to attract people or guards to a point and scneak past them. There are diversion, elimination and one more kind of bomb that i forgot. There is a poison dart thing for silent take-downs. You will be able to hire assassinss to help you on missions or distract enemies. You can hire romny people to belnd in at some point. And probably there are more strategic opportunities that i do not yet now or tried. There are doctor dudes around the city and they can heal you anc sell you healing things. You do not have to be so strategic to finish the game. It is diversity that will appeal you most.\nMore strategicly, there is a bank to store your money or something like that, there are crafting places, there are items to collect and upgrade you armory and weaponary and you can recruit assassinss out of regular people. I have probably finished %40 of the game and never felt any of these are necessary. But again, these can make your game very colorful.\nThe game is mostly taking play in \u0130stanbul. I do not know if it will stay there for the whole game. \u0130stanbul is as good as florance in the earlier games and a fresh idea for this kind of historical game. Nice job ubisoft. A note, Tomb Raider is better parkouring.\nSome similarities with first 3 games:\n- There is a decent story.\n- There is no fast travel. (Or maybe i did not discover it yet)\n- There are errand jobs. I mean not assassin-ish jobs.\n- The map is faily big and impressive. There are enough room to wonder around.\n- You are accepting jobs everytime. This is totaly unnecessary :D\n- There are historical people, like Leo da vinci in 2 and Piri Reis in this one.\nWhat is different than first 3 games: (Pros)\n- Gameplay, free run, fighting dynamics and visuals are better. Though, when you are fighting, the soldiers around you are just wating their turns to be finished off by you :)\n- Characters have more humanity.\n- The game is more action based than puzzle based.\n- There are strategic elements like crafting explosives.\n- Not everybody hates you. You can walk around the streets without always being on the lookout.\n- First 3 games had errand jobs more than neccessary. This time quests feel important and they come up with fresh ideas.\n- This game lets you play as altair and replay his memories. Aww, good old days.\nCons:\n- Parkouring is cool and easy but it should have been better after 4 years or parkouring games.\n- The characters have thick accents. I know this is authenticity and is a good thing but they sound like they are foring it too much. The professional killers sound amateur-ish.\n- Why do i never hear call to prayers in a muslim city? :)\nAs i said in the beginning, a complete assassinss creed game. Read the books of first three and play this one.", "hours": 11.4, "user_id": "76561198085792193", "username": "numan4634", "products": 227, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

He\u2019s fallen into a coma following the events of Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood; I imagine being mentally manipulated by a super-powerful alien, one of a race who claims to have created the human race, could do that. In any case, Desmond\u2019s Assassin friends Shaun, Rebecca and newcomer Bill work hard to save the core of Desmond\u2019s being, and place it into a safe mode within the Animus. While he\u2019s on the idyllic yet lonely Animus Island, he must reconstruct the memories of his past as well as relive more of that of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore.\nIn order to seize a decisive advantage over the Assassins, the evil, scheming Templars seek to gain access to the Grand Temple located beneath the former Assassin\u2019s Fortress at Masyaf. They have one of the five keys required; Ezio must travel to Constantinople, the Crossroads of the World in the early 16th century, and enlist the aid of local assassins to find the other four.\nOnce there, the excitable local Assassin Order head, Yusuf Tazim, shows him around a small part of the gigantic city, as well as grants him a useful new implement: the Ottoman hookblade, which enables him to cross large segments of the city via ziplines as well as to extend his reach in parkour or combat situations.\nAs with II and Brotherhood, Ezio has the opportunity to buy all sorts of property and reap a percentage of profits. From the quaint shops found throughout Constantinople, Ezio can buy books and artwork to improve the value of Assassins\u2019 Dens, or more importantly improved weapons and armor to help his chances in battle.\nWhen the Templars choose to assault one of the Assassins\u2019 Dens that you can occupy, a Tower Defense game starts! You\u2019re responsible for placing various types of troops on the surrounding rooftops, barricades in the streets and other hindrances to prevent the enemy from re-taking the Den. This is not an unwelcome addition to gameplay, but is a little hard to get used to no matter how much you play it.\nWhen you\u2019ve found certain amounts of Animus Data Fragments (little collectibles) throughout Ezio\u2019s journey, Desmond, back on the Island, can take on first-person puzzle challenges to help unlock his fragmented memories. These consist of placing platforms or inclines to get through various challenging puzzle rooms within the \u201cBlack Room,\u201d a deeper safe mode which requires manual decryption through the aforementioned puzzle solving.\nAlso, when you find each key, you will flash back to a playable vignette with the Master Assassin, Altair himself, who has locked untold secrets within the Grand Temple, but, having suffered repeated assaults on his Fortress, has chosen to hide the keys within Constantinople.\nMultiplayer returns with modes both old and new, with an actually interesting story that details the history of Abstergo, the modern incarnation of the Templars, and their efforts to bring down the Assassins and seize control of the world.\nA few technical issues aside, this is definitely one amazing game and I\u2019d highly recommend it to those who, like with the rest of the series, don\u2019t mind a little bloody action in with their historical fiction.

I've still yet to see a better trailer for a video game and while I don't think it's fair to judge a game on impressions made by a trailer, I just can't watch the opening cutscene of the game and not feel like something is missing. The feeling of disappointment wears off pretty quick though because any fan of the series will feel right at home playing as Ezio fighting templars in good old Masyaf.\n\nThe assassin training system is interesting in this one because when your apprentice becomes an assassin there isn't a ceremony cutscene to mark the occasion but rather you take them out on a mission and you teach them lessons accordingly. I think this is a nice variation to the apprentice feature. If your student fails then you teach him and he applies those lessons to the next mission you do together. This is a great addition to an already good system introduced in Brotherhood and I think it's one of Revelations' greatest assets. I also really liked the challenge dungeons on this one where you find the masyaf keys. Some of them were really spectacular and the chase and climbing camera isn't too disruptive with their forced camera angles this time like in Brotherhood.\n\nThe new Hookblade is alright as far as gameplay gimmicks go, making the parkour flow a bit faster and navigate the occasional zipline but overall it's a bit underwhelming and merely an extension of the high jump you learned in the second game. I did like however that it lets you grab on to ledges after a long fall, saving you from death.\n\nThe addition of bombs were a fun but superfluous mechanic in my opinion. It's merely another rarely used gimmick that doesn't add much to the core gameplay. It's there if you want to use it and you don't have to use it if you don't want to. I don't feel like it beats the classical sneaking and stabbing style of gameplay cemented in the game's predecessors. I don't know, since I wasn't involved in developing the game, but it feels like a mechanic that was added purely because a focus tester asked if they should add bomb crafting to the game. So they did and not many people ended up using them, which is probably why it hasn't returned in later installments. Also, every input feels like it takes half a second or more to register and this is a problem that plagued the series through many of its early installments. And when the core combat and gameplay mechanics are this unresponsive it doesn't make you want to use advanced tactics such as bombs and upgraded equipment because it's not fun to plan out an attack and then get spotted because you're unable to maneuver properly. This could have been helped by the simple addition of a crouch button and faster combat animations which I'm glad they implemented in the later games.\n\nLike Brotherhood the game lacks polish in many areas and it's not without its glitches. One particularly amusing one I had made an NPC walk in circles for 30 seconds straight like a dog directly in front of the NPC he was supposed to talk to in an unskippable cutscene, forcing you to just stand there frozen waiting for the AI to catch up. In a different example I'm fighting enemies with an ally and the game thinks the enemies are all dead so it starts a cutscene but one is still alive and kills me during the cutscene without me being able to fight back. It also still has the same problem Brotherhood had when the assassination blades hit the air around a target's head instead of the head itself.\n\nOne of the minigames this time, because almost every Assassins Creed should have at least one or more minigames for some reason, is a real time strategy game. I don't understand why this is here. Personally I didn't find it very interesting or fun and the worst thing about it is that you only have to play it once and not having to play it is considered a reward. It only comes up again if you gain enough notoriety, which never happens if you're diligent, which you will be because high notoriety means you can't navigate the streets in peace.\n\nThe Desmond's Journey missions were great and it was good to finally get some proper backstory on our main protagonist. The infamous minstrel mission warrants a special mention as well. I found it very amusing, the songs are funny and have many references to previous games and characters and at least it was different. The missions in Revelations are more varied, unlike Brotherhood where almost every mission is a tailing mission with nothing happening. Revelations did many things that didn't pan out but at least it tried to be different and it's a better game than Brotherhood for that.\n\nThis game concludes Alta\u00efr and Ezio's stories and they reach a satisfying conclusion worthy of the characters and their legacy. I've always thought that Assassins Creed can tell a good story when it tries, even if the present day storyline is glacial. It's the themes of the series that grab me. Freedom and order, how to reconcile the two and the corruption of power. These are questions that have puzzled civilization since its infancy and even today we are searching for answers. This theme and its exploration is the foundation of my love for these games and why I keep coming back to them.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed \"Nothing is true, everything is permitted\" is explained to mean that it's an observation of the nature of reality. To say that nothing is true is to realize that the foundations of society are fragile and that we must be the shepherds of our own civilization. To say that everything is permitted is to understand that we are the architects of our actions and that we must live with their consequences whether glorious or tragic.\n\nRequiescat in pace.", "hours": 33.8, "username": "Danny Rodriguez", "products": 190, "early_access": false}

It's my third AC instalment and after having completed AC II and brotherhood, the feeling I get from revelations until now is a familiar and nice one. The combat is more difficult which makes more sense really, but very... fragmented too. The aim system doesn't work properly and the AI is having a little bit of difficulty in understanding that I obviously want to shoot the guard and not the fellow assassin standing next to me.Combat doesn't have the superb flow evident in brotherhood. Same goes with the parkour system, although I have noticed that the AI is a bit more... intelligent here and doesn't make me climb on any bit of stone  I come across. I haven't advanced much in the story yet, the game kind of compells you to buy the whole city before getting on the real business in hand. Oh, the thing with your \"notorieaty\" augmenting every time you buy a building? Annoying. And just absurd and time consuming. The Den Defense seems a bit out of place in this kind of game. The big breakthrough of the game is obviously the bombs, but to be frank... I never really liked using them. And although it is a fitting utility, ubisoft did it a bit too much. Last but not least, I regret the absence of a selected saving point during missions. Especially in the big dungeons when you try to get 100% synch... you fail and you have to do it all AGAIN. Silly really. All that said, and STILL it's an incredible AC game. Constandinoupoli is great, and take it from a Greek, many NPCs are talking greek.

Not quite a revenge or liberation tale as the last 2 games, but a search for knowledge, left by Altair in a library built near the end of his extensive life. What will wait you inside? That's for you to find out.\nNot only will you get to experience Ezio's last chapter, but also control Altair for a second time during key moments of his life, from a young and humble apprentice to an old and wise Mentor. While I consider it to be the weakest of the trilogy, it's not without its merits. The introduction and conclusion are among the best in the series and the characters are still interesting.\nBombs are probably the biggest addition, and I'll just say they can be useful at times, because I usually don't bother tinkering with them. Constantinople, although beautiful from afar, didn't feel as varied or memorable as Rome, which is ironic, since it was so aptly named as the \"Crossroads of the World\" due to its cultural and religious diversity. I don't see the point in bringing back Brotherhood's system of \"city-restoration\", since the Ottomans have been there for some 60 years now. The fact that the fast-travel points are unlocked from the beginning doesn't leave much room for exploration, and I'm generally against fast-travel right off the bat, since it doesn't feel earned.\nDespite these last few negative points, there is much enjoyment to be found here, especially if you liked Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood (which you should finish before going into Revelations).", "hours": 29.0, "username": "Ez win", "products": 49, "early_access": false}

This game has a lot of great moments, some of the best in the whole franchise. These very well done character moments with both Ezio and Altair as well as great action set pieces such as the first hour of the game or the tombs of the Masyaf keys make this game very memorable.  A lot of the story missions and side plots feel like filler and it is not very interesting which brings this game back a lot as well as the additions that the series didn\u2019t need like the tower defense and bomb crafting. Even though Constantinople is a great setting for this game it\u2019s not as interesting or memorable as the previous games settings. These problems stop this game from being amazing but I still consider it to be a great game and it closes off the Ezio trilogy perfectly.\n8/10 (Great)", "hours": 16.4, "username": "David0vi\u0107", "products": 307, "early_access": false}

This is because playing a big open world game like this feels like a rather big undertaking for me. Not that the games are bad, just that they demand alot of time and I rather not get into it unless I feel I have that time without feeling stressed about it. Once I started up again I played it almost every day until I finished though.\nI'm gonna review this in the aspect of it being the last part of the Ezio Trilogy. I was delighted to spend more time with Ezio Auditore, and get to some sort of conclusion with him and Desmond.\nCompaired to the other two, I have to say this is my least favourite though. The settings are not as varied or beautiful as in AC II, nor are the missions. Constantinople is the only city you see (and a rather bland one at that) apart from a dreary underground cave town, and a bit of the boring Masyaf by the end of the game. I miss the horse riding from previous installments (though I seem to be in the minority there), colors, the warmth of characters like Leonardo Da Vinci, & more humour. There are no set pieces that stand out like before, apart from SPOILER! running along burning ships in the harbour. SPOILER END!\nI don't mind playing an older Ezio, that suits the story progression fine, and he is a wonderful man when he is more wheathered & experienced. But I did not feel as emotionally involved as I did in II or even Brotherhood. The supporting voice cast are also less stellar than in past efforts, with exception of John De Lancie.\nIn II, we got to experience Ezio grow from a young scoundrel to a avenger of his family, and to a defender of the people and freedom in general. The story moved at a steady pace, and I shed a tear over the tragedies in his life, as well as stood in awe over the beauty of the scenery at times, accompanied by the exquisite music by Jesper Kyd. It was close to a perfect game in my opinion.\nSo it was a tough act to follow, naturally. Brotherhood did well though, almost as well.\nAll 3 are well worth your time and effort, but as they progressed they became less effective in their storytelling, and bugs and glitches increased as Ubisoft released them with what felt like increasing haste. Sure, one should ride on popularity and try and respond to fans and consumers thirst for more, but not at the expense of quality control.\nI suspect also that the writers didn't know how to end Desmonds, Ezios or Altairs stories, and just made it up as they went along, which is an oportunity lost. For me the ending of the trilogy left me wanting, but not for more or for clearer answers, but rather to replay AC II, to remember the series when it was at it's best.", "hours": 40.2, "user_id": "76561198028711579", "username": "E.M.J. \u32db", "products": 290, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

If Ubi wanted to make a cool game with Ottomans and Saracens, by all means they should've, but with Ezio? This game is undeserving of Ezio.

Rather than build a compelling environment like Brotherood did, this game just took pictures of a city and made the map bigger, bigger, bigger. Somewhere in this game was an interesting story, but the narrative focused solely on the characters, and did not uniquely tie into Istanbul. Brotherhood's story tied character motivations with facets of the city, making you want to explore Rome. In Revelations, the city is just a backdrop for a well traveled plot.\nIstanbul feels like a larger version of the AC1 cities in that it has no distinct personality. But I love the cities in AC1. Why? AC1 was new, the climbing was new, so in that game, the cities felt huge. Plus, armed with only your blade, the cities felt like they enabled you to assassinate your target. Add onto this a connecting wilderness and the world felt complete. In this game, you have a thousand tools to get your target, and a billion things to bumble into, and huge travel times to complete needless tasks; the city just feels like an impediment.\nThe ending of this game, where you are hang-gliding around and repeatedly defeating a boss---who finally gets offed in a cut-scene where he gets pushed off a cliff by someone else---is just bad. I mean, nothing about the boss warrants a multi-stage fight. It's just poor design.\nAll of the new moves in this game feature herky-jerky animations. The technique to scale things rapidly also makes no sense from a gravity/momentum/physics perspective. I wouldn't normally complain about this, but the terrible animation compels me.\nThe game has two great cutscenes: one at the begining of the game, which sets a great tone, and one at the end of the game, which is incredibly satisfying, providing a resolution better than any other in the series. They are really well done. They stand up irrespective of this game. I watched them well before playing Revelations; I watched them when I played Revelations; and I've watched them since playing Revelations, and I wonder why they are tethered to Revelations.\nIf only the rest of the game could have been so compelling.

These episodes are short, and all we have collected from five pieces, but memories of the protagonist of Assassin's Creed for the number one, perhaps, the best moments of Revelations. And reveals a character in less than two hours better than the entire length of the first part.\nBut the central face of the story, of course, is old audience. Before us is a life already wise, experienced a lot of hardship and bitter lessons, a man of fifty-two years. But age - not a hindrance still playfully jumping on the roofs. Is that the place of Venice and Rome came to Constantinople (now - Istanbul), divided into two large water area. Swim from one to the other will not work, so I have to use a system of fast sewer tunnels (the good, this time some of them are open from the beginning), or hire a boatman, a taxi driver.\nBut before you go to conquer the cultural capital, Ezio will visit the fortress of Masyaf. There must be a hidden secret library of the Assassins, which houses a terrible secret. And we should in that that was the first to find five keys to the door and it does not give the Templars get their dirty paws on the ancestral knowledge. The adventure will be exciting, especially failed entry and smart, a strong finale. The only pity is that in the middle there is a noticeable sagging.\nStar, but removed\nTo carry out this very good mission will have the old ways. As before, we have to be worn on the roofs of the beautiful city, hidden in the crowd, and expertly clean goal. Tasks are varied and a good imagination. For example, one would have to change a traveling musicians performing in front of all of society and color eye-catching, while your minions-assassins quietly sent to the bottom of the well of another Templar. And such original instructions are not enough. Generally, Revelations, unlike its predecessors, most focused on the story. Create your guild kills, pumping recruits and buying buildings unobtrusively offered as a short rest in between missions. No side orders and the competition is not provided. The only thing to do in town, so it is rare to weigh cuffs bullies, but to catch the thieves. And the modest size of Constantinople the same Rome.\nAt first glance, to distinguish the \"revelation\" of the sequel or Brotherhood is difficult. Mechanics, control and brotherhood economic part have not undergone any changes. But, of course, the developers could not leave his project completely without innovation, but they seem to be strained at times and sucked from the finger. For example, now our excesses in the streets much more serious consequences. If the anger of the Templars or the custody of the Ottoman Empire, and take away time from the suspicion, you have to reflect their attack on your base captured. Completed this part of the game as a simple little variation on the theme of tower defense. On a narrow street on the headquarters of the guild systems brave marching troops of the enemy, and we set on the roofs along the road of various fighters and build barricades on the road. FUN, this is simple and at first even like, but get tired very quickly. Therefore we recommend to you as soon as possible to get a masters Assassins (students pumped up to level 15) and instruct them to defense.\nAnother innovation is the bomb - a new weapon in our arsenal. On the one hand they are useful: they can be used to distract enemies, destroy them or to demoralize and disorient. Recipes - Sea. Experimenting with various integral components, which are abundant in the trunk or on the corpses, we can get explosive movement with very different characteristics. But here's the situation when they really need, are extremely rare. Of course, you can actively use them, but it is almost always much easier to operate the old fashioned way.\nBut the most small, but among the most useful upgrade uniforms became a hook knife.

The story progresses more, though.\nNot as much to say about Revelations. After Desmond stabs Lucy after retrieving the Apple in the Colliseum, Desmond goes into shock and his brain activity is highly unstable. He gets hooked into an Animus and is told by Subject 16, who is just a memory echo in the Animus itself, that he needs to complete Ezio's story to leave the Animus and continue the journey. You then find Ezio in Constantinople (or as it was recently christened: Istanbul) and he's trying to find the Masayaf keys that were left behind by Niccolo Polo to open a vault of supreme knowledge. Upon entering Istanbul, Ezio finds himself confronting a conflict between Byzantine insurrectionists and the new Ottoman occupiers of the city. Ezio has to find the keys and discover the last bit of knowledge, not just for his own sake, but for Desmond's as well.\nWhile I love Istanbul and its many landmarks (my favorite being the Hagia Sophia), the city felt like it was compressed down to AC2 size (think Venice or Firenze). Since it was the only place you could go (except for one sequence which took place in a small area inside of a cave that you can't go back to) the world just felt small. Istanbul was a shining city of the time as well as being one of the largest cities in the former Roman Empire, so it just felt disappointing to only be moving about a tiny area when you were so used to Rome's open areas and openness. The game was also fairly short compared to AC2 and Brotherhood. I think there were a total of 8 or 9 sequences with only a few missions each. Most of the gameplay was repeated, except they added in bomb crafting (which I didn't use all too much) as well as a Tower-Defense-style minigame for the previous-Borgia towers. Once you conquered a tower, if your notoriety stayed too high for too long, the Templars would try to take it back. You would then have to play the tower defense mini-game to hold it. However, it takes a long time and notoriety can be reduced fairly quickly (and the game decided to try to force the TD mini game by making notoriety reduction harder through only being able to bribe heralds and kill witnesses). After the initial mission that had it, I never did the tower defense game again. I never needed to, so it was pretty useless. There was also no special armor you could get and those puzzles were reserved for when you got the Masayaf keys (you only had to get 4 of them...). All of the mechanics felt really recycled and the new additions didn't seem to really give this game that extra kick that the series really needed. Taking the cities in the Assassin mini-game was new, but then it just became a management sim and if you neglected it for too long, the game forced the city to revert back to Templar control. So it was just forcing you to do the Assassin contract missions for the sake of doing it, rather than achieving any real goal. A lot of the game's new mechanics felt that way. They had you do them just to have you do them, rather than make it an integral part of the story.\nThe story was the saving grace of this game, though. It really advances the Templar vs. Assassin story and it even crosses paths with Altair's story from the past in little sequences left behind in the Masayaf keys. In the end, the game shines a light on why trying to find the artifacts are of vital importance to the world, and it makes the race for the vaults feel more urgent than just a \"we don't want the Templars to have them\" motivation. Ezio truly becomes his own character as a grizzled veteran of the struggle and his temperment is perfect for this game. They even gave him a love interest that worked, and although she was more of a side dish than the main course, it added to the story instead of distracting from it.\nIn the end, I have to give Revelations a slight \"Yes\" recommendation. It's still fun, but I found myself wanting to take more breaks and do something new rather than play through to the end. Thankfully, the end comes fairly quickly so you can push through and move on to the next chapter in the AC series.", "hours": 58.8, "user_id": "76561197993919345", "username": "Hobo McChicken\u00a9\u00ae\u2122", "products": 624, "early_access": false}

But I found myself lost in the plot (in a not-great way).\n---\nI must a cardinal sin - I never played the first Assassin's Creed. Because of this, I felt as if the Altair storyline felt shoehorned  and out of place. I found that they tied up Ezio's storyline quite well, but it would have been even nicer if they should have somehow made a transition into their third installment into the franchise. Desmond's line was also too short and not memorable. Characters were also nothing of the ordinary, but it was neat to see a grizzled Ezio well into his 50s-60s leaping towers like a Parkour Youtuber.\nWithout stepping on spoiler territory, the storylines and objectives were a bit muddled. However, I found myself forgetting less about my objectives and more into the rich map design. It's showcased in its entirety by lengthy and enjoyable missions. One quip from a design standpoint - both stealth and assault are favoured, though there are missions that are stealth only. For the most part, the designers respected these divergent playstyles.\nThe most common criticism in the game would be its wonky minigames (tower defence missions were painfully slow and poorly choreographed). I'm inclined to agree.\nThough the campaign alone is worth the price of admission, stealth-loving players that favour the covert stylings of Splinter Cell multiplayer games will sink some hours into it (despite a poor userbase because of age).", "hours": 18.6, "username": "PunaniTsunami", "products": 449, "early_access": false}

It's the final game of the Ezio trilogy and it provides the essential closure that every gamer craves and needs to basically needs to not die emotionally. If you are a highly commited fan, and have played the previous games before this game, this game is a must have for every single fan. You can get away with not having a game like Assassin Creed Liberations, but if you do not have Assassin Creed revelations it is like reading a book and not reading the conclusion, the ending.

Assassin's Creed III also has this problem.\nBut besides that, this was a really good game. Great story, great gameplay, ran smoother than the previous Assassin's Creeds and the controls listened to me more, mostly.

{"product_id": "201870", "page": 59, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-03-16", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Revelations has the best story of the three games, thankfully taken as a trilogy it it is a fulfilling one. We see Ezio the man mess up more, he is older, wiser, and a little slower. He remains a great character. Altair is another character that is reintroduced to fill in the gaps of what happened after the events of AC 1. This time he is voiced correctly and for the most part the story told in his timeline is good. However, his timeline also has the weakest gameplay. Now as much as Revelations feels like the end of an era, it also feels like a stop gap. Desmond himself as a character does not move in his respective arc in any meaningful direction. This is supposed to be helped by the inclusion of the FPS section of the game, but unfortunately they are terrible, more on that later. If you are looking for a fitting end to Altair and Ezio\u2019s stories, then this is the game for you. Unfortunately, this games offers little when it comes to other more important things.\nGameplay in AC: Revelations suffers greatly. It has the same controls as all the other games, but all your side excursions are ripped wholesale from Brotherhood, with less success. Everything you came to love in Brotherhood is expanded on, but turns into a tedious, tremendous waste of time. This is probably Assassin\u2019s Creed at it\u2019s most Call of Duty like, at least until I play Rogue, which I hear is pretty much the same game as AC4. After a while I just played through the sequences and did little else once I got all my recruits to Assassin level. Lastly the side objectives in Revelations are the worst. Most are poorly worded, and usually become irritating. This will probably be the only AC game where I didn\u2019t bother to get 100 % synchronization in the story missions, simply because I could not be bothered with the system. Oh and one more thing, Desmond now has a FPS puzzler. These puzzles are terrible, poorly thought out, and not challenging in the slightest. It\u2019s the worst addition of the series and is a waste of time. After you finish these puzzles, Desmond decides that he will be an Assassin...again? This side story is incredibly stupid and repetitive and does nothing, but mess with the main game's pace. Didn\u2019t Desmond already decide that he was going to be an assassin? Why do I need to take him through these sequences so he can finally be one with his destiny? It is an incredibly insipid waste of time for a character who can\u2019t seem to give himself a break and by the end has moved through his character arc only a bit. At this point I can see why people were fed up with the Desmond storyline, but I feel the fault has to be with the writers, who probably had been writing him out of the series ever since Brotherhood.\nThe environment of AC: Revelations is I believe the strongest. The city is beautiful, colorful, and diverse in a way the other Assassin\u2019s Creed games have never been. It\u2019s probably my favorite city from the AC2 era of games.\nThe performance of the game has  improved greatly from the previous AC games. I don\u2019t know if this had to do with the fact that now I\u2019m using Windows 10 or this is just the best port of the AC2 series, but I think it\u2019s a little of both. I did get some stuttering, but it only happened twice in the game as opposed to every couple of hours in AC2, and random areas in AC Brotherhood.\nAC: Revelations is the worst game of the Ezio saga, but it has the best story. If you have been playing this series for the story, then picking up this game is a no brainer, but if you did it for the gameplay, then picking up AC2 is probably best. Why is it the worst game of the saga? The side objectives prove to be frustrating instead of fun like in Brotherhood, the side missions are borked with endless tedium added to probably lengthen the game. This is the weirdest part since the game is easily the shortest of the three games. AC: Revelations is worth your time if you love the story, but it doesn\u2019t hold up if you are looking for innovations in the series gameplay. Revelations is worth playing for a fan, but a casual player should steer clear away from this game and just jump in one of the numbered entries. Despite all this, I still reccommend the game, especially if it's on sale.\nSome notes", "hours": 27.0, "username": "Neutron John", "products": 961, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "201870", "page": 59, "page_order": 1, "recommended": false, "date": "2016-03-16", "text": "Revelations can't be described as a complete disaster. It is an AAA-class title, with fascinating visuals, complex game mechanic and so on. Were it an independent project, with no connections to Animus and stuff, I'd maybe even praised that thing. But as a part of bigger body... it is certainly one of the dumbest volumes in the whole Assassin's Creed series (if not the worst), and can be pictured as a filler into complete AC scenario plot. Rare calculated \"breath-taking\" action moments fitting an adventure game dissolved in dozens of hours of useless grinding, with the same gameplay mechanics as in the AC Brotherhood, but more spoiled. So if you are still not bought that game, I seriously advise you to hold your hand. At least until you see some really big discount...\nWhat I don't like about Revelations? The usual stuff: all those things Ubisoft called as \"key features\" and \"revolutionary gameplay\" in their hyped proclamations, in fact don't work as supposed. Broken balance, questionable game plot, and the worst of all - the feeling that I'm not fitting into intended audience of that project. The motivation of protagonist may be suitable for teenager, grown up by Hollywood, but sadly, I can't buy into that crud no matter how hard I try.\nWhat I want to say by that is that Revelations was presented as a game which reveals so much of the Truth, making some serious fixing to the story which started to sink into unwanted tangles and incoherent twists... And it was Revelations that made it all clear: the basic Assassin's Creed story about saving the world and the ages-old struggle of total control and total freedom... it's the least attractive game feature both for players and for game designers.\nTo put it simple, all the promised Truth that Revelations \"revealed\" to the player - not really informative or least entertaining (that especially corresponds to the memories of Altair). The Assassins made a truce with Turks, so they kill political leaders in countries that Ottoman empire desire to conquer and take low profile in return. Was it about just cause? Bringing people more freedom? I doubt that. In this turn, I started to question myself, what's the real difference between Assassins and Tampliers? That question was supposedly answered in the first game, but Revelations severely undermined previous scoops. Now it's more like \"bad guys are those who shot at us\"... considering the fact it is Assassins who usually shoot first.\nOkay, let's forget about history lessons and questionable ethics of the game characters. Let's talk about gameplay, the thing I honor even more than distinct scenario.\nIf you were playing before in the Assassin's Creed 2 and AC Brotherhood (which I strongly suggest), you'll see that almost all key features remained the same. You strolling the streets of the big city, climbing the roofs and towers for better sightseeing, you meet new people and kill the most of them... You collect some prize chests scattered across the city, and use money from them to buy new weapons and even new stores and historical buildings. Or don't buy. It is irrelevant, in the end.\nIf we talk about anything but main missions in the Revelations, gameplay may provide only conceptual interest. Ezio, now a renowned mentor, nurtures other assassins more than killing himself. Side-missions for levelling your students now taking more and more time, becoming a constant push-pull on the map, where assassins competing with tampliers. Even more, game designers attached a tower-defence mimimi-game, which is so irritating that common advice is to avoid it by any cost. As of Ezio and his abilities, it's safe to say that he's armed to the teeth right about from the start of game. And after he take a hookblade and crossbow - and especially after the first student raise into master level (which can achieved quite early), it's all starting to look like T1000 was sended to the past (to ensure Suleiman's reign, maybe?)... Seriously, all those healthkits, poisons, quite-fast pistol, silent and deadly crossbow... and bombs to send terror into crowds, all that combined feels like overkill. Something like adding half-pound of sugar into (name)Cola bottle.\nAt the bottom line, about 5 hours of gameplay can be noted as somewhat interesting - main missions (some of them) and cut-scenes. And again, I must repeat that the scenario there even more grotesque than in the Assassin's Creed 3 (which I thought was impossible...). The only thing the screenwriters performed well is the love-line for Ezio. Taking the full perspective on gameplot leaved me puzzled and even ashamed, for Ezio, for Altair, for Desmond... How so? What's that was for? What was the reason? - those unanswered questions fumed me into this negative review...\nMark 6/10.

Brotherhood, while short, continued the good parts of AC2 and gave us a bit more story. This game is a pile of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing deceit and lies from Ubisoft. The name of this game makes it sound like the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing final title in the series but instead (like Brotherhood) it is another 50 dollar \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing expansion pack that barely advances the story, and adds abunch of stuff to make the game boring and uninteresting.\nThis game is literally just MORE OF THE SAME. It is identical to the previous two titles in everything from controls, feel, and graphics and nothing seems to have advanced. Well, I take that back. The graphics have gotten better as it seems they increased the LOD for the PC version, as well as giving us super sharp textures which are not seen on the console version. This is just a guess, but the game is the best looking in the series and definitely looks better than the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 console version. The graphics are not even the problem with the game as it is still pretty impressive with the size and detail of the cities that is present in this series. The problem is the same reason that Call of Duty sucks\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665now. They are running the franchise into the ground by releasing MORE OF THE SAME, especially considering this is the 2nd \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing title of AC this year.\nSo I don't have much to say about the gameplay as for the most part it is the same stuff that we have seen before. You mainly play as Ezio (with various Altair scenes) where you run, jump, chase, and assassinate targets based upon where the missions send you. The combat is largely the same with all the same weapons and one enemy attacking you at a time, then with the counter and kill system present. It literally controls exactly the same. The problem here is, there is nothing new that this game offers in terms of missions, combat or anything else. It does add more stuff to the game (like bombs, and the worst tower defense mini-game ever), but none of this really adds to the core gameplay and is really just extra side activities to have fun with (or not).\nThe first major problem with this turd is that the missions have become incredibly \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing boring. They either have you doing the same that you did before in the previous two titles (which was the exact problem with the first \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing game, i.e. repetition). The missions are literally just the same thing as either following a target, finding an artifact, etc. There is nothing wrong with this as the core game itself is pretty fun especially if you liked the gameplay from the previous titles, the problem is just because we have \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing done this so many times before that it is starting to get stale, the game needs to have new ideas and variety in the missions. Something which we all know Ubisoft sucks\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665at.\nNow they are also adding in abunch of convoluted\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665that I don't really give two\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and a sack of balls about. The first thing is bombs, and crafting bombs. Ezio now can throw bombs and make different types for different purposes. There is nothing wrong with this element. It could have been a solid addition to the game, but the fact is I simply don't give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about it because the game doesn't make you. It is just another side activity for Ezio to do. The game is getting TOO filled with this\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Now you have buying shops, gaining money from the shops, upgrading armor, buying new weapons, repairing armor, collecting animus fragments, recruiting assassins, sending assassins out on missions, burning down towers to unlock areas, capturing guild dens, side quests, Mediterranean defense, and challenges. Now I'm not complaining that there is a lot of content in the game, the problem is none of it \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing matters to the main story in ANYWAY in the slightest. Buying shops and upgrading had a purpose to the story in AC2 as you were improving your hub city and helping yourself and your uncle. None of it has any \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing meaning in this game and is just there for the sake of being there, and it really makes it uninteresting and too cramped with\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665that doesn't matter. I'm happy with most of it as it adds some content to the game, the problem is it didn't need any MORE\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665on top of it, maybe just EVOLVED forms and more interesting forms of what was already there. Now bombs are added on top of this, and worst yet, the single \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing WORST tower defense game in the history of games.\nThis game has such a terrible tower defense game that it makes my\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665deflate and shrivel inside of my body. Whoever decided to put this into the game should be hanged in public and peed upon by everyone who purchased this game. After capturing a guild den, they become under conflict and you have to play a tower defense game placing units on the map and blockades to stop the Templar from reaching a certain port. The problem is it is so horrible balanced and utterly boring that it hurts the game rather than helps it. I don't give a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665about this tower defense\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and it needs to go. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you Ubisoft.\nSo I have to say just to clarify, the graphics are nice and the game is still the same kind of fun we have had before, just now becoming stale. The problem is, the story doesn't help. Big \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing questions were left at the end of AC2 and Brotherhood and they really added a sense to want you to keep playing. The story in this game does not. In fact, this game barely \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing advances the story AT ALL. Desmond is now stuck in the Animus for some reason and Ezio is trying to unlock the pieces to some door of Altair. That is it, the story doesn't really evolve beyond this or reveal anything more about the ancient race. All that you find out is that Ezio retires and knows Desmond is watching for some reason (they never explain how) and that some solar flare destroyed Earth and Desmond has to stop a second. A solar flare? That was the big secret? Another point which hurts and does not help the game.\nThis game is fallen victim to what I call the Ubisoft Curse (can I trademark that\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665). AC1 was moderately successful so Ubisoft put more work into and made AC2 which was a great game and it sold well. Now Ubisoft is putting the curse on the franchise and milking it \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing dry like they have done with all their series. They milked Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six, and every other \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing series with 500 mediocre games that they rushed out the door simply to generate a quick buck. This was their LAST good series that they owned. AC2 was a damn good game, brotherhood continued the trend, but this one has fallen victim to the curse where they simply rushed another title with the AC name on it to make a quick \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing buck. It sucks because they are now \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on their last good series and we, the customers, are the ones getting \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed up the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 because we paid 50 bucks for this. Assassin's Creed 2 felt epic because you traveled all over Italy to multiple cities, and had a hub city from which you operated. It made the game feel large and epic in scale, as well as being the longest game in the series. Brotherhood and Revelations have begun killing this by only containing one city which stabs that feeling right in the back and confines you in a smaller area which is obviously faster to develop so they shove out more titles. The Ubisoft Curse begins.\nThe series needs more time between sequels and more innovation as this title does not keep the fun and large scale feeling that AC2 has had and instead feels like a rushed title to make more money of the franchise by offering the exact same\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665as before with a few new elements thrown on top.\n6.5/10", "hours": 17.2, "username": "Vampire Bride", "products": 271, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

Like all games, this should always happen where every year the game improves in graphic quality and this game fulfilled it.\nThe new features of weapons/items makes it more easier to play. One of these items would be a grenade that you throw to wipe out a crowd of enemies. There are more features, that you should find that out yourself.

However right away I can say that this game, while good, has been a bit rushed to fit the yearly release date. I found more glitches than in the previous two games - those are graphical, audio, AI & camera issues. The storyline is mostly set in Istanbul and a this change feels good, with a different architecture this time around. We finally get a proper ending for both Ezio and Altair while advancing the Desmond plot quite a lot. Desmond gets some backstory too and we meet Subject 16. Many missions are pretty cool, especially building up your master assassins. But some types become a bit repetitive and the 100% requirements for many missions are again VERY annoying. Maybe they are needed because you have assassin to fight for you and this time also bombs to throw out and kill whole groups. Yet I still feel the balance could have been adjusted. The combat is the same as in AC2 & AC:B. Main assassinations are again great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. Some game mechanics added to this game are just swing and miss, mainly - mediterranean defense game, den defense and for some people also the FPS platforming. As always you need a uPlay account. I tried some multiplayer and while Deathmatch is actually fun, but every other type of mode you get destroyed by high level people because they have better gear. Otherwise the game itself is nice but it feels it could be better. Recommended for anyone who played the previous games, but expect a less polished game which somehow lacks even compared to AC1.\nThere are some DLCs available for this game that are not on Steam.\nSolo Pack (weapons+upgrade), Mediterranean Exclusive Missions (missions), Multiplayer Pack (character).\n------------------------------------------------------------------", "hours": 71.3, "username": "Artibius", "products": 491, "early_access": false}

You created a pitch black cape, grab a black leather glove (from OJ Simpson fame) taped a butter knife to your wrist and put on a raiders hooded sweatshirt.  You're totally ready for a new adventure as everyone's favorite assassin Enzio Auditore.   You start up the game excited to finally see what really happened during the events of the previous game.. (cliff hangers tend to do that)...\nNothing more needs to be said as the real life story isn't driven forward much at all in this game, but that doesn't detract away from the brilliance of this wonderful game..\nThe Story....  Back again As Desmond Miles, only this time Desmond Miles is in a coma, brought upon by his interactions with the Apple from the previous game.  Fear not, instead of seeking out medical attention, or generally waiting for Desmond to wake up as going into a coma is a serious side effect of the Animus.. his trusty companions decide the best course of action is to strap Desmond into the Animus for yet another fun and exciting adventure as Enzio..  Immediately you'll notice something Enzio is a geriatric now.  He's old, he looks to have aged about 40 years since Brotherhood, but we'll let that slide because in all honesty Enzio is probably the coolest fictional old guy since the Dos Equis guy..\nEnzio finds himself in Constantinople, on a mission to discover the secrets of Altairs (the assassin from the first game, for those who don't already know)  Waltzing up and just going into the library would be too easy.. we are talking Assassin's Creed here.  So after a nice little tutorial missing you're thrust into Constantinople, all alone, broke, and injured..  The story picks up from there...  or it doesn't depending upon how you look at it..\nThe Gameplay..  it's fairly familiar by this point, run, jump, collect, kill, sneak... a few major additions in this game was the hook blade, a nice little addition, also you can now create bombs, lethal, stun and Smoke varieties..  These are pretty much game changers once you get used to how they work..  Another addition is red and yellow trails when you open up eagle sense.  It's kind of cheap in all honesty, but sometimes you just want to watch the world burn..   Towers used from the last game are back.. only now they are no longer called Borgia towers (since the Borgia family was pretty much removed from the AC universe in the second game)  Now they are known as Dens, which you unlock to gain a new hideout for your assassins.\nAnother neat addition to the game was den defense.. (which is a simplified tower defense game), while the concept was pretty neat, in 24 hours of playing, I only managed to initiate 2 den defenses.. The first tutorial one, and the second one happened not too long after that..  It wasn't for lack of trying as I left my suspicion meter in the red for hours, and paid close attention to the map, wandering around various parts..  Needless to say I think this aspect was broken in my game for some reason..\nThe recruitment system is back, and it's been expanded upon quite considerable.  You can now reach level 15 with individual assassins, and you can set them as leaders of the individual dens.  Furthermore, the quest system seemed to receive an overhaul as well.  Now you can have your assassins take over a city, (instead of just quest there)  when you're in control you receive cash, experience and bomb making materials.  A neat addition to say the least, especially as money in this game is fairly difficult to come by until you've opened up almost all the shops and banks..\nAs well as playing Enzio, you'll get the chance to play as Altair.. although his missions are fairly limited but are really interesting and help show what became of Altair after you left him..\nOverall..  I'd recommend this game, although after playing Assassin Creed 2 and Brotherhood, this game felt like more of the same, where as the previous games seemed to get better as time went on.  Although it could have just been me starting to get burned out on Assassin Creed.  Also the game didn't feel quite as epic or as well put together as the previous 3 games.. Not just the story but the bugs, glitches, and general unstable nature of the game.. especially when closing the program down, which crashes 90% of the time.  Almost inexcusable at this point in time, matters are made worse because the crashing often times results in a locked up computer.\n*Quick Note.. Multiplayer is still alive in this game, but it's pretty much on life support.  After playing Multiplayer long enough to get level 20 I can say that any new comers to multiplayer will be in for a very daunting task.  You'll likely be matched with level 50's who have all the best perks equipped..  Although after I gained some levels and learned the game it was more fun than I expected..

It takes everything from AC 1, 2, and Brotherhood and tries to focus on the good stuff while eliminating some of the more tedious elements. It also introduces a nifty secondary blade for the speediest parkouring yet and a crafting system for bombs that a lot of people overlook but it is nice to see developers still trying to create novel experiences. The story is also decent and it ties up the Altair and Ezio stories in a satisfying way while leaving a cool hook into AC 3.\nOn top of that, there's an few optional first person platforming levels tossed in that give some of Desmond's backstory in a totally new way. And if you like that, there's a dlc that adds more of it that tells the backstory of subject 16 wihch I thought was pretty cool.\nAnd continuing from AC Brotherhood, there's even a multiplayer mode that seems pretty similar and is more fleshed out. Sadly, I think it's even emptier than ACB's multiplayer and you'll probably get rekt by Prestige level 12 players while trying to start out and learn everything.", "hours": 40.6, "username": "UltimateXero", "products": 242, "early_access": false}

Unfortunately, upon arrival Ezio is attacked by Byzantines, who have taken possession of the old fortress. On his little adventure Ezio learns something regarding the existence of some artifacts that will help him open this old library, the Templars have one of the keys, but 4 others remain hidden, on his journey, he learns about Niccol\u00f2 Polo's journal, which will help Ezio to locate the rest of the keys, thus a new voyage takes him to the great city of Constantinople.\nNew historical characters appear on this journey, such as Piri Reis, Manuel Palaeologos and Prince Suleiman, as for new characters that will help Ezio on his adventures, such Yusuf Tazim and Sofia Sartor, the latest being some sort of love interest in the beginning of the game and future wife of our hero. But that is not all, we can also play as Alta\u00efr once more, by re-experiencing some episodes on his life every time we find a key, this aspect is great, it really takes you back in time to relive part of his story, his life as an Assassin, his family and what drove him to take over a weak and fractured order and revitalizing it and finally becoming a legend.\nI must say that Assassin\u2019s Creed has always been solid when it comes to game mechanics, just some small details that do not overshadow the whole experience, on AC: Revelations everything feels smoother and fast paced, controls have changed a little, but it is nothing serious, fighting feels more fluid and cohesive, we have multiple swords and small weapons at our disposal, as well as the gun and poison and the crossbow, with a new design. On this instalment, a set of bombs is introduced, bombs with various characteristics that would help us getting rid of enemies or just distracting them to fulfil our missions, but the shining star here is a new tool called hook blade, which will help us to free-run faster throughout the city, as well as to climb buildings and towers in a matter of seconds. Definitely, some minor aspects have changed and some other have been refined, kill streaks are easy to perform and you can kill enemies in seconds with no problems at all.\nWe are also introduced to a new system, which is some sort of tower defense action, at some point on the game, you will have to face attacks on different zones of the city you have liberated, and this means the enemy will attack at random moments, even during missions, and you must act quickly or the place you have captured will be lost, consequently retaking it is part of the job, but if you play your cards well this new mechanic would not be a problem at all.\nThe recruitment has also changed a bit, now every time you recruit a new member some sort of mini mission is triggered or sometimes is just defending citizens who will gladly join your cause, after you have some new members you can send them on various missions to defend or retake different cities, the assassins will now level up faster so once they reach the title of Assassin you can make them leaders of the different dens you have all over the city, by doing this a new mission or activity is triggered.\nThe AC franchise has always delivered beautiful depicted cities and locations, this is not the exception, Constantinople is beautiful, massive and full of details, every building and tower show little elements which highlight the depth of the religion and cultural background of the city. Inscriptions are to be found on historical and important building and towers, some other places show the difference of the neighborhoods, weary and old architecture is present everywhere. Outstanding.\nOn the other hand, the population and trading is massive, multiple stores and NPC\u2019s crowd the city with life, and side activities, one small detail is the NPC design, it is notorious that many of them repeated themselves, many characters looked the same, which makes you think that maybe somebody was lazy regarding this aspect, it\u2019s nothing grave nonetheless.\nAC: Revelations is great when it comes to sound effects, the sound of blades, the fire arms, all of the crowd\u2019s conversations, everything is masterfully done, the voice acting is as always, superb, nothing bad to say about it, Ezio sounds mature and wise and all other voice actors have done a tremendous job on their roles, everyone is believable, top notch acting.\nThe music has always been important for these games, this is why I have to say that the soundtrack for this game is splendid, it really captures the atmosphere of the city and every secret, from action-oriented music to more ambient sounds, all of it is perfect. At some points it really makes you feel the inevitable is about to come, the end of our journey along with Ezio, but at the same time a new beginning in his life, the music itself truly delivers a great impression.\nThere is always something negative with these games, unfortunately, there are some new ideas that are a little rough around the edges, as mentioned before the tower defense system is really not the best, it feels unfinished and rushed, like out of place, not only due to the fact that is presented briefly but also for the way it decides to show up from time to time, there are points on the game which you are far away and it urges you to defend a certain den, it happens you are on the other side of the map and by the time you struggle to come back and defend it, the place is already lost or sometimes the systems triggers these new tasks while you are in the middle of another mission, of course the main missions are more important, so to speak you don\u2019t care much about the dens and continue with the story. I am sure it looks good on paper, but the idea was not implemented in the best way.\nAnother new characteristic that seems like a new add on but tends to be forgettable after a couple of times is the bombs system, yes, it really looks great, all sort of bombs with different applications, but rarely practical, you can collect the ingredients or just buy them but in the end the tedious system is easily replaceable by the poison darts that far better than any kind of bomb, and also more fun and faster, overall, the bombs looked like a new great addition, however it was extremely overshadowed by the simplicity of other tools we can use to kill or distract enemies.\nAC: Revelations is a great game with a fair ending to Ezio\u2019s adventures, and a memorable travel back in time to relive some of Alta\u00efr\u2019s experiences, it is sad, yes, we have seen how Il Mentore was born, turned assassin, we have witnessed how he lost part of his family to treacherous enemies, we have seen how he has become a wiser man, how he has learnt to deal with his past and face the present and how all the suffering, nonetheless, has paid off.\nI must highlight the love interest for Ezio, his future wife was a great addition to the story, it feels like Sofia is an important part of the whole story, but at the same time she is not more essential than the story itself, it is subtle, yet significant and a likeable character.\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations is a must for every fan of the franchise!", "hours": 30.7, "username": "PandaFraHelvete", "products": 312, "early_access": false}

To its credit,\nis better than Brotherhood and is pretty much the sequel Brotherhood was meant to be. Although whereas Brotherhood was an unimaginative rehash of previous gameplay principles, Revelations appears to be this dubious mishmash of poorly implemented game ideas.\nThere's less filler missions but now you individually rescue about a hundred citizens to induct into your assassin ranks. They removed the cryptography puzzles (a shame since I honestly enjoy cryptography) and inserted first-person PLATFORMERS into the metagame sequences instead. There's this odd TOWER DEFENSE mini-game, and it's presented both as a fail condition from being too notorious yet comes with rewards of its own. The Awareness Icon can go blow itself: even at max notoriety, Ottoman soldiers won't challenge you unless you're already doing something suspicious and Byzantine soldiers always view you as an enemy anyhow. Finally, challenges are back and in greater number than ever. They were probably intended as a tutorial device but the sheer quantity of tasks required grinds the story to a halt.\nA major sticking point for Revelations is how utterly unbalanced it is. I was used to unbalanced mechanics from when one could simply wait for money to fall from the sky and open up better equipment\n. That's still there but now you have the main map open from the get-go and access to END LEVEL EQUIPMENT as soon as you unlock your towers and complete your assassin network. Master Assassin armor and 5/5/5 weapons by sequence three? You better believe it. Bomb crafting seems to be the major drawing point of this installment and they're both easily accessible and eminently customizable. Sadly, simple smoke bombs were already overpowered by Assassin's Creed 2  and have now become superfluous by the sheer amount of killing tools you possess. Furthermore, they can only be crafted at specific crafting stations, meaning you won't be able to switch to the right bomb in the middle of a mission when they'd be relevant.\nI really wanted to give\nmy thumbs up; it's essentially a Michael Bay movie set up in Turkish gunpowder civilization. But as much as I enjoy the stunts you pull throughout the story, there is no defense for the clunky gameplay mechanics.

Or at least thats what I did with about 92 hours of my 99 hours of gameplay. (I do not regret it) The other portions of the game that worked were the heroic sendoffs for Altair and Ezio. These characters represent the golden age of the assassins creed universe so it was nice to see them get a respectful sendoff rather then be overused in future cash cow moo creed titles\nThe Bad\nThe pacing wasn't perfect. The historical research wasn't as meticulous as in previous games. The \"Den Defense\" minigame is essentially optional... The antagonists weren\u2019t particularly threatening. Horrific Islamic war criminals are presented in a positive light and freedom fighting Greeks seeking to reclaim their homeland are presented as the villains.... (what a brave stance for the developers to take) The tutorial mission and the ending mission are basically the same. You cant steal/use Turkish rifles, you can steal from peasents in front of guards ext. The game feels repetitive and short and like the content cut from previous titles were thrown into this game as a haphazard mix.\nThe Ugly\nYou can play as Desmond as he navigates some cheap\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\"jump over things\" minigame where he monologues about his past. You may choose to simulate this experience by slapping yourself with a mouse pad.... you know where.\nBottom Line.\nThe games budget was triple slashed when it became apparent that it would only be competing for market share with Assassins Creed 3. You can see the scope that was intended for the game and literally feel missing content as you faff about. It\u2019s clear that the developers aspired only to adequacy and met it not with leaps and bounds but as a half asphyxiated carcass crawling over the finish line before collapsing but whether it\u2019s by an inch or a mile the game made it. It IS adequate, its pros do outweigh its flaws. So yeah, I liked it, I liked my time traveling Prussian warhammer and my fake\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665Aladdin sword and \"macing\" peasants was thoroughly amusing. I'd do it again.

Story was more fun than  brotherhood, but couldnt compare with the AC2 story of course! This time, the city is constantinople.\nAgain, we come back with brotherhood assassins crew that you can send on missions to become better assassins. Again, i spent more time buying all the shops and monuments and playing with my crew than running the main mission (I actually got the master assassin armor before i finished getting the first crappy leather set of armor from the shop! hahaha). There is a concept of setting up a new den after you capture templar regions in the city. Similar to what we already had in brotherhood, but this time, the templar can capture it back if you're not careful!\nAlso, we get introduced to all kind of bomb making. Actually, this game is fantastic for terrorist in training. The amount of bombs you can use is just insane and pretty overpowered! It's a good thing you can only bring 3 bombs of each type on you at a time or you would do nothing else to assassinate your targets but bomb them! But then, they put bomb making tables everywhere in the map so you are rarely more than 1 minute away from making more bombs! And you always get more bomb making ingredients than you know what to do with (i never bought any bomb making ingredients. In fact, i sold so many ingredients for big $$$! Especially at the start when you are poor, its a fantastic way to make money).\nThe gameplay is awesome and fun. What is also very special about this game is the templar you kill. In all the templar kill you did in the earlier AC, templar always die with arrogance and naked lust for power that you cannot root for them, they are insanely evil and corrupted by power. But in revelation, it's quite the opposite! Each templar death made me question my motives as an assassin! The templars that we kill always had pretty good reasons to do what they did and they sincerely believed they were trying to help humanity become better! And they always said: What are you assassins doing to help humanity? And we just can't answer positively that question. I'm telling you, each templar death is not rewarding but very troubling! That's freaking AWESOME in  a game!!! Completely different from the other templar death in previous AC.\nNow the only lowdown would be when you go back into the animus and play as desmond.

He'd finished the story so I didn't get what had happened. That was Brotherhood. Needless to say he never let me play it.\nSteam sale rolls around some years ago, Brotherhood and ACII are discounted so I get them both. ACII was the closest to the first AC and I loved it's story. Brotherhood was the game I never got to play myself, and I enjoyed it but the story wasn't as hooking as 2's. I couldn't decide if I wanted to continue it.\nI'm glad I did. Revelations takes the story of ACII, the combat and gameplay of Brotherhood, mixes in the sense that you can only get from a favorite TV show or movie series that this is the end of your favorite character's story, and sets it to cook until well-done. A lot of the reviews I saw for this game only focus on what it was missing so they were lower scored. I'm gonna tell you what I got from this game, and you can decide if you'll enjoy it.\nIf you enjoyed ACII's story and Brotherhood's gameplay, you're getting both with this game. There's not much in terms of new things because it doesn't need those things. Revelations' boasts a wonderfully crafted story that at the end will leave you crying(yes, I cried.), the music helps with it's somber lows and action-paced highs(the main menu's looping music had me fighting tears with the vocals), the gameplay has just enough new mixed with old to keep you glued to the controller(or keyboard), and it's cast is at it's finest.\nSo any Ezio fans, do yourselves a favor and get this game.

Opening ports, rebooting my computer in safe mode, closing all other applications... nothing worked.

It brings an ending to the story of these two characters, and on top of playing an older, more experienced Ezio, you also get to play some parts as Altair.\nMechanics-wise, the game picks up where ACB stopped and adds to the mechanics you know from the previous 3 games. You still micromanage your assassins, recruiting and training them, and you send them out on missions. This time, they don't only bring back money, they can also take over other cities, which will provide you with incoming money and components for the other new addition - bombs.\nThe bombs have a rather complex system... you have three categories, of which you can have three bombs on you. For example, a shrapnel bomb, a smoke bomb (similar to the good ol smoke bombs from ACB) and a cherry bomb, which you can use to lure away guards, distracting them.\nYou can put together those bombs, deciding whether you want them to explode on impact or with a delay, or whether they work like a mine, with a tripwire.\nIt's a nice addition, but to me, it's not a total game-changer. You should get used to those bombs and their benefits, and use them (the game will teach you how, and you can also \"test\" the bombs in a kind of a simulator).\nOther than that, it's a lot like ACB... crossbow, assassins you can command and have them attack enemies for you, etc. Climbing is a bit more convenient now due to the new hookblade, which also can be handy in combat.\nThe game DOES have a few issues... I had a few crashes (apparently when some popup came up in my taskbar, the game crashed... at least I suspect that to be the reason), while the overall performance was great even at ultra settings.\nThe controls... sigh... well, I do play AC games with an Xbox controller, and I think thats a LOT better and easier than using kbm. However, the controls still are often pretty... imprecise, wonky, weird. You know what I am talking about if you played earlier ACs... jumps going wrong as Ezio will not jump to some kind of ledge, but suddenly jump to the left or right. The hookblade, which will make you climb upwards faster (and allows wider jumps as you can grab ledges with it), might cause you to accidentially do backwards jumps sometimes.\nI guess that's the curse of the series... those controls. I noticed a big improvement in Unity (yes, I know, the game has serious issues)... climbing down and fast parcour seems so much easier and controllable in Unity. I can't pinpoint why that is, it just feels that way when I compare parcour and races in ACII/ACB/ACR and ACU.\nThe story is a bit confusing (MUCH less so though if you played the previous games and know what the Apple Of Eden is, what the Templars do etc.), and I am not sure how well this game would work for you if it was your first AC-game. I did enjoy it a lot, and the atmosphere of the game is AWESOME. Old Constantinople (modern day Istanbul) has a lot of vibe to it, and looks beautiful. Right now, my favorite setting is Paris in ACU, followed by Constantinople and Rome (ACB)...it's up there.\nGreat game, great ending to the Ezio-trilogy AND AC1. If you enjoyed the first two Ezio-games, make sure you get this one.\nPros:\n- Great atmosphere/setting\n- Good story/ending to Ezios and Altairs story\n- Some minor improvements to climbing, weapons, assassin guild etc.\n- Great soundtrack\n- Play as Altair\n- Very cool intro\n- Some very cool missions/memories... (wait till you have to prevent an assassination at the palace, with some Italian musicians involved...)\n- Some epic moments and Indiana Jones-like fights (thinking of one of the last battles in which Sofia was involved)\nCons:\n- Occasional crashes (YMMV)\n- As usual, kinda problematic controls\n- Might not be a good standalone or \"get into the franchise\" type game, start with AC or, even better, ACII\nAnd... once again, and I am not gonna spoil anything - if you did like Ezio and Altair, you owe yourself (and them) to play this. The ending of their story (for a bit more of Ezio's story, check out the \"Embers\" movie on YT) is quite touching - yes, it's sad, but to me, it was a satisfying ending to the story of two amazing heroes\n9.5/10", "hours": 21.5, "user_id": "76561198171238315", "username": "danstew23", "products": 185, "early_access": false}

Even though those were somewhat useful, they still added a bunch stuff that wasn't, like the tower defense sequences,\nIt's like ordering an ice cream sundae, something you know and love, and the server tells you that you're getting the \"new and improved\" sundae that's totally better then the regular old sundae.

I think it definitely helps with your enjoyment of this game to play it right after beating the AC:B because it helps you appreciate the imrpovements and differences.\nCombat is improved with the addition of stronger enemies that can't be insta-killed. It encourages you to make more use of your various tools and stealth, which enhances the variety of the gameplay.\nThe long climbing / free-running segments in AC:B could feel like a boring slog at times. They've dramatically improved that in this game - any sections that have an emphasis on free-running and climbing have an engaging, well-designed \"flow\" to them that was lacking in the previous games. The addition of the hook blade makes climbing more engaging because you can go faster if you use the hook correctly, and it allows the levels to give you more of a sense of speed and traversal because of things like zip lines and long jumps. Overall, these sections have gone from being a dreadfully boring thing that you just have to force yourself through to a very fun and exciting bit of gameplay.\nThe setting in AC:B was starting to get stale after being so similar to AC2. Things like the voice clips, ambience, architecture, and stuff like that just started to make the game feel a little bit too familiar. They've addressed this by bringing you to a whole new, unique location in this game. It seems like a small difference, but it really is a great relief to not be hearing the same random voice clips from the guards and citizens as they react to you.\nThe only spots where I didn't enjoy the game involved having to re-do certain long sections during missions when I failed or when a bug caused me to fail, and the tower-defence like mode where you have to defend your captured strongholds. In such a huge game as this, random bugs are an inevitability. Thankfully, the checkpointing system is usually quite forgiving (or at least I got lucky), so you only have the occasional frustrating moment, but there were a few sections where I had failed right before a checkpoint and had to replay 5 minutes or so. That's just not very fun when those 5 minutes are pretty much the same every time. There's really only a few missions that have the capacity to be frustrating, though. As for the tower-defense, it's just not fun. I frequently found that, while I could successfully and easily hold back all of the waves, I lost right at the end when the siege unit comes through. When that happens, you may find yourself in a situation where you don't have money for more units so you just have to sit there watching the siege unit plunk away at your base until you die. I think that you're supposed to disband the units that the siege engine has already passed and re-assign them to be near your base, but I ended up not getting a chance to try this out. Anyway, I don't come to this game for tower-defence, so it's kind of an annoying interruption. You can avoid it in several ways, thankfully, so as long as you put a little bit of effort towards that end, you won't have to deal with tower defence.\nThere's plenty of other things that I won't go into that adds to the appeal of this game.\nOverall, I think it's more fun than AC:B because they had time to see what people thought about AC:B and improve upon it.", "hours": 14.0, "username": "chairbender", "products": 392, "early_access": false}

The game gives a small synopsis of what has occurred in previous installments, but considering that Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood are still well developed games to this day, it would be best to play them first.\nStory: We find the current timeline of this game in the midst of conflict between the Byzantine Empire and the remnants of the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople. A now experienced \"Old Man,\" Ezio leaves Italy behind to make sense of the history of the Assassin Order and the experience of his ancestor, Altair. The story and everything that makes it is the most exceptionally well done in this installment. Voice Actor Roger Craig Smith still shines as Ezio, making us believe that this is indeed an aged and seasoned assassin. The characters he interacts with all help to shape the world surrounding us. You care about almost everyone regardless of how little they may be highlighted, even to a fault. I actually wish we would have had more time with Sofia Sartor, an Italian book collector with whom Ezio befriends. This is an example of how unfortunately short lived this game in particular is. Concentrating on the main story while doing some side content, I beat this game in 17 hours, the shortest out of the Ezio trilogy.\nOn the present day storyline, Desmond is trapped in the animus, interacting with subject 16, also trapped and with an unsettling demeanor. While each moment with these two characters is well done, it is also short lived and not built upon too much. As you collect animus fragments in Ezio's storyline, you can also unlock First Person puzzle missions on the Animus Island where Desmond is stuck in. Unfortunately I could not do these missions, as there is STILL a bug in the game that will cause the game to crash whenever you try to enter the mission. I've been told this was also an issue with at least the PS3 version but I am currently unaware if this was ever patched on that version.\nGameplay & Content: What you are familiar with from the previous installments is further fine tuned in Revelations. The platforming is better, though not by much (I still occasionally jumped to my doom every so often due to bad positioning of Ezio, the camera, or the occasional platform that was a little too well hidden). Horses are no longer a feature in the game, though not exactly needed. Much of the side content from previous games was either ratcheted down or completely taken out. I never once saw Assassination contracts, which fortunately were brought back in Assassin's Creed III for those who enjoyed them (Not me, I tended to ignore them). New side content, such as the \"Tower Defense\" imitation you are introduced to near the beginning of the game, is easily forgettable and even seems like the developers went out of their way to hide the fact that they exist.\n\nMain gameplay missions are the typical \"Kill this target, tail this target,\" but occasionally they throw something quite fun and unique in to surprise you. At one point you get your revenge on those pesky minstrels, steal their clothes and become one yourself. Not only was this mission clever, it was fun hearing Ezio mock the very existence of minstrels with his lyrics. I would almost encourage you to play this game for this part alone.\nThe new bomb system in this game that replaces the smoke bombs from the previous games is for the most part ineffective I found in most situations and at best very situational. Attack bombs you have too much of a chance of hurting yourself, decoy bombs either fail at distracting your enemies or immediately blow your cover regardless of distance, and even stun bombs won't work on most enemies. Only the \"Smoke Screen\" bomb, which is literally the smoke bomb from the previous games, will actually work for you. Thankfully this was a feature that was scrapped in future installments and I say good riddance.\nAudio: There is not much to say in terms of the audio. As a AAA title sound and music are top notch. The background music is beautiful and relevant to the setting, and sound effects are quality and impactful.\nGraphics: This game is a bigger step ahead from Brotherhood than Brotherhood was to Assassin's Creed II. Everything is much better detailed and animated, which helps give you an idea of where the series is headed in terms of graphics. However I am not sure if this a problem with my Graphics card or with me, but just like the previous games in the series, I had problems with shadow flickering. On my NVidia GTX 970 I'm surprised to see this STILL occurring. Additionally this still shows the issue of NPCs and world props loading in later than they should be, sometimes scaring the ever loving hell out of me. This is a problem that STILL persists with Assassin's Creed III as I have been playing it.\nFinal Thoughts: While a step down from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood overall, it is still worth the time and price for the story alone. Ubisoft provides a thrilling and immersive experience in the open world of Constantinople despite its many glaring flaws. As far as the story for the Animus Fragment puzzle missions? Would probably be best to youtube them.", "hours": 17.3, "username": "Deathwing Duck", "products": 187, "early_access": false}

While on the surface this game may seem similar to \u2013 indeed, even improved from its predecessors, the game suffers from a weak plot and repetitive gameplay relative to the previous games.\nStory\nEzio Auditore is graying, but he hasn\u2019t slowed down yet. After travelling to the fortress of Altair, the assassin protagonist from the original Assassin\u2019s Creed, in search of answers, he is confronted by a group of Templars who are searching for five keys that could open up Altair\u2019s vault and give them access to the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact left behind by Those Who Came Before that can reveal many secrets and control men\u2019s minds, among other things. Ezio must find the keys before them so that he can keep the artifact safe.\nAlas, this game\u2019s plot is quite poor compared to the previous games; the plot is motivated entirely by a \u201ccollect the soup cans\u201d plot, where you try and collect the magical keys before the bad guys do. The cast is all new, with only Ezio appearing from the previous two Assassin\u2019s Creed II games, and while there are flashbacks to Altair\u2019s life in the aftermath of the original Assassin\u2019s Creed, having never played the first game, I\u2019m not sure to what extent some of the characters are carried over from that game.\nThe biggest problem lies in the fact that the modern-day plot \u2013 the entire reason that Desmond, the protagonist, is flashing back through his ancestor\u2019s memories \u2013 takes an extreme back seat throughout the game. Desmond spends the entire game trapped in the machine that allows him to view his ancestor\u2019s memories, and thus the meta-plot comes to a screeching halt and the whole game feels like a pointless cash-in, something which Ubisoft created to exploit AC II once more before finally releasing AC III. While the meta-plot never consumed a huge fraction of the previous games, its absence here is very notciable, as Ezio\u2019s story just isn\u2019t that interesting or high-stakes, and none of the characters I encountered in Constantinople connected with me in any way. The whole \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d angle that the previous games had is almost entirely lost, with no real signs of said gigantic conspiracy appearing in the game, and without that whole aspect, the game is simply much less interesting.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is virtually unchanged from the previous Assassin\u2019s Creed II games. Ezio starts out with all his toys, and he only really gets a couple new ones \u2013 a hook that he can use to extend his reach while jumping, which is vaguely interesting for some platforming, and bombs, which have a variety of effects, but the main one is basically \u201cwin fights even more ridiculously easily than before.\u201d There were a few acrobatic maneuvers added to close combat, but they\u2019re mostly pretty worthless; combat is extremely easy and I never even once had to use the new maneuvers to win or escape.\nThe gameplay is still the same formula as the previous Assassin\u2019s Creed II games: you spend the whole game running through a city, climbing buildings and occasionally murdering people. The parkour is pretty smooth, but honestly has begun to wear a bit thin; while it is neat being able to climb buildings, in the end it is mostly just following paths through the environment which mostly feel extremely straightforward and without much skill. Because Ezio does so much automatically, there\u2019s very little challenge in the platforming aspects of the game, and because Ezio is so good at instantly killing enemies \u2013 indeed, he can kill every enemy in the game with a single hit, and oftentimes, kill entire groups in this manner \u2013 there\u2019s very little challenge in combat. The main challenge of the game is sneaking around stealthily, and a few missions where you aren\u2019t supposed to kill people, but even all of that is easily done within a couple tries.\nConsequently, the game as a whole feels extremely lightweight, and there isn\u2019t much of a sense of achievement in victory; everything feels like it was handed to you on a silver platter, and the lack of challenge makes a lot of the game feel samey. A few underground tombs add some variety to the feel of the game, and a few of them felt pretty good, but in the end they really more or less boil down to \u201crunning along the path and the game trying to make it look impressive\u201d, rather similar to the 3D Sonic games, but without the challenge. The missions can almost all be beaten very quickly, and most of the missions that cannot be beaten extremely quickly are because you have to run back and forth across the city. If you were just running through the main quest line, you could beat the entire game in under 10 hours.\nThe main side quests in the game are just \u201ccollect all the objects in the environment\u201d, and while there are maps to finding the items which you can purchase, actually grabbing all the items is completely unchallenging; it is just tedious. Indeed, almost all of the \u201cchallenges\u201d in the game are just tedious time-wasters to make the game feel longer than it really is; there\u2019s only a handful of sidequests, and of them, only two had any real weight to them, and both of them were additional \u201cExplore the ancient tomb\u201d type challenges, much like the ones in the main questline, except in different environments.\nAs in the previous Assassin\u2019s Creed game, you can recruit a bunch of sidekick assassins and send them on quests to go murder people to level up, or you can have them stick around and murder people for you while you\u2019re going around town, which makes the game even more of a joke. In the end, these sidequests are handled entirely textually and are very dull, just another time management/time waster that the game throws in to make things last longer.\nGraphics\nThe game looks decent enough graphically; the graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are serviceable enough and the primary characters are all reasonably distinctive. Alas, your sidekick assassins are entirely interchangeable and not terribly interesting looking, and the city itself, while pretty enough at first, quickly becomes a bland backdrop after running across it for the umpteenth time. The hidden assassin key locations break up the monotony a bit, but for most of the game, you see nothing but a bunch of samey buildings.\nFinal Summary\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Revelations is a cash-in on the Assassins\u2019s Creed II series of games, and is pretty much entirely worthless; the game does nothing to further the meta-story of the series, and Ezio\u2019s story here is pretty bland. The gameplay is just more of the same from the previous games, with more of the same tedious time wasters to pretend like the game is longer than it is. There\u2019s just not a whole lot here to recommend; it is yet another ACII game, but despite the slight improvements in gameplay it is worth neither your time nor your money.", "hours": 34.5, "username": "TheTitaniumDragon", "products": 1160, "early_access": false}

After the events of AC:B, he finds himself trapped along side Subject 12. Subject 12 explains to him that he has to finish what he started in the Animus; finishing the Ezio Auditore storyline, or lose all grip on reality. He enters back into the life of Ezio as he searches for answers at the castle in the first game, only to find it overrun by Templars. After Ezio finishes them, he finds the sacred library of Altiar, only to be locked by some kind of mechanism. He travels to Constantinople to find the keys needed to open the strange door, as well as looking into the life of Altiar as he finds each key. While in the city, he meets up with other Assassins and helps expand the Order, while eliminated Templars along the way.\nHere is where is gets a bit messy.\nIf you choose to do all of the side quests for the Order, which for me took a few hours at least, you immediately get one of the best armor in the game, even though you technically just arrived in the city. Progressively, your enemies stand nearly no chance against you since your armor is maxed out. Sure, steath is still an important factor in the game and can still be a challange, but overall, combat has never been easier. Not to mention the best weapons are given to you as well. You can still buy landmarks, shops, etc, just like in Brotherhood, and there lies the problem; this is Brotherhood improved/reskin. It feels like a discount Brotherhood. At least, that's how I felt like it is. Hopefully it might just be me. But gameplay overall can be quite easy to manage. As I stated, it feels like a DLC of Brotherhood.\nBombs, on the otherhand, is where this game shines the most. You can now be really creative on how you want to kill your targets. You can customize your bombs by making them lethal or non-leathal. From shrapnal to smoke, bombs are fun to use. Except the fact that you can kill literally dozens of civis at once and the game can let you get away with it. Overall, good laughs from this one.\nSUMMARY:\nAC:R is a fun, good game. Not terrific, but not terrible. It has its moments, and is a great edition (story wise) to the franchise that will either leave you in tears, or determined to play the next game for the sake of finishing what you started in the AC world.

Besides all that, which is probably the most accurate way to describe the game, I personally liked it, but I'm also a stupid fanboy.\nHey, maybe that's what you get when you try to push out a new title every year with no exception, Assassin's Creed: Unity sure showed us that, perhaps not creatively, but surely in a techical matter.\nOh yeah, and Uplay isn't exactly anything to cheer about either.

Continuing in the pattern of doing things with entirely different gameplay, his side missions are only useful because of their glimmer of backstory.

Some of the actions the game says you can do with certain keys are not possible. Furthermore, the jumping and climbing as weird. Sometimes when you are trying to climb up a wall, you will just jump backwards. And when trying to jump off roofs, Ezio will stumble at the edge several times before you actually jump.

{"product_id": "201870", "page": 85, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-07-01", "text": "This game is an odd entry to this series. Not odd as in bad, but odd as in often quite different from previous entries but simultaneously repeating past mistakes. Often, sadly, lacking polish -- it seems like they didn't have time to properly finish this game.\nAs always, I will go through the different elements and parts of the game in a haphazard order.\nImmediately you'll notice Ezio looks quite different from the previous entry. He is much older, even though only 5 years have passed since Brotherhood. Besides the age, his whole facial structure is different and he has strangely hazel eyes. Not really anything to complain about, it just threw me off since he doesn't really even look like the same character.\nThey seem to be trying to go for the 'weary traveler in search of answers/far away from home' sort of character development with Ezio here. That works out okay. The story in this game is, at the very least, better than AC1, II, or Brotherhood -- not to say that is much of a standard.\nStyle-wise, we've departed from ACII/Brotherhood. Different UI, enemy types, textures to go along with the Constantinople/Masyaf setting.\nFor the music, Lorne Balfe is in charge as opposed to Jesper Kyd this time. He does a great job. The music has its own sound quite different from II or Brotherhood. It's some of the best music in the series. Dramatic and powerful pieces really help bring together the feel of the game -- Ezio's last adventure/searching for answers at the end of a journey.\nFor the gameplay, we still have chain kills and assassin initiates you can call on anytime. The game is still absurdly easy, though they made chain kills slightly harder by making the time you have to counter a little less and varying up enemy types -- some are harder to counter/might need to switch weapons. A small improvement, but not nearly enough.\nThey added a hookblade and ziplines and the game talks about these things as if they're really important. They aren't. Hookblade is a replacement for climb leap, and it looks really stupid compared to regular double blades. Ziplines just let you...move across rooftops slightly faster? I guess? Again, hardly makes any difference.\nThey added a bomb creation system that goes just too far in complexity for anyone to devote time or effort towards. I don't really mean that it is difficult or complicated to understand. I just mean that adding a system that allows for creation of different effects -- distraction, crowd dispersal, AoE attacks, crowd attraction -- should be WAY easier. I shouldn't have to craft that stuff, it should just always be on hand and easily refillable. Good idea, badly executed.\nThey added a castle defense minigame for your 'assassin dens' that indicate your control of the city -- like the Borgia towers of AC:B, except you have to defend these. The minigame isn't bad if you're on KB+M, though I know it's not great if you're on a controller. I'm one of those weirdos who plays AC with KB+M and prefers it. It's an okay minigame, but it just seems sort of thrown in there, and lacking any depth or reason to keep playing it.\nConstantinople is pretty and large. It is not quite as pretty as Brotherhood's Rome, partly because they decided to apply this gross smoky visual effect over the screen at all times. Besides that, a lot of the city is just colored brown and dark green, just sort of a splotchy vomit color.\nSo how is it beautiful then? The citizens, unlike AC1, II, and Brotherhood, actually have more routines and activities in the city. So, atmospherically, it is superior to the previous entries. In the other games, citizens walk around and gather in circles -- that's pretty much it. Here you will see vendors at their shops, fishermen actually fishing, beggars begging, and so on. The populace is lively and realistic, and it helps a lot in making Constantinople worth exploring and experiencing.\nFor side content, there is simply much less when compared to Brotherhood. It actually just seems like they didn't have time to finish many missions. There are 'thief contracts' -- but only two. This game has less of the focus on the three factions -- mercenaries, courtesans (Romanies), and thieves. Which is good, it was really odd how ACII/B were so fixated on them.\nSo the side content ends up being much less plentiful and it detracts from Constantinople -- just less stuff to do here. The lack of finish is a sad reminder of how they could make these games so much better if they would take their time and not rush them out yearly.\nThe story, as I said before, is at least better than the 3 previous entries in the series. There is much more structure, more explanation of Ezio's motives and reasoning for doing this or that, and things happen more naturally.\nEzio is looking for answers in Altair's vault, he needs five Masyaf keys, he must search for them in underground crypts and on the bodies of templars/byzantines. He writes to his sister, Claudia, frequently. His letters to his sister are used simply to remind the player of why Ezio is doing what he is doing, what his motivations are for continuing and what his thoughts on current events are. This is very helpful to the player and a huge improvement compared to the simply shoddy storytelling in the previous games.\nThe Masyaf keys let us play as Altair in memories that occur after the events of AC1. As I've explained at great length before, AC1 has bad storytelling, terrible voice-acting, and Altair is a stupid character. However, Revelations took this opportunity to make something decent out of Altair's story. He has a real voice actor who actually sounds Arabian/Middle-Eastern and his story has drama, loss, and death all complemented by Balfe's excellent soundtrack. Altair being able to invent and wield a gun in the 1200s, however, is a little silly -- the sci-fi crap doesn't excuse it.\nThe separate part of the storyline concerns the heir to the Ottoman throne, the Byzantine templars, and a pair of breasts  known as Sofia.\nThe player is sort of expected to believe that Sofia, a twenty-something book store owner, falls in love with fifty-something Ezio, because the developers wanted to give him a happy ending. Whatever, it's dumb but I expect it from these games.\nSomehow, the player is expected to care about the Ottoman story but I don't know why anyone would, the game even goes as far as to tell Ezio that it's none of his business by the end anyway.\nThey really enjoy bending history when it comes to the Ottomans v. Byzantines business. The Ottoman Empire was quite the utopia and the Byzantines quite oppressive and evil according to this game's revisionist history. These games always slip in highly modern viewpoints about fairness before the law and equal treatment that never really existed in the 1500s to appeal to moderns playing this game.\nDesmond is much less annoying because he's in a coma and trapped inside the animus with Subject 16. The first-person platforming sections that go into Desmond's past are just fine, nothing too bad. Worth going through. So that's something of a plus compared to the atrocious dialogue in II and Brotherhood between all the modern characters.\nStill, decent enough to be worth playing and having enough that it does better than the other AC games to be worth buying -- so, like Brotherhood, pick it up when it's cheap and go through it.", "hours": 44.8, "user_id": "76561198015641338", "username": "JUB JUB", "products": 215, "early_access": false}

This couldn't be better than this. In Assassin's Creed series, Ezio's trilogy is the most prodigious and astonishing. Like how Mentor Ezio's story started and ended. Revelations proves an eminent part of it's series. Allow me to share my thoughts on it\nStory is the momentous feature of this title. I can call this story with many names and nostalgic is one of them. Because the story has been extended with the memories of Legendary Altair. Altair's sequences let us know more about him and core of the story. Mostly about his beliefs, judgement and misery. But whole story is about Ezio's journey to find the hidden artifact of Altair. So Ezio goes through Altair's long lost memories. This is how Ezio finds himself in an immersive battle which is more darker than it looks. Even Ezio travels some ancient sights and meets few iconic persons who left marks in the history. So story is themed with ancient background and beliefs. I loved how one story made multiple conclusion of Ezio and Altair. Even both of them are perfect. Also through the story, Ezio finds his love. So there was some lovely moments along with emotional and humanizing moments. The whole story through, i couldn't expect how it's gonna end. It is immensely contingent. Altair's memories and Ezio's ambitions inflicted elusive perfection to the story. Still there are more to say about it.\nVisuals are great as you know this is almost 6 years old. So don't expect it to be something like astonishing. But you'll be satisfied with the visuals. About Characters, facial expressions and details are better than before. All the characters looks great. About environments, everything seemed really cool. They are improved than before as well. It's not that colorful but bit yellowish. Still great overall.\nGameplay is the most focused feature in this series after story. There are more skills and moves for fight. Also there are some new cinematic finishes when you counter kill any attacker which seems really cool. All the fighting interactions are perfected. You'll have an eminent experience in every combats. Some of the attackers are complex to eliminate like Janissaries. They are highly skilled and wise. So you'll find yourself in bit of trouble. About map and locations, you'll be able to explore a breathing city. Besides Istanbul, there'll be more locations to wander. All those crowds whenever you kill someone that's just intense. Makes situations more deep. Well the city is not that big like Syndicate but not even that concise. There are couple of tunnels for fast travelling. Even the city keeps you busy because there tons of collectibles. Like in game currency, bomb making incredients and many more things. Also you can play multiple side quests like memories of your allies around the city. So you would be very comfortable with it's gameplay.\nHave to say, Revelations has the superior background scores. Better than any other titles. All the soundtracks are perfectly matched with their given situations. Makes the whole experience more iconic and emotional. In other words, all musics of Revelations are incomparable.\nI have no problem with the performance. I'm playing on Intel Core i7 7700K, R9 390 STRIX and 6GB Ram. Getting absolute 60 FPS with highest settings. Tell you what, i didn't get any bugs, errors, crashes or stuttering till now.

To an extent the assassin\u2019s creed franchise has led this life and has overcome underwhelming launches, bad plotlines, and glitch-ridden release\u2019s, however this makes sense: what goes up must come down. Assassin\u2019s creed has gone on to become one of the most anticipated IP\u2019s however the core experience of assasiney fun is found at the peak of the franchise\u2026 Assassins creed revelations.\nAssassin\u2019s creed revelations was the fourth game in the franchise, final game in the Ezio trilogy. It does a lot of the norms of the franchise, with a large city to explore the novelty in this game is the Hook blade, and bombs. The hook blade allows you to make further jumps, to swing on zip wires or to use special moves on soldiers. And bombs allow you to well\u2026 bomb people in lots of different ways, using sound as a distraction or sulphur to gas the guards. Apart from this the game runs pretty closely to 2 and Brotherhood. And to an extent is more of the same but revelations does stand out as there are more mini-games/crafting/managing than in the previous two but also because it has (my opinion) better combat. It feels more fluid and certainly as more options.\nRevelations has a nice rounded plot that concludes both Altair and Ezio. Gameplay is fun but a little samey. If you were looking for a world where there is countryside then you should look elsewhere as Istanbul although large and well-designed is purely a city. Missions on the whole, are fun and there is lots of extra content in the way of factions and animus data fragments (they probably mean nothing to you but what they are, are units that you collect around the world you can use to unlock extra missions that you play as Desmond).\nSummary\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 7/10 nice at the time, but a little outdated now\nCombat: 9/10\nReplayability: 4/10\nSound: 6/10\nPlot: 7/10\nWorth a play today: 8/10\nFun: 9/10 the most fun I\u2019ve had with an assassins creed game.\nOverall: 8/10\nDefinitely worth a try today.

Basing on that, the title Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations is a suitable heading for the third and final instalment of Ezio Auditore da Firenze yet this time, it also tells the story of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad basically giving both of them the closing curtain call. However, if you want to ultimately see the final chapter, it\u2019s advisable to also see the short film Assassin's Creed: Embers. Nevertheless, even though it\u2019s the final chapter for both of these famous assassins, the game plays out the weakest of Ezio\u2019s trilogy and, unfortunately worse than the first Assassin\u2019s Creed game.\nThe franchise Assassin\u2019s Creed grew way too fast in popularity as shown during the past three games. The first had a decent storyline and approach whilst Assassin\u2019s Creed II added many more features that made Assassin\u2019s Creed I look like a tech demo. However, in Brotherhood, even though it\u2019s my favourite out of the four, starting to show cracks in the storyline thus using the \u2018band aid\u2019 approach, especially when playing the modern day characters with Desmond and those obnoxious kids. Seriously, it was so messed up, the game can do without them. However, this \u2018tradition\u2019 carried on into Revelations yet, this time, those kids played a minor role and thankfully, Desmond now has a backstory via the Animus Shards scattered throughout the map of Constantinople.\nRevelations, whilst not a bad game overall, is the game that needs to tie up loose ends from the previous Assassin\u2019s Creed games (including the DS / PSP ones). It looks like Assassin\u2019s Creed was getting way out of proportion with its storyline with plenty of \u2018WTF\u2019 moments near the end. It feels like Ubisoft have no idea where this franchise is heading too thus making this game the closing chapter and start fresh if another game was in production (for which it was, titled Assassin\u2019s Creed III). If you managed to get on hold of the Animus Edition, it comes with the Assassin's Creed Encyclopaedia explaining the history as best as they can. It\u2019s a worthwhile addition if you want to stitch up the potholes this game has created. I guess the game can be viewed as the scapegoat, the victim of its own success that had to be released to get some closure to this fantastic series.\nFull review here:\n7 / 10", "hours": 75.2, "username": "Azghouls", "products": 2058, "early_access": false}

I am genuinely impressed by how much this game has to offer. It is not so much a revolutionary improvement of the AC formula but instead a perfection of almost every single mechanic in the game. Since this is the fourth game in the series you can clearly tell that they have had a lot of time to improve and polish every detail of their now distinct form of combat, stealth, free-running and so on.\nAlthough the combat is still pretty much the same as in brotherhood the animations have been cleaned up and a lot of new ones added. This makes the combat feel very fluid and the addition of the hook-blade makes for some extremely awesome and brutal finishing moves. Even though this is still the same parry and counter based combat from the previous games, it has been polished to perfection and is the best the series has ever seen.\nThis game does a great job of tying up the stories of Ezio and Altair leaving you with a very satisfying conclusion and setting up for a new assassin in the next game. The storytelling mechanics that the game employs are superb and make use of inception like memories inside of memories. This is complemented by a less exiting but still interesting story about the sultans of Constantinople and their struggle for power. While this may not be as good as the conspiracies of the second game, it serves as a well fitting background for the main story of Desmond and Ezio.\nIn my honest opinion this is my favorite AC game so far and well worth your money.", "hours": 16.2, "user_id": "76561198109589421", "username": "Waffle Wizard", "products": 266, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "201870", "page": 98, "page_order": 7, "recommended": false, "date": "2015-04-22", "text": "This was quite a disappointing 28 hours all to the very end. This game took everything that Brotherhood established and made it many times worse. The storyline is very disjointed and much of what happens is poorly explained or simply does not make sense. The missions are also far fewer than in Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood. There are also only a couple side missions, compared to the dozens I completed in the previous titles. Even the city itself, the only one, is tiny. In a few minutes I am on the other side and there is nothing interesting going on on the way. The ending was the worst, but of course I won't spoil it here.\nThe gameplay is essentially the same as the previous game with the addition of zip lines, which are kinda cool, if you use them; situational events which happened to me only once in the course of the entire game and it was a dude who gave me 500 for moving a couple boxes; different enemies who act the same as in the previous titles, except for Janissaries who you can't kick, shove, hit or even counter as that hardly does anything. Another option is bombs, which is a nice addition but doesn't work for one simple reason.\nThe user interface has stayed the same, with some minor graphical additions. This is a huge problem. Why? Simply becaue there are four hot keys and that isn't even enough for the main weapons. There is a main weapon, a smaller blade, a hidden blade, poisoned hidden blade, fists, crossbow, throwing knives, three types of bombs equipped at once, poison darts, money and I feel like I might still be missing something. This leaves you awkwardly going through your giant selection in the middle of a fight just to choose the right tool. Another issue is that the assassin looks even less like an assassin. Ezio is so loaded with weapons and armour, he can't help but look suspicious. This was not the idea of the original game and as far as I know the stealth aspect is here still.\nAh yes graphichs. This is a game from 2011. I have seen absolutely wonderful graphical content in games from that time and two years later Tomb Raider came out which blew my brain out of my skull with how great everything looked at even medium. Revelations makes Constantinople look beautiful, but the characters look like manikins. There is hardly any life to them. They don't breathe, their hair is one blob plastered to their heads, the women's breasts never move, blood looks like a four year old's ketchup dream. I am glad they move somehow when they talk at least.\nLast category I wanted to touch on was stability. I have encounted numerous bugs.

There are \"revelations\" and boy are they exciting as hell. Some nice diologs, a couple of loveable characters, really important pieces about the past and the future.

The two most notable things i found were that there are two kinds of running, you hold down your right click to run, which is different but it works because if you want to actually climb up anything or jump onto something you have to also click space along with holding down your right click. This makes it so that my assassin doesnt just jump on a random box im running buy or decide to climb a wall when im just running buy it, its a perfect yet simple fix to a problem im STILL RUNNING INTO IN ROUGUE! How is it that a solution to this problem was found and not used in any creed after.\nThe other control based thing that sets this apart is that you have to subtly move your mouse to select the person you want to counter attack. In almost every other creed you press counter attack to win all fights, its easy, too easy for a game that boasts a good combat system, in revelations when im in a fight with 5 or 6 guys, its actually difficult to switch my selection and its incredibly satisfying to be able to select over the correct person and counter attack them.

A great story with the most charming of all the AC protagonists, returning to the setting that made the first Assassin's Creed so unique.\nPro's:\n- Great Story and Storytelling, has some of the greatest moments in the series.\n- New mechanics such as bombcrafting and a parachute and small advancements in managing your Brotherhood.\n- New setting with Constantinople and surrounding area including the good old Masiaf.\n- Costantinople is grand, colorful and busy. No grasslands and empty areas as in Rome.\n- Gameplay remains unchanged from Brotherhood, Ezio is still capable of murdering guards in style, even in his fifties.\n- Old Ezio is of all other games in the series the most likeable Protagonist. He is wise, calculated and badass, always teaching his fellow Assassins what he has learned throughout his life. But in his heart he has not changed, he is still a ladykiller and even as an old man he still flirts with a significantly younger woman. (SPOILER: Successfully!)\nCon's:\n- Not much new in terms of gameplay. If you don't care for the story it may not be worth it for you.\n- Uplay.\n- Ubisoft.\n- Desmond is suddenly black. How did that happen?\n- Credit scene cannot be skipped in case you want to continue playing after finishing the story.\n- Ubisoft.\nIf you really enjoy Ezio's story, this game will be a blast for you. If you are more of a mechanic and gameplay focused player, there isn't much new to Revelations that would excite you. Revelations scores with it's story, setting and atmosphere.\nIt finishes off Ezios story very well while shining a brighter light on Altair's life and how he influenced the Assassin order, how he fundamentally changed them to what we knew them as as Ezio. In completely optional puzzle sequences inside the Animus you can also learn more about Desmond and his early life, how he became a bartender instead of an Assassin. Overall in my opinion ot has the most exciting story and the most diverse way of telling it of all AC's. It has some epic and hilarious moments.

I went straight from AC:Brotherhood to revelations and was dying to know how it all wraps up. Ezio's journey from first becoming an assassin in ACII all the way to the end is incredible. He's a phenomenal character in gaming and should be up there with some of the greats. His character and personality shines through unwavering till the end. I felt like I was actually Ezio in all the various locations in which this game is set, having to follow his tale through to completion. If you have ACII - AC:Revelations, I highly suggest putting away some time to play this great trilogy. Whatever your thoughts on Ubisoft are, they nail these three games and should have just stopped there. (More on that later.)\nSO, combat is obviously a major part of the gameplay here, and since AC:B they refined it even more. The combos are even more satisfying when dealing with multiple enemies, the executions are even more gratuitous, and the connectivity between between targets is so much smoother. It really feels like you're total badass. It's awesome. With different weapons there's a big difference in how combos and executions are... executed. Timing is key, as heavy weapons vs daggers vs hidden blades vs bombs vs projectiles are all extremely varied in how one must play, and win a fight. Ezio's style also comes into play since introduction in ACII, as he's now an experienced killing machine in AC:Revelations. His smooth, graceful style from ACII by the end becomes an unstoppable force of blades and death dealing in his later years.\nAs usual, the voice acting is killer as well as the dialogue itself. These games, especially AC:R are so meticulously scripted it actually feels like these are real people behaving as people do. 10/10 for all that. Also the random NPC's interactions while running through the streets or climbing buildings are spot on and really ad to the overall ambiance of the game.\nOK, on to the annoying stuff. Every time you renovate a shop, you're stuck there for about 10-15 seconds while the building animation happens. Since there are about 150 shops, there's a lot of renovating to be had. There's also a LOT of unnecessary animations just to press ESC or TAB to view the map. I'd say a good 2 hours from my play time in AC:R is just animations from renovating a shop or viewing the map animations. Also every time you interact with pretty much anything there's some kind of cut scene. Even if it's just a few seconds can be annoying after you've seen it 30+ times. Such as: using a pidgeon coop, bomb box, ANY shop, storyline door, ANY door, loot chest, loot body, picking up a body, fast travel, assassin dens and a quite a few others.

This interation of the game brings many new things to the table. There are many new different types of mission that keeps the player entertained. The many new toys that are given to the assassin makes each encounter different. My personal favorite is my trusty crossbow, but the grenades do a fabulous job when area damage is needed for a swarm of enemies.

The first thing I noticed was the lazy console porting in terms of controls - the menus etc could be far more elegant and easy to navigate if optimised for PC - but that was to be expected.\nThe gameplay wasn't exactly a huge departure from Brotherhood, with only minor tweaks compared to the changes made in previous titles. The new gameplay elements are mostly to do with the new hook blade and explosives, that latter of which I hardly used, if I'm honest. The tower defence-esque segments where the Templars attack your hideouts seemed a bit clunky, but in my 30 hours of playthrough such an event only happened once anyway as I was never short of funds to pay off heralds and thus spent very little time 'in the red'. I assume it was intended to feel like your assassin allies were constantly under pressure and relying on you to run around the city fighting off Templar attempts to retake your dens, but in practice it really didn't seem to matter much.\nThe graphics were consistently excellent, as you'd expect from a Ubisoft game. I found the setting of Constantinople well-executed, believable and fun to explore but somehow less compelling and aesthetically engaging than the Renaissance and Medieval environments of the earlier AC games.\nThe storyline of the AC series continues to be the main draw for me. It is consistently engaging and well-written, with believable characters who you really grow to care about. It was a pleasure to see Ezio mature into a wise old fox, a striking contrast to the headstrong young ladies' man we were first introduced to in ACII. The weaving in of Altair's story, leading to an eventual conclusion of both his and Ezio's tales at the end of the game, was well done and kept my interest piqued throughout. I think I'll miss Ezio and I hope he will maybe make an appearance at some stage in AC3, which I've just started playing today.\nIn conclusion, if you have enjoyed the series up to this stage I'm sure you know what it's all about and don't really need to read reviews before you give this game a shot!

Overall, this game is better than 3 in a few areas but 3 has better control and combat. But what makes this game so unforgettable and so pleasing to look at is its combination middle eastern/Victorian setting. The graphics are stunning and even more pleasing to look at than AC3. The character models are just as good as both AC3 and 4. The presentation value is astounding and there are a lot more objects and details than there are in AC3. The combination of dulled bright pastels with dusty and sandy overtones give the game a remarkable and unforgettable world. Two things this game does better than AC3: more non-linear in comparison and better presentation (although 3 still looks awesome).\nThere are two main reasons why I like this game over 3. Ezio is imo the best main character yet in a AC game, and this game takes place exclusively in a giant city with limitless parkouring opportunities and is heavily populated by people everywhere. It means you have more paths to complete objectives and to move around the game, or at least much more parkouring opportunities. In 3 you are going to spend some time in the wide-open wilderness and even the cities are much more wide-open than this game. I prefer to have this game's giant tightly quartered city at my disposal.\nThere are a couple of problems that this game has that I wish it could have done much better on. The controls are not as tight as thery are in later games, but they are close because AC controls are sometimes hit and miss. Sometimes you will parkour onto things you did not want to, and sometimes you will jump to or down from places that you did not want to. Combat however is smooth and easy. The other problem is optimization. It is no surprise and is a common issue with all of Ubisoft's games because they are, far and away, the all-time undisputed kings of bad console ports. Their ports are so bad that I stopped buying their games years ago. I have kept following their progress though and they are still making horrible ports. They will probably never learn. Anyway, the problem with this game is that while it runs at a smooth 60fps, there is constant stutter-locking, common in a lot of bad Ubisoft ports.\nDespite the flaws this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen, even despite its age.\nGame 8.5/10, Port job: 5/10 Go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 yourselves Ubisoft.

While both of these things are factual things the game actually delievers on, ultimately the entry comes up short in many other aspects.\nThe story picks up many years after the events of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, with the fall of the Cesare Borgias and with Assassin Master/Superspy Ezio Auditore hiding the Apple of Eden for Desmond to find in the future.  Four years later, Ezio finds one of five keys needed to unlock Altar's Library, sending him on a search for the rest in a tumultuous and violent Constantinople. While a solid (and very video gamey) set-up, what follows is unfortuantely shapeless and uninteresting, often hitting similar story and character beats from the previous two Assassin's Creed II games. Not to mention the Desmond timeline, which is padded out and only serves to set up conflict for the third game, without really saying much about Desmond or the supporting cast at all.\nThe gameplay is bog standard Assassin's Creed. If one is unfamiliar with that, imagine trying to climb slowly up similar looking buildings and running around on rooftops avoiding guards with an increasingly convoluted and bloated set up moves that requires holding down one button in order access half of your movement abilities. One should also not expect stealth mechanics, becaue they are practically nonexistant. One must hide in shrubs and wagons and wells in order to avoid guard detection, but outside of a few areas in the game (in which a forced reset on being spot is used), combat is generally the best option. However, if one is expecting a deep weapons based combat system, prepare to be dissapointed by a system that is designed entirely around countering your enemies attacks. That's it. One simply counters attacks in order to be successful at combat.\nRevelations (as generic a subtitle as one can think of) is a victim of publishing tactic called Annual Release, in which a successful franchise is produced on a yearly schedule, often using the same art assists and minor gameplay additions, often leading to contrived plots and half baked gameplay mechanics. In this case there are two new mechanics: the first are through the form of bombs, in which Ezio can craft a multitude of them, only a handful of which are of any good use. The second is through a rather annoying tower defense mini game which appears if you're in too high of alert for too long of time. Fortunately, it's rather easy to avoid this mini game and a player only has to ever do it once, unless they don't pay enough attention to their alert status. It's also telling that neither of these mechanics or minigames found themselves in sequels.\nUnfortunately the game does end in a rather satisfying way, so if you have played every Assassin's Creed up to Revelations, it is worth playing through on that merit (but only if it's heavily discounted).

It's a nice puzzle mission but it is way too simple.\nMy overall opinion: While this is a decent addition to the franchise, this game was an obvious attempt to milk money out of loyal fans.

Note that I wrote \"good\" instead of \"great\" or \"awesome\". It has great potential, but it doesn't develop very well throughout the main plot.\nWhen buying this, expect to be entertained only by the story missions. Not having what to do except to follow the linearity of the game is a bit frustrating.\nUnlike 2 or Brotherhood, this installment isn't as long or extensive, in terms of gameplay time or maps. One has enough money, by the end, only to rebuild about 70% buildings and buy about 70% of what shops offer.\nThe title's setting is Constantinople, which is big indeed, but the whole game is restricted to that ares, except for a few missions which take you to Masyaf or Capadoccia, which are small and not fully explorable, by the way. For movementation, the lack of horses on the city is another downside, as it could be a time saver and more interesting than the fast-travel system for many trips.\nOn the other hand, Revelations earns new gameplay refinements. The addition of bomb-crafting and using definitely makes for a better experience. There is also the new hookblade, which replaces your secondary hidden blade to make climbing easier, faster and more practical.\nStory-wise, it wraps-up Ezio Auditore's story in an interesting way. That is why one should first play Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood to know the main character better and have a better experience.\nOverall, I'd recommend Revelations in case one likes the Assassin's Creed series, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by the amount of content or excitement the assignments bring.", "hours": 43.2, "username": "O verdadeiro X-GOD", "products": 163, "early_access": false}

Some are for good, some for evil. The setting in Konstantinopel is refreshing, but much after a few hours running through it you do get bored at the rather repetitive environment. You just don't care about learning the map by heart, compared to the experience in Assassin's Creed II & Brotherhood. The minimap is rather limited as you very often pass by points of interest because it is so small.\nThe hookblade is one of my favourites. When I encountered it I thought to myself; \"why wasn't this in the previous games?\". It's uses are many, and it's fun to get creative. The combat system is pretty much the same as always, but it lacks something, something from its prequel. Everything is just too simple. If I'm surrounded by 7 enemies then they should attack me, not stand around waiting for me to kill them one by one. The addition of bombs are really helpful at any given time. Customization is a love-interest of mine, making this great. The bombs seem to reflect the player, and with great accuracy.\nThe storyline is very interesting. The story of Ezio is awesome, and Alta\u00efr as well. Desmond is more of a question mark though. His background story is... enlightening, but the \"maps\" are a bit hard at some points which seems rather strange.   The story does however feel like a dissapointment. It is too short. I know that I play games too much, but this ended rather quickly. And since the gigantic cliffhanger left behind from Brotherhood, Revelations feel like either a sidenote or mistake. The end was very pleasing and somewhat epic in Ezio's story, but I want more. No spoilers, but it felt rather epic when Ezio and Alta\u00efr were together.\nTo sum up: the storyline of the game is short, unmotivated, teasing and at some times even infuriating. The inventory of weapons and tools gives you a wide range of possibilities, but together with a dumb AI the entire combat system has become too easy. Still, it gives you the liberty of playing the game the way you want to, as you can use this arsenal either to distract hostiles, kill them, ghost etc. The setting is too big, too repetitive and one-sided. This game may be a must-be in a gamers life, but it is in many ways dissapointing. If I want to powergame anything from the series, it would either be Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood, not this.\nStill, this IS Assassin's Creed.

This game brings closure to Ezio's story and provides a smooth transition into the next game. Desmond is given more story and there are optional levels where you can learn more about his life by solving puzzles.\nRevelations takes Ezio back to the route of Assassin's Creed and has him follow the trail Marco Polo has left for him in Istanbul. At the end of each memory sequence there is an Altair memory which reviells the events following the first game.\nAs well as updated graphics and mechanics, this game introduces the hook blade used for moving quickly though the districts but also intresting and original combat tactics. The use of bombs has also been expanded creating unique solutions to large patrols of guards. Ezio can distract guards by creating divertions, frighten them by filling the bombs with lambs blood, or simply blow them up!\nAs in the previous two games the notoriety system adds a level of caution to the game steering the player to use tactics and stealth, rather than brute force to resolve confrontations.

If you're looking for a great conclusion to the Ezio story, then you will love this game. If you haven't played Assassin's Creed before and are looking to get into the game, don't go for this one first. You'll be wondering what is going on for much of it. Try the original Assassin's Creed or Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.\nStory:\nEzio - spends most of his time in Constantinople, looking for the keys to the Masiyaf library. Along the way he'll tangle in local politics, romance a charming woman, and of course climb and sneak around looking for all those hidden loot caches.\nDesmond - he is put into the Animus by a certain someone (no spoilers) to prevent the onset of madness after the events at the conclusion of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. He needs to untangle the strands of his mind (reaching a \"sync nexus\") to be certain of his sanity before returning to the real world.\nSetting: Constantinople (Istanbul). The city looks glorious. Ubisoft clearly spent a lot of time on the look and feel of the city, and this is arguably one of the greatest successes of Revelations. There are also numerous caves to climb / explore, as well as a wonderfully atmospheric excursion to an underground settlement.\nGameplay: If you've played Brotherhood, you know what to expect. Combat is nearly unchanged. Store renovations are everywhere. Recruiting new Assassins is unchanged. There is a new \"tower defense\" mini-game. Seize Templar towers (a la the Borgia towers from Brotherhood); but if you acquire enough notoriety, the Templars can take them back. Sounds good on paper, but unless you are just completely careless (or don't care about notoriety), you'll rarely see this mini-game after the tutorial. For moving about the city, the \"hook blade\" has been added, basically allowing you to zip-line all over the city. It works well (and is required for the completion of several timed missions), but the zip-lines only work in one direction, limiting their usefulness. There's bomb crafting, which is useful in some situations, but isn't required. And - that's about it.\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations is the perfect conclusion to the Ezio triology, but it would be a mistake to think of it only interms of Ezio. To get the full impact, you need to not only have played the first (original) Assassin's Creed, but have also engaged with it on an emotional level. Then, having played through Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood, you start Revelations with a return to Masiyaf. This is a great moment that had a lot of impact for me. Also memorable were several flashback scenes where you play as Altair once again. Even if these sequences weren't tied into the narrative, they would still be fun. But they are. The story of AC: Revelations is arguably the strongest of the entire series, as it effortlessly weaves three narratives - Desmond, Ezio and Altair - into a complicated tapestry that makes absolute and complete sense. And the final conclusion - which I won't spoil - truly contains revelations of the highest order. I could not imagine a more satisfying ending to the Ezio Auditore trilogy, who IMO is one of the best characters ever created in any media.\nMultiplayer is pretty much dead, making The Ancestors Character Pack and the Mediterranean Traveler Map Pack moot and near-pointless DLC. The Lost Archive DLC, however, is essential. Maybe the game-play time is short (2-4 hours), but story-wise it focuses entirely on Subject 16 and his story of betrayal and madness.", "hours": 62.4, "username": "AbedsBrother", "products": 834, "early_access": false}

Aside for few small differences it is same as Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed 2... It is really good, I like Assassin's Creed, it makes you look powerful and badass... The city itself is beautifully designed and atmosphere is fantastic...\nCombat is usually too easy, as you might expect, but can also be frustrating against tougher opponents that dodge your every move... But, as I said, something you might expect from AssCreed game...\nEverything said, gameplay is great... If you like other games in the series, you'll like this one...\nSo, why the \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"...\nFirst, I KNOW that it is a somewhat \"fantasy\" game, I KNOW that it is \"made by people of various religions and beliefs\", I KNOW that it is just the game... But, as stated numerous times on the interwebz, people like it, people play it, and people learn about historical figures and facts from it...\nSo, we clarified that; This game... It insults common sense with its \"historical\" story... And not only that, it also straight forward writes false historical facts (e.g. in database you can read that Constantine the Great forced Christianity on the citizens of the Empire... Why would he do that?! He, himself was not a Christian for almost his entire life... He was baptized on his death bed...). It is just an example, many facts, not important for the story (such as one, written above), were absolutely wrong... Why?! So the Christians would look bad? And Ottomans would look like nice guys, liberating the good people of the Empire... Byzantine empire (also, Roman empire, not Byzantine... The term Byzantine Empire was not used in it's period, neither was it used during the time the game takes place, but it is not important mistake) was multiethnic, and somewhat multicultural empire where barbaric peasant boys grew up to become Emperors... Through ambition and bloody struggle... So, you are telling me about racism and hate for other ethnicities and races in it... And all that, before Ottomans came, liberated the city and allowed everyone to live in it, happy and free... It is absolutely preposterous... And insulting... Especially for Greeks... Every Greek I met so far in the game is bad guy... They are all Byzantines... And, yes, I know they are templars, but they are frequently called Byzantines... More frequently than Templars, actually... And the game openly speaks very bad about Constantine XI, who is national hero in Greece, and saint for some Orthodox christians...\nAnd, as you can see, I played a game for few hours... And I plan on finishing it... So, lets see the story to the end... But I am not planning on recommending a game where Palaiologos are main antagonists in fight against the Ottomans...\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u1f72 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03b2\u03bf\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\nYeah, thanks for reading...", "hours": 11.9, "username": "Balder", "products": 1183, "early_access": false}

Many good aspects saved the bad ones for me. Namely, this game feels very much like a \"forced-filler\". Granted, Ubisoft had their plans for the Ezio Auditore character and I can respect that. But at least, Ubisoft has done a fantastic job for Ezio's conclusion of its trilogy.\nSo now Ezio wants to uncover the secrets left in Massyaf library by Alta\u00efr but he can't access it. So he has to go over Constantinople, trying to find the keys left there, on purpose.\nPROS:\n+Story takes a while to begin, but contain a really good conclusion for my favorite character, Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad.\n+Emotionally fulfilling ending for Ezio Auditore.\n+Soundtrack as good as previous AC games. It is a shame Jesper Kyd won't return for the other AC games.\n+Gameplay mechanic got refined in most areas. Hook-blade is a great new addition so were the bombs crafting.\n+Cities are still great to explore.\n+Solid visuals.\n+Brotherhood recruitment is refined. You now have missions to promote an assassin to a den leader.\n+Multiplayer got much improved, even if I barely played it. I do like the way they're made as a Templar's training grounds.\nCONS:\n-Uplay DRM. I had trouble activating my Deluxe and DLC contents on Uplay since these addons aren't activatable on Uplay but    IN THE GAME itself. And if you try to activate contents on Uplay often, you get a temporary ban... irritating!\n-Gamebreaking bug met during the 'Setting Sail' mission. Had to restart the game many times.\n-AC formula has grown old. I could feel the AC fatigue in this game.\n-Main story with Desmond Miles in Revelation is the weakest of the AC games.\n-The mini-game for sending your assassins in other cities is quite pointless, especially once they're all high level, this mini-game becomes pointless because the Templars always miraculously reclaim the claimed cities of your assassins.\n-Tower defense mode. Sure they're a new mechanic of the game but not because you make new stuff makes it good.\n-Desmond sections are very bland. First-person puzzling. Boring, too long for so little revelation. You better watch Youtube videos or read AC Wikia instead!\n-Poor pacing. Slow start... very slow progression... then once you reach the near-end sequence, it is a non-stop \"end-mission\".\n-Very little that's actually new\n-No horseback riding.\n-The Lost Archive DLC is quite pointless. It is an interesting backstory of Subject 16 but you gotta cope with the annoying bland First-person puzzle platformer. Better watch Youtube videos or read AC Wikia instead!\nOVERALL:\nSomehow, my least liked AC game of the franchise, so far, since I haven't completed AC 3 and AC 4 yet. But this one feels very much like a flushed out filler, a game that wasn't really needed. The story of Ezio got to end properly and a good service for Ezio's fans. But I could realy feel the AC fatigue in Revelations, especially on the Desmond Miles main story. It was very bland and its First-person puzzle platformer was quite boring. It's not hard, just too long for the few little \"secrets\" that gets revealed. Just watch Youtube videos or read AC Revelations Wikia instead!\nRECOMMENDATION:\nIf you had managed to play AC 1 till AC: Brotherhood, yes, you must play AC: Revelations. The conclusion for Alta\u00efr was my main appeal since not only it was well done, but actually made sense with Ezio's story too. If you're a newcomer to the AC franchise, well you're not in the right place to start playing here, with Revelations. You'll feel quite lost on the whole saga. The story is quite important and you either better play the previous games or get informed on the main events of the other games.\nRATING:\n7.5 / 10\nMaybe someday, we'll be able to play as a Templar, single player speaking? That is my greatest wish for this franchise! Or heck, make another IP and focus on the Templar side of story! I'd love that very much Ubisoft!\nAnd now, to continue my AC marathon with AC 3...", "hours": 21.0, "username": "LIKEUCARE", "products": 1534, "early_access": false}

When I found out that in this game, Ezio tasked himself on another hunting quest, I thought, \"Again?\" The freshness of Ezio's adventures was gone and the Ubisoft team should have stopped while Ezio was still on top. Adding new weapons to your arsenal was not enough to keep me interested, and I actually found myself dreading the need to invest in city businesses and to train assassins all over again.\nThe pacing of the game was off-putting as well, with the Den Defense minigame to be most annoying.

This title concludes Ezio's story from AC2 and AC: Brotherhood, so you will probably like this story if you liked the story from those titles. The voice acting and dialog are very good in my opinion. None of the characters stood out as particularily annoying either. There is also some optional extra story related to Desmond's past leading up to the first AC title that is unlocked by collecting DNA fragments while playing as Ezio. I found the story to be somewhat interesting, but it wasn't worth dealing with the awkward first person perspective game play.\nIf you play games for the game play mechanics and like the game play mechanics of the previous Assassin's Creed titles, then you will probably like this title. The controls are still a little awkward. I often found that Ezio trying climb walls unintentionally when all I wanted him to do was run straight. Bombs were added along with the ability to craft them. Ingredients for them are found all over the place in chests, looted from enemies or purchased from vendors. I found these to be pretty useful during my playthrough, and they offered some variety to the combat.\nThe hookblade was added which allows Ezio to climb faster, use ziplines and perform some new combat moves. While climbing up a wall in the previous titles, the player could jump up and grab a ledge that was slightly out of reach. The hookblade essentially just removes the need to press another button in order to grab onto that ledge after jumping. Ziplines are randomly placed over the city rooftops, but I found that I rarely used them during my playthrough as they usually didn't go in the direction I was heading. The hookblade can also be used during combat to do a \"hook and run\" (Ezio rolls over the back of an enemy and keeps on running), \"hook and throw\" (Ezio rolls over the back of an enemy and throws him to the ground) and \"counter steal\" (Ezio hooks the pocket where the enemy's coin purse is and jacks it). The only time I ever used these moves during my playthrough was to complete the challenges associated with them.\nThis title also has a number of challenges associated with the assassins, the mercenary guild, theives guild, the romanis and bombs. Most of the challenges are relatively easy to complete (Call assassins in during combat 25 times, Distract guards with romanis 15 times, Perform a hook and throw 10 times, etc), but a couple of them are quite frustrating (Perform a counter kill streak of at least five 10 times). I completed all of these challenges, but I had to look up how to complete some of them on the internet. Completing groups of challenges will unlock perks associated with each faction (faction weapons, reduced faction hiring cost, faster \"call assassin\" recharge, etc). I found completing these challenges to be mostly worthwhile.\nThere is a metagame called \"Mediterranean Defense\" that is basically used as the main way to level up your assassins. The player selects a city, then a mission in that city, and finally assigns one or more assassins to that mission. Money, assassin XP and a percentage of control over the city are awarded at completion. The player can also assign assassins to each city which can then be used to complete missions without using the ones alotted for the \"call assassins\" ability. Each \"day\" (every 20 minutes of active game time not spent in any menus) money, assassin xp (for stationed assassins) and bomb ingredients are awarded for each city the player has control over. However, a random percentage of assassin control is also subtracted from each city. If a percentage of assassin control reaches zero, templars will lay siege on that city. If the player doesn't complete a special mission with a day, control over the city and all assassins assigned to that city will be lost.\nSomething else to note is that there are two optional parts of the game with completely different game play mechanics. The first is the \"Desmond's Journey\" sequences that are unlocked as the player collects certain numbers of DNA fragments while playing as Ezio, and the other is the main story content for \"The Lost Archive\" DLC. The game play for these sections is in first person perspective, and the player must overcome puzzles by placing different shaped platforms to walk across. It vaguely reminded me of Portal without the gun. I found the game play for these parts to be awkward, frustrating and completely out of place in an AC title.\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with this title. However, there was one thing in particular that annoyed me: the \"Mediterranean Defense\" metagame.

A hefty promise, but the real question is, will it succeed?\nIt\u00b4s no easy task to juggle three main characters at once, but Ubisoft has done a remarkable, if incomplete, job. There\u00b4s no denying that Ezio and Altair\u00b4s portions are handled extremely well, providing insight into both of the character\u00b4s final days as the emblematic assassins they are, and getting to know what happened after the credits rolled in the first game of the series is an absolute delight, but the same sadly can\u00b4t be said for Desmond\u00b4s sections. Although its evident that the developers tried to take a different aproach to the familiar gameplay by giving it a first person treatment, the final product comes out as uninspiring and dull.  Nevertheless, the overall storyline more than makes up for it, and rounds up these characters on a high note.\nFortunately, Ubisoft made absolutely no mistakes with regards to the audiovisual style, maintaining the excellent values proposed by both ACII and Brotherhood, and manages to set the bar even higher with sharper details and fantastic voice acting. The beautiful city of Constantinople takes center stage, a breath of fresh air just when Italy was beginning to feel a little stale at the end of the previous entry in the series, and cements the franchise\u00b4s reputation as one of the most stunning ones around.\nThe gameplay aspect remains almost untouched compared to Ezio\u00b4s other adventures, but giving that it was superb in most of its aspects, that doesn\u00b4t really count as a negative, although a little more innovation wouldn\u00b4t harm, either. Notable additions to the formula include the trusty hookblade, which allows you to extend your reach and prevents you from falling to your death (a regular in the series), an improved use of bombs which range from lethal to tactical and sneaky, and the ability to defend your captured dens via a tower-defense-like minigame which feels like un unnecesary step in the wrong direction, even though it can be fun the first few times.\nThe multiplayer portion first introduced in Brotherhood makes a return, and even though it sports a few new flashy additions, doesn\u00b4t provide enough content to keep you away from more complete online experiences for long. It\u00b4s a nice complement to the main adventure for sure, but one which, if given a little more polish, would have been up there with the genre giants.\nOverall, the game is a considerable leap from the previous title, which felt rather disappointing and \"safe\", and does enough things right to distance itself from it and stand high among the franchise\u00b4s best offerings, surpassed only by the magnificent Assassin\u00b4s Creed II.  It can only get better from here...\nPros:\n+ Beautiful open world crammed with things to do\n+ Breathtaking visual and audio design\n+ Engaging plot which overarchs two of the most loveable characters in gaming and brings them together like never before\n+ Long, varied campaign which tosses you in a variety of engaging scenarios\nCons:\n- Uninspired Desmond sections\n- Engaging, yet short-lived multiplayer component\n- Feels  somehow similar to previous entries\n- No more Ezio and Altair :(\nConclusion: A fascinating adventure which closes the lid on one of the most gripping stories of modern gaming, Assassin\u00b4s Creed Revelations grabs hold of you and doesn\u00b4t let go until you have seen everything it has to offer, and believe me, that is going to take some time, my friend.\nGrade: 9.1 (Amazing)", "hours": 27.4, "username": "JumpSh0t", "products": 159, "early_access": false}

In some situation you have just the impression that it's all a repetition of what happened in Rome.\nFrom a gameplay point of view, I found some improvements very interesting, other simply terrible. I liked very much all the \"city conquest\" feature, and also the \"siege\" parts. Also the bomb vrafting was interesting, and the new moves, like the use of ziplines. What i really didn't like were the \"animus\" sessions, that were in most cases just boring (from a gameplay point of view, whilst they gave some interesting insights about the story) or even annoying. It was a pain for me getting all the achievements, the \"impress Warren Vidic\" in particular was a nightmare.\nThe multyplayer section is enjoyable. Personally the only game mode I like enough is the deathmach, finding the other ones mildly boring, especially at this stage, with 2 chapters went out after ACR, with the volume of player restricted only to some hardcore gamers.\nOverall, this game is a must play only for the fans of the saga (that I am!), while new player should probably start from the first chapter, or even (as I read in the reviews) jump directly to the Black Flag chapter.", "hours": 332.3, "username": "Daiquiriism", "products": 213, "early_access": false}

Again.\nAt this point in the series, you know exactly what you're getting into. The basic gameplay has remained unchanged from the previous game, and the only new gameplay hooks are completely superflous. Bombs are largely useless, except in really specfic situations; the Tower Defence-styled \"Den Defending\" is not only boring and frusting, but you're likely to not even see it (I had to actually try and get my Infamy up just to see them), and the Hookblade just basically changes your combat and climbing animations, and not much else.\nSo why am I recommending it? Because at its heart, the gameplay still just works. Combat is shallow but cool looking, the world is graphically beautiful (even if Istanbul is far less colourful than Rome and Italy), the full syncronization goals still add great replay value, and fans of the series will definitely want to see the wrapping up of Altair's story. The actual ending to Ezio's story however, is reserved for the Ubisoft-produced film short, \"Assassin's Creed: Embers\", so make sure to give that a look when you're done the game.\nAlso of note is the incredible \"Desmond's Memories\" minigame, which is a first person puzzle-platformer where you assemble and place blocks to traverse surrealistic Animus worlds as you find out about Desmond's life before becoming an Assassin. \"The Lost Archive\" DLC consists entirely of new puzzles and story in this style, and for that reason alone, the DLC is highly recommended. The gameplay in this supposed minigames not only outclasses the main Assassin's Creed gamplay, but with a bit more depth, would easily stand as its own game.", "hours": 76.6, "user_id": "76561198039936102", "username": "Sor Eddie", "products": 793, "early_access": false}

I mean it's kind of hard to top going after the Pope and the Borgia family. I was so frightened about this problem that I actually delayed myself playing it for a very long time.\nI can say, however, that this game did very well.

While this game doesn't quite meet the high-stakes assassinations of previous games, it does plenty of new things that come in to replace them, and most important, makes them feel very natural.\nNow I won't spoil anything, but some of the setpoints are very fun. Some of the side dungeon-like crawls are especially fun and make for excellent game play where you feel as though you are a real assassin having to fight time and perils, compared to the idiot who bumps into everyone while running.\nAs far as plot, some of it's pretty good.

You get to say: \"Goodbye Ezio\". Which. You get to play as him ONE LAST TIME, before inevitably saying goodbye to the most timeless and compelling character in all of Video Game history (my opinion). Though this game DOES wrap up the story arc oriented around The Apple Of Eden, to me, \"Goodbye Ezio\" is the thing that truly stands out.\nThough this game can be sumarized in two words, it's just as amazing as any game in the series (pardoning AC3... what a disapointment).", "hours": 42.7, "user_id": "76561197983915759", "username": "Orphanlast", "products": 65, "early_access": false}

One of the highlights about this game is you get to know more about Altair from the first game.\nLike all Assassin's Creed this one is no different about telling a good story. Like the previous AC installment there is a lot of things to along the way like additional missions to the main, etc.\nA good improvement are graphics and how the everything looks (going from the world to the character models); you should be able to find a lot of detail through all the game. As the previous games the music is and it keep being really good and it fits perfectly to what happens.\nA clearly great improvement to this game was the multiplayer which was improve in good ways compared to the previous, which of course introduces new modes to play, which feels fresh in the PVP multiplayer world, not the classic run with your gun and shoot everything moving kinda multiplayer; is all about style and how you eliminate your targets. Lots and lots of rewards, challenges and even more context to the Templars background.\nAlso, if you got the Lost Archives DLC you will be able to know more details about Desmond's story, like what his past was and some other stuff; this may add some context if you want to know more about the characters; I'll say it will be like an hour or hour and a half of extra content.\nBottom line, if you like the Assassin's Creed series, this one will probably be something you like; so, what are you waiting for? get that hidden blade a target and go for it!...", "hours": 43.4, "username": ".: D :.", "products": 227, "early_access": false}

You now assume Ezio in his early 50's as he heads to Masyaf to find the hidden \"keys\" that will unlock Altair's libary and awaken it's hidden secrets. The templars are also after the keys and after Ezio fights one of the captains and takes a journal that belonged to Niccolo Polo he must head to Constantinople, find the other keys, and stop the templars before they can use the knowledge for their own gains. The story here was honestely the worst for Ezio, he felt like a mentor to the other characters and didn't really put in much of a impact in this game but I understand because this is Ezio's final game and it portray's both his final struggles and his somewhat tiredness towards his own brotherhood.7.1/10\nGRAPHICS: The graphics are the best out of Ezio's trilogy enough said.9.5/10\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay was way WAY less difficult than AC:B was, you could buy all the stuff without going through some stupid fetch quest for it, the full sync was better, and it only frustrated me once.Simple as that.8/10\nCONCLUSION: This was a fine way to end Ezio & Altair's story but it should've been stronger like AC:B was at least, but Ubisoft still tried their best with gameplay and a hookblade, GO HOOKBLADE!\nBUY RANK:1-2 (Pretty good price so far, you should buy it now or wait till a sale.

Beware of a few plotholes and contradictions though, as well as a few bugs scattered throughout.\nThe economy system is present once more, allowing you to revitalize Constantinople by opening shops, buying monuments and installing assassin dens throughout. The (by the end of the game) huge amounts of income this generates allow you to purchase a variety of nifty items and of course more of the above. New gameplay elements including the hookblade and craftable bombs allow the player to have more fun in the cities.\nSadly enough there are also a lot of downsides to the game, the world is smaller, with most of the action taking place in Contantinople. There are also fewer things to do with the factions, they're basically tools to use rather than that they feel... thought out, vibrant or whatever.

In that case, you know what to expect from AC: Revelations. Fortunately for us, Ubisoft realized this and is very quick to drop you into the action with minimal opening tutorials and hand holding. This way the game dug its hooks in quick and held me throughout the roughly 30 hours it took to get 100% synchronization.\nBoth of the new cities, Constantinople and Cappadocia, are a joy to explore and move through, befitting of the signature feature of the series. In the opening cinematic as you first step into Cappadocia I definitely had a stop and stare \u201cwhoa\u201d moment. These cities become more than places but characters in the story that you get to know more of as you play.\nWithout spoiling anything, I was pleased with most of the new characters as well as how they handled the old ones, particularly in wrapping up Ezio and Alta\u00efr\u2019s sagas. I would have liked to have seen some of the villains fleshed out more. There were several that we don\u2019t see enough of to avoid feeling like they\u2019re one dimensional characters there just to fulfill a checklist that says a boss fight is needed. The voice acting and Jesper Kyd\u2019s soundtrack are high quality, as usual. The interactions involving Ezio and one of the new characters, Sofia, are among the high points of the writing and acting. I was also pleasantly surprised with the telling of Desmond\u2019s story, despite that portion\u2019s odd gameplay.\nThere are some unique features in this game that create a couple minor stumbling points. The most notable is the first person Desmond sections that I just mentioned. I wouldn\u2019t call these a complete failure though. In fact, I expected far worse considering some of what I had heard about them. Some of these areas are visually stunning and the soundtrack caught my ear a couple times. It\u2019s the first person view and simplistic gameplay that drag them down. For whatever reason there is also a tower defense type minigame that isn\u2019t good enough to deserve a place in the game. If you\u2019re careful with your notoriety status in the regular game you shouldn\u2019t have to do this often, I only ever did it twice.\nWhile I only spent 2 hours playing multiplayer, I enjoyed the time. It certainly is a different experience and takes a different mindset to play against other people.

Also, Istanbul and Cappadocia are marvelous locations and are fun to explore. Unfortunately, the drawbacks are probably too big. Storyline starts interesting, but then gets very predictible and not very... revealing. And if you like Altair, then you would probably not like scenes with him and ending at all. The whole ending sequence is just very dull and unimaginative. The whole game just feels like it was built on something great, but actually managed to turn it into something boring. Also, just a warning: Ezio's face looks very very very old and Desmond's face looks nothing like Desmond. I also played AC3 and I must say, both those games have issues with faces, which just look very altered and unfamiliar.

I really like the decision to give Altair a final conclusion and make it playable. It adds depth to the story and to the lore when you connect these two characters, centuries apart. It gives a nice sense of history. Then, of course, there are the Desmond sections. Personally I've never hated them as much as some, mostly it just seems like a missed opportunity. The potential is there to add a lot to the story but it's just under and/or incorrectly utilized. That being said when it isn't forcing you through inane free running puzzles you do learn a little about Desmond's past, about why and how he ended up where he is.\nFor the most part base gameplay is unchanged. The biggest differences are the addition of a hook blade which mostly effects free running (higher climbing jumps and zip lining), bomb crafting/use (use is up to your play style. You don't have to use them but they can be useful), and a tower defense mini game that is thankfully entirely optional (which begs the question \"why is this in the game?\"). The combat is a little less of a grind with the counter-kill/kill-stringing system which can have you speeding through a group of enemies in a flash. Although the ability to kill an entire group of guards without breaking stride makes you wonder why they bother having the fights in the first place. Unfortunately this tweaking of the combat system has continued the trend away from actual planning and assassination toward big raging battles and waves of enemies. There are a few forced stealth sections but those are almost always very linear with a clear path and sequence of actions. It's really a shame because they give you so many weapons and skills but don't really give a lot of ways to fully utilize them in a stealthy way.\nOverall this really is one of the better games so far in the series. The game world is still huge and beautiful and stabbing guards in the neck from the third story doesn't really get old. If you've played the rest of the excellent Ezio story arc then this is a must play. If you haven't then you should go play the others first then pick up Revelations.", "hours": 71.8, "username": "AHoopyFrood", "products": 473, "early_access": false}

However in terms of raw gameplay it's still a fun game, with fairly basic combat mechanics which are coupled with some crazy death animations (and of course the craziness of ragdoll physics). Many a demented cackle has been produced as bodies have been flung, or barged off of a tall building - I should probably seek help...\nThe missions and quests are fairly generic, and if I'm honest there aren't too many standout moments in the game mission wise aside from the final run (which is now becoming something of a trademark in the Assassin's Creed series). Storywise I felt again the game never really got going while playing, yet looking back it clearly did. This was a far more streamlined Assassin's Creed game compared to the other installments, and a quick check of the played time shows I managed to complete the main storyline within 13hours of gameplay.\nThis could mean one of two things: There was a reduction in superficial sidequests to advance the mainstory; or I simply didn't bother exploring and living in the world.\nThe Story content itself is finally satisfying, as in previous Assassin's Creed games they never really explore the actual origins of the Brotherhood. Thankfully this game does, and it presents it in such a way that it finally ties the first Assassin's Creed directly into the rest of the franchise (rather than it being some previous ancestor of Desmond that he's forgot all about). If I'm honest, I think I preferred the small glimpes into Altiar's history, and the 'payoff' was nice. Of course Ezio's story is progressed along nicely too, and he's aged, has changed slightly and has a rugged man beard that inspired The Last of Us.\nThey even manage to build up Desmond's character, even if he is in a coma and trapped within the Animus! And of course there's some ball twisting progression of The Firsts in there too.\nSo overall Revelations managed to bring together the 3 (all in 1) Main Characters of the Franchise and progress them along nicely. I just feel like the City's mission was a little lacklustre as the fight between the Ottomons and the Byzanite's wages across Istanbul. I never really felt I was involved or playing a critical role in the outcome - perhaps I'm missing the point and Ezio wasn't a crucial figure in those events.\nThe city design itself is an interesting one too, as I felt way more relaxed playing the game. It didn't feel as open or as grand as Italy in ACII or Rome in AC: Brotherhood. It was close and pretty low profile, and for some reason it didn't feel as though I was ever in any real danger, despite the game's attempts to throw danger at you in the form of the 'Awareness' meter.\nWhich brings me onto the Assassin's Den Management subgame - it never triggered for me. Perhaps I was a great Assassin Master who managed to keep the Assassin's activities a secret from the evil Templars, but outside of the pre-planned tutorial on the Tower Defense Sub-Game, it never happened again in the 13 hours I played the game.\nOverall I'm happy I played Assassin's Creed: Revelations, as it does do some fan service to tie all of the loose character plots together, and brings Desmond to life. However, I think at this point if you haven't enjoyed Assassin's Creed II/Brotherhood then Assassin's Creed: Revelations is probably not for you.\nOne for the fans.", "hours": 13.5, "username": "Chris", "products": 1901, "early_access": false}

I will admit that the first chapters may seem somewhat \"filler-ish\", and Desmond side-story is marred by questionable gameplay, but trust me, your patience will be well rewarded.\nReviewers complain about villains, saying they're not \"bad\" enough (Gamesradar review), not as fun as the Borgias. Way to miss one of the points of the entire series. The game makes an emphasis on the fact that Templars are not \"evil\", and Assassins are not \"good\" \u2014 those two are merely world views, perhaps one with more merit than the other, but neither is infallible. People fail to realize that Assassins are essentially a terrorist/intelligence organization that forges alliances and \"removes\" people to further its nebulous cause, a distant idea of freedom, not to \"uphold good\". And it makes sense that this conclusion is not apparent to those who've only played AC1/AC2/B, since both protagonists were young and foolishly romantic back then. This is why I consider it very important to play Revelations, as it sheds light on the bigger picture of the ancient struggle and the fragility and imperfection of the Creed, through the wise eyes of aging Ezio and Altair. If this fails to move you, then there is exploration of mortality, regrets, retrospective, love of life \u2014 Revelations greatly amplifies the beautiful sadness of watching Ezio and Altair's lives come to an end.\nAs for the gameplay, combat is a little bit tougher than in Brotherhood (kick-spamming is no longer stupidly effective + enemies are tougher), 100% synchronization in individual missions is quite hard to achieve, thanks to simple but better challenges, such as \"lose no health\", whereas Brotherhood mostly peppered you with stealth challenges which were rather simple, especially with the crossbow. Furthermore, the Assassin training \"mini-game\" is now much more rewarding, not to mention that the old and wise Ezio is now a true mentor, who gets a chance to work with individual aspiring master assassins personally, through the assassin side-quests \u2014 which, by the way, touch upon the moral dilemmas, \"gray area\" and the paradoxes of the Creed. AC:Revelations fleshes out the Assassin brotherhood theme MUCH better than AC:Brotherhood, and I'm amazed that so few people recognize this. Your \"pet\" assassins finally have some sort of personality, and you feel more compelled to keep them safe.

The only time you're forced to play it is the first den defense \"tutorial\" mission, and it's hardly something to complain about. Hell, some might even enjoy it (I almost did). You also don't have to craft bombs if you don't feel like it.\nI put this game easily on par with Assassin's Creed 2, and as far as emotional engagement is concern, I would put it even above any of its great predecessors.", "hours": 29.1, "username": "atrokkus", "products": 95, "early_access": false}

After the cliff hanger ending in the proceeding title, we should have recieved a better payoff in this installment. All of the other installments had an awesome back and forth between present day and the past... with two story lines moving forward in ways that amazingly come togehter. By contrast this game takes place pretty much entirely within Desmond's unconcious mind and the past. Sure, we still go back in time, Ezzio's story is unnecessarily extended, but very little happens to advance Desmond's story or move it beyond the previous installment. To put it another way, this games moved the Assassin Creed storyline about as far as the second Matrix movie moved that series along - which is to say, more of the same damn thing and a big to be continued at the end. If anything, the storyline was cheapened considerably by a backstory presented on these terrible surreal levels where you only hear people from Desmond's past talking while you try to get from one point on a surreal map to another.\nDesmond storyline changes from being young bartender kidnapped off the street by an evil corporation who he knows nothing about and forced into a machine that transports him back into a war between his ancestors and their sworn enemy - a war he knew nothing about and did not know he would become part of - to a guy who really, really should have seen all this coming and not been so confused or surprised when the templars eventually abducted him to use him for their evil purposes. Way to completely ruin the storyline of the first few titles. Unless I missed something when playing the first few titles, Desmond didn't know who Abstergo was initially, why they wanted him, knew nothing about the Assassins and temlpars, had no idea he was born into this war. In Revelations, we learn he grew up on a farm run by the modern day Assassins, was forced to train every day, and was told, repeatedly by his parents how he would oneday become a part of this battle. His parents even told him all about Abstergo and how evil and corrupt they were. He knew who they were, knew they were after him, and he was trained for 16 years by assassins... why did he even need the bleeding effect to gain the skills of an assassin... he was raised by assassins... and told he was an assassin... Is this not a gigantic plot hole?\nMoving along, there are unnecessary changes to the gameplay, again, which means you have to learn all over, again, the best way to fight. For me, this was the worst port to PC in terms of gameplay mechanics. In the preceeding titles, fighting was very fluid and natural whereas Revelations felt almost clumsy by comparison. There are several new components to the game, including a tower defense mode, which didn't really advance the game or make you feel like an assassin, as well mentoring and overseeing many new assasins. I actually enjoyed recruiting new assassins, but once you have them all you do with them is send them on missions to level them up and make you money and influence- missions you never really see or get to play - and they either succeed or fail which gives you more or less influence over cities you never really visit in person in the game... Victory can be ensured for each mission as long as you send your best recruits, which just makes this component of the game boring and tedious.\nRevelations took me less than 10 hours to complete the storyline and unltimately stop playing (and I like to take my time - compare this to the 39 hours I spent on AC:II, the 32 hours I spend on AC:Brotherhood, and the 22 hours I spent on AC. In terms keeping my attention and keeping me interested, this game just paled by comparison to the other games in the series. Add the awful backstory for Desmond and the sort of far fetched \"time to save the planet from solar destruction (not templars)\" and we end up with a dissapointing addition to the overally story.\nEven a bad assassins creed is still a good game, but I can't really say I recommend this one.", "hours": 10.9, "user_id": "76561197961560195", "username": "Appeal to Heaven", "products": 315, "early_access": false}

Not much has changed in this one from Brotherhood as Ubisoft felt like they had figured out the best formula to make just about the perfect Assassin\u2019s Creed. However they have added a few things to combat and the cities. In Revelations you can now build different kinds of bombs with different ingredients that are useful in lots of situations.  The various bombs include Caltrop Bombs (explodes caltrops that hinder your enemy\u2019s movement), Cherry Bombs (which make a large sound that can lure guards away), Gold Bombs (Filled with coins that cause the crowds to create a distraction) and several more.\nThey also added a hook blade that while climbing doesn\u2019t really add anything else but when the player is running towards an enemy can use the hook blade to vault over them and keep moving. It also allows the player to utilize the zip lines. On top of that another game mode was added within the single player called \u201cDen Defense.\u201d This mode is sort of like a tower defense mini game in which the player uses \u201cresources\u201d to buy different kind of assassin\u2019s that defends an Assassin\u2019s Den from the Templars. It is a nice fun way to get away from the tediousness of some of the missions.\nOverall the gameplay didn\u2019t change much however it did seem like at times they had broken the fights a little more making it more difficult to do various moves and allowed for the player to get hit more in fights. Unlike the other two games I started to get a little irritated with the bugginess of the combat and climbing at times.\n\nThe story continues after the ending of Brotherhood in which Desmond has fallen into a coma because of the event that happened at the end of Brotherhood. His Assassin comrades decide to put him back into the Animus where he awakens to Subject Sixteen and Animus Island. Desmond must find out the location of the lost city from Ezio before the Animus deletes and purges him from the system (exactly what happened to Subject Sixteen). When he begins as Ezio he finds himself in Masyaf (The Assassin\u2019s Stronghold from the first game) trying to open Altair\u2019s library to discover the location of The Great Temple but there are Templars everywhere.\nEzio discovers that the way to open the library is to find the 6 Masyaf keys that are located in Constantinople/Istanbul. While he is looking for the new keys he discovers a plot by the Templar led Byzantines to retake Constantinople from the Sultans. Unfortunately I can\u2019t give too much more in plot as it would reveal and spoil too much but suffice to say I enjoyed this story the most out of the three.\n\n\nIt felt like a lot more detail went into the cities in Revelations than Brotherhood or Assassin\u2019s Creed 2. There are a lot more colors, more subtle details and even the characters/NPCs have more life to them. The locals felt unique and the design was quite impressive. It also feels like this was a better done port that the other two as it runs better on my PC however it wasn\u2019t without its bugs. I did get frequent bugs and crashes while playing and it did set me back a bit. However the voice acting is just as good as the other two games if not better. Roger Craig Smith has done his best as Ezio yet and all of the Turkish characters had a fine accent as well. The music actually felt more like it was made for a cinematic experience and that added to the game a lot as well.\n\nOverall I felt like the story was the best yet in this game however the gameplay felt forced and buggy. On top of that the game had several crashes that did make me do parts over again which was unfortunate. However with that being said and even if the score is lower I believe that this game was the better game simply because of the story (That is the part I feel is most important in a game).\n\u2022\tStory  - 5 out of 5\n\u2022\tGameplay \u2013 3 out of 5\n\u2022\tGraphics \u2013 5 out of 5\n\u2022\tSound  - 5 out of 5\n\u2022\tFun \u2013 4 out of 5\nA total score of 4.4 out of 5", "hours": 25.0, "username": "Freelancer", "products": 1493, "early_access": false}

This game is abandonware, no more updates with no further support on PC.  There is a news crawl on the bottom that is so out of date there is even a tip that reminds us to preorder AC3 and get all the great preorder bonuses!!!!  This game started out good by giving players a hook to reach higher places, then it went downhill fast.  This is by far the WORST assassins creed game EVER made.  Many of the buildings in the game you cant climb there is nothing there, just a big blank space.  While the controls are as bad as every other PC version, making it so buildings are harder to climb while making the average building much taller this time around 4 stories is a huge pain for navigating the city, especially the fact its broken up into 2 parts.  Taking place in a third world country it has no horses for whatever reason even though there are multiple scenes with carriage chases.\nSome of the challenges are almost broken, the Bomb Challenge set 2, rather than get fixed in the last patch got all bugged up.  The bomb challenges are completable by making bombs at the quick station then making them in your inventory.  Took like twenty times of doing it for it to pop, but just keep doing it one by one, and you will get past that menace of a problem.\nFor a story you have the end of the Enzio trilogy, so sad to see him go.  There is even a wonderful romance including a picnic for the two lovers in a graveyard.  The time trials are crap, just mirrors edge wannabe clones.  Other parts where you play as Desmond they actually found a way to make more annoying by making it an fps platforming part where you move blocks around, as dumb as that sounds its that stupid to play.\nRating:  0/10  Value:  4.99", "hours": 70.0, "username": "BridgetFisher", "products": 7306, "early_access": false}

It featured some flashbacks to Altair, the original assassin, but didn't really explain much about the Templar/Assassin war, their philosophies, or just what's going on in the modern world.\nIt did reveal how depressing Altair's life was. Pretty much his entire family gets killed. He gets disgraced and kicked out of the Assassin's Guild, his son gets killed, his wife gets killed when they go to redeem their dead son, then more people get killed. Everybody goes and dies until eventually Altair himself sits down in a chair to rest and dies. But those are just the flashbacks.\nThe actual storyline is not memorable.\nGameplay is very similar to previous games. You have the same 4 groups of allies; assassins, thieves, warriors, and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s. You try to burn enemy outposts and renovate shops in the area. The only difference is the location, which is set in Istanbul/Constantinople.\nVisually, the game looks nice. It's sharp, crisp, with good character details and animations.\nMusic is beautiful. The main theme is catchy. Voice acting is above-average.\nOverall, It's a nice game in the style of AC2 and AC:Brotherhood, set in a different town, cast in a gloomier tone.

I would have written a review for the original one since that's the one that got me hooked on the series, but I played that one on the PS3, so I can't review the PC version. Fair enough. I have the PC version now, though, and am planning on playing it.\nRevelations, on the other hand, I played all the way through on the PC version. First off, if you've played this game or any of the others on the consoles only, you have no idea what they're supposed to look like. The graphics are astounding. That out of the way, the obligatory \"eye candy\" factor, what's the game really like?\nThe good: As is the case in every previous installment, you can lose yourself completely in this one. You don't have to, but if you want to spend a month playing nothing but this game, you can. On the other hand, and that's another thing I like, if you just like the story, you don't have to invest the rest of your year in it. And it's a good story too. Great dialogue, color and characters that actually feel real with a few twists thrown in on top. As I like to say when I run into that rare creature, the game with a good story, \"it would make a great movie.\"\nIt ties up a lot of loose ends too, closing out the stories of Altair and Ezio very well indeed and, quite frankly, even as a fan I was beginning to reach the point where I wasn't sure that Ezio's story, as fascinating as it is, could be milked any further. I like closure. At some point. I'm done with Ezio and Altair now, and not in a bad way. It's all good.\nThe bad? The side games get a bit repetitive. At first I was determined to dominate the Med and renovate every public lavatory in Constantinople before I'd finish the game. At the end, not so much. But that's what I like about these games: You can carry on with the side games, quests, mini-games and so on for as long as you like them, and then you can get right back into the story and finish the thing if you've had all you can stand. And you'll STILL end up with weeks of play time. You don't miss out on anything.\nExcept for the Desmond's Journey optional side game, which I only made it through the second sequence of before I tired of it. Placing blocks in space and playing first person Tetris just doesn't do it for me, sorry. But I didn't lose anything because of it, so *shrug*. I would have loved to hear all about Desmond growing up, though, but it just wasn't worth it for me.\nOverall? A great romp. Beautiful, stunning even, with a story that reads like a book to the point where I couldn't wait to go to the next mission point to find out what happened next. Just like a good book. That with some awesome fight animations, controls that keep getting better and cinematics made for movies, not to mention the awesome soundtrack and it's a very nice package of awesome interactive entertainment indeed. Oh, and with a bit of history thrown in for good measure.\nI may be lonely in appreciating the database entries about historic locations and people, but I appreciate them very much. History isn't taught near enough in schools nowadays.\n9 out of 10.", "hours": 28.5, "user_id": "76561197996899190", "username": "MishaTX", "products": 309, "early_access": false}

There are even some pistol wielding guards who \"want\" to shoot you in close combat/melee range: they aim at least 3 seconds before they shoot... they could touch you with their pistol tip but hey, better aim that thing before popping it!\nThe easiness isn't all: that game has only one real assassination, where you have to sneak up onto your target.

It is mediocre in almost every way. That's why I wrote this message to you. To warn you of this game.\nLet's take the environment for example. In ACII and Brotherhood we spent the game in Italy during the Rennaissance. There were unique environments, several factions that all offered different side-quests, quite a questlines, and on top of that a few assassination targets (because, you know, it's called\nCreed). Revelations practically removed all of those things. The game takes place in Istanbul in the 1510's, and apparently back then it was normal for an entire city to look completely the same, without any variety at all. The buildings are copy-pasted, there were exactly 3 side quests (one for each faction: Thieves, Mercenaries and Romanies) and there were very, very few assassination targets, with most of them being introduced only minutes before you get to stab their precious little necks.\nInstead, the game likes to expand on something that had been introduced in Brotherhood: micro-management. I will only say 3 words on this matter:\nI wish that was the only bad thing there was to say about this game, but unfortunately, it isn't.\nThe characters seem to lack any kind of personality. For example, they practically turned Ezio in another Desmond. Extremely boring. And it's not just Ezio, but ALL characters you meet in this game. They lack any kind of personality and do not possess any real characteristics. Speaking of characters, they also seem keen on introducing Ezio's new 30 year younger love interest. And how do they do it? By practically shoving her down the player's throath. With a few small additions to the plot, she could have been skipped completely. Which would be a good thing, since the dialogue between her and Ezio is especially cringe-worthy.\nSpeaking of the plot,\n\nAlso, a word of warning, if you want to buy this game because it has Alta\u00efr in it, don't even bother spending your hard-earned cash. Alta\u00efr only shows up for a few short moments, with time jumps as large as 20 years. And even he seems to lack any kind of personality. As for Desmond... He's still Desmond. 'Nuff said.\n\"But wait!\", some of you may say, \"They added several new elements! Like grenades, the hook-blade and the tower defense minigame!\" Yes, they did add them and yes, they removed all challenge and make the game even easier and more boring. Grenades are overpowered, the hook-blade is overpowered (and unrealistic) and the tower defense minigame is a complete waste of time.\nAs for the multi-player, maybe you will enjoy it, maybe you won't. I didn't bother playing it.\nSo, with this list of complaints I finally rest my case. Sorry for the extremely long wall of text, but people need to know that they should NOT buy this game.

While it doesn\u2019t really move the present-day plot along very much, it does conclude both Ezio\u2019s and Altair\u2019s (the protagonist of the first game) storylines, effectively wrapping up every major loose end before the start of AC3. The game primarily features an older, mid-16th century Ezio, on a quest to learn more about Altair and the Assassins. This leads him from Masyaf to Constantinople, where the majority of the game takes place.\nThe new setting of Constantinople is visually nice and as usual is a cool place to explore. However, it feels smaller than previous games. My feeling is that making this game was most definitely more of a financial than a creative decision. In other words, because of having to crank out a new game on a yearly basis, the scope of Revelations had to be reduced. This is not only reflected in the smaller size of the world, but also in many of the creative aspects. There are no major changes to the established formula that one might expect from a series on its 4th iteration. The mission types and game mechanics are all pretty much the same as in Brotherhood and AC2. Luckily, that means that the game is technically near-flawless... however, on the flip-side, it\u2019s creatively a bit stale.\nThe one major thing that Revelations introduces is a sort of \"tower defense\" sub-game, which involves (you\u2019ll never see this one coming) defending towers using various types of Assassins and defenses. However, this is an odd addition, as I came to find out, it can potentially be avoided entirely. You see, these missions supposedly only pop up when your notoriety gets too high, but if you manage to keep your notoriety low and assign Assassins to each of your towers (as I did), you will never experience this mini-game beyond the initial tutorial. I had completely forgotten this was even a thing until I was just now thinking about what new mechanics were added to this game. So unfortunately I can\u2019t speak to how good or bad this new addition was. It just seems an odd choice to add this whole mechanic and then not have it be a mandatory part of the main game.\nOne other new gameplay addition comes in the form of a series of optional 1st-person puzzle levels. These are available in the present day Desmond sections, and serve as a way to tell the story of his past. These levels are really hit or miss. The 1st-person controls are awkward and the abstract nature of the levels is a bit odd. I thought the idea was interesting, but eventually the whole process became quite tedious. Your mileage may vary on these levels. They are completely optional, however, so there is nothing lost by avoiding them, except some Desmond back-story. Incidentally, there is also a DLC pack featuring similar levels which fills in the story of Subject 16 (Desmond\u2019s Animus predecessor) and Lucy Stillman. If you like the style of these levels, you may be interested in checking that out, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the price (I recommend just watching the important bits online).\nAt any rate, the main draw in this game is clearly what it does to conclude the storylines for Altair and Ezio. For that reason alone, it\u2019s worth checking out if you are a fan of the series or either of those characters in particular. However, just keep in mind that other than that, this game is literally just more of the same, with little innovation. If you played the previous games and find yourself tiring of the AC formula, Revelations likely won\u2019t satisfy you from a gameplay aspect. But, if you can handle one more round of the same thing, this is a nice ending to the first part of the AC story, and worth checking out.\nGrade: B\nNote: I don\u2019t recommend playing any of the Assassin\u2019s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.", "hours": 29.5, "username": "noibn", "products": 1828, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "201870", "page": 173, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-02-02", "text": "Revelations is a bit of a bittersweet experience. On the one hand the game offers up a lot more answers and insight into the story arcs of Ezio Auditore, Altair Ibn La'Ahad, Desmond Miles and the struggle between Templar and Assassin but at the same time the entire thing feels like it's tied together very loosely.\nAssassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood featured Ezio Auditore struggling against the Italian Templars first as a means for personal revenge and then as a true Assassin fighting against tyranny. With the shift to Constantinople both Ezio and the player feel like complete outsiders with no real stake in the budding conflict between Ahmet and Selim over the Sultanate. The entire expereince is even ironically summed up at the end of the game when Ezio is told to leave and never return - leaving any and all of the player's victories and failures feeling hollow.\nTo make matters worse Revelations is the first installment in the series to really not bring anything new and ground-breaking to the franchise. The biggest additions are the hookblade and the bomb making but both of these things feel like they were just added out of necessity rather than as interesting and enjoyable features.\nThe most outlandish of the new \"features\" however is Desmond's Journey (and later the Lost Archive DLC). Seperate from the main game, these portions have you navigate puzzles and obstacles from a first-person view while learning more about Desmond Miles and Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16). While the concept is interesting it just feels out of place and as a result kind of unnecessary.\nThe multiplayer however did see some improvements - namely the introduction of Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes as well as the ability for players to customize their characters' clothing and weapons.\nOverall I believe Revelations' real issue stems from the fact that it's trying to cover too many bases at the same time. Attempting to tie up loose ends between mutiple characters spread out over different time periods and games, moving the main modern day story arc along, AND giving the player a new location with a new historical story-line and characters proves to be too much for Ubisoft to stuff into a 25+ hour title and in Revelations' case it definitely shows.", "hours": 30.7, "user_id": "76561198006893472", "username": "Fear2288", "products": 418, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "201870", "page": 176, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2012-12-19", "text": "As with Assassin's Creed Brotherhood you play as Ezio Auditore, this time in the city of Constantinople. Ezio is now looking for several keys to a vault that Altair sealed centuries ago. Each key lets you relive a select memory from Altair's life, which is where the revelations happen. In this way it gives closure on both Ezio and Altair's stories at the same time.\nThe game shares a lot of similarities with Brotherhood: the majority of the game takes place in one city where you liberate areas and recruit new assassins who you then send off on missions throughout the region.\nGraphically Revelations is definitely the best-looking game in the series so far.\nUbisoft made a few gameplay additions to spice things up. My favorite is the new hookblade, which makes climbing a breeze; it also has other applications like ziplining between buildings (why these ziplines are all over Constantinople I have no idea) and the ever-useful hook-and-run maneuver. Bombs are interesting, but I didn't use them much except when the game prompted me to.\nAnother nice addition was some backstory for Desmond. As you might know, at the end of Brotherhood Desmond falls into a coma and they put him into the animus to keep him from losing his mind. There you get to play through a few first-person levels that tell us about Desmond's life before he got mixed up with Abstergo. It's nice to know more about the person who you are playing as, and solidifies him as an actual character rather than simply the guy who you have to go through to get to Ezio.\nThe Lost Archive DLC does something similar for Subject 16, and it was very moving. I would recommend it to those who are interested in good storytelling.\nThis may have to do with the fact that I completely ignored all side missions during my five hour push to the end of the game, but Revelations seemed much shorter than the previous games in the series. I only spent 19 hours in the game; for reference the amount of time I spent in the other games are as follows:\nAssassin's Creed: 22 hours\nAssassin's Creed II: 39 hours\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood: 36 hours\nOverall I would recommend Assassin's Creed Revelations to those of you who felt that Altair and Desmond felt hollow in the previous games and those of you who are obsessed with plotlines.", "hours": 19.2, "username": "Wolf Revo", "products": 439, "early_access": false}

From his birth, we have seen this man age and become an elder. A process you in the beginning feel quite a bit.\nThere is a beginning section where you are wounded and need medicine, limiting your climbing abilities and forcing you to make do with what you have, which are haystacks. A nice way to get people gradually reacquainted with how you do things in the AC series.\nConstantinople is now your playground. Everything you could do in Rome, can now be done there, and more. The Hookblade serves as an additional climbing method. Whereas in Brotherhood, you could leap and grab hold of a normally unreachable spot, you can now use this technique to climb even faster by launch yourself a second time. A rush to do several times in succession, though for some reason it still functions perfectly for dual assassinations.\nBombs can be put together now as well, allowing you to carry three types. To distract, to kill and for tactical purposes. For every type, you can put together several ingredients with different effects befitting their purpose. Distracting bombs will usually distract guards and such, while lethal bombs will kill in various ways. Tactical bombs can range from smoke bombs, to bombs that drop fake coins to lure a crowd of people, and much much more.\nWhlie an excellent game, I can't say that you'll be able to fully appreciate the game and story if you haven't played it's predecessors.\nIf you have been following the AC storyline, you'll enjoy the progress of Ezio and the hidden history of Alta\u00efr. Especially the latter's closure is a potentially emotional one.\nA worthy end to a storyline focussed on an Italian Assassin.

It feels somewhat shorter than its predecessor, but this helps keeping things interesting through and through. Gone are the brilliant puzzles from ACII and Brotherhood, but they're replaced by first-person storytelling sequences with platforming elements. Main theme by Lorne Balfe performed by the winner of a fan singing contest sounds amazing and is probably the most memorable musical piece in the whole series to date. Multiplayer got a facelift as well and now features a sort of a storyline with cutscenes.

Assassin recruits are given more meaning, as once you level them to 10, you can assign them to a den and begin a mission with them in which you actuall interact with your recruits. Gaining recruits seems some similarly unique missions, as aposed to the simple 'defend the civilian' from Brotherhood, which still exists but in lesser numbers. Missions for your rEcruits also has a purpose, letting you gain control of other reagions of the world while you work towards your goals in Constantinople.\nThe story is much richer in Revelations, and ties up loose ends, and gives a very satisfying conclusion to both Ezio and Altair's storylines. Desmonds story is progressed only slightly, but some of his backstory is filled in, more than him actually making any forward progression in the over arching plot.\nThe new setting is refreshing from ACII and Brotherhood's focus on Italy, and the new characters you meet are easier to connect with, and care about than in previous titles.\nThe new hookblade adds some much needed precision and functionality to free-running, and adds some speed to vertical transitions. Finishing animations add a lot to combat, and might actually make you stick around and fight a pack of guards instead of running away and hidding.\nAll in all, this s the best game in the Ezio trillogy, and in the first 4 games.", "hours": 18.0, "username": "Bloodstorm", "products": 522, "early_access": false}

The horses are completely non-existent, except for some horses pulling carriages in specific interactive cutscenes.

This removes the ability to jump straight up, and then reach your arms to a side to grab a ledge.\nThey've added a new type of enemy that cannot be killed, except with counters.
