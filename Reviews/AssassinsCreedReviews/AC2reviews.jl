I played this game to help me understand the lore better.\nAssasin's Creed 2 Review:\nPros:\n1. GREAT STORY AND CHARACTERS- the story kept my interest throughout the entire game. There are also a lot of side characters that have a lot of depth to them and play significant roles. You know a story is good when you feel connected to not only the main character but also the characters he encounters.\n2. GREAT ENVIRONMENT: The cities were very beautiful. Ubisoft did a great job creating different atmospheres for each location, such as cloudy and gloomy at Ezio's villa and bright and sunny in the cities. Also, the cities were bustling with people running about doing their jobs, such as bards trying to sing to you, ladies of leasure flrting, hooligans causing trouble, package delivery men running around, priests preaching the end of times, and thieves being chased by guards. The enviroment was on a level that is sorely missed in some more recent games.\n3. HISTORICAL CHARACTERS: In the game you encounter a lot of historical characters such as Leonardo Davinci, who had a great personality. I really felt like I was traveling back in time and living in that time period.\n4. THE GAME PLAY IS FUN...most of the time.\n5: GREAT CINEMATIC CUT SCENES: I enjoyed watching the cinematic cut scenes. They helped me to feel imersed in the story. A lot better than the behind the shoulder views I was forced to watch in Assasin's Creed: Origins.\n6. I ENJOYED OWNING AND UPGRADING MY OWN HOUSE: In the game you own a villa (technically it's your uncles). Anyways, you can upgrade the property and surrounding town architecture.\nCONS:\n1. BAD CONTROLS AND MANEUVERING: I  used an xbox controller to play the game, and even then playing the game felt a little difficult. For example, in order to go to the start menu I had to press down on the controller stick, so many times when I was fighting I would accidentally press down and go to the start menu. Probably more my fault then it was the games. Often times I would go to jump from a ledge, but instead of jumping Ezio would fall down and hang from the ledge. I also felt the game was not very responsive when I pressed certain buttons. For example, I would press (B+down) to get Ezio to release a ledge or bar, and I had to press the buttons many times before he would actually let go. This can make the game frustrating. Especially when you have to chase people across rooftops.\n2. FIGHTING SYSTEM: I didn't really enjoy the fighting system. There was a lot of button mashing. It really doesn't require too much in the way of skill and most of the time I would just sit and wait for someone to attack me so I could counter their attack and insta-kill them.\n3. BAD CAMERA ANGLES: The camera angles definitely feel like something out of the stone age. I constantly found myself missing the verticle viewing angles from more recent games. There were also instances when the camera would get stuck at a bad angle as I went into a room or away from a wall.\nCONCLUSION: all in all, I was very impressed by this game. The game doesn't have the best graphics, the maneuvering can be quite clumbsy, and the camera angles can sometimes suck, but the incredible atmosphere, great story, interesting characters, and gameplay kept me glued to my laptop for a full 24 hours.\nI would recommend this game!", "hours": 23.8, "user_id": "76561197973269980", "username": "FreakinMonkeys29", "products": 23, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 2, "page_order": 8, "recommended": false, "date": "2018-02-11", "text": "Assassin's Creed 2 is a game that many people look back on fondly. I remember my first time playing this at a friends house I was in awe (and spent most of my time just killing civilians). It was such a new concept to me (I had never played the first game) and open worlds were not common outside of Grand Theft Auto. Indeed, it is often consider the best Assassin's Creed game, but that really says a lot about the franchise because it's... not great. In 2009 it was a \"perfect\" sequel to a very popular game that improved the best aspects of the original in almost every way. In 2018, it's a clunky snorefest with really good music. And if you have fond memories of the game and are about to start refuting all my points, stop now. It simply does not hold up anymore, go about your life and keep the positive memories you have before I destroy them.\nSo let's start with the good, and number one would be the music. Jesper Kyd did a knockout job as usual and it heightens some of the dullness of the gameplay and story. It's one of those soundtracks you'd actually listen to on your own, outside of playing the game. Next, we have the graphics. The artstyle itself is very well done and I think it does a good job at what I imagine 1400's Italy would have looked like. I'm actually impressed at how the game looks for being nearly 10 years old, but only up close. The pop in is atrocious but I guess that's a sacrifice that had to be made for rendering such a large game world on the hardware of the time. A smaller, final note, the out-of-Animus sections of the game are very short and far between. They are so infrequent that I sometimes completely forgot about that part of the plot (which is a positive thing).\nUnfortunately, that's about it for the good. Everything else is average or worse.  We can start with the story, which admittedly has a pretty great first act. It brings you in pretty quickly, and you get to know Ezio, an interesting and fun protagonist. And then things take off into the second act, the worst and longest part of the game. It stretches so long with too many unnecessary parts that it would drive most people to quit. It takes probably 12-14 of the approximately 20 hours of the game until we finally get to the third act. The only problem is that you've probably gotten so bored at this point most of the tension has been lost. The final mission will sneak up on you because you've stopped paying attention a while ago and have just been going through the motions of hopping from objective marker to objective marker. I was more excited that I was finally going to be done than I was to see the climax of the game, and that's not something you want in your game. There's a pretty simple \"boss fight\" and a twist that's not really expected, but not super shocking or interesting either. The game ends rather abruptly, to be follow by Brotherhood. Too bad I have no interest in slogging through another Assassin's Creed game, especially if this considered the best. There's also some DLC, but I couldn't push myself to finish it. The story is far from terrible, but it's just not enough to hold up the rest of the game.\nSure, some of the second act should have been trimmed, but a lot of it would have been passable if the actual quests weren't so dull. Most games use the simple \"Go from Point A to Point B and do an objective\" formula, but usually there is some elaboration to make things interesting. Assassin's Creed 2 rarely changes things up (though when it does it's usually a refreshing break), and the game becomes stale very quickly. A lot of the missions in themselves are bloated, with the tired old \"do this thing three times\" trope popping up too often. There are really only three mission types anyway: Kill person/people, escort person/people, trail person/people. Rarely is any sort of interesting spin put on the mission, it's often a long trek to go somewhere for very little payoff.\nSpeaking of trek, the freerunning system is rough. I can't exactly blame it for lacking some of the refinement of the subsequent games but it's clunky to the point of frustration. This is exacerbated by the odd control system, which is meant to be played with a controller. When it does work, it's fine and has little impact on enjoyment, but it doesn't work often enough to become a major annoyance. All of the puzzles in the game revolve around climbing, but they're so simple the only challenge comes from trying to work around the clunkiness. Freerunning is 75% of the game, but after the initial cool-ness wears off (and it probably wore off years ago if you're in 2018), it's just bland and makes everything feel like a chore.\nCombat, another staple of the game, is just too simple. There's almost no depth to it and the only challenge is when you encounter enemies who can't be cheesed with a counter kill (and they can just get cheesed with a dodge attack). If you wise up like I did you can just use hired groups to avoid most encounters entirely and just get on with the game. And if you do end up surrounded by a large amount of guards, throw a smoke bomb down and assassinate everyone (or just leave). The actual assassinations themselves are also bland. They're not much of an assassination, it's just running up to someone and stabbing them because there is no stealth system or different methods to kill targets. The only time the game presented me with an interesting optional way to kill my target, it tripped on it's own clunkiness and I had to resort to regular old run-and-stab.\nThere are many other things to discuss, but everything just feels like a half baked implementation of an idea. This is probably one of the reasons Assassin's Creed 2 is looked back on so fondly; it has little pieces of other games mixed in with it. Most of us were probably too young to think about whether or not these elements were actually implemented well, or we were just in awe of them all being in one game. There's a large open world, but it's pretty empty save for a few boring side activities. There a progression system, but it can all be unlocked by halfway through the game and it gives little outside of extra health squares. You have a few different combat options, but you'll probably forget everything besides hidden blades and a sword. There are collectibles, but the rewards are worthless. The whole game is a multitude of different ideas boiled down to their absolute core, and left with many overly simplified gameplay elements that add little value to the game.\nThe real issue out of them all is the freerunning. It's kind of meant to hold up the entire game, being the primary activity the player does. This may have worked as a main feature in 2009, but it's long since been relegated to a more supplementary role. As a result, the Assassin's Creed 2 is packed with excruciatingly simple gameplay stretched over almost 20 hours, and the story isn't quite good enough to prop up the game on it's own.", "hours": 19.0, "username": "Someot", "products": 386, "early_access": false}

The combat, parkour, and multiple open worlds still hold strong to this day. Every area I encountered with Ezio (best character in the franchise) felt alive and vibrant, beckoning to be explored. I originally played this on Xbox and I would recommend playing this version, not the Ezio Collection.\nIn many games since this and Brotherhood, the armor/weapon system was very linear; you have a few weapons to choose from and you gradually get one sword better than the next by paying and soon you have the best gear in game without much effort. The system in II and Brotherhood is my favorite in any game, making it feel actually worthwile when you get an entire armor set or complete enough challenges to unlock certain weapons. There are swords, maces, long spears, a variety of weapons to suite your playstyle which has only been touched upon in the recent Origins.\nThe characters in this game are some of the best in the franchise, Ezio is charismatic and charming with a interesting supporting cast to back up his performance. Part of the reason these characters are so strong is the perfect setting, Renaissance Italy was a vibrant, diverse place at the time and it suits this game so well.\nThis game is not without faults though, most of them lie in the gameplay mechanics. Not often, but occasionally I found Ezio and other models jumping not where I point, common things in AC at this point, but at the time was and still is jarring. For me, the modern day story with Desmond always fell a little flat for me, while I did find it interesting, I kept thinking about Ezio and what mission I'd be doing next.\nProgression is a key theme in the game, both in gear, characters but skills as well. You feel like you're growing along with Ezio and Desmond as they learn new skills to combat their enemies which adds a nice personal touch. I always feel like I'm on a constant journey of improvement or learning which entices me to play more.\nThe story, omg, easily the best in AC. A classic tale of revenge with twists, turns, and gratifying results (at least first playthrough). This goes along with progression as we see Ezio mature into a significantly better character by the end of the game and it is only hightened by the well-written story.\nPros\nCons\nI apologize for any typos in this review!", "hours": 31.7, "username": "PunchingMonocle", "products": 43, "early_access": false}

It\u2019s also one of the most proper sequels in a franchise ever, improving areas that needed rehauling and even those that didn\u2019t. The game continues the story of Desmond Miles, and opens the story of another ancestor: Ezio Auditore De Firenze, an assassin from Florence Italy.\nThe gameplay for Assassin\u2019s Creed II will be both satisfying and disappointing for players coming from the original. The disappointment will come from the only con of the gameplay, which is that the sword combat is even more dumbed down from before. In the original, sword fights dumb down to waiting for the enemy to attack and then counter attacking with one button. In this game, it\u2019s the same exact story; wait for the enemy to attack, and then counter or grab them. Either one will result in a very quick kill and got very boring quick after just coming from the previous installment. It\u2019s so enjoyable I purposely avoided combat when going into endgame collectables. But with that aside, let\u2019s discuss the positives.\nLiterally everything else in this game has been revamped and improved upon from the original. Ubisoft decided to add a looting system, therefore adding gear and money into the game. While the gear and weapons are still gated behind story mission progression, the looting system is a huge step up from simply being given things from an \u201cItalian Al Mualim\u201d after a boring lecture. The hidden blade has been given a counterpart to form \u201cDual hidden blades\u201d, allowing for dual stealth assassinations. Assassinations can now also be performed from above an enemy and below them on a ledge. Throwing knifes, poisons, daggers, money for distraction, smoke bombs and A GUN, have all been added to the methods of which to achieve the players means. Climbing has also been improved, as at a certain point, Ezio can learn how to grab a high ledge while jumping up, adding complexity to the climbing. There was even a point where a glider was in the game and the character was allowed to fly. THE PLAYER CAN ACTUALLY SWIM NOW; but sadly, no other person in the game world can and will disintegrate upon touching the stuff. The player can also now blend with any large crowd of people. Another great to change to the game is adding \u201chit bars\u201d above the heads of enemies. Seeing how many hits an enemy has left really helps with keeping the player engaged and aware of the situation.\nOverall, the gameplay has been massively improved, except for where it needed to be the most.\nThe sound design in this game was amazing. The score for each zone in the game was absolutely superb. Each piece matched the theme of it\u2019s zone perfectly and i found myself humming along almost all the time.The music in the \u201cpresent day\u201d plotlines was so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665icly good to me that I waited to go into the animus at the start just to listen to it. The only issue with the sound design truly lies with the sound effects. While once again the sound effects for climbing, fighting and taking damage are all amazing, the voice acting for the guards is so repetitive. Everytime they say the exact same two things in the exact same order. After playing the game for 39 hours, it got rather sickening. The view point sound effect suffers the same, being the exact same five cello chord drag that kills the mood of the game. The sound effect for accepting missions, while being repetitive is so good that it\u2019s excused.\nThe visuals in this game are a major improvement from the sequel and are very impressive for 2009. The most important part is the style. For the setting of renaissance Italy, the style is impeccable. The color palettes in every zone vit them perfectly. Florence had a nice euphoric glow to it, while venice had a more \u201cblueish\u201d feel to it. The only zone i disliked was Romagna, as it suffered slightly from the aforementioned \u201cfallout 3 syndrome\u201d. The game also had particle effects in the sky, which i thought were great and added on to the world. As usual, I also liked the \u201csimulated\u201d feel to it, with certain things glowing with animus effects\nThis game has so much content. The best part is almost none of it is repetitive. Instead of giving the player the same six remedial tasks and then a big assassination, this game gave proper unique missions leading up until the assassinations for 14 sequences. The side missions have an even bigger variety. The player can do \u201cassassination contracts\u201d which with the exception of four \u201ctailing missions\u201d were all unique and different. There were courier missions and races, which were also all unique and different. The five  \u201cBeat up\u201d missions, however, were very repetitive and had the same plot every time. Six \u201cAssassin tombs\u201d which are climbing puzzles that reward the best armor in the game. Templar lairs and assassin catacombs are also in the game and unique. The collectables were unique this time, including feathers, Glyphs and treasures. Feathers take the places of the flags from the original, but only have 100 in the whole game this time. Glyphs are plot related and give a huge revelation to the plot. Maps to all the treasures can be bought at art shops. There is also the \u201cVilla\u201d, which is has an upgrade system which gives you a certain amount of income every 20 minutes of gameplay. I did end up 100% completing this game, and it took me 37 hours. I honestly enjoyed every non combat minute of it.\nI found it extremely hard to believe I had a bugless experience with this game.

To me this is important and one of the only things I don't love as much about the current Origins version in 2017. That said, this feels much more like a good old button masher combat game...a lot.

Only had a few weird glitchy things happen, things that required me abondoning some completed work which was frustrating, but overall the game was reliable and really entertaining.

After Medieval Middle East in the first game, Renaissance Italy sure is a livelier place and a time period to experience. But not without the infamous cloak and dagger politics either. Boy, was all these a great improvement over the first title! In means of story, things are just getting started; and in means of gameplay, Ubisoft learned from experience and managed to set the bar higher.\nSo, what happens after Desmond's realization that the war between assassins and templars never ended? Well, I warn you that next two paragraphs will contain spoilers concerning the first game, so if you are yet to play the original title and willing to do at some point, skip this part. At the end of our previous game, Desmond and Lucy broke out of the Abstergo lab, with the revelation Lucy was an assassin all along. Now, they are staying low in an assassin hideout, while a team works with a new version of Animus on Desmond, to try and find information concerning other Pieces of Eden, buried deep within Desmond's memories. As various clues we have gathered at the end of the previous chapter implied, we skip a generation to arrive Renaissance Italy in out memory line to track the next Piece of Eden, and as a result, we are introduced with a new ancestor of Desmond: Ezio Auditore de Firenze.\nSeries of memories here in this chapter, covers Ezio's lifespan from his birth 'till his mid-forties, portraying a story of betrayal, vengeance, acceptance and frustration as the end reveals a grander bite than poor Ezio ever bargained for. Soon after our story starts, the young Florentine nobleman's mischief and debauchery comes to a sudden end with a persecution, that will change his life forever. From there on, he vows to hunt parties responsible for the tragedy that befall on him, and we accompany him as he proceeds with it. After silent, stubborn and arrogant Altair; Ezio is a contrasting protagonist, with a Mediterranean sense of humor and a taste for all kinds of earthly delights, yet also the meticulous, with a libertarian outlook that all assassins share. Whom would I prefer? Well, I think I'm still an Altair gal at this point, but we'll be together with Ezio for two more games, so that can change.\nThe setting is Renaissance Italy, and we travel through and between Florence and Venice, witnessing the rise and fall of Medici and Borgia families, decades in between. Cities are bustling with all kinds of arts, wonderous examples of Renaissance architecture and various discoveries of engineering. As another trademark of AC series, we are to encounter many historical figures, either as allies or foes; and live a part of history itself under an exciting conspiracy twist. All characters are impressively fleshed out, with their own accurate backgrounds and agendas. The cityscapes are well used in this one too, with genuine landmarks; and every scene is another opportunity for a breath-taking screenshot.\nThe gameplay itself improved considerably too, with countless side quests to deal, parkour missions to run, assassination contracts to accept, assassin tombs to discover, templar vaults to raid and a good deal of collectibles that actually serve various purposes upon their completion! There are also imprints left by the previous subject of experiment labeled as \"the truth\" for us to discover the origin of all this conflict. Upon discovery, these clues present us some really complicated, yet well thought puzzles, deciphering bits of information about assassin and templar involvement in history! As another bonus of the gameplay, money is introduced, so you can look for treasure, rob your defeated foes, accumulate an income and rebuild your family villa in Monteriggioni \u2013 and even adorn your halls with famous artworks of the era too. Sure, there are a couple of downsides to the game, like most weaponry that we will encounter providing little to no improvement aside a couple chosen ones, or climbing AI still being ridiculously clumsy \u2013 but nothing that would break your immersion. At the end of the day, you are in for hours of gameplay which you wouldn't be bored of, not even for a second.\nIf you are yet to experience\nseries, this is a good enough place to start, covering the basics of the previous game and improving upon it in means of playability. This is where things get interesting, revealing the centuries long conspiracy a bit more. We'll see more of Ezio to come in\n- the second part of Ezio Trilogy - and see what else fate stores for the beloved Renaissance assassin.\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page\n- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "hours": 71.6, "username": "Faudraline", "products": 1874, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 14, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-26", "text": "In my opinion, the best AC title to date (sorry Origins, I love you very much but ACII's still on top). The graphics may be outdated for some more nit-picky players, and AC1 actually has better graphics (at least, in my opinion), but ACII still manages to be an incredibly immersive experience. Its main locations (Firenze, Venezia, Forl\u00ec, Monteriggioni and San Gimignano) have their own characteristic aura and their own charms and even soundtrack. Firenze is passionate, colorful and vibrant. Venezia is colorful but at the same time it retains a \"dreamy\" feel to it. Forl\u00ec is gloomy and humid. Monteriggioni feels like home, not only because it is the headquarters of the Assassin Order, but because it's warm and welcoming. San Gimignano is a small but busy medieval city, and feels imponent. I have personally been to Firenze and Venezia before playing the game and I'm being serious when I say that the game brought me back to those cities.\nStory-wise, it's very compelling. There was no moment in which I felt like the story was dragging out. And unlike other AC titles, ACII is a game that lets you become attached to the secondary characters. They have their own story and character development.\nIt surely is not as good as Brotherhood graphically or gameplay-wise (in Brotherhood you have many more combat and weapons options), however I do think that ACII is the best game out of the two. Brotherhood has far more side content (also very much varied), but the main story is just not as compelling as ACII's.\nACII is a classic, not only for Assassin's Creed fans, but for any gamer who enjoys a great game. If you haven't played it yet, do give it a try. If you're too scared of spending money on something you're not sure you're going to like (like me), watch a gameplay or two on Youtube, and see if you'd like to take on the experience yourself.

They are outdated and there are issues with overlapping and how clothing folds, but for the time, they were pretty great.\n-Music: Some of it, especially the theme for some of the cities, felt very chiptune-esque. I felt like some of them, especially Florence, could have been made in Spore; however, it did have atmospheric music when you became notorious and good cinematic music.\n-Cinematics: The cinematics were... not amazing. They were good, certainly. Some were impressive, but nothing that would make a person go 'wow' unless they were deep in game.\n-Story: Not bad! In fact, it is one of the chief redeeming qualities of this game. I always like a game with a good storyline, and Assassin's Creed 2 delivered it. In fact, the story was why I kept playing. If you are looking to just buy Assassin's Creed 2 without having played 1, I would suggest at least looking at a synopsis of AC1. This is a continuation, and it improved drastically from the first game.\n-Content: Overall very unique and fun... for a little bit. If you want to get a perfect 100% playthrough of this, prepare for some slogging. The main storyline is very fun and interesting, if a bit overly difficult at times, but the side quests and the collecting just got boring eventually. But then again, I can only take so much collecting myself as a personal preference. Take this with a grain of salt. If you love collecting, the content will not be an issue for you.\n-Controls: This is where the game drops me. The controls could have been great. They could have been. It was obvious a lot of coding went into them and a lot of work went into building this game, but.... It was so difficult to control my character at times. Whenever I would try to sit on a bench after escaping the guards, I would just climb right up, once again losing another valuable hiding spot. When I tried to stay hidden and out of sight of guards by climbing on the railing underneath them, Ezio (the main character) would pull himself up, giving way to the guards and losing the mission again.\n-Gameplay: Fun, but... frustrating as hell sometimes. Don't get me wrong, the combat is amazing. That gets a full 10/10 from me. Sometimes I would go pick fights with guards just for the dynamic combat, because that is so much fun. But... just.... ehhh....... There would be levels where I just wanted to delete the game and possibly everything on my computer because they were so difficult. I had to look up walkthroughs for two of them. The mechanic of 'not being seen' on missions gets taken to the extreme. You cannot be detected at all. Under any circumstances. Even if you kill a guard immediately after he detects you and nobody else has seen. Never. This creates some very upsetting situations. I am still mad about some of them (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 THE MISSION PORT AUTHORITY)\n-Overall: Would I recommend others play it? Absolutely. The story and the combat makes up for everything that is done badly. Would I play it again? Absolutely not. They do not make up for my intense, intense anger at some of those frustrating situations. In any case, it is a good addition to the AC franchise, and I'm excited to play AC: Brotherhood.", "hours": 136.9, "user_id": "76561198051753381", "username": "No Regurts", "products": 123, "early_access": false}

The story is well written, and will grab your attention for sure. My only gripe is the controls, they can sometimes be clunky (I'm using an xbox 360 controller BTW), nothing is more infuriating than falling out of a building while you're trying to escape guards. The combat system is also pretty good but can be repetitive. One thing to note is that this game was released in 2009, and its graphics may not hold up to most people's preference and may be a dealbreaker for them. That's all subjective though.\nIf you're getting this one, buying AC:Brotherhood is a must because this one has an open ended ending.\nNothing is true, everything is permitted.\nRequiescat in pace.", "hours": 29.2, "username": "Kuroshito (\u304f\u308d\u3057\u3068)", "products": 156, "early_access": false}

There is a noticeable uptick in volume of the hand-crafted story. Quality of the story telling wavers at times, but overall provides a sufficient enough backdrop to push the proceedings. While the first title's graphics show nicely even in 2017, the sequel has an \"oily\" feel. Things are not helped by plentiful use of close-ups, which accentuates the edges and dates the title considerably. The first title used much more sensible angles for story cinematics. The main protagonist is substantially more likeable and overall the story feels planned out and not just put in at the last moment as it was with the first one. Vistas are comparable to the first title. The main difference here are heterogenous layouts of maps within cities. Both small and sprawling cities are present. Combat is not stale yet, there is progress on the AI behavior, although the fights are seldom challenging. The music is mostly hit and miss with a too small number of appropriately selected environmental music.

While it's a shame that there are no missions where you can learn additional info about your targets or something that would help you in the assassination, considering how the original game had plenty of repetitive tasks for barely useful info, I guess nothing is better than something bad.\n+The storytelling is much better. Instead of the whole story basically spanning only the first and final few scenes, with tons of filler in the middle, most of the main story in the game feels like it actually is the main story. And it was quite interesting.\n+The story in this game spans several years, rather than just a few months, with timeskips in appropriate places, thus not making it seem like everything is resolved in a day.\n+Addition of customisation and an actual variety of weapons. Though, too bad that it's mostly just an upgrade from a weapon with lower stats to a weapon with higher stats. Would have been nice if multiple weapons were good, but in different areas, thus giving you a choice in gear based on your preferences.\n+A money system and a home economic system. A nice incentive for working on side content.\n+Ability to hire followers to serve as a distraction or help during battles.\n+Guards no longer just randomly attack you for looking at them funny or just riding on a horse. Though, otherwise, the notoriety system seems a bit of a hit or miss to me. Throughout my playthrough, it built up quite slowly, but was awfully easy to get rid of. Could just be me though.\n+Certain guards actually have the brains to look in various obvious hiding spots.\n+Fast travel is incorporated into the world as caravans that you can hire to transport you to places. An in-story explanation for fast travel is a nice touch.\n+The possibility of outrunning guards to lose them, instead of always needing a hiding place or killing all the pursuers just to get them off your back.\n+All the collectables actually have some sort of reward.\n+You no longer need to pickpocket specific people just to replenish your ammo. You can now either loot consumables from fallen enemies, or just buy the stuff at a store.\n+The real world segments are far rarer and less interruptive than in the previous game. Though it's a shame that the real world still basically didn't really matter at all.\nSome bad things about the game\n-uPlay. A completely unnecessary annoyance.\n-Can't replay missions unless you start over, unlike in the original game.\n-Still can't skip cutscenes. The cutscenes are nice the first time, but not so much the second time.\n-The pistoletta takes too long to aim and it's loud, so it's worse than throwing knives most of the time.\n-Fast travel can't be used to travel between districts in the same city.\n-No feature to replenish all ammo at once.

Its incredible fun jumping from roof to roof, escaping enemies and assinating them from stealthy positions.\n- The storyline is very engaging. The characters are well fleshed out and the dialogue is well written and funny at times.\n- Animations are varied and very well done, sound design is great. The game ran perfectly with no major bugs or breaking.\n- Altought a few years old the cities are still pretty breathtaking. As you're sitting atop a tall building looking down on a vibrant city, you can't help but be amazed at times.\n==============\n================\n- The game is very easy. I played on normal difficulty initially and it was a walk in the park. They only times you're really going to fail is being discovered during a stealthy mission or falling from a large height (which is sometimes the fault of a bad camera angle)\n- I did mention the gameplay is great, and it is, but at times it can be frustrating when Ezio doesn't do what you want him to. Also they added a monetary system which felt like a waste. I always had tonnes of money, so much so that it became redundant. Costs 100 to fast travel somewhere? Cool just take it out of my 1,000,000. This also made purchasing health too easy, in turn making an already easy game, even easier.\n- The AI at times felt a little weak. On the roof of a huge building while its occupant is worried about an assasin? The guards will just tell you to get down. That guy will get fired. Escort missions can be a tad frustrating and even one time an enemy half way across the city somehow could still see me when he got stuck. I had to travel all the way to kill him as he walked into a wall.\n- Although there is a lot of variation, some of the missions types become quite stale towards the end.\n===========\n================\nAssassins Creed 2 is a great game.

All my hours came from purely grinding the main story alone. 33 hours. You don't have to feel you'll finish the game too soon if doing side quests aren't your thing. A continuation from Assassin's Creed, the sequal puts you in the shoes of Ezio. An assassin in Europe seeking not only revenge for his family but also answers as to why. He finds so much more and it's truly only comprehensible by playing or seeing for yourself. Ubisoft did it great and this game can easily last a hundred hours if you want to play casually. The story grows ever the more clearer, and your hatred from the modern day enemy only strengthens as you near conclusion. Buy it.

Took just a touch over 24 hours to beat, with doing some side stuff, but not all.\nThe only issue that lingered from the first game is the issue I had with physics, but in some cases it was worse in this one. If you kill a guy near a drop off, you will more  than likely fall. After the body hits the ground, it likes to flop, sometimes kicking you off the edge with it. It got annoying, but it was in no way game breaking (although it did kill me a couple times).\nI loved the feature with rebuilding Villa Auditore. It never got old, and I collected every armor and weapon because of it. Same with purchasing every painting. It was enjoyable.\nThe Parkour was a big improvement over the first one as well, but the camera was not always on your side. Especially during the Assassin's Tomb segments. You might be rushing up an area, then out of no where the camera does a turn, and you miss the jump. It didn't happen all to often, I did end up getting used to it, and taking my time helped.\nAll in all, this was a much better experience from the first game.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 20, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-03", "text": "Assassins Creed 2 is a massive improvement over the first game in every single way. The first game lacked so many features that make a game enjoyable and was just a barebones, repetitive experience (in my opinion). Assassins Creed 2 has good graphics and great music. The story is interesting with excellent voice acting. There's actually some really awesome parts and intriguing concepts in there, story wise. There's quite a lot to do in this game, there's the main story, side missions, viewpoints, codex pages, glypths and finding chests. There's also actually shops and items now, which is a welcomed addition. The world isn't really \"open world\" with a huge map, it's more just free roam inside a city with some outskirts, still cool though. The world really feels alive too. After a like an hour you unlock the ability to upgrade the Villa by spending money and collecting things which increase the value and in turn give you income. I LOVED this feature, like seriously. The more you spend on it, the more you get in return (over time), it's such a great concept.\nNow some things I didn't like. The climbing and movement still isn't the best, so many times your character jumps off of something when you don't mean to. The combat is average at best. At first it seems really cool with the awesome animations and counter attacks and dodges etc, but it gets old fast, especially against \"bosses\". You basically just either spam, throw an enemy and stab, or stand there and wait for the counter attack. Also if you've got allies you just keep walking up behind and stabbing, I don't know, it doesn't feel \"fun\" after awhile, it's just boring. I mentioned bosses, but the thing is, there's no real \"boss\" battles besides 1 or 2 big bosses but thats it and it's just spam them to death. The game also feels quite repetitive after awhile, and after like 60% of the game you'll have bought everything and money will mean nothing which sucks. Also the game crashed like 5-6 times during my playthrough.\nA few things that are personal opinion, some might like it, others (like me), didn't like it at all. There's no real customizable progression system here. I mean like, sure you unlock more stuff as you play, more tools to use and such, but there's no skill tree or way to change the game to suit your playstyle. There's also so many super lengthy jumping puzzles that get extremely tedious and frustrating after awhile. The Glypths..... like 80% of the puzzles seem impossible to solve without just random clicking or 200 IQ. I know many would disagree, but I think the stealth is quite poorly done and can be super frustrating, to me atleast. One small little thing and you fail and have to repeat, and unless you know the perfect way to do every stealth mission it's just trial and error, which gets annoying.\nThis is quite a small thing, but I don't like playing with subtitles because I feel that I spend too much time looking at/reading them that I'm not really watching the scene and feel less immersed, but the game almost forces you to use subtitles. There's so many times when Ezio and others talks in Italian so unless you got subtitles on you'll miss quite a lot of dialogue. One last thing, the map is really laggy, doesn't really matter too much though.\nOverall I think Assassins Creed 2 is a really solid game. I personally found most enjoyment in this game through the story and upgrading the Villa, everything else didn't really impact me that much.\nGraphics (For its style): 8\nSound: 9\nStory: 8\nGameplay: 6\nReplay value (depth, amount of content, variety in gameplay): 5\nOverall Rating: 7.5/10 - Solid, enjoyable game.", "hours": 25.0, "username": "Rise.", "products": 510, "early_access": false}

Assassin's Creed II is the crown jewel of Assassin's Creed series forever. Still this couldn't be beaten by other Assassin's Creed titles. Because Assassin's Creed II unbolted an intensive story and a charismatic character. Now let me share my thoughts on just a few aspects.\nAssassin's Creed II captures the story of one of the most charismatic assassin called Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. The story presents the origins of a Florentine nobleman who becomes an assassin. His every quest makes him more wise and efficient fighter. But all of a sudden his only aim becomes revenge and justice. So this is how you're gonna experience the life of a Florentine nobleman or an enraged assassin. I loved how they presented that what actually makes him an assassin from a prodigal person. Not just an assassin but generous and kind person. Also his journey was quite longer than i predicted. Like unpredictible sequences and countless conspirators around him. So that's what makes the story more intensive.\nAssassin's Creed II holds very simple gameplay. Like simplistic combat mechanism, parkour and other features. Actually i didn't really like the combat mechanism. Cause of counter attacks and executions but i loved all those assassination skills and moves. Besides, i was really fond of parkour. Cause i was able to parkour spontaneously without any deficiency which i get in those Assassin's Creed titles of nowadays. Also controls are pretty flowing and comfortable. So definitely the gameplay was really amusing for me.\nActually Assassin's Creed II has very improved visuals than Assassin's Creed I. Like world design got more sheer and characters looks more detailed. But as you know we are saying about a title which was released 7 years ago. So you know the drill.\nWithout any deficiency, I got flawless performance on Intel Core i5 4590, R9 390 STRIX and 6GB Ram. But i had to go through some unwanted crashes. Besides, i haven't found any error, bug nor stuttering. So i got nothing to yammer about it.\nAssassin's Creed II brought the most glorious and excellent background score called Ezio's Family. Even the Assassin's Creed Origins has it's version of Ezio's Family to honor those memories of Ezio Auditore. Most of the titles got different versions of Ezio's Family. So i guess you know how much intensive that music is. Besides, Assassin's Creed II has absolute illustrious OST. So humble thanks to Jesper Kyd for those.\nSo peeps, Assassin's Creed II worths much more than it costs to get when most of the $59.99 titles fails to impress you. If you're still not experienced with it then just get it now and i personally guarantee you that you won't be melancholy with it.", "hours": 19.7, "username": "T'Challa", "products": 70, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It does set the mold for what it means to live and die by the Creed - obedience to the cause and suppression of self-identity/ego.\nThis game flips that on its head, with a passionate protagonist who seeks (of his own volition) revenge against his family's murderers, gradually learning to be less brash and more merciful in a journey that spans 2 decades. He takes on the mantle of Assassin as a family tradition, and most of the etiquette seems to come to him naturally, with his uncle training him in the parts that don't. The story only gets more exciting, and always feels fresh.\nThe combat system is improved from the first game, in that health is shown - a trade-off for not being able to one-hit counter-kill enemies. Fistfighting has also improved (unless I just sucked at it in the first game), as countering is now possible, you get a good measure for how many hits the enemy can take, and you don't easily get swarmed by passers-by deciding to jump in. Double stealth blades are nice too, and taking out enemies nearby if they're close enough to the latest person you stabbed. This weapon, and another one revealed in the trailer, are story-related in a way that connects to the first game's protagonist (after the events of Bloodlines). Stealth and climbing haven't changed, aside from the jump climb which speeds up scaling buildings. You should buy this game mostly to enjoy how it feels to be able to swim, even if nobody else in Italy can.\nWould recommend, \u00a34 on sale for a story that took 50 hours to complete (and then some, for collectibles) is hard to beat.", "hours": 59.0, "username": "<Kl0n[d1k]E>", "products": 510, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "33230", "page": 33, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-11-12", "text": "Introduction:\nThe first assassins creed game was an interesting one. It had a great vision, but because it was the first it was difficult to make a perfect game. So after seeing that the first assassins creed was nothing more than \"okay\", they made a new one. Assassins Creed 2 is a game setting place in renaissance Italy. You play as Desmond Miles just like in the first game, and trough the Animus you follow the story of assassin Ezio Auditore.\nGameplay:\nThe free running experience that this game gives you is already a huge improvement from assassins creed 1. The free running is faster, more improved and less annoying. Though the fighting is still a bit boring to my experience. If you would fail making an assassination you will have to fight with the opponents instead. And that fighting mode is not very interesting, just very repetitive en not actually quite dull. The game is pretty well made and feels very playable but it also gives you a few bugs. I didn't find any game breaking bugs but there were a few bugs that could be pretty annoying. But no major problems there.\nStory:\nThe story sets place in both the modern time and renaissance Italy. In my opinion this is a great time to set an assassins creed game, and it is a very fun one. The story is about Desmond Miles going in the memory of his ancestor Ezio Auditore. You see his story throughout the game and you play as him of course. It is an interesting story but can also be a bit vague. Because after I played about half the game I thought to myself, what am I actually doing. And its fun that at the ending Ezio himself kind of has the same feeling. You go trough the game murdering Templars trying to understand why. And eventually you will get an idea. Still the story is difficult to follow sometimes. Also this game feels like it takes a few months in-game to finish. But it actually takes much longer. And the Aging of Ezio is a strange one, but because I don't to spoil I won't say too much about that.\nGraphics/Sound:\nThe graphics are pretty nice for a game that came out in 2009. It feels pretty new actually and it doesn't have any major texturing problems. It just looks great and it plays like it looks.\nPlay time/Replayability:\nI played this game for about 20 hours but i must say that after 10 hours the game already got a bit boring and just wanted to finish it. I wouldn't say that this is one of those games you want to fully complete and do all you can in. But I do see myself replaying this game a few years in the future. because of the story and fun gameplay.\nFinal Recommendation:\nI do really recommend you playing this game. though it might feel a bit long while playing you will have a lot of fun. And especially seeing that the game is pretty cheep nowadays, it is most worth it. I do recommend playing the original Assassins Creed first. because the story will make more sense, And you will appreciate that improvements allot.\nOverall i would give this game an 8.5 for it is a very good and fun game.", "hours": 18.8, "username": "De Geinige Gozer (de smerige)", "products": 121, "early_access": false}

I distinctly remember my excitement at seeing the E3 trailer and demonstration in the summer of 2009 followed by several months of intense anticipation at the thought of getting the game for Christmas.  That fateful day came when I first entered the beautifully rendered world of Renaissance Italy, and gaming for me has never really been the same.\nI can't kid myself and say that Assassin's Creed 2 hasn't aged a day in the intervening eight years; however, it has a timeless magnificance to it that still makes it not just a series highlight but one of my personal favorite games of all time.  In this game, Ubisoft perfected the world building that would go on to define the franchise as well as developed one of the most charming and sympathetic protagonists of all time in Ezio Auditore.  The story, while at times corny, managed to find a fine balance between the historical intrigues that form the backdrop with the overarching narrative of the Templars versus Assassins.  When this game came out, that overarching narrative still had weight and mystery to it that in my opinion was thoroughly stomped out after Assassin's Creed 3.\nSo, why play this game over a newer entry into the franchise?  Honestly, do it for the story, atmosphere, and immersion in history.  The gameplay certainly improved in later entries; however, upon reflection I can't help but think that something else was lost along the way.  This game, like few others, can truly transport you to a whole new world if you let it and make you yearn to relive a history that never existed.  You'll root for Ezio as he enacts his vengeance upon the Templars whilst simultaneously mourning the man he could have become had tragedy and a bit of predestination not interrupted his normal, aristocratic life.\nFor these reasons, I'd say that Assassin's Creed 2 is well worth the revisit for players such as myself and equally appealing to those new to the series and looking for a good entry to start with.  While it may be technically inferior to the latest titles, it has a soul and warmth to the story and world that in my mind far surpasses its technical limitations.  Chances are by the end of your twenty or so hours in the campaign, this game will make you want to research and learn more about the era of the Renaissance if just to feel closer to Ezio and his world.", "hours": 25.7, "username": "JokerFett", "products": 174, "early_access": false}

In 2017.\nHonestly, the game totally does not need my recommendations. I just want to talk about it!\nI want to start with saying I was taken entirely by surprise by how much I loved AC1 (also in 2017. Yes, yes, the ice did just melt over that rock I'd lived under for the last three thousand years...)\nAh! Not to hold that one person who'd read this (a generous estimate) in suspense, I've liked the game.\nBut, unlike the countless multitudes, I really disliked Ezio Auditore. He was just too much, and did not really feel like an Assassin. Altair was way better! Also, I felt that the beautiful trailer misled me. It promised a culmination of the game during the carnival, and the game did not finish there. And it was not as exciting as pictured, but still fun.\nAfter AC1 I expected a slick game very focused on a delivery of powerful, memorable moments with a few very, very interesting characters. What I got was a buffet of many wee little things. Gods, AC2 is bloated... the codex in no way replaces the masterfully done short stories of every Altair's target in AC1... Ezio has to do away with half-Italy, and most of them are forgotten the moment he stops his Latin prayer for the dead.\nWe also get stronghold, the butcher, the backer and the armor maker shops, the endless enforced womanizing, Don Ezio's gigantic family each demanding a collectothron that really did not help me to bond with the character and getting into the story for the first five hours of the game or so.\nThen the game improved, the bloat got managed, the florins poured in... and the addition of the Tombs was actually really cool. Except, yeah, the tombs were very cool, but the reward was only granted for all 6 done, and I did 4 and gave up on the fifth after a while. Alas, it was not for a casual player with an imprecise control of the keyboard. The multiple side-jumps it required with a tight timer and precise alignment... and that at the point in the game when the main story drums were beating, beating, beating.... gods, I wish I was better, but falling and swimming, falling and swimming, and starting over again 20 times defeated me.\nThe two DLCs jammed before the end sequence did not improve the game either, particularly the lackluster Sforza and Forl\u00ec one.\nThe Bonfires with Savonarola was more interesting, basically feeling like a tribute to Altair and AC1, with Ezio going through the collection of nine sinners seduced by the power of the Apple, but it highlighted the weaker aspect of the AC2 for me vs AC1. Obviously, the scenes were far more lavish and the characters far more interesting in AC1. But barring that, Altair was consistent. He had sort of a detached curiosity and a shade of doubt. He managed to convey a dispassionate regret of sorts. Ezio was all over the place, telling some men it was not their fault, telling another he should have resisted, and coming down hard on others.\nSavonarola\u2019s expose cutscene did not do the character justice at all. It was minuscule compared to the insane mad charisma the character possessed to through the whole city into the frenzy. Ezio\u2019s speech foreswearing vengeance and not following anyone was cheesier than the Dawn Will Come scene in Inquisition...\nThe other thing that Ubisoft saved the florins on, and should not have had imo was only aging Ezio, but leaving his crew's models unchanged over the years, not even their outfits. They did a good job stripping the bloom of youth from Ezio, and in an economical way. My imagination did readily supply that he was also heavier-set, more powerful but slower as we fast-forwarded through his thirties and entered his forties. Seeing everyone else frozen in time and gathered in the same cutscene with aged Ezio thus was jarring.\nI did like the mission design in the Savonarola DLC though, despite the ship stealth one making me scream in anger a few times, particularly when it seemed to go into the assassination screen, but then spit Ezio back on the roof instead not showing desynch.\nAnd right after foreswearing vengeance, Ezio changed his mind and raced after Rodrigo with glee.\nThat\u2019s were the DLC really hurt the game, because the beat of the events, the pace was unmistakable, and it just made me sad I lost it with the detour. I loved that end sequence, arriving battered and with half-shattered armor and shooting Rodrigo in the chapel from the high platform. Oh, how I wished I used the pistol more! Darn silly of me... thing is, even after two games, I have no idea how to throw the daggers, but shooting is easy.\nAnyway, the last battle was fun, but the sci-fi bit was an inferior take on the Battle Star Galactica's reveal...\nThen I got more of Mr.Dull and Miss Lucy, and that was it.\nI do wish the tombs were easier for a casual, because that would have improved my game a lot to have that Altair\u2019s tribute. And, in the end, I still feel that despite undeniably being very entertaining, AC2 does not hold up to the benchmarks set by the AC1 in terms of pacing, effectiveness of the cutscene, interesting characters and a compelling lead.\nBrotherhood will be next once I satisfy that other compulsive gaming impulse and play with a girl and with the dialogue choices, and stuff for a bit :)", "hours": 35.4, "user_id": "76561198373008989", "username": "Carefull", "products": 19, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 34, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-11-06", "text": "Assassin's Creed II is the sequel to 2007's Assassin's Creed and is one of, if not the, most highly regarded games in the entire series. But does it still hold up today? This is what I think of Assassin's Creed II.\nIn short, yes. Despite aging graphics, this game has lost none of its considerable charm. It's a huge step up from the first game, with much more variety in character models and locations. Florence and Venice in particular are well realized and it is simply wonderful moving through these beautiful cities. The atmosphere is wonderful and I enjoyed every moment. Jesper Kyd, the composer, compliments the game with a stunning soundtrack. Whoever thought that Renaissance Italy was a good next step for the series is a genius. It just works so well.\nThe story picks up from where it left off, with Desmond escaping from Abstergo with the help of Lucy Stillman. They wind up at a safe house with two more Assassins in the shape of friendly Rebecca Crane and sarcastic wise\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665Shaun Hastings. With a new Animus, Desmond must use it to relive the memories of another of his ancestors, this time the legendary Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze.  Ezio is my favourite Assassin in the series and is hugely popular with fans. His likable personality and charisma really makes you root for him. His story is tragic, as he is betrayed early on and embarks upon a quest of vengeance upon those responsible. We spend over twenty years in his shoes which showcases great character growth as Ezio ages. The story is much improved from its predecessor's and is substantially longer without dragging on.\nOne word here. Variety. As i said in my review of the first game, it was repetitive and it suffered as a result but not so here. There are many different mission types all through the game and there is rarely a dull moment. A particular highlight was deploying a prototype flying machine across Venice to infiltrate a highly guarded palace. Ubisoft were clearly listening to criticism and improved the sequel in every single department. Better story, more variety, Assassin tombs and Templar caches to find, more weapons, twin hidden blades, more fluid movement and faster climbing, an economy and more. It's still impressive to this day. Not to mention having your own town that you can upgrade and then earn money from. Money is broken as hell though, as you soon have way too much than you can spend and it quickly becomes irrelevant.\nSupporting characters also bring it to the table here, with historical figures such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Niccolo Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza and Bartolemeo D'Alviano all starring to varying degrees. Da Vinci in particular is your friend throughout and is constantly upgrading your gear, making the aforementioned flying machines and he and Ezio have a great relationship. It's all very well done indeed. Apart from Altair and Al Mualim in the first game, there wasn't anyone really worth mentioning. And there are more I haven't mentioned, including plot armour wielding Rodrigo Borgia as the main villain.\nThere are a few negatives worth mentioning of course. The camera likes to play games such as forcing Ezio to jump off ledges into thin air and making you fall often. This happens most in the Assassin tombs and can be frustrating. The combat is improved from the first but it is still very much a counter fest which can be charming in its way but is worth mentioning. Also the remix of the first game condensed in the admittedly brilliant Bonfire of the Vanities, tasking you to kill, you guessed it, nine targets. The execution is much better with more variety which shows what the first game could be in a potential remake. I was hard on it though in that game and thought I'd be hypocritical not to mention it here.\nAs you might be able to tell, I really love this game. I fell in love all those years ago playing this game for the first time and I enjoyed it even more this time around in what is my eighth run through. This is my favourite Assassin's Creed game and I still think it is well worth a playthrough even today. The gameplay and story are still great and is the precursor for the rest of the series. It might not have the slick presentation in Brotherhood, the robust size and ambition of 3, the style and panache of Black Flag or the hauntingly beautiful finish of Ezio's trilogy in Revelations, but in my heart this one still reigns supreme. Running in at around 20 hours, or 25-30 if doing everything, you owe it to yourself to pick this up if you haven't already. Play it, and play it now.\n\"Where other men blindly follow the truth, remember; nothing is true.\nWhere other men are limited by morality or law, remember; everything is permitted.\nWe work in the dark to serve the light.

Many may argue against me, but in my opinion, the story dragged on WAY too much. More than half of the campaign was not important and did not need to be included. Don't get me wrong, in the beginning, the story was incredible. I loved it. But as it went on, it got more and more sidetracked, and just got to the point where I was thinking: \"When is this game going to end?!\"\nCamera angles. Boy where do I start. Absolutely awful. I cannot express how much this destroyed the game. Assassin Tombs and Templar Tombs were more my enemy than the actual bad guy in the game. Immovable camera angles that changed every bar you jumped onto made the tombs a pain in the a** and less of a fun challenge. As perspective changed, so did the way the game interpreted your keyboard input, therefore, if the camera was behind me and I was pressing W, and it changed to be in front of me, I would then proceed to go backwards. Also, combat. DAMN. Wood, buildings, people, anything possible would stand right in front of the camera.\nAI. As a person who has played AC2, AC3, and AC4, I can tell you, the AI is buffed in this game more than any other. They are smart, which is not a bad thing, but it just gets stressful when it's you vs 50 men and they all attack at once.\nCONTROLS. Boy, was this a problem. Instead of simply displaying the button to press, you had to memorize which button was Legs, Hand, Head, and whatever other random unnecessary things they added. In the cutscenes, it would ask you to press the Hand button quite a lot. It takes me the length of the cutscene to figure out which button is the Hand. By then, I missed it, and now the cutscene is changed.\nCallibration. Man this needs work. When someone attacks, and I'm blocking, and I press the counter button, I expect Ezio to counter. Makes sense right? Not to Ubisoft. In Ubisoft's eyes, if you press the counter button, Ezio only counters if he chooses to, and if he doesn't want to, he'll just but his guard down for a few hits.\nI could go on, and on, and on about all of the bad things this game has to offer. I do NOT recommend this at all to anyone unless they want to play all AC games and/or they are being forced to play.\nOn a scale of 1-10, I would give this game a 4/10.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 36, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-10-30", "text": "Assassin's Creed II is a historically rich stab to the back.\nFeaturing a somewhat dual narrative, the game primarily follows the footsteps Ezio Auditore from the day of his birth.  A 15th century child of nobility living in Renaissance Florence, Ezio grows up a well meaning trouble maker just like his older brother as they often engage in brotherly shenanigans across the city.  But after his father and brothers are publicly executed whie he narrowly escapes, Ezio discovers that his family heritage is a part of an ancient Assassin order that pits itself against the conspiring Templar Order in a bid to safeguard humanity's free will from their conquest.  Taking up his father's blade, Ezio sets out to avenge his family and to erase the entire Italian branch of the Templars.  Riding shotgun on this adventure is Desmond Miles, a 21st century Assassin who is training by reliving his ancestor Ezio's life and memories with the help of a special machine called the Animus.  The story of ACII is a meandering mess with zero sense of pacing.  It has plenty of heart and human warmth to its characters, but the narrative surrounding them is just one Templar kill after another.  The primary story thread takes almost the entire game to be made apparent and the majority of the assassinations in the meantime are mostly unrelated filler to pad the game out.  But the worst story offender is the passage of time.  ACII takes place over the course of twenty-three years while showing absolutely zero signs of change in the world.  You wouldn't even know time passed if you weren't paying attention to the time stamps on the chapters.  There's a deeper running story thread as well though; something that predates the world as we know it, and that story is a lot of fun any time its head peaks above the surface.\nACII utilizes a unique movement and freerunning system.  So long as freerun mode is active, Ezio will make the decision to climb, leap, drop, or dive based on the direction the player is pushing him.  For the most part it works incredibly well, but sometimes Ezio will absolutely blunder any and all of the input you try to feed him.  It's not a perfect system but it works well.  Combat is depressinly barebones.  Swords, knives, hammers and more all come into play, but they're all functionally identical.  What's more, they're obsolete from the outset.  Ezio's hidden blade is intended for quiet kills, but can also block attacks and instantly kills anyone you use a counter attack on in combat.  Other tools like throwing knives and poison are even less efficient.  The game suffers from a considerable lack of challenge, a massive amount of filler treasure slathering the open world cities, and constant repitition of simple and relatively unengaging mechanics.  Money can be used to buy obsolete weapons and armor as well as change the color of your outfit, purchase art for your home villa, or invested in the villa itself to fix it up over time.  You can also buy maps showing you where more money is.  Even the vehicle sections meant to break up the monotony are monotonous.\nAssassin Creed II's flawed but saving grace; the presentation has just enough kick to really sell it.  The mix of synthetic, string, and vocal (sometiems operatic) music is so perfect as to be described as instant classic.  You'll visit major Italian cities and each one is sprawling, beautiful, and distinct.  People fill the streets, heralds bellow with the sound of news, and shops pine for attention and coin.  Texture and sometimes model quality is on the abhorrently low side, but this is compensated for by incredibly human and detailed animation.  All these combined make for a magical visit to 15th century Italy that just barely manages to help one ignore the significant shortfalls.", "hours": 46.5, "user_id": "76561198004162646", "username": "connordavisj", "products": 424, "early_access": false}

It took me around 55 Steam hours (inside the game they are only 37, I don't know why this difference) to beat the game at 100%, included \"The Truth\". I didn't go fast, I actually played enjoying it as much as possible.\n- the game is actually funny and the gameplay improved a lot compared to the first episode (especially with the ability to swim)\n- it's possible to select the italian spoken language, thanks to which all the people within the game are dubbed by real italian speakers. With the english spoken option they mostly talk with foreign-accent italian.\n- \"It's a-me, Mario!\". It deserves a plus only for this.\n- Monteriggioni management is nice\n- there's Leonardo Da Vinci and you interact with him and use some of his historical devices\n- historical locations are quite faithfully reproduced and you can actually learn their history and historical characters' history within the game\n- Venice has been reproduced in a nice way and you can even navigate with a Gondola. How cool is that?\n- at first it took me an hour just to make it work with a controller: I tried JoyToKey first, but the feeling wasn't so good, then I've found the file that people suggest to install in the forum. And thanks to that, it finally worked. But still, why the game isn't compatible with a controller? Are we supposed to play it with keyboard and mouse?\n- the game passes through Uplay, not directly via Steam. Yes, that's a negative thing to me.\n- selecting \"english spoken\", the characters still use some italian word, but with foreign accent. I would have preferred if they spoke only english instead of a broken italian.\n- also, selecting \"italian spoken\", EVERYONE speak italian, even Desmond and other american characters. It would have been better if it was possible to just have the right language for each character. English for the americans and italian for the italians.\n- not funny when you try to enter an area and you receive the message \"Unlock this map through the Ubisoft Club\". Especially if it's necessary for the 100%. Luckily it's easy to get it, but you have to search how it works (I usually avoid Uplay, so I didn't know anything about it) and have to spend Ubisoft Points (which you get also playing the game). I just don't see the reason for this, it could have been better if it was already accessible.\n- the audio volume is pretty low even at its maximum\n- the game gives you A LOT of money with treasures, quests and stuff, and all this money is quite useless. Especially treasures are completely useless inside the game, they are not needed for 100% and you don't need all that money at all.\n- dancing camera: that sometimes becomes nauseating, especially in tombs where you need to be really careful with your jumps. When you fall and die because of that, it's really annoying and a waste of time.\n- automatic Camera too is bothering sometimes, and it seems there is no way to deactivate it. It should help you showing you the path where you have to go, but it doesn't understand if you don't want to follow that path\n- Monteriggioni management could have been better: you end up finishing everything too quickly and the money later is useless.\n- after a while the game started to crash and close it for no reason. Then, after more hours, it stopped and worked fine. Strange.\n- I've found the main story to be a little too long. After a while I just wanted to finish it but the story was still going on. Too much is too much.\n- there isn't Rome (they later included it in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood)\n- if you lose your weapon in combat and can't find it on the ground anymore, the only way to retrieve it is to go back to the Villa and take it. That's a waste of time.", "hours": 56.6, "username": "Giant Lizard", "products": 343, "early_access": false}

I decided to buy the Ezio collection (2/Brotherhood/Revelations) because I never finished 2 on the console years ago. Hearing people claim this to be the best one has me worried for playing future installments as I would barely rate this a recommendation.\nBy far the biggest frustration for me was the controls. As a disclaimer, I played using an Xbox 360 controller. I dont know if it is better using KB/Mouse, but I figured since there is no real aiming needed, and its a console port, a controller is a safer bet. Well, I would say about...80% of the time Ezio did what I wanted him to do. The other 20% I was usually screaming at my monitor saying, \"WTF are you doing Ezio??!?!\" The game has a lot of timed sections, as well as tense moments when your fighting with guards. Having Ezio do something you dont want him to do can be REALLY annoying. To extrapolate on this, I'm fairly certain I took more damage from falling than from fighting over the course of the entire game.\nAlso the story. There were many times were it was just plain bad. One instance comes to mind is you are met with a problem of you needing a ticket to take a boat. Immediately upon knowing this a woman starts yelling for help: she is stuck on an island. You get a boat, and take her back to land. It turns out she just happens to be the owner of the castle? Like wtf? Why is the baroness of the entire area stranded on an island randomly? The entire middle part of the game is just fluff and errands. I feel like the game could have been told in a portion of the time and have done much better. Also in a reation to the story, Ezio felt really lifeless. Aside from the first few hours when his character is built up, the game does nothing to really make you care about him, hes essentially a lifeless killing machine.\nThats a lot of negative points. What about the positive? Well the parkour and animations are done well (when it works). The game does a good job (when it works) of making you feel like a badass stealthy assassin. Also, it feels like the classic mechanics that invented it all, the type of fighting and movement systems you see in more recent games (Batman and Shadow of Mordor) so its fun to experience the \"grandfather\" of these type of mechanics.\nThe graphics are also starting to show their age by modern standards. I was delighted to have the game work and look good (for its age) on my 4k monitor, but the graphics just look bland and foggy. Leftover console port issues I'm assuming.\nOverall, I recommend AC2 to experience the origins of Ezio's story, but I will not be doing a second playthrough.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 46, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-09-24", "text": "What a great game! It's my favorite of the series so far (I've played through the Ezio storyline and most of AC III at this point), and it still makes me want to go back and play it again.\nBasic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.\nGameplay and Controls 6/10:  Still one of the most challenging aspects of the game, especially for mouse/keyboard users, but as I was more used to the controls, having played the first game, it was not quite as difficult. The only things that took some getting used to were the combat system and the new blending system. Kill streaks were almost impossible for me to get at first because I just couldn't get the timing down. I think I only started to finally get them towards the end of the game when I had enough practice that I could set them up effectively. So, are the controls still challenging? Yes, but at least if you've played through the first AC, you should be familiar enough with them that only minor to moderate adjustments should be necessary. The controls for other forms of combat (ranged, for instance) are actually rather easy to get the hang of.\nGraphics 10/10:  As with the last game, the graphics are truly impressive. Not only are the cities and countryside that you move through absolutely gorgeous (like seriously, I want to go back in time and move to Italy now), but everything from the movement of the characters within the game to the movement of extraneous things like horses and carriages is tremendously realistic. Maybe not Halo level of realism, but frankly, I'm not looking for that in a game like this, so what they do have is amazing. It made the immersion in the world so much better than most other games that I've seen or played.\nStoryline 8/10:  I enjoyed the storyline of this particular game very much, even with the inaccuracies presented about the Templars. The history of the time period that it represents was otherwise rather accurate, and that made the game hugely enjoyable for me. Talk about history coming to life! The only part that I had any real trouble with was keeping up with how many years were going by in-game, especially since the characters were not made to look any older throughout. It actually came as a bit of a shock to me to realize at the end just how many years were contained within the story, even though I would see the new date flash by at the beginning of each new memory sequence. In addition to the great history aspect of the game, I found the fictional story within it compelling and complex enough that I did not lose interest for almost the entire game. (Towards the very very end when I was playing through the Bonfire of the Vanities quests, I started to get bored because that was not really  part of the main storyline, and it became tedious; but otherwise, the rest of the game was quite good.) I think, again, that the story within this game is the most enjoyable so far out of the installments that I've played. The only two parts that I didn't enjoy as much, were the two DLCs at the end of the game that come with the deluxe edition (the Battle of Forli, which was okay, but not great; and The Bonfire of the Vanities, which as I mentioned previously, became tedious rather quickly).\nCharacters 9/10:  Oh my word, the characters in this game are great! I didn't add a review of characters for the first AC because we really only dealt with Altair for the most part, and he was just okay. Ezio was actually personable and such a fun and likeable character that I truly loved playing as him. Not only that, but the other people (historical and fictional) around him in the game were so well done, that I wanted to interact with them even more. Leonardo Da Vinci is the best!\nOverall Rating 9/10:  As I said, this game is my favorite so far out of the AC games that I've played. The storyline was detailed, graphics were superb, characters felt more like my friends than just graphics on a screen, and I truly enjoyed becoming immersed in the rich historical world of Renaissance Italy and exploring it through the adventures of the vibrant character of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Highly recommend!", "hours": 54.0, "username": "samara_dubhlainn", "products": 20, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

And this time, it's a different one, but basically the same, and that's ok!  So, if there's a game that followed the original faithfully, it's Assassin's Creed 2, and there's a lot of interesting things going on with this game, not least of which is the inclusion of historical Italian archetecture along with some descriptions and stuff, so maybe, just maybe, someone will learn something...something other than how to stab people and walk away.  (So, it's basically like a New York Public school except you leave knowing something about the world!)  There's a lot to say about this game...the plot is excellent and unique, they've gone through the trouble of creating a universe worthy of the big screen (actually, in truth, much better than most modern movies), the game is fun to play, there's a lot to explore, etc, etc.  They've even included money, though you end up being a millionaire by the natural end of the game with nothing else to spend the cash on, but hey, it's a start, and game economies are hard to do well.  There are fun to find collectables (more fun than finding all the flags in AC1, I promise), and the game functions pretty well. I think I had, maybe 2 CTDs in 50 hours of play, so, not too shabby for a port.  And, the character is easy enough to control on PC, with uncontrollable camera angles only appearing a few times (a few times too many).  And, the saves are done well enough for a consoler.  The immersion in this game is also a big plus:  environmental sounds, city life, etc, making you just want to walk through the crowd from time to time.  All in all, a solid game, though certainly not an opus.

That being said, this review will attempt to not be viewed through the rose-colored glasses of Nostalgia. However be warned, this is a comprehensive review and will contain\n. Read below the TL;DR for the full review.\nAC II is a great game to play if your'e feeling nostalgic for the series, and the story is still captivating as ever. However, with the PC port the camera controls are extremely sensitive, the game will bug in some locations, and forced stealth missions may cause frustration. I played the game using a mouse and keyboard, I would recommend using a controller.  Overall, the game still maintains its ability to entertain and captivate. 8/10\n----------------------\n\nAssassin's Creed II is a continuation of the AC series that follows Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian noble who's life of leisure gets throttled into chaos after the false accusation and excecution of his father and brothers. After taking the mantle of \"assassin\", he hunts down the conspirators responsible for his family's destruction. The more he kills, the more Ezio comes to understand that the plot is bigger than just city corruption, and with the help of his uncle, as well as an interesting cast of supporting characters, Ezio grows into his role as assassin and attempts to discover a life-altering secret.\nWhen it first came out, AC2 was my favourite of the developing series. A lot of the combat from ACI was drudgy, somewhat difficult, and unfair at times since it was easy to be swamped with enemies. AC2 provides not only more weapons for customizability of how you play the game, but also offers an easier overall combat system that includes techniques like dodging, strafing, and probably the most useful, COUNTERING.\nCountering is a lifesaver, especially when dealing with multiple enemies. However, this version is a PC port, and as I played it with a mouse and keyboard, countering and chain killing took some effort of timing. The most difficult aspect of combat was the item wheel itself. Part of this problem has to do with mouse sensitivity which I will get into later, but the fact that you could choose, let's say, the Sword, and yet because of sensitivity you'll end up picking the Coin Purse or Double Blade.  It's more annoying than unreliable, but it causes the player to have to focus more on easing the mouse to pick the weapon they want, instead of enjoying beating up bad guys.\nAnother highlight of AC2 was an improvement of the detection system. We all remember how annoying it was to run slightly above a snail's pace and the whole city was upon you in AC1 right? Thankfully, AC2 allows you to run at full sprint through the vast and beautiful cities of Italy without so much as maybe causing a merchant to drop a box or two. It's a nice change of pace and makes traveling from point A to point B much quicker and more satisfying than having to worry about triggering half of the city guards.\nThat being said, being on rooftops still angers the guards, so take caution (even if you are wearing a cape that reduces noteriety) or simply assassinate them when they're not looking.\nGameplay isn't too much different than AC1: free-running and assassination are still the main functions of the game. Viewpoints are available to find quests, codex, or treasures and open the map for more visibility as well as guard and hiding spot tracking.  However, AC2 refreshes the formula by adding a lot more content and techniques to free-running and climbing.\nFirst off is the idea of fast climbing. It's actually fast. I recall in AC1 that even holding R2 didn't make you go much faster. This is greatly improved in this game. There's even a reach climb technique that is taught later in the game that helps you jump gaps on walls for easier climbing of certain buildings.\nIn terms of content, AC2: Deluxe edition contains most DLC that was released for the XBOX editions. This includes:\nExploring the great cities of Italy is more exciting than ever with Races, Beat Up, and Courier missions that take you across the cityscapes, not to mention the eventual\n.\nThe game also allows you to hire factions to distract or engage guards, so Ezio can sneak into places he may not necessarily be allowed.\nHere's the downside to some of the gameplay though and it's two things: the\nand\n.\nIf you're someone like me who really gets into the atmosphere of a game like this, you're most likely using the camera to make sure you won't trigger a guard that could potentially cost you the mission, or you need to see the next possible area you can climb to reach your goal. Let me say this, using the PC camera with a mouse and keyboard:\n.\nThe main issue with the camera is the sensitivity of the mouse for the PC port; I do not know if this issue is fixed by using a controller. As soon as I started the game and touched the mouse to look around, it was almost dizzying how sensitive it was. Looking into the options there is NO OPTION to change mouse sensitivity. You just have to deal with it. This can cause a multitude of problems including glitching into walls and roofs due to weird and quick camera angles.\nThe other issue is forced stealth missions. This is most likely a personal opinion as I get easily frustrated with a game if I have to do something over more than three times. This happens a lot in this game towards later in the game's plot. Let it be known that I don't have an issue with forced stealth missions. For a game like AC it should be a staple that the player doesn't just run in and kill everything and get out without consequence. However, making a requirement that you can't be detected at ALL can make for an interesting gameplay style but also a frustrating one.\nThere are at least four forced stealth missions in this game, meaning if you get seen by a gard (indicated by a red marker) it's instant desynchronyzation. Granted, this mechanic did make me have to be more clever in HOW I completed the mission, but there were times where the game want's you to be a specific KIND of clever, and doesn't quite give you inference on how to do it. It got to the point where I desynched roughly 9 times on one aspect of a mission, and it made me not want to complete the game.  That last sentence is purely from my own experience, but I know that strict stealth can cause frustration, and it makes an interesting scenario just not fun and dreadful when it's expected in the future.\nThe story in this game speaks for itself, and the beautiful landscapes and cityscapes of the major cities of Italy makes it all the more breathtaking. Artistically speaking, the look and feel of the game is much improved on the first AC, despite having some minor setbacks in terms of gameplay mechanics. I definitely enjoyed it and is well worth replaying for all the collectibles available.", "hours": 31.4, "username": "DatHylian", "products": 88, "early_access": false}

However, I can't reccomend it for a few reasons. For starters, combat, which has tons of different options and features added in for no good reason, just gets reduced to countering attacks by the opponent. Enemies quickly become skilled enough to block your attacks and grabs, meaning that the only way to do anything to them is with a counter (which is an instant kill). The boss fights are even lamer - nothing but chain grabbing. You grab them, punch them a few times, and while they're getting up, you grab them again. This works 100% of the time, and could be done forever. I didn't take any damage at all in the final boss fight using this method, nor did I do anything other than grab him. It's worse than wobbling in Melee.\nClimbing is a super cool mechanic at first, but quickly gets old. It's honestly all the same and really just boils down to holding up, left, or right. No interactivity at all, and it can be painfully slow.\nMissions in this game are usually just frustrating. Almost every mission is just \"go assassinate some guy\" or \"follow some guy\", the latter being incredibly annoying. This gameplay is fine at first, but when it becomes almost every mission in the entire game, it gets old fast.\nMy biggest problem is the lack of good stealth elements. The things is, all the groundwork exists there for it to have strategic stealth sections much like Dishonored (a game I wholeheartedly recommend). This would actually be quite interesting and fun, but it doesn't exist. There's almost no strategy to any of the missions and trying to be stealthy usually isn't your best option anyway.\nThe story is pretty meh. Nothing to see there.\nIn conclusion, this game isn't that good. The only good parts are the cool animations and the well-designed world, but the actual gameplay is repetitive and uninteresting.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 53, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-08-09", "text": "When the first Assassin's Creed game released in November of 2007, it brought with it an entirely new genre that has yet to be replicated. Fighting as an Assassin in the era of the Third Crusade, battling the opposing Templar faction while seeking a legendary religious artifact that's known as a Piece of Eden; all the while having a modern story element entwined. It's no surprise that the game exploded into the 12-release franchise that we know today. Although the first installment was deemed unique, yet repetitive, 2009's Assassin's Creed II raised the bar by attempting to change the formula, while still keeping the base aspects of the series intact.\nEquipped with a new protagonist and era, players will now find themselves in the robes of Ezio Auditore da Firenze; a young Italian whose home lies within Renaissance Italy. The modern day segments, while limited, still revolve around Desmond Miles; a bartender who was captured by Abstergo, a corporation that created the high-tech piece of equipment known as the Animus that allows its users to relive their ancestor's memories. It's revealed that Abstergo, who are actually the current era Templars, chose Desmond in particular as his Assassin ancestors knew the whereabouts to the Apple; a Piece of Eden that contains legendary power. Early on, Desmond ends up escaping Abstergo with the help of some current era Assassins, and they hold up in an abandoned warehouse as Desmond continues searching for the highly coveted religious artifact.\nWhen you talk to Assassin's Creed fans about their favorite character, you're most likely to hear the answer \"Ezio\" more often than not. The classy Italian ladies man with a thick accent and lucious locks is undeniably a fan favorite, and it helps that his presence spans the course of three games. Assassin's Creed II takes place from 1459, Ezio's birth, through 1499, landing the beloved protagonist at age 40 by the end of the title. So as to not give much away about the intricate plot, let's just say that Ezio's tale is one of loss, revenge, and acceptance. His father was an Assassin, a fact that was hidden from Ezio until he was about 18 years of age, and from there onward he became part of the historical guild himself.\nAs this franchise is one that is known for it's historical accuracy, at least to a point, Renaissance Italy works well within the universe. There are a handful of locations to visit, including a large, sprawling Venice and Florence, as well as many well established landmarks. Along the way, Ezio also meets many well known figures from the era; most notably a young Leonardo Da Vinci. As Ezio upgrades his home villa, he can purchase real-to-life Renaissance paintings to adorn its walls, and when examined they come with factual tidbits about the pieces. Needless to say, the game is brimming with historical accuracies and educational material, all the while throwing a unique spin on some of the actual events that occured.\nIf you've never played an Assassin's Creed game, you're in for a bit of a surprise. The gameplay is unlike any other title on the market, with free-flowing parkour in an open world full of missions and dangers. You will be tasked with climbing to some of the highest points of the game to unlock view points, which subsequently reveal a larger portion of the map; afterward, you can perform a signature Leap of Faith off of the top into a bale of hay. In some areas, you will be required to be stealthy and unseen, avoiding guards at all cost. Other times, it doesn't matter and you can go in blades blazing. Now if you have played a game in this franchise before, specifically one of the newer ones, you're going to be frustrated. Assassin's Creed II's climbing system is primitive at best, frustrating at worst, but still not as raw as the original title.\nRegretfully, there are a few more pain points that extend beyond the climbing mechanics. One is the notoriety system, wherein if a guard sees you commit a crime, your wanted level is raised by a fraction; this includes accidentally stumbling into some bumbling idiot carrying a box and making them drop it. To lower your rating, you must remove wanted posters, bribe heralds, or kill officials. If guards see you do any of these things, they will raise your notoriety level back up to where it was, and potentially begin conflict with you. The battle system can also be irritating at times, as it's not fluid in any sense of the word; it's also incredibly dull, leaving it better to avoid conflict at all cost. Despite the array of weapons you can purchase, you will only find yourself using a handful of them throughout the game; a good chunk of them are absolutely useless filler.\nAside from its 13-15 hour campaign, there's a plethora of content to keep gamers busy for dozens of hours if they wish to seek ultimate depth from the title; parkour race missions, beat em' ups, view points, collectible feathers and symbols, chests to plunder, courier missions, Assassin tombs, Templar lairs, and more. Players can even upgrade Ezio's armor, weapons, pouches, and homestead. Full completion never feels like a chore as the beautiful landscapes are enough eyecandy to keep even the most ADD of gamers appeased; although the Assassination Contracts can become a bit repetitive after a while.\nAs far as the entire franchise goes, Assassin's Creed II is a classic in its own right, and a beloved favorite by many fans of the series. The story is remarkable, the characters are lovable, and the entire experience is extremely memorable. There are a few pain points here and there, such as the outdated and sometimes frustrating climbing system that can take some time to get used to. As well, the amount of idiots carrying boxes that stumble into you, causing you to get in trouble, is ridiculous. Needless to say, there is obvious room for improvement. However, the game runs great on PC, and given its age the graphics aren't terribly outdated. If you own a console, I highly suggest picking up The Ezio Collection; while the mechanics aren't updated, the textures and lighting have been given a breath-taking overhaul, and the game feels brand new once again.\nThe Horror Network\n|\nClick for Gore", "hours": 14.1, "username": "The Horror Network", "products": 2621, "early_access": false}

The game still doesn't have a Quickload or Quicksave function and still uses checkpoints, but checkpoints are regular while pursuing the story and readily available while simply exploring.  The game's interface and menu systems, while a little difficult, are far more user-friendly.  Character movement is much improved, and camera issues are mostly gone.

I cared about what happened, even if the story wasn't such a revelation to me personally.\n- It worked like a charm on Win10 with my controller. No technical problems at all, no Uplay problems either.\n- It has tons of fun stuff to do. Very differentiated quests (mostly killing, but fun!).\n- YMMV on this, but it's an easy game. I don't like to stress too much over games, and it was ok for me.\n- Collecting things makes sense, they are relevant to the story.\n- Double air assassinations never get old.\nCONS\n- Towards the end, the story took over and the gameplay was a bit mechanical.\n- Too many timed quests (and close shave at that) for my taste. If I wanted to constantly worry about the clock ticking, I would be a track athlete.\n- Video- audio was not synchronized in many of the cut scenes.\n- Guards can be annoyingly stupid, blind and deaf.\n- Ezio has a ladder fetish. No, really, just walk by them and he gets an urge to climb.\n- Jumps and reaches have game logic. 2 meters away, if the game needs it? No problem. 40 cm if the developers didn't want it that way? Nope.\nThis was my first AC game, and now I'm itching to play all of them.\nP.S.

Throughout the game you'll visit different cities with different information on different locations, buildings at the time of late 15th century, and both fictional and actual real people.\nBesides from the amazing adventure and good graphics at the time of actual release, game does offer you some side activities that actually would either contribute to the story (graphs' puzzles come to mind), serves mostly to enlarge your pocket to ensure you can get better armor, weapons, ranged ammunition, and smelling salts to restore your lost health, or get you a amazing armor set while doing the side activites that involve Assassins' Seals. Later on in the game, you can get involved rebuilding a villia that seen better days has passed and look run down and murky that later, with investment, repay you later and build up its intrastructure as well unlocking new areas to explore as florins ticks in at treasure box.\nAll in all, this game is perfect for those who want to be introduced to the franchises, if anyone chose not to do the very first game, and beloved Ezio series and Desmond's misadventure.

Namely, this time you get your own house (villa) and have various accessories to collect in order to improve it, as well as your character\n+ Very interesting conspiracy story, with many real facts mixed with fictional ones, which made for a good history lesson in Renaissance Italy as well\n+ Many interesting characters, both allies and enemies, based on real historical persons, with the best one being the main character, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Getting to interact with Leonardo Da Vinci was also great and the way he was portrayed was very good too\n+ Many weapons and ways of assassination were added, giving the game a bigger variety in gameplay\n+ Huge and detailed map, which included Florence, Venice and a small part of Rome, as well as some smaller cities, each containing a big variety of secret places too\n+ Hearing the characters speak in English, but with an Italian accent was funny\n+ Mind-blowing ending, this was probably my favorite part, since I didn't expect it to include a twist of these proportions and I found took the game to a whole different level\nCons:\n- Despite the many added side quests to keep you busy and the improved weapon and assassination system, the main gameplay's structure remained the same as the first title. You follow someone until a certain point or you fight or you run, that pretty much summarizes what you do for the whole game, failing to avoid repetitiveness to a certain point, although not as much as the first game (an aspect that the Arkham games managed to handle better, in my opinion)\n- The fights and assassinations, though stylish and cool to watch, felt a bit too easy and not much challenging (with some exceptions)\n- The soundtrack was just OK, in fact it might be the only field that I found weaker than its predecessor, since the first game had a very good theme when you were being chased, absent here. The tracks were good generally, but mostly forgettable\nThese minor flaws aside, Assassin's Creed II is a great game and I definitely recommend it, be it for the various added improvements or to get a detailed taste of Renaissance Italy, mixed with conspiracy schemes.\nThat said, I still consider the franchise's ancestors, the Prince of Persia games, to be overall better in structure and more fun, so it's a pity Ubisoft discontinued them to make way for this series, but since things turned out this way, be sure to step into Ezio's footsteps and learn the ways of the assassin!", "hours": 63.5, "username": "Buttman", "products": 509, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

You took on the role of Desmond Miles, a modern era bartender with a somewhat shadowy past, but seemingly more interesting ancestors.\nA callous, uncaring scientist, Dr. Vidic, at a research firm called Abstergo forces his prisoner, Desmond, under the supervision of his subordinate Lucy Stillman, to use a machine called the Animus, which is able to retrieve Desmond's genetic memories and visualize them. One of Desmond's most important ancestors, at least to Abstergo, was known as Altair, a Middle Eastern man living in the 12th century Holy Land. Altair was one of the Assassins, whose sworn enemies were the Knights Templar.\nWhile the details of the epic story are best experienced for yourself, suffice to say, Altair is able to safeguard the Holy Land against the Templars, but Abstergo has a hidden, sinister agenda for the information the Animus reveals...\nAssassin's Creed II continues the story just seconds from where the first game left off; Lucy and Desmond, revealed to be modern-day Assassins, realize that Abstergo has become a very dangerous place and that they must leave quickly; Lucy escapes with Desmond to a secret hideout, where a new Animus is set up.\nTogether with Lucy and a new support team of a historian and technician for the Animus 2.0, Desmond explores the life and times of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young man in late-15th century Renaissance Italy, and experiences his trials and tribulations first hand. Ezio, who discovers his Assassin heritage fairly early, gets many opportunities to test out, among others, that most important weapon of the Assassins, the wrist-mounted Hidden Blade, which can kill a man before he knows he's in danger. Over the years, Ezio has many experiences, good and bad, and assassinates many behind the conspiracy against his family, who were killed or traumatized in the opening hours of the game, and attempts to subvert a plot that could threaten the entire world.\nEzio makes a home base at his family's villa, and is able to repair and renovate many aspects of it using the money he finds or earns in his journeys, and is even able to make more from the visitors to the shops and amenities of the surrounding town. Ezio, and through him Desmond and the player, adventures through many regions of Italy including Ezio's home city of Florence, Venice, and the Tuscan countryside. With his uncle Mario and several other Assassins, Ezio begins to piece together the mysteries surrounding several ancient, extremely powerful artifacts and strive to keep them from the Templars.\nThe graphics in this game are simply beautiful; review sites have said this is the best-looking free-roaming game ever, but I believe it's about tied with Grand Theft Auto IV. The animations, just like in that game, are pretty spectacular; you'll rarely if ever see Ezio miss a nook or \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 in the wall while climbing unless you cause it to happen. Each one of his movements is accounted for in the architecture.\nFree-running, sometimes called Parkour, makes its return in this sequel. Letting nothing stop you from going forward, always finding a way over or under obstacles, the several locales that Ezio finds himself in are very fun to navigate. With methods created in the first game, you as Desmond control Ezio's movement, fighting, climbing and jumping with the greatest of ease. It can be very dangerous when you run out of rooftop during exploration or a chase, and should you fall, you don't automatically heal in this installment; you must use pain-numbing smelling salts.\nThis is definitely one of the best games I've ever played; from beginning to end, I was greatly entertained, from the great combat to wonderful exploration to shocking denouement, and I was pleasantly surprised at the portrayal of the real historical figures I met. If I could give this six stars on my established scale, I would, but I give this five stars.", "hours": 86.1, "username": "EazyCheeze1978", "products": 929, "early_access": false}

This includes the Hidden Gun, the ability to swim, a graphics overhaul, some flying mechanics and many refines to combat.\nGameplay\nAssassin's Creed II favors stealth over full-on combat.\nYou can run, ride horses, swim, or use paddle boats to get to your destination.\nParkour has been improved from the first game, which allows for smoother and faster movement and many different animations have been added from the first.\nCombat\nThe combat in this edition of Assassin's Creed, has been improved from it's predecessor, becoming more fluent with appreciated changes, however there is still a sense of button mashing in there and does not require skill which i prefer.\nBeing able to use the Hidden Gun, will bring a whole new advancement to the game's combat.\nYou can now purchase armor and weapons, which will increase health and change Ezio's appearance.\nStory\nAs stated above, you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze.\nHe starts off the game young and reckless, until his family is hung because of templars wanting to take control. Before his father dies, he learns that his father was an Assassin. Ezio goes to collect his fathers gear and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Mario's villa in the countryside. As he assassinates his targets, he identifies the mastermind of the plot: the Spaniard Rodrigo Borgia. In modern day you play as Desmond Miles ,who is the ancester of Ezio Auditore, and you are on the run from the modern day templars. Unlike the first game there are more things to do in modern day suc as some missions and a little free roam.\nGraphics\nConsidering the game was released in 2009, it doesn't have the best graphics.\nColors are quite bland, shadows are horrible, and render distance is short.\nWith a SweetFX patch, and with 4k DSR 60fps, the game doesn't look that bad.\nOptimization\nOptimization is quite poor in this game.\nFrame rate will jump around a lot, no matter the settings you use.\nBugs\nEnemies will attack you even when you block them.\nBad performance.\nPersonal Experience\nBeginning of the game is rather boring, and didn't interest me all that much.\nOnce I got to the middle of the game, I really liked it and was really interested.\nPerformance wise, I was playing on a RX 480 with everything maxed out at 2560x1080p. I could easily manage 60fps+.\nThe game was a great improvement from the first game.\nPros\nInteresting story.\nLoveable main character.\nGreat landmarks.\nCons\nPoor performance.\nMicro-stutters.\nBland coloring.\nConclusion\nGreat improvement over the first game, and gets interesting once you're through half of the game.\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the Assassin's Creed franchise. However if you own a xbox one or ps4 i would reccomend buying the ezio collection as there is improved graphics and it also comes with the direct sequels of ezio's life.

The freerunning was still at its infancy here and it requires pressing 2 keys to do it ( which, naturally, brought a lot of problems until they figured a way to make it work with just one key) - so expect a lot of frustration. Plus, there's the keyboard and mouse aspect... These games were developed for consoles and controllers, not KB&M - and it definitely shows. Still, you can mostly get around this except for a few areas where the lack of a joystick shows.\nStory wise, it's fairly good: Enzo's a likeable guy and you get to meet a lot of characters from the history books. They did overdo it a bit when putting Machiavelli as an assassin - but it's something you can overlook. There's also a \"vibe\" that you just haven't seen since AC3 - which mainly comes from Desmond's story arch and his encounters with the precursors.\nSoundtrack is classic Jesper Kyd...nuff said.\nOverall, 8/10.

I wanted to relive good memories of having played AC2 when it first came out.  I first bought this game for Mac but it doesn't work on that format despite supposidly being availiable on that platform.  I'm lucky enough to have bootcamp so I installed it on the windows side of my computer.  It worked for 3 hours then Ubisoft updated to require you to have access to their Uplay system.  It requires you to create an account with them which they will use to spam your inbox.  I gave them an email I don't really use anymore and then the CD key was locked to that email.  When I tried to switch it to my current email, I was locked out of the ability to play the game or change to the original email account when I try to log in to Uplay.  I bought the game and I'm denied the ability to even play in offline mode despite having my product key and having paid for the game.\nBefore I bought this I felt like I was honestly doing a bad thing like giving money to a hate group or a drug cartel and I wholehardity regret giving Ubisoft my money.  They will have you pay and deny you access to what you rightfully purchased.

Oh the soundtrack... it really is amazing and helps a ton when it comes to immersion.\nThe game brings historical characters to the table then adds a little conspiracy into the mix, which makes for probably one of the best thought out storylines in a game yet. The series has just failed to deliver in the same way with all of the other games. I had this game before it was on steam and have completed it probably 4 or 5 times, and i will still end up replaying it again at some point.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 84, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-04-02", "text": "Assassin's Creed II is a perfect example of how to make a sequel. There's definitely a good reason why this one is a fan favorite. The basic story is that Ezio Auditore is seeking vengeance and is trying to rid Italy of the Templars. He soon uncovers a bigger plot that will affect more than just Italy. Now, just like with every other Assassin's Creed game, this one takes place in a historic location and time period. This time, we dive into Italy during the period of rebirth, The Renaissance. Before I talk a little more about Italy, let's go talk about the combat.\nNow, if you've played Assassin's Creed, you'll know that the combat system in that one was pretty good, but they've definitely made improvements. Weapons, for starters, have definitely been given an upgrade. There's a multitude of weapons, like maces, hammers, swords, daggers, throwing knives, and even a wrist pistol! There are different tiers of certain weapons (Mainly swords) that have different stats. Some add more damage, while some are quicker. In my opinion, the sword is the way to go. It's kind of like Mario in Mario Kart, generally good all around at all of the stats. One very noticable difference from the first game is you know have TWO hidden blades.\nTwo hidden blades allow you to stealthly take down enemies easier and faster! Now you can kill two guys with one go. The hidden blade mechanics have also been improved. You can jump off legdes to take down enemies, you can effectivally use them in fights (unlike in AC 1), and you can also ledge-shank guards. This simple change is one of the great improvements from the first game. Now, general combat has also changed. It's more brutal, gives you more freedom, and works really well. Also, more death animations have been added, to satisfy your bloodlust.\nIf you remember just a little bit ago, I mentioned a 'wrist pistol'. What exactly does it do, you might be wondering. Well, it definitely kills people. The wrist pistol is a ranged weapon that you get later on in the game and is definitely not something you saw in AC 1. In terms of usefulness, it's pretty nice. It's definitely not something you'd use for being steathy, because it's loud as heck! It's great for clearing out those annoying rooftop archers though. Still on the subject of weapons, throwing knives are still in the game and they really haven't changed from AC 1. Some more weapons that have been added include a poison blade and a smoke bomb (Which is kind of a weapon, but it can't really hurt anyone xD).\nAlright, so what's the enemy AI like? Well, honestly, the combat is really easy in this game. There are a couple of difficult sections, but they're not that hard. The combat is still fun so, there's that. The AI isn't the brightest AI, but they're definitely not the stupidest. There are a few different enemy times, such as archers, your standard guard, armored dudes, and heavily armored dudes (Which can be a pain).\nOkay, so we've got all of the combat stuff out of the way, now let's move on to some more stuff. So, the game has a system known as 'notoriety', which is just the level of ablitiy the guards have for recognizing you. If you have high notoriety and a guard sees you, they'll go after you. If you have a lower level of it and stay around for too long, they'll probably go after you. In order to get rid of this, you have to remove wanted posters, bribe people spreading the word about, and sometimes even kill a fool. The system overall is pretty cool and works well. It can also make you more careful as what you do.\nAnother great thing about this game is its level variety. It never really feels like you're doing the same thing! Sure, there are assassination missions where you're given a target and you've got to assassinate them but hey, you don't have to go around and collect intell like in AC 1. There are a couple of things you do a couple of times, but the levels are unique. Without spoiling anything, there's a level that takes place in a carnival, as well as a level where you fly a glider!\nYet another great thing about this installment is the characters. The characters are very well-written and well voiced! You'll notice a few famous faces in your journey. The characters are very fun and you build a connection to them over time. Also, the main character, Ezio, is a really great character. He's not dull (*cough* Connor *cough*) and he, like the story, is very well-written. Also something to note is the music. The music is absolutely amazing and is probably my favorite soundtrack from any AC game (followed by Black Flags).\nWe've basically covered everything here except for one thing...the map. Just like in real life, Italy is beautiful in the game. The graphics are pretty great for its time and the maps look great as well. The maps you'll travel through are pretty large and very diverse. You can travel through them by boat (Yes, you can actually swim in this one) or by horse. You can also fast travel back to each of the locations. I've personally never been to Italy, but I've seen pictures and it definitely looks accurate!\nOverall, this is probably the best game in the series! The characters are amazing, the music is great, the story is incredible, and the combat is so good!  If you haven't played this game, I HIGHLY recommend checking it out. I definitely recommend starting for the first game, but you'd probably be fine starting from this one too.\n(Also, just note that this game does use UPlay)", "hours": 19.9, "user_id": "76561198153716024", "username": "Space", "products": 187, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 85, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-04-01", "text": "Assassin's Creed 2. So this game came out just 2 years after AC1 and when this game came out... fans loved it, critics loved it... and even today it's known as the best AC game ever made. Is it?\nStory:\nSo the story takes place from 1476 - 1499. It starts off with Ezio... being born? uhh... skip 17 years later and Ezio's father and brothers are killed by a family friend Uberto Alberti. Ezio, escaping the city of Firenze with his mother and sister, go to Monteriggioni and meet his Uncle Mario. Mario teaches Ezio to become an Assassin. Ezio, like Altair, has to kill a certain number of templars and along the way, he becomes wiser and learns more tricks. So along the way you meet people like Leonardo da Vinci, Paola, La Volpe, Sister Teodora, Antonio and Rosa and also Bartolomeo d'Alvanio. In the end, Rodrigo Borgia, leader of the Templar order, becomes Pope to obtain the staff of eden and eventually takes the apple of eden from Ezio. However, Ezio then takes back the apple and the staff and uses it to enter the vault where he then finds out about the future, which would be the end of the world.\nThe story... like AC1 goes from being 1 thing to another thing entirely. AC1 went from being Altair just doing it because he wanted to rank back up to actually trying to find out the meaning of the creed, bringing peace in all things. Ezio goes from just wanting vengeance to wanting to bring freedom to Italy.\nGameplay:\nEverything from AC1 is back, and you don't need weapons or items to do certain abilities, you just need to learn them through people like Mario or Rosa. Leonardo also uses Altair's codex pages to upgrade the hidden blade to have a poison blade and a hidden gun. The gun doesn't really work too well... but it was the 1st time doing this... also everything other game that had a gun was an actual gun. Not a small tube in your wrist. But the parkour is the same, tweaked slightly to be easier and better to control, stealth is way better this time and you don't need to worry about running around the entire city trying to lose the guards and you can finally swim in this game. Yay. You're also able to upgrade your life meter by obtaining better armour or having Leonardo decipher codex pages.\nCollectibles:\nI didn't talk about this in my AC1 review because I didn't really bother collecting anything. I don't think it does anything... I could be wrong. But in AC2, you need to collect 6 assassin seals to open a gate in Monteriggioni that will allow you to take Altair's armour. Unlike collecting feathers and codex pages... the seals are very fun to collect. You go through different assassin tombs and it feels a lot like something out of Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones. Codex pages... ehh, you need to kill a few guards and just loot it like you would with a dead body (in the game not real life). Feathers can go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 themselves. I want to have fun when collecting, assassin tombs are fun. Everything else isn't. Is Altair's armour worth it? ehh... it looks nice but it's no different to having the most powerful armour in the game along with Leonardo's life meter upgrade.\nI probably won't talk about how it was killing each target because in this game it's set out similarly... although there was 1 I really did enjoy. Leonardo's flying machine in Venice then killing Carlo Grimaldi was the best assassination mission in AC2.\nSo is this really the best Assassin's Creed game? I personally don't think so. But I can see why people think it's great. The graphics are much better, much more colourful and vibrant this time and the soundtrack... oh that is the best thing in this game... and the story is far better in this game. It's also got 14 sequences. So if you're playing this for the first time... it'll take you a while to complete. For me, only around 20 hours to complete the story and 5 hours messing around doing nout.", "hours": 25.1, "username": "Alta\u00efr", "products": 59, "early_access": false}

The side missions are useless, Ezio will often get too excited and jump off buildings, grab onto boxes and generally make your life unpleasent. The crowning acheivment of pain is the story. There is no real direction, years pass for no reason, Ezio is likeable enough but most everyone else is just boring. This would be fine if the story ended when it should. There is a point where you have a boss fight and a Wizard of Oz moment (and you are here, and YOU are here and you...) Then it keeps going. You go save a town that you have not been in at all, as a favor for a person you met once. Then once thats done you go to ANOTHER town and have a whole slew of people to kill. It. Doesn't. End. If the gameplay was good enough and enjoyable the long story would be great, but Assassin's Creed I gameplay is only good for about 9 sequences, after that, it loses most of the charm it had.

It's a great, unique story with dynamic characters and fun gameplay and it's evident that a lot of time and effort was put into making this game.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 94, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-03-04", "text": "So after rediscovering this series with Assassin's Creed 4, I've decided to play through all the main games in the collection until I've caught up with where the series is at now. I won't be reviewing the first Assassin's Creed game because I played it on console, but for the rest of the games I believe I'll be playing them through Steam. So starting with Assassin's Creed 2.\nWell for one, I know that this is the game that turned a lot of people onto the series, which is probably why they decided to make three of them in this setting.\nMy first impressions of the game were, well they were pretty bad. This is a pretty terrible PC port. The controls on mouse and keyboard were terrible, and too confusing to customize to a way I liked. This surprised me since the default controls for AC4 were really fluid and intuitive.\nSo, I thought, \"ok then, I'll play with a controller.\" Which is something I almost never do for PC games, but I figured, that's what this game was built for, and so it'll probably work better. Wrong. The controller support for this game is utterly broken as well. However, if you check out the community hub for this game, you can find a fan-made patch for the controller support that fixes things.\nIt still wasn't perfect, but it definitely worked a lot better after that and the game became playable.\nDespite the controls and graphics being less accomodating than what I was used to with AC4, I did still enjoy the game a lot.\nThe Assassin's Creed series benefits from having some really easy, yet satisfying parkour mechanics, and they just feel good to use no matter what game you're playing. When they work at least.\nDifferent from AC4, this game focuses much more heavily on the assassinations, and really feels like what I assume most people think of as an \"Assassin's Creed\" game.\nIf you can get the gameplay to work the way you want then you'll probably have a lot of fun with running and stabbing your way around Renaissance Italy.\nSome stuff this game does well is the variety of locations. All the different regions of Italy really feel different to me, and the item collection is pretty solid this time around. I actually think this game handles the item collection better than AC4 because everything you collect is added to your Villa's overall appearance and value, and collecting everything of a certain item type usually leads to a bigger reward. In my opinion this is actually handled much better than the Pirate Hideout in AC4 but at the same time, I wish there was more interactivity with the Villa in this game. I wish they could've made it feel more like a home, maybe added some customization features, etc. and possibly a more direct way to get there.\nOverall the story is pretty good, it involves a lot of backstabbing Italian nobles, a corrupt Pope, ancient mystical artifacts, and a few loveable characters like Leonardo da Vinci. Who is portrayed like an adorable nerd in this game. One point though. Machiavelli was supposed to be a Renaissance era political genius. But he doesn't really do\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in this game. I don't see why the Assassins keep him around.\nGet past the controls and you'll find this is a pretty fun game. Although my vote would still have to be for AC4 as the best Assassin's Creed game I've played so far.\nOn to Brotherhood next, which I'm a little wary of because it looks like more of the same. but still I'm looking forward to diving deeper into this series.", "hours": 26.8, "user_id": "76561197995200857", "username": "mrguy0807", "products": 177, "early_access": false}

The main improvement is it's NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.\nYour hero is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Whereas in the first Assassin's Creed, you were the main protagonist Alta\u00efr based in Damascus, Jerusalem, and Acre. Ezio's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the bits outside the Animus) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note.\nThe gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.\nAlso, it easily has one of the best soundtrack.

If you havent played the assassin's creed series befor, definately pick them up. Although the reecent entrys have been meh at best this one was and still is amazing.\nAlthough the free-running mechanics seem somawhat cluncky in this game they are still fun to use, although frustrating at times. when you arent under pressure by any timed stuff the free-running can be a joy and fun to use. The only time it gets annoying is when you have to chase someone of do something thats timed. If your camera and jostick arent in the exact spot you want to go, if its even a millimeter off, you can kiss your shins good by as you do a full 90 degree jump off into the abyse below. If you are chasing someone, expect to run up and jump over everything you don't want to as Ezio automatically decides to run up a wall you wernt aiming for ro to jump off to the left eventhough you were running forward to jump to the other roof.\nThe story for the time was very intreaguing and kept me hooked. I orriginally owned this on the PS3 and i played it over and over again and loved it. The game is long and full of action and stabbing people. The game provides what the title says.\nMy only issue with the game (other than randomly jumping off of stuff to meet my death) is memory sequence 12 and 13. Orriginaly this was dlc and wasnt included in the game for some reason, but with this being the actual \"full game\" it is included. Yet for some reason it felt really shoe horned in. you get to explore  anew district but only for like 5 minutes and all it is there for is to explain how Ezio got a map. (just for clarification sequence 12 and 13 a \"broken\" memories)\nFor me it just made no sence what so ever and kinda killed the flow of the game.\nThe other think that kinda kills the game are the colectables and lack of achevements. the colectables are there for you to unlock stuff. so when you colect 50 feathers you get a weapon (its\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and buthe time you have colected 50 of them you'd have gotten Altair's sword) and when you get 100 feathers you get the auditore cape that makes you notorious constantly. this is where the absence of achevements comes in. On the consoles there are achevements and there is purpose to these things other than to increace your play time. On pc its pointless. By the time you have aquired this cape there is no point in plying anymore purely for the fact you would have done everytihng. It seemes ted.ious\nThe only other down side is Uplay. If the servers are down expet to not be able to play this game. seriously uplay and ubisoft its self are the only things that make this and other games\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665to play.\nAll in all id say get this game and enjoy it. Its a fantastic game and definately worth your time.\n11/10 would Udon'tplay again (Seriously Ubisoft.

Back when I first played it, I didn't know what to expect mainly because the first Assassin's Creed game was interesting, but very poorly executed, but since the media was giving so much praise, why not try it? What I found was one of what I consider the best games of the previous generation.\nLet's begin talking about the technical part -\n. The game\n, and in scenes with lots of NPCs and things happening, I could feel that the game was running\n(of course I will let my PC specs later to give an idea), and I can't say that the graphics still good, they're acceptable, but most of time, if you take a more close look you will see that a lot of textures are in low resolution. Anyway, the game offer options to customize the graphics if you're running in a not so powerful machine, and from what I remember, it scalate pretty well in older systems.\n.\nNow, about the story. It will be hard, but let me try do it in the more fast and understandable way:\nBack in the crusades, there was two factions fighting, the Assassin's and the Templars. Assassin's wanted to achieve peace for the mankind by giving people freedom, while templars wanted to control people with extremely powerful artifacts of an ancient civilization, because for them it was the only way to achieve peace and a perfect world. Things happened between that time and now (2010 - 2011), and those artifacts are now lost. However, a corporation called\n, that is controlled by Templars discovered a method to find those artifacts -\n, and so, they developed\n, a machine who could\n. And then, they captured\n, an Assassin that had escaped from his family and was living without any connection with them as a bartender.\nThings happened, we now retrieved his memories from Altair, an edgy assassin that was the main character of the first game and now, because of those things that happened, we're going to retrieve another guy past, but this time is not only for the info on the artifacts, but also to train Desmond -\n. Anyway, during the game, we will not follow much of Desmond story, so we are going to now talk about it's ancestor that is also my favorite character in the entire series.\nwas a young italian guy from 15th century, doing young italian guy things, he had a happy family, two brothers, a father and mother, and one sister, but then pretty bad things happen and he need to get away from his house and city with his sister and mother, so he run away to\n, and his plan was to stay there for sometime and then go away from all that. However, some other things happen, and he decide to help his uncle to fight against some bad guys. And then for some motive he decides to stay there with his family,\n. Then he go and begin to hunt down who made the bad things that made him run away in first place, and then he enter in the Assassin order, discover that his true enemy is now the Pope, and go hunt him too. Not in this exact order.\nNow, talking about the gameplay. During your gameplay, you will expend most of your time on Animus, since it's the main part of the game.\n. Initially, you will have open access of the parts of those cities that you have unlocked so far, and you unlock more parts of the cities doing story missions, but in free mode you can go search for treasures, do side missions or just explore the cities. You also have money\n, however, the most powerful armor can be only adquired doing side missions, where you search for things to unlock Altair armor, in those side quests, you need to use your skills to go up in places, sometimes with a time limit, they're like puzzles based on skill. I didn't have much problems other than controls, and even then I didn't have to try more than 3 times to get at some place, other side missions include\n. You also will have some collectibles like\nand some Animus bugs left by the last guy who they used the machine.\n,\n. This all I need to say about it, I think.\nControl wise,\n, and I played with a keyboard and mouse setup. Playing with this may give you some problems to get up in some places or do some more advanced parkour, but it's not too bad. The combat is also fluid, but it kinda get repetitive in late game, unless you decide to be creative and use the entire arsenal that Ezio have -\nand things like it. You don't need to, but it's cool and add some diversity than just kill people with swords.\nNow, about it's soundtrack, there's not much to say,\n. Composed by\n, it just add so much to the game, like\nwhile someone is pursuing you. It's so good.\nSo, this is it. The Ezio story will go on in the two following games, Brotherhood and Revelations, and in a short movie that tell what happened with him after those two.\n8.0/10", "hours": 12.3, "username": "MJunioR", "products": 1080, "early_access": false}

AC2 takes everything about the original AC and makes it better, while also adding brand new ideas and gameplay mechanics.\nThere is so much to say about this game, so I suppose the best place to start is the story and characters. AC2 continues the story of Desmond and the Assassins, which takes a backseat role in this game (to the delight of many), but also introduces the new story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze (who is now the face of the entire franchise), a young man living in Florence during the Italian Renaissance.\nIn stark contrast to Altair, the protagonist from the original AC, Ezio is a loveable character. Altair is direct, brutal and quiet. While Ezio is charming, caring, and inquisitve. Ezio suffers a family tragedy which causes him to seek revenge, and eventually leads him to become one of the assassins. Along his journey Ezio befriends many men and women, and almost all of them are as easy to like as Ezio. The historical fiction that takes place in this game is nothing short of spectacular. By the end of the game Ezio and Leonardo da Vinci (yes you read that right) are practically best buds! Ezio gets involved with the Medici, the Pazzi, Machiavelli, and even the Borgia!\nThe entire story is well-written and exciting. The missions are unique (unlike the original Assassin's Creed) and fun. The setups to assassinations take a far more natrual approach than they did in the original AC. That being said, the section of the game leading up to Sylvio and Dante, and even to a lesser extent the section prior with the Doge, I personally think is the game's weakest point. Many of the missions at this point in the game become less unique and more monotonous. First, go to three rooftops and kill 3 sets of archers. Then later.. Go to 3 areas, free captured allies, come back. Then later.. Go to 3 areas, kill enemies, come back.\nLuckily, this doesn't last long so it's not such a huge hindrance, but the game does take a dip in quality here. However, the game ends with a pretty amazing finish, with some really great cutscenes and action, so that's great.\nWhich brings me to one of the best things about this game, the dialogue and voice acting. Man, is it good. The voice actors and writers knocked it out of the park. The pacing is good, the acting is great, and the characters feel real and sound like they actually care. You may think I'm making a big deal out of this, but bad voice acting and dialogue is one of my biggest gripes in games nowadays, especially for big releases from companies like Ubisoft. Watch Dogs for example is a testament to just how absolutely terrible writing and voice acting can go in video games. Yuck!\nThis brings me to the gameplay. Along the journey Ezio really develops into a truly fleshed out Assassin and you feel different than you did at the start. Ezio unlocks a number of tools and tricks to help in his assassin techniques, and this really helps the game stay fresh and exciting. Most importantly the combat doesn't dull. In reality, the combat is very, very simple. Yet somehow, it never bores. The feeling of pulling off some of the counters and unique assassinations is always thrilling. With so many tools at your disposal, you always have so many options on how to deal with threats or tight scenarios.\nThis does bring me to one of my (very small) gripes about this game, though. Ezio doesn't feel very much like a true assassin in this game. In the original Assassin's Creed so much of the game was about being stealthy. And while it fits Ezio's character to be a bit more reckless and unrefined in his assassination techniques, who is more of a raw assassin than a trained assassin like Altair was, it makes the game less about classic stealthy assassin gameplay and more about open combat. Often times it's easier to just hack and slash your way through things than to try them stealthily, which is a little disappointing. This wouldn't be a problem, because the open combat is fun. But.. later on in the game (specifically the DLC, sequences 11 and 12, which I'll comment more on later) the missions begin to require stealth more and more. And if you've become accustomed to just hacking and slashing your way through, the game can become a little more frustrating. I just wish the game would've been more consistent aboutn what it wanted of you.\nBut once you learn how to go about things in a stealthy manner the game is just as fun as ever, and this is in large part to the MAJOR refinements Ubisoft made to the movement in this game. 9 years ago I played the original Assassin's Creed and I was amazed with Altair's movement and agility. Just before replaying AC2, this past week I decided I'd replay the original AC to remember the important plot points of the Desmond story. I was disgusted with how choppy the movement was in the original AC, because the first time I played AC was when the series was just beginning. I didn't know anything better! However, now that I've played AC2, there is no going back. The difference between movement in this game and in the original AC is like night and day. Ezio grabs onto things well, he climbs faster, he leaps in directions which make sense, and on a related note, the camera actually moves and controls well in tight spaces, which only makes the parkour easier.\nMy only gripe with the movement is the leap climb ability. As mentioned before, Ezio unlocks a number of assination techniques and tools to assist him in assassinations and combat, but there isn't any progression in terms of your movement. However, there are some structures which you may encounter in the early game which you cannot scale due to not having the leap climb ability, and the game gives you no indication as to why. Unfortunately, this drives the player to just maddeningly try over and over again to scale certain view points which are literally impossible without the ability. If the game made some kind of indication that it would be scaleable later, then it would be a non-issue.\nSome other positives of this game are: it actually feels pretty good on both keyboard and mouse & controller, the soundtrack is great, the visuals are beautiful, the ai functions pretty well, especialy groups of thieves and mercenaries, and last but certainly not least SOME the collectibles are UNIQUE and FUN (the tombs and TRUTH videos, the feathers are not fun) especially when compared with the collectibles in the original AC. Seriously, if you do not do any of the bonus content in this game you are missing out on a huge part of this game's content and a lot of it's enjoyment. I think I spent 8 hours on collectibles alone.\nSome small unmentioned negatives: In the Deluxe version you will play the DLC before the finale, (which are sequences 12 and 13 of 14 total sequences) and they feel a little out of place. The movement in Venice is less smooth than in other cities. The courtesans are pretty much the worst ai ally faction in the game by a long shot, which makes them kinda undesireable. The game gates you sometimes and isn't completely open-world. It's not a problem when a game keeps you from exploring an entire other city, but within a city when it locks you out? That's silly to me. Continuing.. the game has quite a few bugs, especially with dead bodies on roofs. This didn't bother me so much, most of the time it's funny, but sometimes a dead body ragdolling around or off a roof can break your cover and force you to restart a mission. UPlay... kill me plz. And finally, the micromanaging of Monteriggioni is stupid and pointless.\nAll in all, this game really is legendary. The story is engaging, characters likeable, gameplay exciting, and music immersing. If you play any of the games of this series, this game is the one to play.", "hours": 25.7, "user_id": "76561198128287463", "username": "Shiny Magikarp", "products": 155, "early_access": false}

And if they had, this game would easily have racked up a very high score in my personal and otherwise uninteresting score book. Unfortunatley, assassin's creed II is much like the first title: there are a lot of good ideas, I mean A LOT of good ideas, but most of them are poorly implemented.\nIf you haven't played assassin's creed before you played this game, you'll have less use for this review.\nMain Character\nEzio Auditore is a lot less \"oh look, stabbity stab stab, I'm an assassin\" than Altair was, and has a depth you can appreciate. At the start of the story, He's a stereotypical italian rich youngster, a womanizer and well... Sort of forgettable to be honest. But as you progress through the story, he matures and becomes more and more interesting.\nStory\nThe story is still quite linear and predictable, following classic dramturgic structures. That's not to say it's bad, only that you can sort of catch what's going to happen and the plot twists are not twists as much as they are... Plot... Turns. Winks maybe? Desmond's story, the man whose memories you're exploring (but who in no way is the protagonist, funny enough), gets his own fleshed out story arch. You get to understand him more, and his relation with his co-workers. Still, in spite of predictability and linear story line, it is enjoyable and doesn't veer too much into the unbelievable. The story is probably assassin's creed II's main strength, because like most of ubisofts games, it suffers from poorly executed ideas.\nControls\nHere's where assassin's creed screws things up a bit. See Altair always felt like an assassin. He stabs his victim, then runs away and hides until the guards give up. That's what an assassin does. He doesn't have it in for the guards. They're just people trying to get paid to do a job. He's after specific targets, and fleeing after an assassination is almost always your very best method to avoid getting caught. Not so for Ezio. Your best bet with Ezio is almost always to stay and fight until everyone is dead. Ezio is a lot less assassinesque than Altair was, in spite of having a lot more tools at his disposal. I don't know why ubisoft chose to take the gameplay in that direction. Perhaps because it's fun (and looks quite impressive) with all the fight animations. I don't know, but through all of assassin's creed II, I never felt a very much like I'm an assassin. I always felt like rich-kid-given-assassins-tools. A fighter, who isn't an assassin by choice, but by necessity.\nFunny enough, that is actually reflected somewhat in Ezio's gear and story. He comments on it being nice to be able to fight up front and personal rather than having to sneak at one point, and as you gain upgrades, his armor more and more resembles plate armor. Perhaps saying that Ezio in this title isn't very much an assassin isn't too imprecise.\nIn either case. You are introduced to a lot of different missions through the game, and that is a problem rather than something good. When I say it's a problem, I mean it's a problem when it comes to the controls. Especially on PC, the controls are not suited for the missions you are handed. You might have a mission to stalk someone, but fail because Ezio starts climbing a wall rather than run up to a corned. You might want to stab someone with a poison blade, but end up shoving them, or falling down instead. In some cases, you're supposed to chase your victim, but you might fail because Ezio decides to sit down on a bench instead of jumping unto a crate.\nThe boon of assassin's creed, free running, is also the bane of the missions you are asked to perform. This is unfortunate, because those same controls is what allows you to think outside the box. The game often seems to suggest that you are supposed to think outside the box. But if you do think outside the box, deciding to use a throwing knife instead of backstabbing, or a gun instead of poison, you will quickley find that ubisoft wants you to get back in the box.\nMany events are scripted so that you cannot succeed before the game wants you to succeed, and those instances are frustrating for you as a player. They mean you are not rewarded for going outside of the old sneak-sneak-stab mode. You are not rewarded for trying to bypass guards to get to your target. You are not rewarded when you try to implement a plan to use the various tools at your disposal. Instead, you are being punished.\nBut still. In spite of all this, assassin's creed comes recommended. The story about Ezio Auditore is easily the best story the assassin's creed franchise has to offer, and you'd be passing up something good if you decide not to wade through ubisofts well intended, but ultimately wonky gameplay.", "hours": 222.7, "user_id": "76561198042052395", "username": "6174", "products": 147, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 108, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-01-08", "text": "It's been a great many years since I've played this game. Much like Pajama Sam and Star Wars, I was very much obsessed with the Assassin's Creed franchise. Don't worry. I haven't turned into a murderous psychopath. Not yet at least.\nI played most of the Assassin's Creed games multiple times, but I haven't touched II since I first played it. I remember hating it purely for the graphics back in the day, but I'm happy to report that my taste in games has matured. Now let's REALLY find out what I didn't like about this game!\nTo be honest, not a whole lot. Assassin's Creed II is well-justified in being called the best game in the franchise by fans and critics alike. And I mean that as sincerely as I can. It's a pretty enjoyable game.\nThe story continues right off of the first Assassin's Creed (which I might go back and play a third time for sh**s and giggles soon), wherein you play as Desmond Miles as he accesses memories now of Italian ancestor from Renaissance: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Desmond's story is nearly inexistent, but where the real juice of the the story comes from is found in Ezio.\nSee, Ezio isn't a stone-faced brooding Batman-wannabe like Altair and Connor Kenway were. He was presented like an young man who was thrown into unfortunate circumstances and had to dawn the cowl of the Assassin in order to fulfill his quest for revenge. Ezio is very charismatic and likeable, and you genuinely want to see him follow through with his revenge and become a Master Assassin. A lot of the other characters are pretty forgettable, but the game has so much charm and enough little jokes here and there that I felt entertained throughout the whole experience.\nBesides the other characters, I did get a little irritated with how one-dimensional the villains were. The only one that really got my interest was the bodyguard, Dante, and he's barely used in the whole game! I felt a bit of rivalry between Ezio and Uberto as well as Vieri, but a lot of the other targest you hunt down are pretty bland. And, of course, the ending with the final target is a bit anti-climactic. But the big reveal afterwards was enough to grab my interest like it had years ago. It's pretty well-implemented, unexpected, and effective in shocking the player at the end of the game.\nYou play as Ezio throughout five sandboxes across Italy: Florence, Tuscany, Forli, Monteriggioni, and Venice. I like that there's a lot of variety in the locations you visit, so the game doesn't become monotonous. When you travel across the country, it really feels like your traveling to brand new locations each completely different from the other places you've visited. However, there are plenty of loading screens whenever you want to travel and animations that mainly pestered me whenever I wanted to take care of some mundane, but it wasn't enough to completely frustrate me.\nThe worlds, while well-designed, are a bit under-utilized. There's A LOT of stuff you can do, but I never felt that motivated to run around and collect little useless sh** thrown randomly across the city or complete mundane taks that are pretty much identical to all the other ones you've completed.\nIn line with the theme of repetition, is the combat. I'm not a fan. You can't break an enemy's defese very easily but you can do the best damage through a counter... which means you have to wait for your opponent to attack you first... which means you'll be doing a lot of waiting in fights. And it's not like fighting is that difficult. Just tap the counter button. That's it.\nYou know? That's probably the biggest flaw with Assassin's Creed II. It's too damn easy. This game was like scraping my knees on pavement when I first played it, but I think I've become a better gamer since then. At least, I'd like to think I have. And so many missions were so simple to figure out and finish in one try that I rushed through the majority of the game in about 15 hours (the other 5 hours was from all the running around in the cities I did).\nBUT since you're thinking about buying this copy of Assassin's Creed II, you're getting the Deluxe Edition! Woo! Mysterious! What does it mean?\nYou get a couple hour-long memory sequences. Have fun.\nOkay, they're not that bad honestly. Originally, the game clipped them out as the penultimate chapters of the story and sold them as DLC, but since I played the Deluxe Edition it just skipped right to the DLC missions. I'm not a fan of removing story content for the purpose of making money but if you don't play these DLC packs you're not missing much. I'll give you a summary of both of them: Ezio loses the Apple. Then he gets the Apple back. It's not that inspired, obviously.\nWhile the Battle of Forli finally utilized Forli which you only were in for one f***ing mssion in the base game, you have a whole storyline behind Caterina Sforza (who, again, was only in that one out-of-place mission in the original game). A couple twin brothers kidnap her kids, and you have the save them to win the Battle of Forli. It just gives some excuse to pad out the story and add some open combat, which isn't the worst thing ever. I liked Caterina as a character, but the story itself wasn't that compelling.\nThe Bonfire of the Vanities was my favorite chapter of the two. You need to get the Apple back from Savonarola, and to do so you have to assassinate his nine lieutenants across Florence, each with a different twist in how you go about assassinating them. I think Savonarola was a very compelling villain, who was prodded to do what he did because he honestly believe he was doing the right thing by spreading his faith in God to the masses. That and the missions are short enough to justify running around Florence one last time. It was pretty good.\nAssassin's Creed II isn't the best thing ever. It certainly hasn't aged well in its presentation. Cutscenes look pretty wonky. The characters, when up close, look like the characters from GTA IV. They look all shiny and fake, but their body and facial animations are actually really well-done. If you want this game to look better, either buy the Ezio Collection like the dirty console peasant you are, or just download some graphical mods. It's not terrible. The game hasn't aged that well.\nThat being said, the atmosphere of the cities you explore are wonderful. Even though the graphics aren't that great up-close, they look marvelous when you're running around 1400's Italy, and listening to the chatter of passing pedestrians, hearing the howls of the local herald, and listening to the gorgeous soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. It's not the best soundtrack ever, but the main theme of this game and the ambient songs in Venice are some fantastic songs he wrote. This game still looks decent, but it sounds even better.\nLike I said, Assassin's Creed II is pretty damn good upon my second playthrough. I don't think if I ever reinstall this game, that I'll go around and do all asinine side-mission B.S. but I'm certainly inclined to play through the story again. It's a decent game, despite its flaws and one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I'm giving Assassin's Creed II a 7/10.", "hours": 23.1, "username": "Double Uppercut", "products": 289, "early_access": false}

I've followed the series from the beginning... playing as Altair was fun, but Ezio just has so much more depth to his charecter, not to mention style. That moment you get the second hidden blade is just satisfying. Then ezio gains a hidden pistol, which was also fun. I've played through this game several times... IDK, maybe I am partial due to my nostalgia and overall love for the Ezio games.\nThe game is not perfect though. As with most AC games, thee main charecter, Ezio in this case, does not always do what you want him to. Trying to climb boxes in front of you sometimes leads to running up the adjacent wall, or just jumping over boxes atogether. Most of the time this problem is negligable, except during the most frustrating aspect of this game: timed puzzles. Specifically, a good number of Assassin's Tombs. Many of the tombs have timed areas and if Ezio jumps in the water or at the wall instead of jumping to that beam... welll, you have to start over. If you don't care about getting 100% or getting Altair's armor, then skip these puzzles. Honestly, you can beat the game easily without upgrading your health much.

Ezio felt like a very rookie assassin to me, it really bothered me that I felt 80% of the game I was just avenging his family's losses out of revenge and you were put though the learning process of Eden, Templars and the Assassin brotherhood.\nBringing power back to the people and ridding each area of corruption had it's satisfaction on it's own and felt great knowing you made a difference to the areas you visited making Italy a better place again. It is a bit silly however you are given capes of recognition but simply climbing a rooftop is considered a crime? I understand if the guards attack you with the cape if you have killed a civilian or another guard but the cape itself is supposed to be an entitlement for your services to the city and it's people so why be targeted for climbing or accessing restricted areas?\nI don't like collecting coupious amounts of items for such little gain and this game has a ton of them, little more less than the first game but still a lot.\nI didn't particularly like having to read subtitles for half english and half Italian spoken dialogue, I do appreciate it added depth to cutscenes and learned some Italian here and there but I couldn't help but get lost a few times or spaced out. I thought in the first game all was translated to English when Desmond asked Lucy. Perhaps things have changed I guess.\n8/10. Not bothered to collect the other assassin's stone tablet things at this point in time, maybe after I finish AC 3 to access Altair's armor.", "hours": 17.2, "username": "Operator Exe\u00a9", "products": 244, "early_access": false}

Here's my breakdown of the game:\nGameplay: 8/10  The combat system is a little more clunky than the newer Assassin Creed installments, but I don't think that's a bad thing.  You have to thunk about every action during combat and freerunning, which makes the game more engaging than some of the more modern games.  The weapon diversity is a little lacking, and the targetting system for throwing objects/guns is a little clunky.\nGraphics:  6/10  OK, this game is a little dated compared to the jaw-dropping graphics of newer games.  However, there is still so much detail packed into every area.  I also think the older graphics go well with the setting of the game.  You still need to use some imagination to really enjoy the looks of the game.\nStory:  10/10  By far the most well-developed plot of any Assassin's Creed game.  Ezio is the most relatable character from the franchise, and some of the \"famous\" people you meet along your journey aren't forced into the story for no reason like some of the newer games.

The first part of Ezio trilogy, and a second game about Desmond Miles and his merry band assassins.\nGameplay is almost the same as in the first part, but everything is much more smoother. Climbing takes almost no effort, fights are even more enjoyable, and quests, while somewhat repetetive, gives much more insight into very interesting story. There are of course side quests abour running or killing, and they are boring, but if You're not a 100% achiever forget about them.\nEzio has even more tools for killing that Altair could imagine, and thanks to Leonardo da Vinci, he gets much better in killing in different ways. Finally You really have a choice of weapons that match Your style of fighting - fast, but not very strong blades or vice versa.\nThis game's central hub for Ezio is a little town, called Monteriggioni, where player can upgrade buildings, to get discounts, new items and access to new areas.\nEzio will travel to many great looking place, Venice including, which are perfectly depicted in the game. Seriously - if You ever been in Venice, You will feel familiar in that ine in game very fast. While the scale of the cities if of course smaller than in reality, it does not affect that feeling.\nNew thing, which I particularly like are indoors puzzlelike climbing sections. While pretty linear they are pretty fun, because they just 'feel' differently than normal climbing.\nPlayer need to have Uplay account, but do not listen to all those naysayers - it is not an inconvenience at all. While it may be confusing at the beginning, You will have problems with it only if Your IQ is below 70.\nIf You have additional serial keys for extra ingame items, You have to find the Extras menu and redeem it there. Same goes for every other AC game.\nWhat Ubisoft did great with Uplay is award system.

This game puts you in the shoes of the young Florentine nobleman, Ezio Auditore. As an origin story for Ezio and the ongoing story for the meta-plot involving Desmond Miles, you uncover the plots unrecorded by history as Templars and Assassins continue to wage war against one another for the ultimate prize in both the past and the present.\nWhereas Assassin's Creed 1 introduced us to the idea of Templars vs Assassins; here it is fleshed out further with conspiracies and intrigue. Assassin's Creed 2 is also an interesting dive into historical Italy during the Renaissance. Very few games have pulled off a fully involved historical drama with attention to detail that this one does.\nI fully enjoyed Ezio's origin story and his journey of self-discovery. He is literally Renassiance Batman with a very similar revenge plot, but at the same time the plot twists and turns keep the ideas fresh and interesting.\nWhile graphically dated by today's standards, AC2 still stands the test of time.

While it's graphics certainly haven't aged as well as the original or Brotherhood, it still looks pretty good. The gameplay has been improved by the longhold in 2 when compared to AC with the addition of swimming. It also helps to have one of the best protagonists I have heard and seen in a video in a while. Ezio is a charismatic young man, and to avoid spoilers, something happens to him that causes him to seek revenge. The story is absolutely great, but this game is meant to go with both Brotherhood and Revelations. Overall I'd give this game a 8/10. This is because while the game is quite well polished it does get a bit tedious near the end especially with the non-optional DLC segment near the end which I wish was skippable. The DLC segments with Caterina felt like filler, which it honestly was. The DLC consists of two pieces, which altogether consists of twenty missions. A decent number of those missions are just assassination missions. Honestly if you could still get it I'd suggest just getting the standard edition but since they have removed it off of steam you are required to get deluxe edition which isn't that bad.

Even after completing all of these missions there is still plenty to do for those who want to 100% the game, such as locating treasure, exploring tombs and solving glyph puzzles. As the storyline progresses, so does time which provides availability to new areas and technology, which I found a logical way to unlock better equipment and gear rather than being granted availability from 'getting good'.\nAlthough I mostly love the game, there are admittedly negatives that did make the gameplay a little bit unenjoyable at times. The game is played in third person which I don't have a problem with but there are certain points during a parkour sequence where the camera will either look from a really obscure angle so that it made me unsure with which direction I should go to move forward to reach the next point in a sequence, or the camera will suddenly change position and make me suddenly move in the wrong direction. I also found a lot of the time while free-running I thought, \"I didn't want to do that\". For instance, there's a Borgia messenger I'm chasing down on the rooftops and instead of leaping to the next building, I dive into a conveniently placed haystack below. Nice. There is also a very annoying game breaking bug I unforunately stumbled across. Just a little warning: DO NOT RETURN THE 100TH FEATHER WHILE WEARING THE ALTAIR OUTFIT GIVEN VIA ONE OF THE UPLAY REWARDS. YOU WILL HAVE TO RESTART THE GAME ALL OVER AGAIN. I found this one out the hard way.\nOther than this, I didn't encounter many other important problems, and overall for a 2010 game, this is fantastic.\nAnd another little note for players, when you arrive in Venice, be ready to give your mate a hug once the tour has concluded ;)", "hours": 143.9, "username": "armouredmarshmallow", "products": 150, "early_access": false}

A VERY likable character and by far the best Assassin, in my opinion.\nCons:\n- The combat and general game mechanics system isn't as developed as that of ACB or ACR, and is still very plain and simple. But then again, this is hardly a con, what else could we have expected from Ubisoft when this game came out?\n- I'm Italian, and the voice acting is quite cringy at times.

You'll be forced to backtrack to and from randomized points on the map just to pad the game out (a common problem for Ubisoft games).\nExploring the (sometimes isolated) tombs has to be the highlight.

Its a few years old by now but still one of the best, if not the best in the series.\nFull Review:\nAssassins Creed 2 is, for me, still the most enjoyable game of the AC series. The game follows Ezio Auditore ,an Italian descendant of the first games protaganist Altair, as he goes from a young man who witnesses his family killed as part of a Templar plot to an experienced member of the Assassin order. The game has some beautiful locations with the cities of Florence and Venice as well as some smaller countryside areas. Theres a lot of side stuff to do like assasination contracts or doing up your villa but the main story is still really enjoyable with some great missions thrown in.\nGood points:\n-Florence and Venice both look amazing and feel completely different to each other with the beautiful buildings and streets of Florence and Venice having its famous canals.\n- Ezio is a great character as he's both likeable and charismatic and its easy to sympathize with his journey. Compared to Altair or Connor from the other AC games he's still by far the best protaganist.\n- The story missions are both fun and enjoyable a lot of oppurtunities to put your assassin skills to work as well as the variety of gadgets and weapons Ezio acquires.\n-This version comes with both DLC expansions, The Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities.\nBad points:\n- Combat is a bit too easy. You can win most fights by countering enemies and hammering the attack button. Enemies also tend to stand off and attack one or two at a time so its easy to take on big groups of enemies.\n- The parkour free running is good but canbe frustrating as it tends to be a bit inaccurate at times. I'd often have Ezio jump the wrong way or crash into a wall which is especially frustrating when your chasing someone or trying to flee from guards.", "hours": 23.5, "username": "Del Mingus", "products": 1094, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "33230", "page": 157, "page_order": 5, "recommended": false, "date": "2016-08-30", "text": "Typical Ubisoft game: fantastic art design, uninspired story, shoddy development.\nThe art is fantastic, drawing you into an imagined 15th century Florence. By far, this is what drives this game, since the plot and game mechanics are generally tepid. The power of the art is make feel empowered to explore a fantastic world, though this feeling is somewhat stifled after the first few hours by the only semi-open world feel. The game obviously goes through great lengths to make it feel like you have the kind of open world choices you get in games like Skyrim or GTA, but the somewhat lackluster side-games, the limited travel area, and the vanilla storyline causes it to fall short in this department. In fact, AC2 feels far less open-world than AC1 and several times during gameplay I was screaming out for a chance to just wander the city and take assassination contracts out on people, but alas, you are railroaded pretty heavily into the main generic story. The illusion of choice exists all along in this game, but actual choices are somewhat limited. Each \"quest\" you get you have the choice to accept or not accept, but not accepting just means you start the cut-scene over and get a chance to try to accept again. In short, the only choices you get are to play or not to play, and after hours of wandering around Florence's stunningly drawn back alleys looking for pieces of parchment and birt feathers, I generally leaned toward the not-playing side of things.\nAs with most Ubisoft games, AC2 suffers from lazy development, though mostly in the port to PC -- though I did find myself several times cursing the poorly designed camera rotation that often rotates mid-run to cause you to veer unexpectedly is other directions. It was also fun finding the numerous other spots in the game where I got the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665kicked out of my by Florence's overly ubiquitous town militia after I got glitched halfway off the map, unable to move. And don't be too creative about how you approach your targets. Once I decided to be sneaky and come down from above, only to trigger a cut-scene back with me on the street getting robbed. Oh yeah, and the cutscenes. So after a few hours, when you're desperately bored with the plot, then use the cutscenes to get up and stretch and get a snack because you can't skip them.\nIf you're playing the PC version the biggest complaint is typical lazy console port that Ubisoft is so famous for. Most of the game plays all right, but the controls for PC are hideous. If you prefer Keyboard and Mouse, don't even buy the game. It's maddening. The controls make a lot of sense when using a gamepad, but I spent a number of frustrating hours trying to get my controllers to work with the game. I have a XBOX and a more generic Logitech controller, both of which work fine with other games, but they were frustrating glitchy in AC2. I basically had to mod around the XBOX one and re-maps keys for my logitech one. And, to make matters worse, whever I found a new viewpoint in the game, for some mysterious reason, the game would re-map my controllers again. So, stupid.\nIn spite everything, I still somewhat enjoyed this game, though not as much as AC1. In general, if you get lucky and get everything to work well, and can ignore the crappy port, it's not bad for a somewhat mindless romp through Renaissance Florence. But in the end, I probably wouldn't recommend it as one of my more favorite games.", "hours": 29.2, "user_id": "76561198023231507", "username": "ashmund", "products": 98, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

While it is very \"chompy\" for us already,back in 2009 I believe they were astonishing.                                                                                                  I think, nonetheless, that the models of the faces of some characters ( especially the less relevant ones ) could be more detailed despite the age of the game.\nSounds --- 75/100 : The soundtrack in this games offers plenty of pleasure moments especially when the city guards are pursuing you while you parkour in the XV century Florence rooftops. That angelic specific music suits wonderfuly in the parkour moments and I absolutely loved it.\nDespite the good soundtrack, some dialogs of the civilians were extremely repetitive and a reason to mock.\nStory --- 90/100 : Great Story! You are Desmond Miles, a normal person whose ancients were several generations of Assassin's. You are caught in a war between Templars ( the bad guys) and Assassin's ( The good guys). In the first title you are kidnapped by the templars while in this title you are caught by the Assassin's. Due to the low resources of the Assassin's ( that have to face a source of infinite resources that feeds the Templars) you incarnate as Ezio Auditore de Firenze as a way of seeking more information about the Pieces of Eden , and the  main goal , to train you.\nEzio Auditore de Firenze is motivated by revenging the ones that killed his family and throughout the course continues the work of his father about ancient artifacts called The Pieces of Eden.\nGameplay --- 85/ 100 --- Nothing really new here. Fantastic combat system that , in my mere opinion , could be more punishing.The game feels ,after some hours, repetitive due to a decent length in the story time.

I picked it up because it's one of these mainstream games which I had not tried before and because of all the overwhelmingly positive reviews, which I genuinely cannot understand.\nAt the beginning it seemed to be a good and fun game, but the more I played the more obvious it got: The most important thing in a game like this, the controlls and mechanics, at least with a controller, are complete garbage. It feels extremly clunky and glitchy, often you cannot understand why you didnt grab that ledge or why Ezio jumped in another direction, which often times means that you have to start climbing all over again, which can get quite infuriating. One time, in an assassins tomb, in which you had to jump your way up from the left wall to the right, I had to switch to mouse and keyboard in order to complete it because it was not possible with the controller, even after  30 (!) mins of trying.\nThe combat is really bad and boring, either you just button smash untill all your enemies are dead or parry and avoid all the time untill you get random kills. Its also quite unresponsive, I cant count the times Eizo just didnt move at all while being hit constantly. The chase sequences are dreadful, the story is decent at best and gets really boring over time. Overall the game is just too long for what it got with an dragged out storyline.\nQuite sad since the game has otherwise a good soundtrack, great graphics and artstyle considering its age and and a nice level to detail.

Assassins Creed 2 was the \"Deus Ex\" of the series, it set the standard for all that followed, but was never bested. \"often copied, never equalled\" as the saying goes, this was to set the theme and style for all that followed but they were mere \"essays in the craft\" as a famous author once wrote.\nSet in Renaissance Italy, it tells the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Ezio of the Auditore family of Florence. Renaissance Italy was a formative time for Italy and mainland Europe, and was an era where famous architects and artists abounded and marked their place in history. Here in this very city you can climb Florence Cathedral, designed by Giotto and engineered by Brunelleschi, wonder at the many re-created towers of San Gimignano and take in the beauty of Tuscany and it's many re-created landmarks.\nThis whole game is rich in history and has had entire regions of Italy, complete with it's famous people and landmarks, transplanted into it's very core, and this is your playground.\nFollowing on from the original Assassins Creed, which introduced you to Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad who was a member of a cult based on the real-life Ha-shi-shin, more correctly referred to in history as the \"Asasiyun\", Ezio continues the story-arc of Desmond Miles, a modern-day descendant of the original Assassins, on his unbidden quest to seek out the Piece of Eden, and to recover it and use it in defense against The Templars. A typical \"them and us\" scenario but beautifully executed, immersing the player into selected regions of real-life history, and merging it with a simple yet intricate fictitious concept.\nThroughout the game you, the player, become Ezio, a rogue, a charmer and a parkour master... and possibly one of the most-loved characters of the entire series. You start off with nothing, but following the in-game death of your father and brothers, you very quickly learn the arts of stealth, stealing and most important of all, the deadly art of assassination. At fist it is only for revenge but surrounded by friends and family, you are slowly guided and \"trained\" to become an efficient killer in order to \"take out\" various city officials who are actually Templar Agents, bent on the domination of \"the people\".\nAs you progress through the game you learn more about the Templars and the Assassins, and the reason behind their long-term enmity, and the importance and urgency of trying to thwart them in their own deadly quest to dominate the entire earth.\nAll this content-rich plot is set in a beautifully recreated and innovative period of our own history when creativity was at it's peak and when famous people such as Leonardo da Vinci and Machiavelli actually lived and contributed to all that we know today.\nPlaying this game is more that just playing through a simple plot, it is an opportunity to experience  one of the most important periods of European history, and to virtually walk the very streets and admire the legendary architecture of Renaissance Italy, which has been an inspiration to us right down to this day.", "hours": 381.0, "user_id": "76561198008673767", "username": "Sh4d5t4r", "products": 125, "early_access": false}

Enemies pose no threat whatsoever and by the end of the game Ezio is a\nkilling machine, able to murder an army of armored guards with no problems whatsoever. The difficulty level in this game is a step down from Assassin's Creed 1 which although still easy, required more from the player.\n- Has a lot of performance problems on the PC, even with a GTX 980 Ti and an i7 3770k.

I still hate it. Boring, repetitive, uninspired, bad controls, crashes at least once every two hours, etc. On top of that, you have to install Ubisoft's awful game service, make an account, and put up with its slow and poorly-timed updates. You have to be dedicated to play this game. First, you have to sit through up to an hour of pointless install. Then, it takes a good hour or two of very, very boring intro until you finally get to the meat of the game. For example, some of your first \"exciting\" missions include: watching yourself be born, walking around some cubicles in a drab office building, carrying a crate around for your mommy while she talks with another grown-up, climbing flights of stairs, and talking to everyone in the room to make sure that their feelings are heard. I am absolutely not kidding. These are your missions.\nWhen you finally do get to assassinate people, the combat is so stupidly easy that it feels pointless. Yes you can fight with a sword, and the enemies will block, etc. But if you just switch to your hidden blade, pretty much every time you press the X button it instakills an enemy--no trouble at all. Once you get a double hidden blade, it instakills TWO enemies! It's not combat, it's just pressing a button. It was more difficult to pick up the crate for my mother the first time because the controls are bad. Killing people is much easier than picking things up.\nBut the absolute worst thing about this game is the stupid, stupid storyline. Despite their disclaimer, the people who made this game are clearly very hostile toward religion. Instead of real historical data, the game is filled with misinformation and twisting of facts that are told to you as though they were facts. Even Wikipedia is a better source of historical information than this game--and I am talking about the times when the game purports to be telling you historical facts, not about its fanciful storyline about the Knights Templar. I understand that when the game is being creative it does not have to be historically accurate. As for its creative storyline though, it may sound clever but honestly it's just Gnosticism all over again. Reversing the Fall, making Adam and Eve's sin into a good thing, this has been done already nearly two millenia ago. Secret societies, conspiracies... honestly, don't we have enough of this everywhere else?\nMaybe I would like the game if it were just a bit more believable. For example, if the people in renaissance Italy actually spoke and acted like people in renaissance Italy and not just like horny, crude Americans today. A little research would have done the writers a lot of good. For example, they wouldn't say \"Sunday service,\" they would say \"Mass.\" Women would not be allowed in the cloister of the monastery. Instead of saying \"priest\" for a parish priest they would say \"curate.\" But honestly all of this is superfluous; first and foremost, if you murdered two men in renaissance Italy--or even modern America, for that matter--and then picked up their bloody corpses and dragged them out into the street, tossing them in front of a crowd of people, I don't think those people would simply glance at you and then continue going about their business. But this is exactly what they do in this game.\nSave yourself the frustration. Buy a better game, and avoid this over-hyped series altogether. They will continue to pump out worthless assassin games--three or so every two years--until the hype wears off.", "hours": 10.9, "user_id": "76561197991826374", "username": "TrenchaunT", "products": 181, "early_access": false}

The beginning is probably the logical answer to that.\nOk so, I have never played the first one. They all went on sale some time last year, and I got from AC2 to AC4 for like 23 British Pounds, it was great. Like an idiot, I forgot about the first Assassins Creed. This wasn't a problem until some smart \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 from school told me they all follow a story which is intertwined in all of the games. By which time I had already got further in Assassins Creed Black Flag that any of its predecessors. As you can tell, I was off to a good start.\nThat aside, I vowed to myself not to play ANY Assassins Creed games until I finished them in order, which is a pain because I hate the era of Assassin's Creed 2. Well, to the review I guess, I have rambled enough.\nI can't remember the dates, and I can't be bothered to look it up for the sake of the review. We can make it a little interactive review, look it up yourself :) (Here:\n)\nLet's settle with 1400 and cabbage, that's a start. Assassin's Creed is set in an era before guns, which is enough for me, it put me right off. You play as an Assassin. His name is Ezio (Microsoft word thinks it\u2019s Elliot), god alone knows how you actually spell that. Much like all other games in this franchise, you are taken on quite an interesting story to uncover mythical Assassin and Templar secrets from the forgotten past. It sounds really exciting doesn't it?\nI can't give this game a 'no' because the game itself is pretty good. I just don't like it. It is well made, and the graphics are horrible. I understand it's old, but they do make me cringe a bit. The accents on the speech are horrible, no offence to Italian people, you don't all sound that bad. The gameplay is like all other assassins creed games, where the missions are often rather over complicated and you have to parkour everywhere and lunge on people and kill them. They have everything they need, they ought to make a parkour simulator, really, it's a hidden talent.\nThe story itself is quite repetitive, though it is good. There is a lot of 'kill a bunch of enemies and then do it again and again and again' and it gets BORING, but hey.\n8/10. I cannot fault the game without being an idiot. It is a good game; I just don't like it. A lot of time went into it, and for its age it is quite impressive. I have to re-enforce though, that I hate that era. Black Flag is my favourite so far, though Assassin's Creed III does look brilliant too.\nP.S. You wouldn't believe how may times I had to edit this...all the typos I made.

Early in the game, he escapes with the help of their mortal enemies, the Assassins. To join the Assassins, Desmond trains by reliving the memories of one of his ancestors, Ezio. Ezio is an Italian living in the 15th century Renaissance. He is drawn into the life of the Assassins in order to discover the perpetrators of a political plot that threatens his family. Along the way, he assassinates dozens of people, and leaps off a lot of towers.\nThe Good: Almost any bad thing you could say about the first game in this series, AC2 cleans up pretty nicely. The sometimes awkward exposition and cutscenes of 1 are replaced by a sleek, modern story with high-quality cutscenes. The story is paced much better. The controls are simpler. Meanwhile, the strong points of 1 are even stronger here. Ezio is probably my favorite Assassin of the series, transitioning from a fun-loving Aladdin expy to a brilliant, manipulative and powerful one man army out for revenge on the Templar order. Ezio's family and friends are also fun and likeable, including a pretty unusual take on Leonardo da Vinci. It is easy to switch between playing the excellent main storyline and just tooling around Venice doing random sidequests and challenges. The side missions are very fun, but they also don't feel like forced side missions - if you aren't feeling them right now, you can come back to them later or not at all without any consequences. My favorite part of the game is the beautiful recreation of the cities. If you're anything like me, you could enjoy yourself a lot just running around without even doing anything. Most games in a setting like this feel like games in a setting - but I came away from this feeling a bit like I had honestly been to Italy and absorbed a little culture. Finally, combat is improved from the original, and you have a few more options for both smashmouth and stealthy play.\nThe Bad: I have nothing I can really think of to complain about in this game. I'm sorry that you're going to have to use uPlay for it. It's really a terrible platform.\nConclusion: In my opinion the magnum opus of the Assassin's Creed series. Worth it for the magnificent Italian cities alone, but also very well-done in terms of story and gameplay.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 197, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-03-03", "text": "Sort of...\nThe Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise is almost dead and buried at this point to some, but for me, a huge fan of the series, the franchises rest gives me a chance to go back and experience all the Assassin\u2019s Creed games, before the eventual one to release next year in 2017. First, I started with Assassin\u2019s Creed 2. I tried to get to part one, but for some reason it kept crashing every 15 minutes on my PC, and there was really nothing I could do that I didn\u2019t already try. I do suggest however, that if you do go back to play the franchise, just stick with starting at AC2; AC1 is so far behind the technical curve of it\u2019s sequels, that it feels like a PS1 era game compared to it\u2019s contemporaries.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed 2 is often lauded as the best in the series and for good reason. After the simplistic and formulaic repetitiveness of Assassin\u2019s Creed 1. AC2\u2019s diversity is a breath of fresh air. And diverse missions and combat mechanics are the name of the game  in AC 2. However, there are some outstanding issues that have occurred in AC2 while I was playing, that is probably due to just the age of the game itself. First, when it comes to story, it\u2019s great! Ezio\u2019s story is engaging and often keeps you emotionally hooked, but I do have to say that I feel as far as Assassin stories go, I think Ubisoft got better at telling an Assassin's story as the series went along. My only problem with the story in AC 2 is that it tends to be exposition heavy, but what I do appreciate is that it does have some time for heartfelt moments. The other little nag is that the story overall raises far more questions than it answers. It\u2019s a shame since everything about the lore is incredibly intriguing, but for it\u2019s mysteries to be revealed in such a piecemeal manner (which is actually something the series becomes notorious for doing as it goes along) it tends to leave more of a pain to want to know just what the hell is going on. At last the reveal that comes near the end, while exciting and probably opens the series for amazing opportunities (opportunities that have seemingly been squandered in the sequels) is not entirely satisfying.\nNow when it comes to graphics, the game is still a technical marvel. The environments and armors are so detailed that it makes them really feel real. Also another thing I\u2019d like to bring up is the fact that people have started to complain recently that the series, in the more recent entries, has done all it can do to make it feel less like a real place and more like a game, but I\u2019d quickly argue that AC2 feels like a game just as much as the others due to the fact that the Animus\u2019 features cover up the screen in the same amount as the other later titles. Quickly, back to graphics, the game while still being beautiful in spots has terrible performance issues and some minor but irksome graphical glitches. When it comes to performance, it\u2019s terrible across the board. Sometimes the game will drop below 60 to the 40\u2019s for no apparent reason. I can output the game to 4k resolution and it still runs the same with the same inconsistent drops. It leads me to believe that it may be a CPU issue or something, but it is entirely annoying given that the game is pretty old. As for the graphical hitches, I fixed them with Nvidia Inspector which included better Anisotropic filtering, better VSync, and better anti-aliasing as all of the base features included in the game don\u2019t work properly.\nThe gameplay loop of Assassin\u2019s Creed is a kind of all over the place, since Ezio at this point for the next two titles isn\u2019t as nearly as fast or agile as his successors it usually takes a while to reach place to place. This is  helped by the game providing horses and some minute way of fast travel. The fast travel works only if you go to a different city so it\u2019s kind of useless and the horses unfortunately are only useful for the country sides. The good thing is that the horses are fast and not slow. However, if you come up near objects and obstacles you can slow down considerably as the game\u2019s parkour system desperately tries to determine whether your horse is jumping off a cliff or jumping over a fence even when faced in front of the fence. Now when it comes to collectibles, it can be enjoyable since they are really easy to collect and are often in near proximity of each other, which makes the act of collecting them all into an activity that lasts for about 5-6 hours. However I\u2019m glad that a couple of the future titles opted for a \u201ckicking the chest to open\u201d mechanic that makes treasure collecting far less tedious. The feathers are another collectible that you can\u2019t find in a considerable amount of time without a guide, but also provide and emotional side activity. The feathers in AC 2 actually have meaning as Ezio\u2019s mother who stops talking won\u2019t communicate with her family. Ezio collects these feathers in hope that his mother changes. It\u2019s a nice hook that gives collecting the things more meaning, something that the future entries fail to do.\nThe side missions are another part of the gameplay hook of Assassin\u2019s Creed 2. They are enjoyable for the most part, but unfortunately ere on the side of repetitiveness a bit too soon, especially the assassination missions. In the main storyline the Assassination missions are quite diverse and unique, which set up a variety of ways to assassinate your foe, but the side missions which you collect from pigeon coops are not as consistent. There are some cool diverse situations, but unfortunately most of them turn into a simple run-to-this-location-and-then-assassinate-with-your-blade.\nIs it the best game in the franchise? Yes and no, for the most part I think most people have rose-tinted glasses on when they compare the supposed \u201c\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665iness\u201d of the future sequels with the greatness of AC2. AC2 is great, but the future games in the series eventually surpassed it on a gameplay level, and arguably on a story level. The one game I think that definitely improved from a combination of the two is AC 4. On a technical level AC2\u2019s controls just pale in comparison with the other games. Recently in AC:Unity I actually felt that for the first time being an assassin was an actual viable option. In AC2 being an assassin usually comes down to dumb luck, at least from my experience. The soldiers FOV for instance just varies greatly. Sometimes I would jog to them and assassinate without a fuss, but other times when I\u2019d jog to them they would turn around instantly and detect me in which would at times turn into an automatic desync, which is incredibly annoying, as the game pulls the camera out and shakes violently  in a way that almost feels like if it\u2019s telling you, \u201cYou lost!, Stop you lost okay, Just shut up, you lost! Restart your checkpoint, you incompetent assassin!.\u201d  While in my head I\u2019m thinking, F**k you game, F**k you. It\u2019s pretty safe to say that the game\u2019s controls aren\u2019t the best nor is it\u2019s AI consistent. Thankfully these things aren\u2019t incredibly annoying as to deter you from playing, but your mileage may vary depending on what kind of games you play.\nWhen it comes to Assassin\u2019s Creed 2, you can\u2019t go wrong, you got a great story, detailed open-world, gameplay that is enjoyable, and a mythology to unravel.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 201, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-02-21", "text": "Just under a year ago I reviewed\nwhere I ultimately felt it was... alright... but multiple shortcomings and poor design choices held it back from true greatness. This time around, they've somehow managed to do almost exactly the same thing but in almost completely different ways. They've handled the story very differently, but still haven't improved it, they've tweaked the gameplay but inadvertently only served to highlight its flaws in the process, and they've given us lots of new toys to play with, but merely replaced one set of inconsequential features for a whole bunch of different ones. It's kind of both impressive and baffling how little actual progress they seem to have made from so much work.\nThe first time around, the story shifted constantly from a future setting to past, exploring a particular family lineage, but it was such a mess of writing, acting and mishandled plot that it was easily the least interesting thing the game ended up doing. This time, the future setting is pushed way into the background and largely just bookends the game and its story, coming across as baggage the developers grudgingly tried to deal with as little and as best they could. To that end, we play as Ezio in 15th century Italy as he is unwittingly drawn into the midst of a dangerous conspiracy, learning of the struggle between Assassins and Templars as they try to shape the players and politics of the day to take over the country, and ultimately the world. There's more to this as the game makes call backs to the mysterious artefact at the heart of the first game (among other things *wink-wink*), but it never feels as grand or as crucial as they probably mean it to be, and just as with the first game, I couldn't bring myself to care about the whys and found myself increasing checked out of the story, my interest having already long since departed way before the anticlimactic end. Only two games into a thirteen game series, I'm already done with the lore and wish it wasn't a thing anymore. The kernel of a good idea is tangible, but it frustratingly never seems to become anything more than that.\nThe gameplay fairs little better in its changes. The previous game had three large cities and a large hub area of towns, fields, canyons and various other sights connecting them. There was little to do here, though, so unless you really loved collectathons and sightseeing then you were bang outta luck and just had to endure the trip between main events. Thankfully, the hub area has been removed and we're instead given two very large cities, two small cities (with surrounding fields and swamplands) and your very own town to renovate. Once you're let loose to roam free in these places that's where the fun really begins, and also where the heartache hits, too, as what should be a simple joy becomes a near constant struggle and an increasing source of frustration.\nMy memories of traversal in the first game are good ones, always having a really nice sense of effortless flow to movement. Whether it was leaping across rooftops or scaling up walls, it just felt right, and very rarely did anything bad about it ever come to my attention. Here, however, I literally could hardly go a couple of minutes without encountering some kind of issue. Ezio seems magnetically drawn to damn near every object and you can barely run anywhere near a vertical surface without him trying to automatically leap onto it. Dislodging yourself from anything takes way too long, and he pretty much only jumps from anything in a 90 degree, X or Y axis direction. So, many times I wanted to jump one way but it was impossible because it wasn't aligned exactly with the limited directions he could jump. Add to this the camera that constantly insists on \"helping\" you into new angles or straight up removing your control of it completely, plus its annoying sensitivity that was never decent no matter how I adjusted it, or the frequent frame rate stutters, and the whole thing was a never-ending battle to control adequately, leaping to my death on several occasions because of the bad camera and jumping/climbing/grabbing system.\nAs with the previous title, the world itself and its scale is the star of the show which impresses most. The fact that there's only brief loading between main areas and cut scenes or missions is something I feel the games probably don't get enough credit for. Ditto with the sound design that really stood out to me on many occasions while they'd largely go unnoticed for me in other games. Visually, most of the areas are very \"busy\", which may make everything a bit of a blur of visual white noise, but I still greatly appreciated the effort once again in crafting such a fully realised world when they probably could have gotten away with less, between the overall layout, texture detail, and abundance of NPC models that fill the world. But, sadly, as with many other aspects, the busy-ness of the game also worked against it as there was a lot of what I can only think to describe as architectural clutter - basically lots of structures and pieces sticking out of every building in one place or another and getting in your way. It's clear they were placed with the intention of helping you get around faster or more gracefully, but it had the opposite effect on me as Ezio would continuously bump into stuff or grab on to out-of-the-way objects then take an age to let go of them. It just killed so much of the momentum and pace, and a lot of the fun along with it.\nLike I said, there are many new features, like upgrading your small fortress town, but aside from some aesthetic changes that you probably won't even notice, rather than unlocking new things, they only generate more money for you. But since it's such a non-issue in the game and you'll rarely ever find yourself wanting for more, this seemed useless to me. As too where many of the additional weapons and abilities. Again, the combat is a chore. I never felt engaged or threatened, just like I'd hit a tedious roadblock to endure rather than enjoy. But one of the most notable additions were tombs, extra challenge areas of sorts where you had to test your agility across obstacle courses and receive a small reward at the end. But, really, all these actually did were remind me of the game's main influence once again, Prince of Persia, except not nearly as fun as that masterpiece.\nFor all my moaning about it, again, as with its predecessor, I'm rating it up not because I necessarily loved it, but because there isn't enough to truly hate on it. It never infuriates so much or for so long that it's ruinous, just occasionally annoying. And really, its worst crime isn't that it's bad, just that it's kinda dull and never becomes all that it could be. It has one trick that it repeats over and over, that makes it fun for the first five or so hours, but which I was completed done with by hour forty... go some place, climb some stuff, kill a guy, on to the next one. That's it. I wish every area was its own separate space, in its own time period and with its own character that only he or she would operate within independent of the others. Each would have their own skills or abilities (or lack of) and would require the player to play differently with each one, switching back and forth as preferred and completing every mission in whichever order they chose. It would mostly kill off the feeling of repetition and maybe even make the cities themselves have a greater sense of functional purpose rather than suspiciously coming across as filler impersonating content. Until that day comes, while I'm sure many will adore this, I ran out of enthusiasm for it far sooner than I ever should have. So, maybe don't read this as an endorsement of Assassin's Creed 2, so much as a recommendation for Prince of Persia.

Well the number 2 of course! Which is why you now have 2 hidden blades!

You will still notice repeats of certain types of missions, go here kill that, go here get that, and the god awefull tailing missions that I still hate. Blending in with crowds feels silly, maybe thats just me, but if an armed dude walked up to me and some friends while we were talking, I dont think we would just continue the conversation. Combat is varied, fun, and satisfying. At a certain point the mission is combat is not to stay alive, its to make a spectacle of slaughtering your enemy. This is where ACII really shines.

However since I no longer own any consoles, I'm in the process of obtaining all the games again. I was uncertain about this, as I've heard many horror stories of problems ranging from technical issues to just downright not even being able to play the game due to Uplay. That being said, here was my experience with the game.\nUpon initial startup, it would not load with an error stating that the Uplay service was unavailable. This was easily fixed by downloading the current Uplay client from the website. Once I did that and installed, I restarted the game. Uplay loaded fine, linked accounts perfectly and the game started right up. I was very happy with this as this was one of the main reasons I had held off on the PC versions of this series.\nI then ran into controller issues. I have an Xbox One controller and it did not want to work, whatsoever. There is, however, a fix located in the forums that solved this issue, with some minor tweaking to get the triggers to work. After this, the game plays just like its console counterpart.\nOther than that, I've had one hard crash upon exiting to Windows, though this was more of a hang than a crash. I had to log out of my Windows profile and back in to kill the game. This caused it not to sync with my cloud, but it still saved my game to my HDD, and I was able to sync upon my next play session.\nSo, all in all, while it may not be as plug n play as its console brethren, I still reccomend this game to anyone who loved AC, as this, along with Brotherhood was its pinnacle. The graphics are great (for their time), gameplay is smooth so far, though I haven't obviously played long enough to comment on any glitches or bugs. But so far, smooth 60fps.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 207, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-01-25", "text": "The first thing that should be said is Assassins Creed 2 is a major upgrade over the original game, the game actually plays a lot more like a Sandbox game than the original.   A whole bunch of new tricks have been added to help you live our your fantasies of being an assassin.  Some sorely needed tricks missing from the original game was the double execution, and the double jump while climbing.  Also the you can loot fallen enemies for money and an occasional refilling of your consumables.  You can now buy upgrades to your armor, which improve your fighting ability.  Another new addition to the game is new weapons, no longer stuck using predetermined weapons assigned by how far in the game you've gotten.  If you want to use a mace... have at it.. want to use a sword... you're golden pony boy..  Feeling like a two hander..  find your locale guard and slay him..  You can now roll around like the executioner.  Chopping and Slopping all over town..\nThe story..  You return as Desmond Miles, a man captured by Abstergo Industries and forced to relive the memories of his ancestors.  Easy enough...  except the fact Abstergo plans to use Desmond until he's no longer viable..  (ok that's totally not cool)..  All is not lost as the first mission in the game sees Demond escape the clutches of Abstergo with the help of the sexy and talented Lucy.  He escapes from the comfortable confines of Abstergo industries to the truck of a car...   Meeting with a group of assassins who want Desmond to go back into the Animus so they can stop Abstergo.. (Wait I thought he was rescued so he didn't have to go back into the Animus... umm alrighty then)  This time around you step into the shoes of Enzio Auditore, a playboy, slacker, layabout... Although he's the son of a wealthy banker in the 1500's so what else would you expect from him.   After a major betrayal (I won't spoil it) he goes off to do what anyone would do when they are betrayed, get revenge by killing anyone involved.    The rest of the story is your typical, kill this person, rescue this person, kiss that person, while along the way building up your Uncles home town.  As a side note I personally found the Enzio story to be far more interesting than the one presented in the original game for Altaire.\nGameplay..  The game play moves away from the repetitive nature of the first game.  Where the first game required you to fulfill 3 our of 6 events to unlock an assassination, this game abandoned that in favor of a more or less story driven progression system.  Now you do story missions to push forward the game.  Plenty of stuff aside from story missions exist, such as Assassination contract, races, fighting events.  Aside from those events the game also has collectibles, gone are the flags and  in their place you have Feathers, View Points, Weapons and Armors.  New execution and climbing animations have been added...  No more killing enemies one at a time with the double execution..   You also have an upgrade-able base, and the inclusion of money, which has some effects early on in the game, but about the mid way point you'll have far more money then you could ever spend, so don't fret too much if you're only pushing a few thousand after a few hours...  Once you get your city upgraded a decent bit you'll start pulling in money hand over foot.\nCombat..  Numerous changes to combat made AC 2 seem like a totally different game.  Double executions, no more regenerating health bars (you'll need medicine to heal yourself this time around), the AI has improved slightly, no more sitting and waiting to counter attack, this time around you can button mash provided you have decent enough reflexes to counter attack enemies.  A few new tools added to the arsenal as well..   You now find yourself with a (very limited) pistol, and what good assassin would be caught dead without a smoke ball (perfect for killing high ranking officials... or getting caught with your much larger best friends wife).  Old classics like throwing knifes make a return but they are almost as limited as the pistol in terms of usefulness.\nI'll recommend Assassin Creed 2, compared to the first game, AC 2 is like night and day, for being one of the earliest entries into a fairly long series I would personally say it's held out quite nicely in almost every category that matters.  So when asking yourself if you should buy AC 2, I'll leave you with a single question..  Do you enjoy fun video games?  If you answered yes!!! Then by all means buy AC 2 and let your inner killer out..  just remember no shame exist in throwing pesky archers off high rooftops..  It can be the most fun you've ever had :-)", "hours": 23.4, "username": "Orge Lambart", "products": 10532, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

Like having puding after a meal.\nThe Bad\nI still think that the game should've had an official steam release so we can get rewards and so forth but its not the worst thing about the game. My worst experience about this game is the fact that in some cases the screen is forced at a certain angle I suppose to better view where to go and what to do. What I dont like about that is my keys change. Left isnt left anymore and back isnt back anymore. So if your after the fast paced parkour, this game on PC will frustrate you lets say a 5% of the time. Another thing that annoyed me about the game is the rooftops running, Again with the fast paced parkour. Its as if Ezio is a fearless idiot, by the time I can see he wont make it and leave the keys it tends to be too late. So he bravely flies off of the edge of a building hoping for the best results and usually dont get the best part of it. So again, if your after the fast paced stuff, not a good idea.\nNow for the good review part.\nAgain, like Assasins Creed 1, I think the game has a good basis. The finishing and graphics of the game is well done. I like the fact that the collectables in the game has meaning and rewards.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 218, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-12-29", "text": "Assassin's Creed II is a definite improvement over the first game in terms of mission variety, combat mechanics, storytelling and world building. But it is still bogged down by a lot of design choices that leave me puzzled.\nFirst of all, I just wanted to say that similarly with the predecessor, the modern day stuff just blows the big one. None of the characters are likeable. Desmond is really boring, and just does what he's told without a single thought. That Shaun guy is just a huge prick. And the computer girl just gives me \"2edgy\" vibes all the time. Lucy is okay because she's nice, but that's honestly the best trait any of the characters have. It still doesn't make me care about her.\nNow, most of the game is done in the past storyline which is great. Lots of likeable and dislikeable characters which made me care about them. The protagonist, Ezio is a lot of fun, Leonardo de Vinci is impossible to hate, and all the supporting characters are interesting. The vast amount of history available in the database on the real-life locations and characters also make this game very unique. (Though sometimes the history tidbits sound like they were written by some angsty-and-trying-to-be-cool teenager, which is very off-putting.)\nI also really enjoyed the updated weapon variety and the toned down reliance on repetitive mission types. What I mean by that is in the first game, 80% of missions were just eavesdropping, or pickpocketing (in other words, something incredibly trivial). In this game, there's a larger variety of missions, and the dependence on a single mechanic isn't really as present.\nNegatives? Combat is simple (which is fine) but somehow they still manage to make it incredibly finnicky and not smooth. Same with wall running, I found myself jumping in the complete opposite direction to what I wanted or jumping off of a building way too many times. Also the HUD is very annoying; it's incredibly ugly, intruisive and distracting. Anything that reminds you that you're in the Animus was such a headache to look at. The only other thing on the technical side of things is the texture pop-in. Holy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665it's awful. At least this game runs better than the first one.\nAnd while the story is interesting at points, it really just cumulates in the last quarter of the game. The first three quarters is just \"kill this guy for revenge\" over and over again. And the ending is incredibly nonsensical. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's borderline \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\nWhile it's an improvement over the first game, I still can only recommend this as a buy when it's on sale. To me there are just so many strange things that bring the quality of the game down. I really don't get the hype around this series when there are so many poorly executed mechanics right up front and center. I give this a 7.0/10.

Lots of new features that just make gameplay more enjoyable. Things I liked:\n- A noteriety system. Instead of guards being more easily aggravated as the game progresses, you build noteriety through assassinations but it can easily be reduced by tearing down some wanted posters. No more accusations of infidelity for climbing a ladder!\n- \"Dungeons\" to explore. They're like mini levels and at the end you get some treasure and money. They're laid out for optimal leaping and climbing and very satisfying to complete.\n-No more galloping around the Kingdom to get to places and then never exploring the area again. You just go to the edge of the map and click where you want to go. Also a bit more believable than Damascus and Jerusalem being a 2 minute horseback ride away.\n- This is a hard one to say whether I like but you don't investigate the assassination targets anymore. Personally I found that quite dull and repetitive. You don't have to save monks or beggars anymore either. It feels a lot more like you choose what to do which is great because for me AC will be about having the freedom to do whatever you want like climbing the Sistine Chapel, punching lepers etc.\n\n-The music is lovely.\nThings I didn't like:\n-The combat is a bit too easy, it would be nice to have a bit more of a challenge but it does make you feel like an unstoppable badass.\n-Leonardo Da Vinci. Yeah he's in this game and gives you upgrades. I know AC is really historical and filled with real figures but he just feels weird and out of place. Very small niggle though. At least he's nice.\nGET THIS GAME!

In many aspects it is better then the first Assassin's Creed.\nPros:\n- Captivating story. Although you can sense a little bit of what might be coming, I was still amazed that they went full blast on that concept.\n- Not as repetitive as AC 1.\n- Great graphics, and environment in general. History lives and breaths in this game. From music, through architecture, details and famous and fabulous painting. Even weaponry of the era.\n- Eagle vision is useful!\n- Interesting characters.\n- Decent length of game play.\nCons (not many):\n- Combat is very similar to one from the original game. Can feel clumsy a bit sometimes.\n- Although you have a wide variety of weapons to chose from, I hardly ever used throwing knives (unlike AC 1) or felt necessity to use short blade (unlike AC 1 again).\n- From time to time you might get irritated when camera's twists and turns mess up your jumping or other acrobatics.\n- Although far less bugs happened, I've captivated pretty hilarious one. In Venice you may encounter legions of guards on one tiny bit of rooftop. Out of the sudden. They just HAPPENED there. The more you killed trying to clear out the area, the more would pop up in their sted. Creepy.\nApart from that, the game is one of the rarer kinds when you have a blast playing and can learn some history. This is of great value as well, and AC series so far has been also educative. I know I'll be fishing for other titles of AC now. Yeah, I've heard the rumours about meh protagonist in AC III but... I must yet get disappointed by any game of the series.

Playing with a mouse and keyboard is doable, but there will be plenty of moments where you fight the auto-camera and think \"No Ezio, why did you leap THAT way?!\" The controls don't always play nice.\nCombat is easy enough since countering is not always an instant kill, but it's never really a challenge. More of a delayer. Most fights will be bypassed or cheesed with lots and lots of knives, or if it's just simple mooks, counter away.\nAside from that, it's stabby stabby slicey slicey.

The hints were overcome once you have the pictures memorized, and turning off the HUD removed the controller aspect.\nThe game leads to the sequel and thus feels a bit incomplete main story-wise (the Desmond stuff), but the parts that take place in the past are fulfilled.\nOverall, I would recommend this game.", "hours": 37.5, "user_id": "76561198052554580", "username": "daschus", "products": 123, "early_access": false}

If you were prepared for this it wouldn't be that much of a biggy but I was given no prior warning to this and so it's like going into a cinema and having the opening for the movie played every now and then but then it cuts to a massive string of adverts.\nWhen I finally got to the Uplay section and made an account I thought I got to play.

I tried playing the first one (and I would still like to finish it), but it's horrible to look at on Parallels and I unfortunately do not have a PC.\nMy favorite parts of this game are the soundtrack and the parkour aspects. It has the best soundtrack in any of the games up to \"Black Flag\" (since I haven't seen anything past that). Even when I had to do a mission multiple times and got frustrated when the same music signaling I was in the chase sequence or whatever kept playing and I would mute the music to stop bothering me, I could still come back to it and I enjoy it a lot. The parkour aspect - after I figured it out - was REALLY cool. It's just fun to jump up and around obstacles and not feel limited by where I could go. It's how I imagine Spider-man would work without the web-shooters, which is great cause Spidey is one of my favorite supers.\nThey took it out for this game, so I didn't experience it until I loaded up \"Brotherhood\", but I am really, really grateful this didn't have the \"meet the scene requirements\" aspect. I get why that matters, and it makes a lot of sense, lore-wise (e.g., Ezio killed this guy by dropping a ladder on him, if you're reliving a memory, why would you kill him by stabbing him?), but it is SO frustrating, particularly when you're still figuring out the controls. Personally I liked not having to redo a ridiculously long walking sequence so I could try, again, to get ONE requirement done.\nThe graphics are good and the story is okay. Probably the hardest moments were when you unlocked mini scenes with Ezio collecting the feathers for his mother. At 50, your uncle walks in and tells you it's hopeless and Ezio lowers his head sadly. He doesn't say anything, but that scene said a LOT.\nThe puzzles were tough and I had to look up how to get through at least one assassination - the stupid boat one - and the guards could be irritating.

I'm a huge fan of the story, and I have to say, the ending got me. Definitely worth it, after the initial struggles.\nInitially, getting the game to actually run was a problem. Steam didn't actually give me the Uplay launcher, per se, and because I did not know that I needed it, I was getting frustrated that I couldn't actually play the game that I had just bought. Looking through for answers, I was a bit annoyed that I had to go download a whole new launcher just to get the game to run, but I sucked it up and dealt with it, as I'm sure a number of other players have already done, and will continue to do. Aside from that initial issue, I didn't have a single problem with functionality or anything of the sort, so that's a plus.\nI've now set my scopes on part III, because I want to know how Desmond's story really ends (and don't want to do it the cheap way and search it on the internet\u2014where's the fun in that?).", "hours": 16.8, "username": "\ud835\udd6f\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd9b", "products": 64, "early_access": false}

In this sequel, Ubisoft couldn't fix the controls so they loosened up the combat mechanics, making your protagonist a match for even a crowd of enemies out in the open while removing much of the restrictions for a successful assassination. Instead of fixing flaws, they gave you more tools to navigate through the same engine.\n\n\"More rather than better\" seems to be the theme of the day. You can collect around 30 different weapons but darn if I can figure out why I need that many when there are only three types of enemies and you're encouraged to commit your assassinations quietly. There are a ridiculous amount of hidden chests but the bulk of your income will come from your villa and frankly, it's ridiculous that your main money pit (villa restorations) serves to increase your revenue. Between endless assassination side quests, puzzle deciphering and collectibles, I have over 25 hours of gameplay and am still roughly in the middle of the main storyline. This game is positively\nwith filler.\n\nWhat you lose from all of those extra combat mechanics is your overall sense of vulnerability in being a shadowy assassin. Who needs stealth when you can take on a crowd of enemies and still win? All I wanted was a fix to the backstabs from the first game; suddenly I'm face-stabbing a full company of armored brutes with only a couple of smoke bombs as my cover. Cheap, plentiful medicine makes health hardly an issue. All your methods for hiding in plain sight have been kept from the previous game but they've added ways to decrease your aggro from the guards, making your hiding techniques superfluous!\n\nAn especially heinous mention needs to be given to the\nDRM which kept crashing on updates and various occasions. Obviously, I've managed to circumvent this problem if I've coped this far but it's still a frustrating experience to figure out\nI also believe it's messing with my Steam Achievements, as in uPlay's Achievements are written over the Steam ones.\n\nThis isn't sounding like the most enthusiastic of endorsements but\nis merely a flawed game, not an outright unenjoyable one. The characters you meet are engaging, the exploration sequences filled with secrets and those assassination side quests might be filler but they offer some fun challenges along the way. The problem is that you don't *need* to do any of these extra side quests: your reward for those is money and you can get all the money you want simply by\n.

But back in the day, it was a respected franchise because of the games own quality. For me and for many, the best game is still Assassin's Creed II. And what an experience it is, following the story from an young Ezio to a more mature one, while visiting Florence and Venice. The story is well written and gripping, along with Ezio and it's allies, especially it's friend Leonardo Da Vinci. The recreation of Florence and Venice in the 15th century is an immersive one. The gameplay, although not incredible, makes of a good job in both combat and exploration. There's also plenty of side quests and collectibles that really matters, and you'll feel compeled to 100% the game, which isn't hard. The modern day sections are a bit dull, but they are rare. And the soundtrack is well composed. My only complain is that you can't replay missions. But still, it's truly a modern-day gaming gem.\nI also need to speak about my Uplay expecience: personally, i didn't had major problems with it, except for the saves never uploading to the Uplay cloud, which is very common. It was more of a second launcher, and in-game you'll forget it. But despite not having problems (except for cloud saving), i don't support Uplay because it felt useless, has little features and still causes problems for many honest customers.

While entertaining, the action within the game has come to be dated and clunky, and while this is a massive step up from the headache-inducing interaction of it's predecessor, it still leaves much to be improved upon. (To Ubisoft's credit, they did do just that. For better gameplay, move on to later installments of the Assassin's Creed Series.)\nWhat makes this game stand out is the atmosphere. The feel. The setting. Renaissance Italy, as it turns out, lends itself greatly to action and adventure, but allows for that extra bit of flamboyance that only a night in Florence can give. The intrigue of the period makes for unparalleled experierences amongst games of this type, and the very placement of a game into such a familiar let unexplored time period brought diversity to the use of historical settings in game.\nFrom Assassin's Creed II, you will be introduced to a cast of characters and a canvas of settings that will, even after  years, come to surprise and delight you. While I cannot describe in full the emotional effects of this game on myself or anyone else, I can say without question that it is worth whatever price and that I strongly recommend it for all gamers, serious or casual.\nThank you for reading.", "hours": 21.2, "username": "George Washington", "products": 131, "early_access": false}

The gameplay itself is far superior to that of AC1 although if you are new to the series I would recomend starting on AC1 just to appreciate how much better AC2 is. Combat is great, Ubi added a system of buying weapons, short weapons, and armor, where as in AC1 the player was spoonfed a certain set of items as they leveled up. Counter attacks are great, combat sounds are much better than in AC1, Ubi also added much better ways to assassinate people such as fixing air assassinations, adding assassinations from haystacks, adding assassinations from benches. Graphically AC2 is far superior to AC1 (considering that this game is from 2009). The story is much better and much longer than AC1, whereas AC1 had 9 assassinations where you do the same thing over and over, AC2 has i think 14 or 15 assassinations, and NO SITTING ON A BENCH REQUIRED! A GUI was added to the game aswell as the ability to upgrade Villa Auditore: the more you upgrade the more money you get. Cosmetic details were added such as the ability to dye clothes (each region [Florence, Venice, and Tuscany] have their own colors). Ezio wields dual hidden blades, hence the ability to kill 2 targets at one time, as opposed to Alta\u00efr with his single hidden blade. AC2 includes people that accually lived such as Lorenzo de Medici, Leonardo da Vinci, Katerina Sforza, and Girolamo Savonarola (in the DLC: Burning of The Vanities). The parkour/freeruning system is greatly improved, the wall climbing is faster, and more fluid, and the character no longer hits invisible wals.\nOverall Ubi took everything good about AC1, gave the game a better main character, a better setting, and a better story, and made AC2\n9.5/10 9.5 cuz of minor glitches and such.", "hours": 225.0, "user_id": "76561198131927486", "username": "Albert", "products": 88, "early_access": false}

If you skipped the first game (although I highly reccomend you don't, more on that later) the game takes the liberty of summing up all the important plot points in a cutscene at the very start of the game. The world is much more diverse than the first game (where all the cities essentially looked the same) and the story is FAR more expansive (I played more than twice the amount of hours I did with the first one before I actually beat the game). Assassin's Creed 2 also introduces the use of the Uplay server which, despite having very poor feedback towards it, is more of a cool additional feature than it is a nuisance. Here are some of the major points I have about this game (+ is positive, - is negative)\n+The game is incredibly immersive and makes you form real connections with each and every character you are introduced to.\n+SO MANY SIDE MISSIONS/COLLECTIBLES, but nowhere near as difficult as the flags from AC1 and each sidequest rewards you with real in-game rewards.\n+/- Uplay has some very good parts about it, and some slight bad ones. The bad thing is that in order to play any Assassin's Creed title from this game forward, you MUST download a seperate Uplay launcher on the Ubisoft website and make an account before you are able to play it (which would have been nice to know before buying the game). The good of it is that you will get certain achievements throughout the game that award you with Uplay credits, which you can spend in the Uplay shop for additional content in the game. No real money is required, the rewards are neat, and you get the awards for just playing through the game.\n-The Uplay wallpaper for this game is AWFUL. I can't even explain how terrible of a wallpaper it is. Unless you're a completionist, I wouldn't bother with it.\n+The missions add so much to the story and they're so diverse in fashion that you'll hardly realize you've spent four hours of your life trying to finish *that* sequence or complete *this* collection.\n-They don't give any explanation of what control does what at the beginning of the game, so it's difficult to get used to it. This is easily fixed by simply playing the first game, that goes much further into depth about how to use the controls. After that, it gets pretty easy.\nAll in all, Assassin's Creed 2 is one of the greatest games I have ever played. The story is fantastic, the mechanics are phenomenal, the side missions will keep you locked in for hours alone, and the progression is so rewarding. I HIGHLY reccomend this game- actually, this entire SERIES to any gamer out there who might not have tried it.", "hours": 40.8, "user_id": "76561198070038402", "username": "Ohanadude98", "products": 145, "early_access": false}

I picked it up on Steam for a replay when it was on sale, but it uses Ubisoft's Uplay software, which was \"not available\" when I loaded up the game to play. Several users have had problems with Uplay, and it seems silly to me that running an entirely single-player game should depend on the availability of Ubisoft's DRM services.\nThus, I would recommend against buying this game on Steam. If you have a console, though, or are willing to put up with Uplay, it's a great game.\nEdit 1-11-16:\nApparently, many folks have found a way to make the Uplay part work (see the comments on this review; basically you need to download the Uplay launcher from Ubisoft's website separately). Although I haven't tried it myself, this would probably take Uplay from a dealbreaker to a mere annoyance in my opinion. As I said above, the game is spectacularly fun, so it might be worth a shot at making the Uplay work to play it. You can always request a refund if you have problems.\nGiven the new information, I've changed my review to a positive recommendation. If you've never played it before, I think it'd be worth a try, even considering Uplay.", "hours": 0.2, "username": "Derfunkity", "products": 169, "early_access": false}

However, this same care seems lacking when it comes to actual gameplay. Additionally, a few problems with the scripting and cutscenes really damage the immersion they try to create with the detailed world. Also, it's too long (I would say I enjoyed 10 hours of the 20 it took me to beat the game).\nAs you put your first few hours into this game, you'll probably have a great time as you get a hang of the mechanics and complete the various different challenges spread throughout the world. You really have to stick with it to get to the part where the game starts becoming an unpleasant slog.\nThe freerunning/climbing in this is pretty cool, but the moment you run into a situation where you don't understand why you can't grab something or your character doesn't do what you wanted them to, it'll sour the experience. It's very difficult to translate analog stick input into a selection from such a rich, complex space of possible movements, and I honestly can't see what they could've done to make this work better. These problems wouldn't hurt the game experience so much if they didn't have sections that rely heavily on these mechanics in a way that brings out the flaws of the movement engine. The most glaring issue is the sections that cause a memory to restart from the beginning if you are detected. For some reason, the environments that these missions took place in were prone to eliciting these movement issues. Getting detected is not only frustrating because  you have to start from the beginning of the section, but because it doesn't feel like it's your fault - you just didn't expect the character to move in a certain way. You're unlikely to run into this problem until you're well into the game.\nThere's just so many situations when you are freerunning where it's not clear what your character is going to do or they do something you don't want them to do. Like getting stuck crouching on small waist high ledges when all you want to do is go to the ground, causing you to become easily visible to enemies you were trying to avoid and slowing down your movement. Then when you try to get off the ledge, instead of just jumping to the ground, he tries to jump to a handhold or another ledge.\nThe combat is dreadfully boring. You wait for an enemy to attack and parry. Or you hold block and then hit attack in a rhythm until the enemy dies. For some enemies, they take lots of hits until they die, even with the strongest sword. It's unnecesarilly drawn out because of this. All they needed to do is to make combat shorter and less frequent. It happens far too often, even if you are being stealthy, and is just thoughtless. And it's so easy that it actually encourages you to avoid stealth and just kill everyone instead of wasting a bunch of time sneaking around.\nThe stealth aspect of the gameplay is infuriating. You won't realize it until you get a bit into the game and have sections where any detection means you'll fail and have to start from the beginning of the checkpoint. For the most part, it's pretty clear when an enemy will see you. But, again, as you get later into the game, you'll run into challenges that are set up in a way that they bring out all the flaws of the enemy detection system (I'm looking at you, liutenant assassination memories). It could be made much less frustrating by either providing more feedback on why you are getting spotted, by having more frequent checkpoints, or by simply designing the challenges in a way that acknowledges the weaknesses of the detection system and avoiding them. This is the main reason I regret my time with this game - the \"avoid detection\" sections made me so mad, and this really ruined the game for me. Deviously, these frustrating sections come right towards the end of the game, meaning they'll stick out most in your mind as you think about your experience with the game.\nFinally, while they do an excellent job of trying to capture the historical setting via the modeling, sound, textures, and music, several key flaws ruin this immersion. The main flaws involve the actual stuff that happens in these memories being unbelievable or not fitting with the story. For example, there's seceral scenes where armed soldiers jump 50 feet down out of nowhere to fight you in a forced combat section. Or, the first time you fight the spaniard, you actually kill him by bringing his health down to zero during the combat, but in the cutscene that immediately follows he looks completely unfazed and isn't dead. Or, during the last battle with the spaniard, you have several allies that proceed to stand there and do nothing as you wail on him over and over and over, just pressing X over and over again until you get his health to 0.  These sort of strange, immersion-breaking moments are everywhere. Overall, it just feels like the implementation of the writing in terms of cutscenes and memories became sloppier and sloppier as I got further in the game. I almost feel like they were tricking me by having the game be fun at the start and hiding the unpolished, unpleasant parts towards the end of the game when I had already invested time into it.\nAnd this game just drags on and on without changing it up enough. I'm fine with a long game as long as it's still interesting, but this game is long and samey. If the game was half this length, I might've changed this to a recommendation.\nIn sum, if you have lots of time and like just running around completing quests and stuff like that, you might like this, but you have a lot of other great open world games that provide that experience in a much better way than this game. Other than that, I would absolutely not recommend this - it's just not fun enough through the whole game and, while fun at times, will ultimately leave you feeling frustrated, unsatisfied, and whishing you had spent valuable hours of your life playing something more consistently fun.", "hours": 23.0, "username": "chairbender", "products": 392, "early_access": false}

Despite his lack of training, Ezio immediately sprints out the batcave and begins to clean the streets (a broomstick is a viable weapon in this game, apparently). With the help of his good friend Leonardo DaVinci (French for Pennyworth), Ezio sets out with a positive arsenal of exotic weaponry; from an early Batarang, which due to technical limitations of the time, only has 1 hyper-sharp blade, and doesn't really come back after use, to the grapple, which instead of attaching to buildings from a long distance, functions as a way of holding close targets in place - with optional fatal injury.\nWhat unfolds is a spellbinding and beautiful tale of family, redemption, revenge and mass murder.\nYeah, the whole \"no killing\" thing hasn't really been established yet - but  let's be honest here, I think slamming someone in the neck with a car door and leaving them, broken, miles from the nearest hospital also counts as murder.\nAlong with a majestic soundtrack, the game also improves immersion with a launcher inspired by renaissance-era technology. I found the 30 or so minutes I had to spend getting the piece of horse dung to work highly immersive, which, coupled with the painfully intrusive notification system, really made me feel the wonderment and awe of the renaissance.", "hours": 44.9, "username": "The Cowboy Raver", "products": 115, "found_funny": 687, "early_access": false}

I freaking love this game.\n==================\nOld Grumpy Review below\n==================\nWOW Where to begin with this game? This is a pre-game review as I haven't really played too much of this port to really comment on the actual gameplay. But let's get some stuff out of the way that they may not tell you.\nThis is a PC port that requires use of UPlay. If you do not have Uplay, you will need to register for it. Otherwise, you cannot play it.\nFramerate has a hard cap of ~62 FPS. From what I understand the oh so lovely Anvil Engine the game runs on is to blame. I've heard of stories of some people force unlocking their framerates on custom resolutions but I can't be bothered to look into that. They allow you to select 120hz and even 144hz refresh rates though, so more power to the game for that at least.\nThe game's age really shows though, It was meant to run on Xbox 360 Hardware after all. Textures and shadows pop in and out a predefined field around the character, and running it on 1080p and above monitors, it looks absolutely disgusting. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that everything looks terrible and sh*tty unless your character is pressing RIGHT UP AGAINST whatever it is you're looking at. Even when the textures are fully loaded in, they still look like\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nOverall, from a buyers standpoint, if you had to choose between playing this game on Steam or a console, it's probably better to pick up the console version for maybe 5 bucks or less than to pay 20 for basically the same thing but on PC. If it's on sale maybe for $5 on steam, then yes, it's justified.", "hours": 69.9, "username": "AssimiLeaf", "products": 416, "early_access": false}

Having heard great things about the series, I chose this as my starting point and was a bit disappointed.\nThere are so many poor development choices here, and I'm really hoping they're addressed in other AC games because I'd like to try at least one more out. But here are my criticisms:\n1) The game uses Uplay, which sorta sucks. I thankfully haven't had a lot of the issues some of the other reviews here have had with it, but I did run into issues on initial startup (some Uplay files deleted themselves and I needed to reinstall it, for example)\n2) Freerunning..while it's pretty awesome and can be at times fantastic, there have been a lot of situations where Ezio just did the stupidest\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and really frustated me. Trying to jump off a roof towards a hay stack and for some reason jumping two feet out onto the cold hard floor and dying. Trying to drop two feet onto a balcony to get a treasure chest and INSTEAD jumping 30 feet down into a haystack. Trying to catch someone on a rooftop and jumping slightly too far off to a side instead of onto a little foothop. You get the drift. In a game where you need to be swift and precise the precision just doesn't feel there quite a bit of the time...Not that often, but often enough that it gets frustrating. Along with that, the puzzles aren't even really puzzles, but more of a \"can you look around and then hold the freerunning button in the correct direction\".\n3) Combat is atrocious. Foes are constantly blocking and sometimes counter you (which doesn't hurt you much, so there isn't really any reprecussion) so you have to whittle down their health tediously or just sit around waiting for them to attack so you can counter, which sometimes barely hurts them. Allies hit each other (had a quest character hurt another one 3/4 of her health). Stealth killing sometimes launches you off roofs when you just wanted to look cool..Also random posts get in the way when you drop in for stealth kills. Why wouldn't it just make me jump differently so the stealth kill worked? Who knows.\n4) You can't switch weapons or armor without going back to your main villa. This is stupid as hell. If I buy a weapon that is worse than my old one just so I have everything bought why do I automatically equip it and why do I have to go all the way to a transport station so I can get back to the main villa, go to the equipment room, and reequip my better weapon/armor? So stupid.\nSome of the dialogue is just laughable (you need outlets Ezio 'I have outlets' OTHER THAN \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665S haha lol) and the plot is a little contrived. I'd much rather just have the plot center around Ezio and not have the simulation aspects (also the decoded video segments are ridiculous looking and stupid in my opinion). Following people around for missions is boring. Money comes way too easy and you'll have more than you ever need after you start upgrading the villa. There's no sense of tension since you can heal yourself at any time.\nThe game isn't all bad of course. There's still some fun to be had and there's plenty to do and collect. It just seems really pointless at times...there's enough playtime here that you'll 'probably' get your money's worth, there's just plenty of better things you could be doing or playing.", "hours": 29.3, "user_id": "76561198019014373", "username": "Mokor", "products": 201, "early_access": false}

I understand the time it came from, so just have an open mind if you've never played this game before. It's more colorful than the first game. Textures and models still look good. Character models are a little dated but not too bad.\nThere is plenty of content, most of which is compelling and/or fun enough to actually bother with. You can do anything from races to assassination contracts to collecting feathers to even flying with Da Vinci's invention just for fun. You can look for hidden loot, do the assassin's tomb side quests (which are great fun and grant you Altair's armor after you do all six), to courier missions, to taking down thieves and runners.\nThe main story is very interesting, and you start out, once you're in the Animus, as Ezio as a baby, so you practically see Ezio's entire life unfold. The story is more character driven than paying attention to the big picture, which really isn't at the forefront until almost near the end of the game. You'll go to many different historic locations in Italy as the story unfolds.\nThe game difficulty is relatively easy, so it's accessible to new Gamers. It never felt overly easy where I felt bored, though, and by the end of the game it brought on a decent challenge, as it brings about everything you've learned and gained to full circle. The AI is also decently balanced and well programmed with some exceptions, as when in need to be stealthy, they won't unfairly spot you... most of the time.\nNow the Bad:\nThe controller input was a huge pain to set up. It's weird really, it recognized that I was using an XBox One controller (literally, it didn't think it was a 360 controller) but inputs are read as \"Button 1, Button 2, etc.\" So they were a pain to set and often I had to go back and change them because they still felt uncomfortable. The controls in the HUD are also not identified as \"A, B, X, Y, etc.\" instead they are identified as symbols, which gets very confusing until you use them after a few hours and commit them to memory.\nOn top of that, the camera can screw up a jump incredibly easily, or if Ezio isn't positioned right at times he'll jump in the complete opposite direction you wanted him too and either die, get found, or lose a lot of health. This got annoying but not to the point where I wanted to stop playing.\nAlso... Uplay. This is a negative because of how weird it acts. A few times Uplay crashed on me, sometimes it wouldn't start up the game, other times it actually froze my computer. Also it's mandatory to have it run to play this game.\nNow the (not so) bad:\nThis is almost like a feature (The series as a whole is known for their glitches), but there are glitches galore, but never to the point of game breaking and usually they end up being really funny. The AI will push each other, sometimes dead bodies spaz out, at one point my target accidentally killed itself, etc. Sometimes it ended up costing me, like there is some collision detection issues when assassinating guards on the edge of a roof, but sometimes I would end up having them stuck in the wall with their legs hanging out, so I got a good laugh from that.\nAll in All I highly recommend this if you missed out, as you're in for a real treat.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 293, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-05-16", "text": "My thoughts on this game can be summed up by one sentence: It is simple (to a somewhat large fault), fairly efficient and honestly very enjoyable... when it clicks.\nLet's start out with the simple part: The game is simple. If you are new to gaming, it may seem hard at first, but after about 10 hours this game becomes largely child's play. The combat is very easy, with numerous overpowered weapons and tactics that largely make the weapon counter system largely useless. While the combat doesn't get too stale (mostly because you breeze through battles and confrontations so swiftly), it's certainly not a high mark of the game.\nAdditionally the AI isn't that smart, nor numerous to be a threat (except late in the game when you can heal yourself an insane amount of health and have tactics and weapons that make their numbers worthless). It's a shame this game didn't come with a difficulty level feature, because with more enemies, smarter enemies, and more damage dealt from attacks the combat could have been much more exciting.\nNow for the efficient part, this game just \"gets\" things right. The locales are beautiful, fairly large, and filled with quite a few cool places to explore. Overall the world in Assassin's Creed II is great. They also capture the Era in a really fun way. On top of that, they took out some of the most broken aspects of the original Assassin's Creed, namely making the easy dagger kills harder, cutting the \"pray\" hiding option, and making enemies do more expansive searches and use more kinds of moves. The mission pace and structuring is also way better. No longer do you have to do terribly stale mini-game tasks to get to the insanely fun assassination missions. Instead you do actually productive things to lead to the assassinations. The only mandatory task that may get boring are the following missions, but that's only if you play a lot of Assassin's Creed. Those felt more drawn out by latter iterations though.\nLastly, for the very enjoyable part, the feel of the game is just really freaking cool. It's fun to do so many just basic stuff. \"Fun\" is something I find sadly missing in a lot of games, but Assassin's Creed definitely is not one of those games. Basic fun things that are fun to do including travelling, climbing, walking, starting fights, doing any of the variety of side quests, messing with NPC's of all factions, playing with weapons, or getting cool kills. Additionally, while simple and far from a \"full plot\" (as the multiple sequels should indicate), the plot is fairly fun (and good) as well. The characters were generally pretty good, aside from some of the modern day characters.\nNow, there are two main issues to be brought up to prevent enjoyment from reaching that \"next level.\" I define that \"next level\" in gaming as the point when good fun meets good game design to make a great experience. That to me is truly what makes \"classic, must play\" games, of which Assassin's Creed II is not of that caliber. There are two main issues that prevent that level of enjoyment and experience to being met: AI and Game Difficulty.\nAll of the AI's are lacking in intelligence. The AI follows a very linear path and thinking process when you are engaged with them. It's easy to catch how they respond and manipulate it to make the game way too easy. You can use these loopholes to escape or win any confrontation without trying too hard. This ease of abusing and beating the AI takes away the fun \"difficulty\" in the game a lot of the time, and it makes beating the AI seldom feel like an accomplishment.\nLack of difficulty is partially a result of the AI issues previously mentioned, but it's a more grand combination of many game design flaws in Assassin's Creed II. One example is the money flow in the game. If you invest money in your Vila, you get money back... at an insane pace.\nAnother issue in the game design and difficulty of the game is the defense. You get tons of bars of health from armor and completing missions/Codex pages to where it takes about a dozen hits to die sometimes . Add in the fact you can carry double digit potions that can heal half of the max health obtainable, and you can survive up to around 50 attacks. Considering how bad the AI is, that makes you essentially invincible. Offense is similarly overpowered. Many weapons are not just easy to abuse, but your melee weapons in particular are usually fast, powerful, and/or good at breaking through shields or armor. This makes defeating enemies even easier. This combination of overpowered defense and offense makes it nearly impossible to die unless you fall or just don't know what you are doing at all in combat.\nThis ease of combat difficulty is a shame, because if this game had more combat difficulty and forced you into situations with few if any easy outs and many hard outs, some of the moments that kind of \"clicked\" could have reached that divine level of gaming where you just lose yourself in the difficulty and fun of the game having perfect syngergy, which is something only the exploration and harder climbing tasks (initially) ever tend to do.\nIn summary: Assassin's Creed II is in most ways a huge step up from Assassin's Creed I. Gone is the filler, and instead we are given a fresh new plot, a smarter stealth system, more awesome tools and techniques, and an overall refined and redefined Assassin's Creed experience. While Assassin's Creed II misses the mark on several design concepts (namely game balance and difficulty, specifically for combat), it's simply fun throughout with few points of the game where that stops being the case. That fun allows the replay value to make beating the game 100% enjoyable, but is more limited in later game replays at quite a few spots of the game. Assassin's Creed II does a lot of things right and a few things great, and occasionally does things incredibly well. The lack of consistent greatness via a few game design flaws is ultimately prevents the Assassin's Creed II's experience from reaching that level of gaming, but even with those flaws this game is still a blast to play.\nI would recommend fans of open world, adventure game, and action game fans at least try this game at least once.\n(Note that before you read my rating, my scale is measured to rate games based on how good they are, not how bad they are. Instead of rating 7 as Average like IGN or other reviewers, 1 is average, and anything below that is a 0. IGN will only give you 3 ratings based on how good a game is, but I will give you 9 to truly separate the good from the great, and the great from the all-time best video games ever.\nMy rating system goes: 0: Bad, 1: Average, 2: Somewhat Good, 3: Mostly Good, 4: Undeniably Good, 5: Somewhat Great, 6: Mostly Great, 7: Undeniably Great, 8: Somewhat an All-time Game, 9: Mostly an All-Time Amazing Game, 10: Undeniably an All-Time Game)\nOverall the rating I give Assassin's Creed II is a 7/10. For this price (especially with the Deluxe Edition content) it is an exceptionally good deal.", "hours": 63.7, "user_id": "76561197985849557", "username": "Johnknight1", "products": 522, "early_access": false}

Escaping from Abstergo Industries and joining a crew of Assassins, Desmond relives the life of another ancestor, Ezio Auditore, an Assassin from Renaissance Italy who sought to avenge his family's murder at the hands of Templars while uncovering a conspiracy of his own.\n: This game builds on what made the first\na success, while introducing a new climbing and combat mechanics. Although less numerous, cities are larger and taller than ever before, gaining access to new areas almost up until the end-game. You have a home base, Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, in which you can invest to get recurring in-game revenue. The story is interesting and intriguing, and missions are less rinse & repeat than the previous game. Although the graphics are some years old, they still hold as ok by today's standards.\n: There is very little development with the overarching plot that made Desmond travel back to Alta\u00efr's and Ezio's memories in the first place. If you invest early enough in Villa Auditore, money becomes trivial quickly, making sidequests like races and assassination contracts pointless, and you will make little to no use of the items you get from collecting feathers. Fighting can get somewhat repetitive, and late-game bosses pose no more challenges in a fight than the average guard, albeit taking more strikes to get rid of. There are no random events, so you will pretty much fast-travel all the time as soon as you've been to a region once.\n: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 - Next on your list!\nOverall, this game is a good followup to its predecessor, finishing on a cliffhanger much like the first game.

Will it be worth it?\nAbout an hour in the game, all fears washed away. I was in love. This was the game that started my obsession with the franchise.

It showed me that even video games can have a beautiful soundtrack, just like the movies. I still listen to it whenever I am studying and trying to relax.

I like it more then Far Cry or any of their other games. It is a semi open world action game with great parkour and fun combat. Not to mention, the story is a simple story, but one that is nothing short of exceptional. In Assassin's Creed 2 you play the role of Ezio. A young italian living in the Renaissance era. One day he gets in a fight with a powerful family and the consequences soon follow. His father soon warns him about how Ezio needs to escape and take a letter to someone whom is a friend of his. Ezio delivers the letter to this man and he assures Ezio his family will be safe. The next day Ezio witnesses a public execution orchestrated by the same man of whom he entrusted the letter to and his entire family is killed before his eyes.\nSoon after, Ezio becomes involved in the battle of the assassins versus the templars. From that point on, you truly begin to really get involved in the gameplay. Ezio is a well versed assassin and is capable of jumping from ledge to ledge or platform to platform. The parkour controls in the game are spot on and it's a blast to scale through cities like Venice and Florence during the Renaissance era. Ezio being the assassin he is can sneak up on unsuspecting guards and assassinate them. Alternatively though, he can fight them like a badass one man army fighting enemies head on with a variety of weapons. In the combat, you can dodge, counter, disarm or even throw enemies. The combat is a lot of fun and is very simple to pick up. Unfortunately, the game's combat and smoothness is not without it's flaws. Combat can be a little too easy because counter attacks are very powerful and Ezio gets a lot of health. Mission design in the game is incredibly well done and the main story missions test your combat, stealth and parkour abilities. Overall, this is a really excellent game and it's definitely worth playing. I can safely say this game stands the test of time and is still great to this day.", "hours": 35.3, "user_id": "76561198071185809", "username": "Michael", "products": 245, "early_access": false}

Our hero is Ezio Auditore, an interesting character and the favorite of all AC fans, to be honest Ezio is great, he is funny, brave and appealing as a main character.\nOur missions are varied, main missions, sub missions and fillers like gathering feathers, and some other small artifacts that unlock secrets, to all this, devs have added some interesting feature known as glyphs, which basically are signs that let you to some puzzles that you must solve in order to see part of human history and the influence of some important characters of the world and how they managed to acquire a Piece of Eden, this made the game really appealing and deeper regarding the mysteries surrounding the First Civilization.\nThroughout our adventures we meet interesting characters like Leonardo da Vinci, who acts as an ally that helps us develop old weapon mechanics created by Alta\u00efr, which are very useful, once you manage to get the scrolls you can fire bullets and poison darts from longer distances, that way you avoid face to face combat. Among many other characters we meet Rodrigo Borgia (one of many famous popes), Caterina Sforza, Lorenzo de' Medici, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and many, many others, all this makes the game a great title with a vast historical background.\nTo sum up, this game is a must for any AC fan or in this case for anyone who thought that the original AC was boring and dull, with its open ending you definitely should go for AC2 and enjoy the new abilities and skills you develop and of course the many secrets in it, you won't be disappointed, this game adds new stuff and improves the mechanics clumsiness of its predecessor.", "hours": 103.9, "username": "PandaFraHelvete", "products": 312, "early_access": false}

The controls will be taught to you in the early stages of the game very clearly, unlike some other games in the franchise which teach some things but expect you to know others already. This is also a great entry to the story of the series if you don't feel like playing through the first one. (this game is far superior to the original in pretty much every way.)\nI've owned this game for some years now and it was basically one of those games that were part of my backlog of games, most of which will never get played despite my intention to play them all. I'm sooo glad that I decided to play this game over some others in that backlog of mine. The game still is visually pleasing, not yet too 'retro' feeling (This review written in 2015). I was still in awe of many of the visuals. More importantly though, this game has great gameplay, a great story, great characters, great acting and animation. This is the real deal, a gamer's game. Stuffed so full of content, I didn't even do all the extra missions (not even close) and I spent 30 hours in this game enjoying every second. I really can't recommend the game enough. It starts slow and you might be bored for the first bit but trust me when I say that it gets GOOD and fairly quickly. I am now starting to play the next game in the series, Brotherhood, which picks up right where this left off in a very epic way. Make sure you sit at the start screen in these games for a minute or two before pressing start/enter to watch the opening cinematic.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 314, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-02-12", "text": "This second entry in the series is much, much better than the first, but still ultimately mediocre. This will not be spoiler free, as the plots in these games are not worth anything so there is no value lost in spoiling them.\nThis time, there are no frustrating, repetitive repeating missions, or bland cityspaces. No awful dialogue and no terrible sound quality.\nYou will find here that, unlike the first, this game could be described as functional and playable for upwards of 10 minutes.\nAssassin's Creed II is, unlike it's predecessor, a working game. I will argue, however, that this alone does not make it a game worth playing.\nYou will find an admittedly more compelling and engaging story here. We are told the story of Ezio, a young Italian noble enjoying his youth amidst family rivalries and conspiracy in Florence. Ezio's voice acting is leagues above Altair's awful, monotone American accent. You may notice Ubisoft's laziness in making Desmond's and Ezio's facial models exactly the same.\nAnyway, Ezio's family is betrayed by someone thought a friend and his father and brothers are executed.\nOne of the stronger moments in the series in Ezio discovering his father's assassin robes, the track 'Earth' playing in the background, meant to evoke a feeling of discovery in the player and prompt you to appreciate Ezio's transformation.\nThe soundtrack, composed by Jesper Kyd(who is excellent) is likely the strongest point of the game. The atmospheric tracks like 'Home in Florence', the story and character-development tracks like 'Ezio's Family' and 'Earth', and the chase tracks like 'Venice Rooftops' are all fantastic.\nIt is music one can love consistently and appreciate for how it establishes and reinforces the setting of the world. One can quickly come to appreciate the detail and beauty of the game's depictions of Florence and Venice supported by the fantastic music.\nThe story is centered around a convoluted web of conspiracy motivated by revenge and a desire to discover the truth. The larger sin of this game's story, one that many AC games are guilty of, is putting the player in situations where they could solve the central conflict of the plot nearly instantly.\nMore than once, Ezio is tasked with eavesdropping upon the game's villains gathered in a particular location or walking around the streets, completely vulnerable. They do not possess advantages or knowledge that would stay Ezio's blade, it is just some notion of absurd tension-building that seems to have prompted the inclusion of these scenes.\nThe supporting cast is mostly ridiculous. The Ezio saga seems to have this weird habit of insisting that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s, mercenaries, and thieves are all delightful people misrepresented by those in power. I would guess that it is a way of emphasizing that Assassins believe in humanity/are optimistic about human nature while the Templars are not.\nBoth groups, however, see objective truth/reality, religion, and ideology as illusions and lies, so neither group is inspirational or compelling in any way, no matter what any fanboy wants to claim.\nOne can summarize the conflict as 'secular humanists who believe in humanity and thus advocate freedom' versus 'secular humanists who don't believe in humanity and thus advocate order'. It seems the more interesting discussion and debate happened off screen and our position on the matter has already been decided for us.\nAnyways, the 'supporting cast' are all \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s, thieves, and mercenaries. One tells us that prostitution really represents love and that she is doing God's work in running the brothel. Close of the end of the story, all of them jump out of the metaphorical bush and yell 'we were all secretly assassins guiding you the whole time, Ezio!' It's pretty poor writing. They then defeat the primary antagonist of the entire game and let him get away for no reason.\nThe story, split into 14(really 12) sequences, skips years arbitrarily. My favorite moment is at the end of sequence 10, the game decides that the protagonist, with every reason in the world to pursue his enemies, sits on his\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665for TEN YEARS in Venice, starting sequence 11 by lamenting that he'd been sitting on his\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665like a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing idiot for 10 years. Really odd stuff with the timeline like this really makes you wonder about Ezio's character and motivation.\nAt the end of the game, you travel to Rome to assassinate the Pope -- the same character who could have died numerous times before by Ezio's hand. After stabbing him through the throat, his papal staff apparently allows him to..not die from that? Christ these games have terrible writing.\nEzio wielding the 'Apple of Eden' and Rodrigo Borgia(Alexander VI) his papal staff, they duke it out, Rodrigo paralyzes Ezio momentarily, and takes the apple. Ezio now completely vulnerable, Rodrigo logically decides to not kill him and just hurt him a little bit because that always works out really great for the main antagonist in any movie, book, or game. Seriously this\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665is terrible.\nAfter that, Ezio chases him down to the vault and challenges the 60-something year old to a fistfight, Rodrigo posessing a massive upper hand in possessing both artifacts, it naturally makes sense for him to give up every advantage and enter a fist-fight with someone superior in terms of muscle strength and fitness -- potentially losing all progress towards the goal he has been working towards for around 25 years or more.\nAfter defeating Rodrigo, Ezio, being emotionally mature and intelligent and developed, decides not to kill the antagonist responsible for all the death and misery that allowed for the plot in the first place. Ezio was totally willing to murder hundreds of guards who who more or less innocent and just doing their jobs, but when it comes to the person most at fault -- no, not having any of that. I'm going to let you live in an overly-dramatic, angsty move that illustrates just how stupid my character is.\nSo yes, this game's plot and characters are atrocious -- but that's the case in nearly every game in this series, so this game is not any worse.\nThis game is worth playing for the atmosphere and high amount of content. You can enjoy the various side missions like the assassination contracts, underground tombs, and collectibles, free from the pretentious characters and stupid story, but with all the atmosphere of the music and character of the city.\nUltimately, as I said, the game is still mediocre when compared to games that are truly great, but the amount of content, soundtrack, and atmosphere make the game worth playing -- there is something to enjoy here, unlike the first.", "hours": 26.8, "user_id": "76561198015641338", "username": "JUB JUB", "products": 215, "early_access": false}

In the process of course he uncovers his true identity, and advances the story and plot that was introduced in the first game.  The story that revolves around the animus is also here, however its emphasis is greatly dimished from the first game.\nThe elements that made the first game so fun are still here: Open world parkour, vast cities to explore, fun combat, mini games such as time trials and beat up events, overlook climbing, etc.  However adding to the mix are several new weapon types including a pistol, a customizable \"home base\" mini-city to generate wealth and keep your \"stuff\", upgradeable armor, paintings to collect and display, and the introduction of currency \"florins\" which you can loot from dead bodies or find in chests that are scattered about.  In short there is a LOT more to do than before, resulting in a more immersive experience.\nThe character animations and sound design are both excellent.  Cut scenes are rendered in real time as before and character emotes and voice acting are superb.  I use the XBOX 360 controller since clearly the controls were designed with the console in mind.\nGraphically the game is an improvement over the original although at times the textures show their age during cutscenes.  A remastered version of this game would be fantastic.\nThe level of historical content is huge, with additional info available from the abundance of database entries accessible at any time.  I actually learned a lot of things I did not know.\n3D Vision support is superb with the HelixMod update.\nHere are a few things I found a bit frustrating:\n1) Flaky controls at times, particularly during the \"lara croft\" style tomb raids.  Advanced parkour moves are typically not necessary for the rest of the game, so learning them during the tomb raids can be frustrating and require a great deal of precision.\n2) Checkpoint saves suck in general, and here there are moments where the checkpoints are too far apart, requiring you to replay quite a bit.\n3) The frame-rate will frequently drop, especially in cities.  I have a nice mid-range system (780gtx/i5-4850) so I should not be seeing drops in the frame rate, which strikes me as just poor PC optimization.\nStill despite some annoyances this game kept my attention through many, many hours.

If you are new to the series, I suggest to play with Assassin's Creed\u2122: Director's Cut Edition first because of the story.\nWhere to begin... History is playground.\nThis game is one of the most enjoyable game I've ever played. The music is a masterpiece, I will buy the OST on Google Play. The cities are full of life, the environment and graphics feels real. It is now impossible for me to go outside without mentally assessing climbing routes and synchronization points over all the buildings in the historical downtown of my city.\nThe second game and sequels are better than the original, with easier controls, better gameplay, and more fluid combat. Only the respawn system is a step back compared to the original Assassin's Creed, it doesn't make any sense in this game.\nAlthough Ezio is probably one of the best and well-written characters in gaming history, I'm a little disappointed in the last mission. After perfectly built large cities Ubisoft made a mistake to let Ezio go to \"Rome\", which was only a limited wall, a tiny part of the Vatican.\nLuckily the end of the game isn't screw up, I can't wait to continue the story.\nThis is not just a game. The cities has historical buildings, events, and people. In the game you can access information about the characters' life, the story of the place you are. You can find hidden signs to explore \"the truth\". You can access side missions, and you can collect and purchase items.\nAll things considered this game is probably one of the best of the Assassin's Creed games, I highly recommend to buy it.

Even if the graphics are a bit dated, they only show major wear with character models in cutscenes, and the huge cities are still breathtaking. The setting was the first thing to hook me.\nThe game has a lot more going for it than just setting though. Compelling characters drive the narrative- Ezio is extremely likable, and even if Da Vinci's inclusion feels a bit shoehorned, it still makes fetch-quests way cooler when you're grabbing stuff for a Renaissance genius. The story itself, while not mindblowing, is not bad at all, and even with the elements of the absurd the attention to historical detail is way higher than one would expect from a company like Ubisoft.\nAnd, of course, the gameplay. Fighting is good, and can actually be challenging depending on what armor and weapons you use. The parkour, although not as good as Mirror's Edge or anything, is quite cool, and I found that I spent much more time running above the cities than through them. Assassinations and missions can be quite free form, and sometimes the most fun part is creating goals or challenges for yourself with them- attempting to remain undetected by any guards, using hidden blades when a pistol can be convenient, or perhaps just charging in and swinging your sword left and right to take out your opponent in a blaze of glory. The game also throws a number of side-excursions outside of sidequests your way by providing collectibles and a villa to renovate and improve, which if handled correctly will result in absurd amounts of cash and a sense of satisfaction with all you've accomplished. I ended the game with just about everything under my belt except for most of the feathers laying around the heights, and I enjoyed every minute of it.\nAny major problems? Don't go into this expecting an amazing STEALTH game. It's not Dishonored. Nor are the parkour the fighting the absolute best in their catagories. But it's the combination of all these elements blended together in a fascinating setting that sets this game apart.

Assassins Creed 2 is an amazing game and was released on the 4th of March 2010 and for how long ago that may seem, it is still a highly enjoyable and diverse game.\nI really liked the graphics of the game as they are very detailed and true to life, the lighting and shadows are very exact and they work to perfect detail on everything everywhere in the game. The Story is very detailed and, to an extent, historically accurate. The game idea is unique and the development of games takes about an average 9 months per game so far. The weapons and the map is not too difficult to overcome but does have some challenging parts in certain parts which I think is good as it adds to the reality of Venezia(Venice).\nThe Bad points about the games are the slight glitches in it such as it being difficult for a guy with a huge axe to kill an unarmed noble man, even when he is the mission target. Also, the awkward placing of places over the other side of an entire city is ridiculous and unnecessary. All it does is take up a lot of your time and moist people don\u2019t have the time to waste on trivial matters such as that. They could have just implemented fast travels to the viewpoints like that had in all the games prior to that and released it in a update.\nThe Graphics as I said was really impressive and true to life. This really immersive you in the game and makes it easier to play and understand than other, not as quality games like; TF classic and Half-life 1. The music matches the setting and what is happening around you and it really makes you feel and empathetic link with Ezio as if you were actually there. The Cinematic are impressively done but personally I dislike the cut scenes where you can still move around and interact as I feel that it limits what happens in the cut scene as you are also in the game world. Overall though, they are really good. The Controls were easy to manage and made sense when you actually got into the game. So I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t continue them past Assassins Creed Revelations but hey, they are still easy to use. The Gameplay is smooth and precise. The characters don\u2019t just instantly stop when the stop running they slow down and the animation for that is true to life. It is things like that that really just do it for me.

ME takes everything that sucks about AC series and fixes it basically. AC2 is just much of the same of AC1 and retains all the issues that game has while throwing in more stuff some of it adds to the game while most of it is just tacked on and dousn't really add a whole lot to the gameplay. Along with a story thats loosey goosey stupid crap, if I wanted a crap story I would watch a Stallone movie (outside of First Blood Part 1) or Govenator Von Gun Grabber movie. This story is idiot tier presentation to the point that sneaking up to listen on a conversation amounts to standing a couple yards away from these guys in ruins feild and then Etzio is shocked that they realized he was there. Its like Jesus, porn comes with better stories than this.\nI havn't beaten the game yet but thus far I have encountered a number of issues and it seems to be a not very good game as its to similiar to the first in its repatitiveness and screwing around.\nSome problems are\n-No Challenge, its stupidly easy. A small child could beat this game and isn't definitively better than 1 or really that diffrent aside from a few small additions.\n-Extremely stupid AI that can barely play the game\nThe AI dousn't really offer any real challenge unless you get ganged up on, even then just way till they attack one by one then counter them which instakills them most the time. And if not just Jam the attack button until you win. Im still relatively early so I expect more enemy types later on. The AI is so stupid though they will jump off a building and die. I seen it happen, or they just stand there going through a few lines over and over basically amounting to them saying (hey, whose that guy there) until there bar fills and they realize your the guy they are supposed to kill. AI also patrol inside buildings and not much else, its so terribly bland for such a big name game and literally breaks the entire plot when immersion is lost due to just stupid AI quirks.\n-Sounds missing, which makes for some awkward moments when cinematics have no sounds regarding something supposed to be dramatic.\n-Free Running on buildings and up walls has a tendency to grapple onto something you don't want or send you jumping off a building you hadn't wanted to jump off of\nI have seen people claim they never in the time they played the game had their character jump anywhere but where they intended and that if this happens to you its because your bad.  These people are outright lying. Struggling with the camera and free running design is especially a problem in 2 partially thanks to more geometry for the character to jump onto or you will just randomly jump off a building and not lock onto anything even though you should have. Its random at times.\nAlso another issue is the design of buildings and geometry itself, so many areas have spots where you feel you should be able to climb up but the next ledge is just slightly out of your reach so you just stop and have to go around. Its terrible, slow, and clunky, and I feel like Im just wasting time trying to figure out how to climb up a stupid building instead of just going around it at times.\n-Pop in and poor draw distances\nPeople just appear from nowhere in front of you, or they are just a few yards away and have polygon heads that look like some PS1 or early PS2 crap.\n-Not well optimized for PC release\nI cant get above 60fps and VSync is off, the FPS does drop in some areas aswell and the graphics look like a console game, which isn't okay for a PC game that can look far better especially when pop in is noticable. Though the game does look good/satisfactory\n-Controls required downloading custom preset/mod to get them to be usable and not \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nUnfortunately they are still flawed, a combined fast walk/pickpocket button means you do both at the same time, which is terrible because you do both at the same time.\n-Fluffy, lots of time wasting to make the game last longer and missions that just have no real point but to make the game longer. This BS is what makes AS series so crap thus far. I would rather have a 5 to 10 hour game where I really enjoy it instead of 18 hours full of time wasting.\n-Plot is hard to follow if there even is one. And its constantly getting in the way of gameplay. Etzio and Desmon are barely even characters. They are uninteresting and empty.\nThis is the product of a bad port job, either setup the controls yourself or be lazy like me and find someone elses configuration work.\n+Its like the 1st game\nThe first game was good, and a solid third person action game though extremely repatitive. This is still continues with this game, unfortunately not always for the best.\n+Graphics can look pretty good, till you notice something bad that throws the table.\n+Era is nice to see \"alive\". If you consider alive mostly static, unfaithfull to history, with artistic liberties and game design requirements in place, still its nice to atleast imagine how the world was so so long ago.\n-Setting is just a reskin of the AC1. To the point that its just a bunch of reworked textures with much geometry.\n-Extremely padded, the game actually makes you go out and find all the codex pages to continue.

As a fan of stealth games and someone who is behind on early games from the xbox 360 era, I was prettty enthusiastic to get it on steam for just 5 bucks. But upon playing it, oh god. Its...Its awful. From the atrocious and button mashy combat to the over simplified stealth/parkour system, Assassin's Creed 2 plays like a complete mess. Despite all the critical acclaim and refferals from reddit that all boast how \"this is one of the good ones\" and \"its the best in the series\", I am simply yet to be impressed. The visuals are nice, the crowd blending mechanics are interesting and there is an excellent sense of freedom and discovery whilst exploring the cities, scaling up historical buildings and leaping from rooftops are probably some of my favorite moments from this game. The downside is, I spent most of my time getting frustrating how mundane everything else is. The stealth system, which should be the focus, or at least have clear emphasis in a stealth/action game. Why is it so basic? Its the same, generic yellow \"alert\" meters with guards that stand still or patrol in a small circle. These systems are fine and perfectly acceptable ways of encouraging stealth but there is one fatal flaw with this incorporation of this \"alert\" mechanic...Where's the punishment? With enemy AI being completely incompetent during combat and a watered down \"press x till the die and block some times\" combat system, there is absolutely no penalty to being alerted as it is easier and faster to murder every guard you encounter. I could go on and on about how each mission feels like a linear tutorial for mechanics that never seem to get developed, the lack of interesting side quests in the large cities and that whole desmond thing but I feel like a 5 page essay on why Assassin's Creed 2 wasn't fun for ME is ridiculous and a waste of everyone's time. I didn't like this game and probably won't buy another game of this series unless I see some major improvements to the core system's this game is founded on. There is alot of potential, but the game never pulls of stealth or combat correctly, leaving a game where you run and jump off stuff and some french people as the side dishes to a mediocre title.", "hours": 25.8, "user_id": "76561198012507659", "username": "Nowahh", "products": 194, "early_access": false}

Assassin's Creed II fulfills this better than any game in the series at the time of writing this in early 2015. The gameplay is smooth, but the combat system has suffered with age, and feels stale despite its originality at release. This is not to say it is a bad system. Combat, as well as the movement mechanics both still feel responsive and precise enough to allow for the game to be playable with little frustration. Graphically, the game was very solid for its time, and while technically it has visibly aged, it still is good enough to convey the games solid aesthetic details that help to build a believable version of the atmosphere of renaissance Italy.\nThat atmosphere gets put to work in the games three major cities, as well as several minor towns and castles, and does a fair job of bringing them all to life. While many areas of all the cities could be interchangeable, they also feature excellent representations of the cities historical landmarks and unique features that will dominate the majority of your exploration that the interchangeability is very rarely an issue.\nThe writing, like much else in the game, is serviceable, and builds a large roster of reasonably written and interesting characters, and while there are a few misses, there are an equally many solid hits. Characters like Leonardo Da Vinci and Machiavelli are solidly writen, performed, and acted. Lesser characters that make up the majority of your assassination targets are interesting but also forgettable, but serve their purpose as receptacles for your assortment of pointy bits of metal very well. The plot is rather goofy on a large scale, but on a smaller scale, the plot surrounding each major target is reasonably well written.\nThis isn\u2019t a masterpiece in any way. Its not a great action game, its not a great stealth game, it lacks a stand out narrative.

I can't stop myself to measure it to the first game. But generally I liked it.\nFirst of all, the first class work what the team of the Ubisoft done with places, clothes and conversations is magnificent. It really makes you feel, that you are in the renessaince. The good old fighting system don't make any dissapointment and the guards' AI has got better, there are fast ones who can outrun you and there is inteligent ones, who can find you, and there are more fighting style of them too. And what was a great relief for me, our main character finally can swim. Yeah! It was really annoying that the almost super human assassin drowned in the every little water.\nThe beginning of the story is quite good, it just continues where the first left off. But Ezio won't be my favorite: a spoiled kid at the first and that won't really change untill the last chapters. Altair was a complex character with serious character development. Many times in the conversations, when Ezio tries to think, I just thought 'Oh, man'.\nBut stories' rhythm is quite curious I felt aprox. three-four time a peak, where I got the feeling that the game will end now and... It did not end, it was ok once or twice, but after that it was too much for me.\nThe side quests were interesting and the restauration of Montereggioni Villa was quite a good idea. I really liked and waited when can I pay the last of my money on her.\nThe assassins tombs were a good basic idea to take some dexterity game in the thing, it made the game more diverse. Searching for codex pages and the truth was exciting too, but the glyph puzzles were not balanced, some of it is too easy and some is really hard, and it do not really have a order, that it goes from the easy to the hard.\nAn another thing deserve a word. I think Leonardo is the best sidekick ever. I like his style and he was useful, but did not pamper Ezio.\nThe thing, that we can choose weapons, outfits and even the color of our clothes are convinient, while it let us choose our  fighting style, wether we like heavy or light and fast weapons, it is up to us. And the developing of the handblade season it too.\nSo in summary I liked this game. There were really good ideas, which made interesting side lines for the player. We could explore a little beside the main quest line. But Altair's character is more complex and more interesting than Ezio's.

The story is good, even if I think the animus feels tacked on.(Not as bad as the sequels)\nNow the negitives I found with the PC version is a short list. The 360 controller isn't great here, and the other one is that its optimization. It staggers and drop frame rate from time to time. For the most part I get 60 fps maxed out, but for no reason it will drop to 45/50/48/60----/45.

The gameplay is quite fun for the most part; good action sequences and fun assassination moves.  The map is very much to be lauded - a great deal of effort went into the design and it really shows.  Excellent to be able to climb some of those buildings and (implausible as the physics may seem) to leap from a great height into hay or water.  The story was relatively engaging and there was enough puzzle to be interesting w/o being Tombraider Tedious.  Some of the gameplay became rather repetitive, doing the same thing again and again.  And though the weapons are relatively cool, you don't really need most of them.  Throwing knives and pistol are worthless.  Swords were good, knife was better.  But most of the game could have been achieved with nothing more than fists and hidden blades.  The fighting contribution of the hidden blades alone was excellent.  The buying and collecting of items was pretty cool, though it was very easy to get healed as there were as many doctors as courtesans in the streets and healing potions aplenty.  Dying clothes was a bit, um, gay but there were some advantages to being able to collect artworks.  Collecting feathers was for the birds and I eventually just gave up on it.  Most of the puzzles were fun, both in the Renaissance portion and in the sci-fi portion (though the latter got pretty frustrating after awhile.  I would have added a stealth, or sneak, mode - use of shadows maybe like in thief.\nThen the bad.  First, the sk*nk factor of Ezio was extremely boring.  He's a total mansl*t; both in his ubiquitous and quite unnecessary womanizing, his bling, his waxed chest and sculpted beardish.  Even the hoodie and the dangly bits on his jacket were just... boring.  But that's rather trivial.  More negative was the twisting of history - interesting enough to see the sights recreated in meticulous detail and certainly the historical characters were fun to interact with (both Leonardo DaVinci and Nicolo Machiavelli, though more of the latter was needed.  The Borgias show up and are fairly vile) but the bending of history or the negative and anti-religious spin put on things was again, obnoxious.  The game proves a bit buggey in places and some glitches that could have been fixed.  Still, that's not the main.  The main disagreement is with the denouement at the end.  \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665gery, twisting of history and some bad gameplay can all be overlooked.  (Ha - Steam won't let me write \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665gery!) But the story seems to end in one great hunt of evil henchmen... then it keeps going... then you go to Rome, but only part of Rome... then you have to kill the Borgia pope (which, again, I had no problem doing)... then you can't kill him so it drags out into a smack down... but then he doesn't offer a challenge... and then you meet the aliens (sorry, spoiler, but who cares?)... and then you have to get out of the animus machine... and then you fight the templars while the credits roll... and then... and then... it just drags on and on.  The game gets to a point where you WANT it to end - and, for those who can't tell, that's a bad thing.  Something of a let down, but I guess given the umpteen sequels it was just a mizzen game anyway.\nOverall, worth playing, just some things that could have been better.", "hours": 70.6, "username": "ARex", "products": 153, "early_access": false}

It introduced Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the by far most likeable protagonist (perhaps because he has a personality!) This was also the FIRST game with Ezio so he wasn't old hat yet.\nThe new setting of renaissance Italy is great. The cities, like in the first game feel different (Florence is huge with large cathedrals and town squares and Venice is more cramped with canals), but unlike the first game the cities seem varied. One block in Florence looks different from another block in Florence.\nOne of the bigger additions to the game was money (a staple in the series now.) Money is f*cking useless! I breezed through the whole game and bought nothing. Literally NOTHING. You can also use money to renovate your villa to gain more money, but this is boring as f*ck!\nEven though that sh*t's dumb, most of the new features are interesting. There are loads of new murdering gadgets and more missions than before.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 357, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-11-28", "text": "I enjoyed this game immensely.  I played through the first title last year, and I enjoyed that one quite a lot as well, but every time I mentioned how much I enjoyed the first one, inevitably someone would retort, \"Yes, but have you played the second one?\"  To be honest, I really didn't see where the second title in the series could be\nmuch better than the first.  I had seen gameplay videos and everything seemed fairly same-y.\nI still stand by the first game as being an enjoyable experience, but ACII winds up being an\nexperience.\nFirst and foremost the story in this game plays out on an\nscale.  The first game was great in that it introduced the concepts integral to the series, but this game meticulously crafts those set pieces into an epic tale of revenge, redemption and growth.  While Altair seemed a bit like a faceless soldier of the Assassin's Order, Ezio is a well rounded character with human strengths and flaws.  Over the course of 10 years Ezio experiences ultimate loss, and absolution through the Order and through his own personal quest.\nOne of the things that's an amazing strength of this series is how it takes real historical people and places, and then interweaves them seamlessly into the mythology of the series.  ACII is astounding in this regard.  There is so much attention to detail that the entire game seems plausible, and further that you are witnessing a living breathing rendition of renaissance Italy and its colorful inhabitants.\nAnother aspect where the game shines is in it's attention to detail in terms of intricate conspiracies, playing out over the course of centuries.  If you're a conspiracy buff, or a fan of works like The Da Vinci Code and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, you will likely find plenty to enjoy here.  There's just so much content to absorb regarding various political intrigues, and shady nefarious \"illuminati type\" groups manipulating world events behind the scenes.  It's a game that rewards you for digging deeply into its sizable database of people, locations, documents, decodable glyphs and various other errata.\nNaturally the the free running game play mechanics for which the series is famous for really shine here.  The other core element of the gameplay is of course assassination, and it feels and plays here better than ever.  For this outing Ezio sports\narm blades meaning that you can assassinate two targets simultaneously.  Add to that the various new and assorted deadly gizmos at his disposal (provided to Ezio vis a vis a\nfamous Italian renaissance painter and inventor), and he's an\nformidable opponent.  In fact the game makes you feel like an absolute\n, regardless of whether you choose to take a stealth approach for minimum body count, or if you'd prefer hack and slash your way through the legions that oppose you (shock and awe!).  You are a walking razor blade, and\nwill stand in your way between you and your target.  In regards to this latter point I should point out that the combat in this game has been improved significantly from that seen in the first game.  Ultimately the gameplay in ACII feels natural, smooth and exhilerating.\nOne element Ubisoft added to this game which really shines, is that you're tasked with raiding the tombs of various famous assassins.  These areas wear the Tomb Raider influence on their sleeves, but when you combine that with excellent freerunning mechanics, they are an absolute joy to play.  They're basically like a puzzle based free running mini game.  Awesome!\nOne misstep present in the first game, that also rears its head here, is that the analog controls can be\ntouchy at times during freerunning and climbing segments.  I know I've raved about how good those sections are (and they really are), but sometimes Ezio will be in the middle of an epic freerunning line or several stories above the streets of Venice, when all of a sudden he'll freak out like an epileptic monkey on crack, and jump in a completely unexpected direction.  This will often spell disaster if you're high up off the ground or chasing after a fleeing target, and it can definitely lead to some rage inducing WTF moments.  All told though those moments are fleeting, and certainly didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game.\nI almost forgot to mention it, but the Super Mario Bros. reference at one point was pretty much one of the highlights of the game for me.  I won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it.  There's also a random pedestrian comment you hear occasionally regarding, \"a capering crusader\".  Ha!  Classic!\nAll told I had a really good time with this one, and I can't wait to see where Ezio's adventures take him next in AC: Brotherhood (after a suitable cool down period of course.  Too much of a good thing is still\nmuch).  My personal GOTY?  Maybe!", "hours": 64.8, "username": "nullPointer", "products": 573, "early_access": false}

This game is a real upgrade from the first AC. The developers at Ubisoft listened to what people had to say about their first game in this franchise and created this unique and spectacular game! Basically all areas have been improved. AC2 take you for a ride with the really good (and rather long) storyline where Ezio evolves from a boy to a man ... and in the end to an ultimate assassin. The game is fun, it has lots of side missions and collectibles as well. Never have I found a dull moment in this game. The combat is smooth and apart from the generic guard fighting it is not at all repetitive. Main assassinations are great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. Again I also applaud the Desmond timeline although so many people do not like it I think it fits perfectly into the game. Of course there are drawbacks to this game. One being a sometimes funky AI for both allies and enemies. But the main flaw is in this case uPlay. This was the first game to implement it and back then it was a disaster. Today it is better but still far from good because starting the game on Steam just launches uPlay and THEN you can start your game. So you need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is fantastic and takes you on a journey through renaissance Italy where you will adore both the story and the visuals. I know I did.

Assassin\u2019s Creed II is a living testimony against these wise words. It is the much-improved sequel to its 2007 predecessor published by Ubisoft, and the first of a new trilogy of games (II, Brotherhood, and Revelations). While the first game in the franchise had a huge amount of potential, it fell a little bit short in the eyes of many. However, Assassin\u2019s Creed II earned an almost unanimous critical acclaim - and with a good reason. Like the original installment, ACII remains an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. Setting it apart, however, is its new approach to less repetitive gameplay combined with solid story development\u2026 And yes, it does take the time to fill the majority of the plot holes left open from its forerunner.\nThis game picks up precisely where the first left off. Abstergo. Desmond remains a prisoner of the modern-day Templars, as he begins to comprehend the significance of his genetic memories - and the danger of the Apple of Eden falling into the wrong hands. Before he has too much time to brood, the game kicks off with a fast pace, springing Desmond from Abstergo, and introducing him to the modern-day Assassins. With their help, and their version of the Animus, Desmond submits himself to relive the experiences of another ancestor in hopes of becoming an assassin for their own cause.\nThis time he finds himself in 15th-century Italy, at the height of the Renaissance, following the life of another ancestor called Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezio is a noble who finds himself betrayed by the cities rulers, and sets out on a quest for vengeance.\nThere is a lot to be said about the mechanics and gameplay elements that Assassin\u2019s Creed II introduced. Too often, a sequel is just a repeat of the first game, with a different storyline. This is not the case here. Ubisoft did an excellent job immersing the player in what is now a believable world, retaining some of its original mechanics. The beautifully designed free-running system from it\u2019s forerunner has returned, only this time it permits the player to move faster: Thus, cover more ground in less time, and make exploration much more satisfying. As additional encouragement to explore the region, they have hidden treasure chests in every location - Low on coin? No problem! Either go find these hidden goodies, or just kill a guard and pick his pockets.\nI\u2019d also like to take a moment to pay homage to the improved battle system. The combat aesthetics are absolutely stunning, making almost any fight appear brutal and bloody. Furthermore, you now have numerous weapons to pick from at the blacksmith shops, each offering its own selection of kill animations.\nThe quests also have a more modernized efficiency to them, and appear on the map as exclamation marks to guide the player to the next objective. As I have previously stated, they are also a lot less repetitive. You no longer follow the same formula in each quest, which is hugely refreshing. Should Ezio run into trouble during any of these missions, he can opt to blend in just about any crowd of people, or purchase assistance from his allied factions: thieves, courtesans, and mercenaries. Just be careful not to draw too much unwanted attention, or you\u2019ll have to go tear down wanted posters to reduce your notoriety.\nThe purchasing system is really enjoyable. You can change the color of your robes, buy upgrades, weapons, armor, health potions, and even artwork. Once you reach the village of Monteriggioni, you can begin the process of renovating the city to generate your own income through your investments.\nFinally, keep an eye open for glyphs by using eagle vision. You won\u2019t want to miss out on the story that their puzzles will reveal.\nThe controls are relatively friendly, but no longer offer support with re-arranging your buttons. A controller is still the best way to get around, in my opinion, although you cannot re-assign your button placement at will this time. I still do not recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse, but if that suits you, by all means do so.\nTargeting remains a bit tricky, and you can\u2019t always be sure that you will hit what you\u2019re aiming for, but it is something you can work around. From time to time, you might find yourself changing your viewpoint and inadvertently targeting something else, oops!\nAssassin\u2019s Creed has been known to focus a lot of attention on their atmosphere, so it is only fitting that the graphics are as polished as they are. This game offers beautiful and breathtaking sights, and paints them in a realistic light. It is really hard to criticize this aspect of the game, because they did such an amazing job with fine-tuning the scenery to fit their setting. I absolutely love how the game looks and feels, and I\u2019m pretty sure you will too.\nThe music is beautiful, and the voice tracks are considerably less annoying than its predecessor. The combination of assassinating a target to the score of dramatic music can only be described as a rewarding experience. Though it should be noted that the entirely optional use of subtitles will help with translating the incorporated use of the Italian language. Overall the sounds contribute immensely to the games atmosphere, which is something that I will likely continuously praise in this particular franchise.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed II is among my favourites in the series, thus far, and I would definitely recommend a replay at some point. Then again, replay value is entirely dependent on the person playing the game.", "hours": 49.1, "username": "Foreverlore", "products": 148, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

There are new mechanics such as picking things up, mission logs/sequencing, and looting, which are glitchy - there is certainly a delayed action feel in general to movement. There seems to be issues with the dubbing as well being massively out of time with the actions of characters, which can lead to amusing/tedious mime shows during set pieces. I suspect as a result of all the new added features the interface between map and other tools is a little unwieldly. But whilst some of these can be frustrating, there arn't enough to seriously dampen an interesting and enjoyable game.\nUPDATE\nHaving now completed the game, I would say the lack of a difficulty curve is balanced by the at times flailing control system. There were several points which felt like a natural end point, but which were then padded out to add a bit of time. Overall, I still have a positive opinion, and I like a lot of the new additions a lot (thanks gods for the fast travel system) - but I think I had more fun with the first game in the series.", "hours": 52.1, "user_id": "76561198024525677", "username": "SK42", "products": 143, "early_access": false}

You have to jump through all these Ubisoft Uplay hoops after you buy it.  (You will have to go to Uplay and download the Uplay installer, etc.)  And after that, if you are playing with an Xbox 360 controller (like I am) good luck with that!  Another pain in the @$$.  The icons for the controller in-game don't make any sense.  Instead of A,B,X,Y like they are on the controller, the icons are pictures of an ARM, LEG, HEAD, and something else.  And you can't change them.  Sounds like no big deal, but trust me, it's very frustrating.  Makes the game almost unplayable.  For instance, I'm trying to loot a body after killing the guy, but instead of LOOTING his body, Ezio will throw a punch.  Or if you are in a fight and you wanna punch someone, you might end up taunting them or grabbing them.  And the camera angle is terrible.  Half the time you can't even re-position the camera, so you are being attacked off-screen by someone you can't even see.  The controls are #@&ing BS!!!  Ubisoft developers ruined this game.

It was during these modern day sequences that we were introduced to Dr. Warren Vidic, who heads up the program where the memories of ones ancestors are accessed through a device known as the Animus. It is here that Desmond Miles was forced to experience his ancestors memories from the time of the Third Crusade - An assassin known as Altair who would break the three tenants of his Assassin's code of conduct in pursuit of the Templar, Robert de Sable, who was said to be after a powerful artifact known as the Piece of Eden. Killing de Sable would reveal that the very man at the head of the Assassin's Brotherhood was a Templar himself and one who was already in possession of this powerful artifact. Confronting and finally killing his leader, the artifact would later reveal a holographic map showing Altair/Desmond where the other artifacts were hidden throughout the world, artifacts so powerful they could change the very destiny of man. Artifacts that Abstergo would kill to get their hands on. It would also be revealed that a former test subject had been leaving cryptic messages only Desmond could decode that would foretell the end of the world.\nAssassin's Creed II wastes no time in picking up where the first left off. Having discovered that Dr. Vidics assistant Lucy Stillman is a mole, she eventually breaks Desmond out of Abstergo and ferries him off to a safe house where a group of her colleagues have developed an improved Animus. Desmond must once again enter the Animus and access his ancestral memories in the hope that more pieces of the artifact will be revealed before Abstergo can learn of them. This time around we are witness to late fifteenth century Florence as we are introduced to a young nobleman by the name of Ezio Auditore da Firenz who after witnessing the death of his father and brother - brought about by a corrupt official working for the Templar's - is then forced to flee to his Uncles villa with his life and that of his mother and sister hanging in the balance. It is here that Ezio is taught the ways of the Assassin's Creed by his uncle who eventually sets him on a course of revenge that includes killing a number of Templar figureheads all involved in the death of his father and brother with the trail finally leading all the way up to the top of the Vatican itself with Rodrigo Borges - otherwise known as Pope Alexander VI - a powerful man who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the remaining pieces of the artifact. Before doing away with Rodrigo, Ezio is inducted into a secret brotherhood of assassin's having amply proven his worth to the cause.\nHistorically recreating locations such as Venice, Tuscany and Florence the player is introduced to this wonderfully created digital world through main missions and side missions (Rocksteady could take a leaf out of Ubisoft Montreals book on how to create a living and breathing digital world that is a pleasure to explore and not a bore). The world we get to inhabit as our playground is a wonderful recreation of late fifteenth century Italy even going as far as introducing us to a lovable Leonardo Da Vinci who Ezio befriends early in the game and who exists to help decipher the many numerous codex's Ezio comes into contact with. Spanning a period of twenty years the game is a particularly massive one and to be honest this sometimes acts to the detriment of the actual game itself. Assassin's Creed II requires a lot of dedication and patience from its players to progress through and to be honest it starts to suffer near the end because of it. Whilst most certainly a massive improvement over the original in terms of scope, design and story telling it does come at a cost where the game gets so wrapped up in its own awesomeness that it starts to make itself rather redundant, sluggish and dare I say - boring - towards the end with missions that simply exist to pad out an already lengthy game. Just as you think the story is starting to wind down to its conclusion the game will throw another mammoth task your way that will lead into another mammoth task and this may try a very few many gamers patience and tolerance levels as it did mine. Having to find out that I needed to kill nine Lieutenants of the Templar Order towards the end of the game made me want to curse to the heavens after already inhabiting this world for a good 60+ hours. For all the frustration the game induces near its end, it's carried forward by a serpentine plot that is less over the top than the original but far more thrilling and engaging. The ending is a little bit of a disappointment when you finally have Rodrigo Borgias in your assassin's sights. After all the build up this encounter is rather dull and lifeless but thankfully is concluded by a spectacular sequence I will not reveal for those that have yet to complete the adventure.\nSpending so much time in the shoes of Ezio what ultimately emerges is a gaming protagonist for the ages. Voiced impeccably by a first rate cast, Ezio is immediately likable and enduring and emerges as a fully rounded and developed character that one becomes incredibly vested in early on in the game. I can see why Ubisoft was a little reluctant to pack him away after the adventure concluded going as far as creating two fully fledged sequels continuing his adventures alone. Where as Altair was a one dimensional figure from the past and not particularly likable it's the exact opposite when it comes to Ezio who can be ruthless and cunning but also generous and incredibly warmhearted. Assassin's Creed II when looked at holistically is an impressive game indeed with the graphics looking quite spectacular for the most part although you can see the games original console limitations with muddy textures abound everywhere. Audio, however, from the clash of swords to the sweeping and epic soundtrack through to the incredible voice cast is all top notch throughout the entire game. Ultimately, Assassin's Creed II emerges as a game I loved for the most part where it not for all its irritating inconsistencies towards the end (those final missions were a test of endurance and patience and frankly I could have done without them as it employs one of my pet hates in gaming where more and more enemies are thrown at the player to try and give the illusion of a suddenly ramped up difficulty). This ended up being a slight killjoy rather than the thrill ride I was expecting for a conclusion.\nBut with that being said I still thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time spent in Ezio's company and I look forward to continuing my adventures with him in the future, just hoping and praying slightly that his remaining two adventures are a much tighter affair than his first one.", "hours": 21.7, "username": "MarkoStame", "products": 124, "early_access": false}

I initially wanted to play through the entire series up that point and I already had purchased the original, II, Brotherhood and Revelations. But after the first one, I felt severely underwhelmed by what I saw.\nIn any case, I decided to revisit the series again, which basically picks up immediately after the last one ends with an escape from Abstergo. The entire framing device really doesn\u2019t serve anything here, just like it did in the first game. So what if Abstergo is run by Templars? I still have nothing telling me that either of these two groups are worth supporting, because in the end, the Assassins make Desmond do the exact same thing the Templars did, which is reliving the memories of an ancestor, which this time turns out to be an Italian.\nNow since I\u2019m half Italian and also able to speak the language, I can tell you that the English voice-acting for this game most certainly wasn\u2019t recorded by Italians who happen to know English, but by Americans who sometimes happen to have an Italian name doing their best impression of what they think Italians might sound like if they\u2019d speak English. Because holy sh\nit does nothing in this game sound good. There are 12 different pronunciations of the name \u201cMedici\u201d in this game and none are correct. I had to cringe every time they chose to record entire lines of dialogue in Italian because it sounded so unbearably fake. Seriously guys, if you want me to take your \u201cThis game was made by a bunch of people from all over the world to prove that we\u2019re not racist, honest\u201d-bullsh\nit seriously, at least hire proper Italians to do the Italian voice-acting.\nThe gameplay is largely unchanged from the original, which means that I won\u2019t be talking at length here. Suffice it to say that the combat is still reliant entirely only the parry mechanic and as such poses absolutely no challenge to the player and gets boring really fu\ncking fast. The parkour is a carbon copy of the original as well, warts and all. It can still be quite annoying to steer Ezio around, because abso-fu\ncking-lutely everything in this world is contextually interactable and the engine exhibits some indecision at times where you end up doing stuff you never intended.\nThe mission design is more interesting than previously, since you\u2019re no longer required to do the same missions over and over again to advance the story. Although you do end up doing similar things in most missions, they\u2019re at least structured more in a way that support the narrative itself. There still are certain repeated missions like beating up unfaithful husbands, running around as a courier or the assassination targets but overall, it\u2019s better streamlined than the original.\nWhat I did like overall were the Assassin tombs, since for the most part they\u2019re platforming challenges and thus make the most out of the Parkour system. It\u2019s a little patronizing with the game showing you what route to take and there also being no possible ways you can deviate from the main path, but at least it was a little break from the monotony that\u2019s the regular climbing and fighting.\nWith this more streamlined approach to missions, it also means that the pacing of the narrative changes. The result unfortunately isn\u2019t all that good. There\u2019s an incredible amount of exposition that gets delivered and even at that, it\u2019s not enough to inform the player about everything in this world, which is why there\u2019s an entire database with background information about these characters. But I could forgive that if the overall pacing of the game were to hold up well. You can already guess that I don\u2019t think it does. At least not over the entire game. I would\u2019ve thought that the way the story is told between Florence, Montereggioni and parts of Tuscany would\u2019ve made for a pretty decent tale that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome. You get to know the main cast of Templars, are given proper reasons to dislike them and you then proceed to hunt them down.\nBut unfortunately, they had to tack on another bit in Venice. And I do mean tack on, because it feels like they ran out of ideas and just made another city where you get to do the same things you did in Florence again, almost verbatim with the same events happening again. There\u2019s another group of Templars up to no good and you have to stop them. Only this time, they\u2019re not characterized all that well and your allies get introduced very clumsily and basically start dealing with you right away for no apparent reason. The laziness is even noticeable in the actual architecture of the city. The most memorable bits are, as always, the fu\ncking towers you have to climb to uncover the map. Only in Venice, they\u2019re all the fu\ncking same tower copypasted onto different parts of the city. The only thing worse is the part that directly follows with the shi\ntty siege bit and then the final stretch back in Florence that really started to test my patience, because it introduced real stealth missions and Assassin\u2019s Creed don\u2019t do no stealth. It almost made me rage quit, because in Rome, I manage to reach the fuc\nking gate that lowers itself before it got to the bottom and as a result I failed the mission. Fu\nck you, Ubisoft. The only bit that I really liked in the late game was actually the ending, since I\u2019m a sucker for recontextualizations of nonsensical conspiracy theories and it did that in an entertaining way, after that shi\ntty final boss fight, though it\u2019s kinda undermined if it\u2019s already preordained that the Assassins win.\nAlso, why the fu\nck would the game have me come to Montereggioni every so often to collect money in order to rebuild this town in order to make even more money? And why is the fast-travel spot outside of the walls and not, say right the fu\nck next to where I need to be (next to the chest, codex pages and Assassin tomb)? It\u2019s just a pointless waste of time, having to come back here every time to pick up money, bring back codex pages or seals.\nFrom a technical side, the game is a mixed bag. Sure, it ran absolutely smoothly at 60fps on my machine, but I\u2019d better hope so for a game that\u2019s been out for 7 years. But there were still some performance problems and I\u2019ve read other PC gamers had the same problems, where the map was really laggy. The performance of the game didn\u2019t actually drop any frames, just the map itself is incredibly sluggish. On the graphical front, it\u2019s clear that Ubisoft really wanted to make this game look good. But they only managed to do that up close. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of pop-in as well as very noticeable level-of-detail adjustments happening only a few feet around Ezio, which is especially noticeable with the shadows turning from jaggedly flickering black splotches to properly rendered shadows. Not to mention that at times the visuals can get really ugly with the color filters.\nAnd while I already mentioned the map, it\u2019s also worth pointing out the ludicrous number of collectibles that are here. Besides the codex pages, glyphs and Assassin seals that are pretty much required to beat the game and get the most out of it, there are also statues you can collect for some money, and you can collect feathers for some unnecessary reward along with tons of loot caches not worth the effort because your villa produces so much money. Is this really the only way we can make these open world games engaging, by littering them with collectibles in the hopes that nobody will notice that your world is utterly generic and not in the least bit memorable?\nAssassin\u2019s Creed II is an improvement over the original, but not by a huge margin and it also doesn\u2019t manage to make the core gameplay more interesting. The story is decidedly \u201cmeh\u201d and really, the only definite thing I can say about this series as far as I\u2019ve played it is that it mystifies me how people can laud games that are this insubstantial.", "hours": 31.2, "username": "Leto Atreides II", "products": 1300, "early_access": false}

Buy AC: Brotherhood which is a better game in gameplay and level design. This I recommend only to those who want to start the Ezio Auditore da Firenze plotline from the beginning. For the subplot(modern day), one propably could go for this or the first. The subplot doesn't advance that much during one game, so it really doesn't matter.\nEzio plot isn't that great in this game, it's a bit illogical revenge story. It's feels occasionally quite forced and all the side quests feel like just \"something extra to do, but not relevant in any way to anything\". I understand the game has a bit long time scale, but it still kind of feels funny that Ezio would be spending his time running races on the rooftops against random people just for few florins. Especially since florins are quite useless after 1/4 of the game.\nLevel desing is good most of the time and the cities are quite interesting places. On the other hand, player spends most of his time on the rooftops. There's not much to see on the streets apart from walking people, so there's no reason to walk around just for fun. Also this game takes place in many cities, so one does not get familiar with any of them. General flaw in a sandbox game I think: make the city so big that no one never learns to recognize anything else but the minimap screen. Then again the game artificially constrains some areas as \"not available\" until later in the game.\nI also recommend having a controller to this game. I played my first with kboard and mouse and now I played with controller and it felt so much better, even though not as good as AC: Brotherhood. Especially since this game doesn't have a proper key mapping.\nAll in all, it's not a bad game, it just has some annoying flaws and almost everything is made better in AC: Brotherhood.

It also helps that Ubisoft finally relented with their misguided always-online DRM so the current version of the game is playable offline.\nThe only glaring issue I've run into is the horrific xbox controller support this game has out of the box. The strange thing is that the game recognizes the xbox controller, but default control mapping is absolutely terrible and doesn't match the xbox version of the game at all and can't be made to match it. This appears to be due to a poor controller implementation where they treat the xbox controller as a generic gamepad so that the triggers are analog inputs that can't be mapped to button actions. Thankfully there is a fix\nbut it's still sad that Ubisoft hasn't bothered to officially fix it despite the popularity of this game.

The game is set in the 21st century and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze.\nThe story takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy during the 15th and early 16th century. In ACII there is a lot of new abilities that the player has access to that were not available in the first AC. Now you can now use Eagle Vision in third-person view and while moving and you also now have the ability to swim. Now you can hire different groups of NPCs, such as mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves to help you fight, distract, or lure guards some thing that the first AC game never had. A day and night cycle has also been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time.\nThe game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forl\u00ec, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. ACII has added a lot of new side-missions that you can access any time throughout the game like now they have added Assassin Tombs which is an optional side-mission to find all of the Assassin Seals to unlock the legendary Armor of Alta\u00efr.\nOverall I give this game a 10/10 it is a huge improvement over the first AC game and I reckon it is probably the best AC game out there.

The continued theme and story from the first game in the series proves to remain just as captivating if not even more so. The gameplay is amazing and the things you are able to do with your character (in both combat, customization and just overall movement) are incredible.

This is one of the those cases where the sequel is better than the original. That's a good thing because that's what a great sequel should be, better. The Story is very intersting but can be confusing during some parts. One thing I kind of had a problem is putting Leonardo Da Vinci in the game because after about 1/3 0r 1/2 through the game he just stops being involved in the plot. The Gameplay is very fun like the Parkour but the combat is just Blech. I try to avoid combat because I don't like it very much and the noriety bar will fill up making guards recognize you faster. But since there's a lot of combat I recommend getting good armor and using the hidden blade as much as possible. One thing I didn't likeabout the Parkour--This is kind of a nitpick--is that I would sometimes fall from 4 stories up and land onto a 1st story window being just fine. I know you could just say it's Video Game Logic but I've been doing more Parkour IRL and I find it Ridiculous that Ezio Auditore can do this kind of stuff. This next thing is random: In the begining you play as him as a new born child.\n[SPOILERISH] I warned you.

You can visit beautifuly modeled cities in their most famous times. Living cities.\nAC2?\n+++ aka Pros\nBeautiful graphics, even nowadays. Everything modelled and textured with artistic feeling. Everything fit its place. Real work of architectonics.\nDynamic time of day.\nStreets full of people so one can feel really living city.\nIf you get bored in Venice, just go relax and drive gondola, watch city life mirroring on channel waters between houses during sunset.\nVery nice audio environment too. Heralds shouting their anounces. People talking each to other. Vendors shouting their offers. Just close your eyes and you can easily be there in those living cities.\nMain character Ezio runs and jumps same easy and flow as Altair did before him. And it is same fun.\nClimb or jump EVERYWHERE. Absolute freedom of movement!\nCombats - i'd rather avoided conflicts and when it was about fight i just tried run away. And when it really came it was fun. Lot of attacks and combos with counterattacks. Just do your clickity-clicks and watch Ezio dance his \"danse macabre\" between enemies :).\nCombats II. - you think you can run over the rooftops? :) Beware, guards are able to pursuit you even there.\nNice side jobs, eh, assassinations ;), because what could Ezio better than that. And i loved those boat/ships hijacking, get there unnoticed and do my job.\nI found or encountered almost no bugs or glitches.\n--- aka Cons\nI HATED FIXED CAMERA and/or AC2 CAMERA OVERALL SO MUCH! (sometimes ;))\nOne can very soon got really feel \"hey, i am console port\" - i can imagine with gamepad could be playing less frustrating in some parts (every time when game switches from player camera to some fixed camera in space etc.). It can get really frustrating even more when you raid some of Templar lairs or Assassins tombs, there are enviromental puzzles, which completing means very often to be fast with Ezio and jump and climb very precise with precise timing. Which icould be hard when you run a wall and suddenly, camera switches to some weir fixed position and because Ezio's movement is related to camera it could switch Ezio's direction during his movement in no time ... and you finish somewhere else where you shouldn't.\nAnother due to console-port pain - it is the graphics. It is nice, but no one can really tune it up. In case of shadows and LOD distance even at highest settings one can see popping higher geometry details or drawing shadows in front of his eyes.\nAlso sometimes in combat, mostly in tight streets and/or closed spaces camera does its strange work and ends in tree or in Ezio's body so you hardly can see what is happening ... during combat :/\nNo one of guards can swim. Just run, run, run and jump into the water, if you can and swim out of area of distraction and you are safe. No one will hunt you on water. Looks strange in rest of almost perfect gameplay and AI behavior. Guards just watches you swim away, eventually shouting and throwing rocks at you :).\nConclusion:\nSame as AC1 was AC2 has fantasy, but yet very believable and catchy story, decently built on pillars of real historical events. One has a huge opportunity to expand his knowledge during gameplay about parts of history which formed our today euro-atlantic civilization. This is what i loved on AC1 and i loved it again in AC2.\nVery good game with over 50 hours of playtime if you do all side missions/jobs.\nLooking forward to play next games in AC series.", "hours": 71.1, "user_id": "76561198076587335", "username": "bujablaster", "products": 167, "early_access": false}

You start playing as Desmond and you must escape Abstergo with Lucy. From there, you travel to a safe house where you meet two new characters who are going to help you dive into the past of another one of your ancestors. The premise is that you can learn how to be an assassin in present day by reliving the life of your ancestor. Unlike last time, you'll now be reliving the life of Ezio during Renaissance Italy.\nBasically everything in this game was improved. All of the original mechanics still exist with a few added extras. You can now buy and upgrade the villa where your family relocates. Upgrades give you more income. Likewise, collecting paintings, new weapons, new armor, or other items increase the value of your villa as well. The only downside is that there is that once you begin collecting/building, your income skyrockets and there quickly becomes nothing left to buy. I ended the game with well over 400k florins (the currency) because there was nothing left to buy.\nAlso improved was the side-quests. These quests don't seem as random or pointless as in the original and unlike the original, they continue to challenge. While two quests different quests might require you to assassin someone without being seen, the circumstances of those missions are so different, they hardly feel the same.\nThe only thing I didn't like about this game was Uplay. It's not so much that I don't like signing up for Uplay or that I feel annoyed my game is forever attached to my Uplay account (after all, that's basically the same as Steam). But what frustrated me was that Uplay would open every time I exited the game. If you are using Big Picture mode and a controller, this is problematic mainly because you can't close the window with a controller; you need to grab your mouse. I got around this by setting up a Pinnacle Game Profile to run when Uplay runs so that through a few button presses, I can control the mouse and close the window.

Going to say this now, I like the franchise of Assassin's Creed, but not as much as I used too. I was a fanboy of the games, I admit. I thought every game in the series were the best things ever. But now I've become more \"wise\" with my games and such and I don't think they are the best games ever, but more a guilty pleasure.... Assassin's Creed II is a direct sequel of Assassin's Creed. It's a story driven open world game with some social stealth elements and lots of combat. As for the story (what AC is knowned for), AC II is good, an improvement over AC I. But like many other games, it felt rushed towards the end and has a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing sequel bait (like we need more). It has interesting characters (not the best, but interesting) and one of the few games were I actually like the main character. Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian plumb--playboy, rich, cocky and charismatic lovable man. I love him and so do a lot of people. How does the gameplay hold up? Well it's an improvement over the first game, that is for sure. It follows the same logic, you're an Assassin, here's a contract, now go stab the guy. It is less repetitive than the first instalement. Now you have even more side quests to do, all kinda repetitive, but the Assassination Contracts are always a yes in my book for an Assassin's Creed game. The side quests are either go deliver mail (you are a banker that delivers stuff at the start of the game); beat up a man for cheating on his wife; assassinate a Templar (enemy of the Assassin) assossiate or you race someone across the map. The combat has become easier, now instead of waiting and countering everyone, you can wait, counter and shoot them! I swear, every installement of AC makes you have more and more weapons to use, it's too much for me. The game is really easy, a little too easy at points. You can purchase better weapons and armor in the game with money (trust me, you will have way too much cash), which makes the game easier. Is the world good? Yes, you have more places to go to than AC 1 and you go to Venezia, I love Italy and I want to give AC II a big kiss for placing this game there. The game did not age well compared to the other instalements. It still sort of look good to me, but it is poorly executed at times, it's laughable at points (i.e right after you get hidden blades, the scene makes me laugh every time how bad it is). The stealth in the game is different from the first game, and it's better. You can blend in crowds instead of praying everywhere you go. The more \"bad\" actions you do, the more the guards will notice you etc... Is it the best game in the series, I do not know. I don't know which one I prefer, Assassin's Creed II or Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. AC II is more an AC game, but I did spend over 600 hours into ACB on xbox...\nIn the end, it's a really good game, I like it a lot. But it is not the \"best game ever\" I thought it was. Good story, good world, easy but fun combat and it has Ezio, can't argue on that.

It definitely improves upon the original, and it is a fantastic experience for all players.\nAs I said before, Assassin's Creed II is a lot better than I. First, better graphics. This is expected, but it looks beautiful. The Renaissance scene is absolutely stunning, some of the best scenery of all time. They also introduce a new protagonist: Ezio, a young man who dons the white of the Assassin's when his father and brothers are killed by a viscious tyrant. Now he trains to kill all involved in the conspiricy, for justice... and revenge.\nThe story is flawless, connecting you with Ezio in many more ways than Altair is Assassin's Creed. And Ezio isn't the only great character. The entire ensemble is amazing, and each character makes you feel as if you genuinely know them. This is great to keep a player's interest and entertainment. Unfortunately, Desmond's side of things are a bit lacking. They aren't exactly up to par with the rest of the game, and mostly left me wanting to get them overwith and back to the Renaissance.\nAssassin's Creed II fixes Assassin's Creed's biggest flaw: FREEDOM!!!! Assassin's Creed II is an open world, giving you the chance to explore, do side missions, find collectibles, or just screw around, have fun! It also gives you the freedom to customize Ezio, choosing weapons and dying your clothes (though who can't resist classic white!). I mentioned collectibles. There is a side mission involving tombs. You must explore these tombs and bring back a disc from each tomb to your home. There is a secret room containing the armor of Altair, the strongest armor of all. Collect all the discs, and you will unlock the Altair's armor. But, sometimes all this collecting gets a bit repetitive, so search at your own peril or boredom (like those stupid freaking feathers)\nThe combat system is improved, again giving you more feedom in your style of fighting. The controls are great, and easy to understand. But best of all, it stays away from repetitive situations. Sometimes. The combat can get a little old by the end. Assassin's Creed II delivers a non-predictable gaming experience.\nThere are some issues, as the game is only as good as your PC, but otherwise, a fun time.\nScore: 7/10 - Good", "hours": 35.6, "username": "PandaMaster", "products": 198, "early_access": false}

The creative freedom of designing characters and abilities without pretext allows boundless possibilities. Ubisoft Montr\u00e9al however breathes life into a real world historical backdrop. Assassin\u2019s Creed II is a fascinating game set in Renaissance Italy in the late 15th and early 16th century.\nStory\nThe game is set in various locations around Italy including Firenze, Venezia, Toscana and Forl\u00ec. During the Renaissance period, Italy experienced a revolution in art, design, fashion, expression, food, drink, love and religion. Architects and inventors were encouraged to utilise their imagination. Men and women lessened their inhibitions and Catholic scholars embraced this passion to enjoy life. But beneath the surface were ploys to exploit the people, enhancing the political and cultural standings of the greedy. The desire of wealth and status embroiled hidden conflicts and espionage. The few that could see past the visage took it upon themselves to balance the justice by any means necessary.\nThe game literally begins at the birth of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian born to a banker. Through his teenage years, we see him grow up in Florence, developing his fighting skills as well as his charm and womanising skills. But his angst impedes his promise of becoming an assassin, his father\u2019s secret profession. Ezio is characterised brilliantly thanks to an excellent performance by Roger Craig Smith and writing that reveals his character traits over superb exposition. When his father\u2019s lineage is revealed, Ezio must adapt quickly in order to protect his loved ones. This narrative urgency spurs Ezio on. It also manifests into the gameplay making the player focus on perfecting the mechanics of swordplay, parkour and assassinating.\nGameplay\nEzio inherits the abilities of his ancestor Alta\u00efr to free-run and scale buildings. Taking advantage of this, Ezio can use the rooftops to traverse covertly and prey on his targets. The parkour animations are flawless with Ezio interacting with every surface and obstacle uniquely. Controlling the free-running is fairly straight forward, not requiring much skill. But navigating the fastest way to evade, scale or traverse all whilst avoiding or attacking guards is incredibly entertaining. Ezio\u2019s sword fighting skills are greatly improved over Alta\u00efr\u2019s. The new counter attack move allows more fluidity in the battles with more enemies attacking as a unit. Rather than attacking one at a time as in Assassin\u2019s Creed, the enemies use their numbers to surround Ezio and strike from all sides. But Ezio\u2019s gruesome counter means he can deal with the better AI as well as disarm and use their weapons against them.\nDespite being called Assassin\u2019s Creed, the assassinations were a very small part of the first game. Limited to just 9 specific targets, the game was mostly based around reconnaissance missions that made you eavesdrop, pickpocket and tediously collect flags for some reason. The rigid structure got very repetitive making the last third of the game drag. Assassin\u2019s Creed II breaks free of this structure and allows for more variety in the missions. Historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci provide Ezio with new tools like the double hidden blade in exchange for collectable codex pages of the blueprints. Ezio also gains a Wheelock firearm for ranged assassinations later in the game. One mission even uses da Vinci\u2019s flying machine as a way to infiltrate a target\u2019s fortress. The unpredictable variety of the missions coupled with the new gameplay mechanics, such as rowing gondolas, inspire surprise and delight in the experience.\nHorses return from Assassin\u2019s Creed with the ability to use Ezio\u2019s sword whilst on horseback. Guards will no longer attack the assassin if he is galloping on the horse but the city gates prevent the horses from entering the central streets. Evading enemies whilst being chased seems less frustrating than the first game but just as exhilarating. Although, the guards will now actively seek Ezio\u2019s last known location including sticking swords into haystacks. Wells, balconies, rooftop gardens and carts can be used as cover as well as blending into crowds. When Ezio\u2019s cover is blown, he will gain notoriety. Notoriety can be reduced by removing wanted posters, bribing heralds and assassinating officials. Wanted posters are so abundant though that removing them is the quickest and easiest method.\nThe game also includes an economy system that allows Ezio to restore the town surrounding the Auditore villa in Monteriggioni. But the balance of florins is uneven with the estate fully restored early in the game. The flaws in the economy are highlighted when the deposit box constantly fills requiring returning to the estate just to receive the income. This was a rather pointless chore. Ezio can also invest in businesses to make a return but as money was freely available this didn\u2019t have a purpose. Collectables are more intricate than the original game\u2019s flags. The Glyphs can be revealed with Eagle vision, which then involves solving puzzles to uncover the truth of Earth\u2019s history. Tombs in the cities offer a fun distraction as Ezio navigates the platforming areas to get to the treasure. These sections highlight the intuitive parkour mechanics whilst making the player advance more tentatively. All whilst enjoying the stunning interiors of famous landmarks such as St. Mark\u2019s Basilica in Venice.\nTechnical\nThe art and design of the game is beautiful. The fashion, the architecture and the famous landmarks are all fantastically restored to their former glory. However, the textures don\u2019t quite look as sharp as in the first game. The sky doesn\u2019t vary much during the day and night cycle and the game invokes a slightly blurry look to hide the inconsistencies of the technical aspects. Occasionally a quick time event will occur, which seems unnecessary and distracting. However the sound of slicing steel through flesh is wholly satisfying and the score by Jesper Kyd is beautifully arranged. The voice actors also provide their likeness to the character models so the performances feel inherent to the character and highly engrossing.\nVerdict\nThe series has taken all the necessary steps to take the strengths of the first game and envelope them into a cohesive package with an innovative setting. Molto bene.\n89%", "hours": 25.6, "user_id": "76561198049371903", "username": "benjameshodges", "products": 198, "early_access": false}

I have possibly 80+ on PS3 where i used to play it since the very release. *NOTICE*\nAssassin's Creed ll, A monster game from 2009, picked the story up where AC1 left it. In comparison with AC1, AC2 made some great changes. AC2 Included a more thrilling storyline and more (simple)features which AC1 should have had. AC1 was very linear and couldn't take me in to the story really. The gameplay has been improved since there are more things to do, examples: Beat-up missions, assassination missions etc. In my opinion this will deliver you some more gaming hours, besides free-roaming in the 15th century of Italy you can play the side missions. Two reasons to not rush the game with main missions only.\nThis will take me to the next point, after getting all stuff you actually can get, completed all missions (side missions too) the game will be boring(based on my experience), of course you can free-roam like I mentioned before but for some reason I don't like it much if I know there is nothing to do after free-roaming gets boring. Replay is able, since I bought it for pc too. (kinda crazy but hey!)\nAC2 does not include multiplayer. Maybe a bad point about the game, but I never cared much about the mp of a AC game since I didn't like the PvP setting. Like AC Unity will include I prefer co\u00f6p mode, to fight with each other against the enemy. Actually ironic that the story gives you the experience to raise a brotherhood and the multiplayer wants you to finish each other off.\nConclusion:\nAC2 is a must own, story will keeps you busy for (roughly) 7 hours, but I advise you guys to explore the world, get the feathers and extra stuff to collect, take the time to enjoy the game which is a rare thing actually isn't common anymore.\nAnd for the people who prefer history games...

Instead, they opt to have two buttons: 1 button for auto-freerunning and 1 button for auto-freerunning. Well, 'climb and run,' but the distinction is irrelevant since you can just hold both buttons down 90% of the time. \"Ohh he's so skilled!\" Shout the NPCs of Florentia, yeah, no. I suppose we can call it a move towards inclusivity, since you only need two working thumbs and an index finger to feel like a god.\nJust as the freerunning is at least spectacular, the combat is at least funny. That is, it is unintentionally hilarious to find new and creative ways to break the combat in your favor. Such as exterminating an entire garrison of soldiers with your bare hands by sidestepping their exaggerated swings and breaking their neck. Or grabbing them by the collar (trained men with swords, mind you) and chucking them from a ledge like helpless children still learning to use their legs. It would all be quite fun, if they didn't give you LITERAL MOUNTAINS OF HP. It takes three hits to the face before you even lose a single health peg, and you can carry a huge number of instant full-heal elixers. Given that even the most enormous groups of enemies wait obligingly so they can take their turn attacking you one by one, you can expect to win even if you have just turned 4 years old.\nIronically, the main reason I'm enjoying myself is due to the storytelling. Despite the cast consisting exclusively of mildly insulting Italian caricatures (expect to see that hand gesture where they pinch the air about 5000 times), the characters are actually very human. Even the main character, which is a welcome change from your average game these days, is not just a lifeless robot. Ezio's relationship with his familia is well established in a lengthy (but not obnoxious) prologue and paramount to his motivations. It's a breath of fresh air, really.\nOverall, the only reason I'm recommending ACII is because you can get it for cheaps.

You can scale buildings even faster than before, and on top of that, new equipment and assassination techniques to the game as well.\nSome of the basic things that had me dreading the first game have sort of returned. I didn\u2019t necessarily like climbing the numerous numbers of viewpoints around the cities to view my map.

However this isn\u2019t hindering the gameplay but adds to it, as almost every building you scale is different in some way.\nCombat mechanics are better than ever, though dislike heavy soldier quite a bit, as you can\u2019t counter their attacks, as you can with almost every other enemy.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 417, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-06-24", "text": "Assassins Creed 2 is a relatively fun, and engaging experience. The core game-play works well. The sneaking stabbing and fleeing all work. However there is rarely a real sense of peril, especially as the game progresses. Once you're at full strength with all the best weapons, there's no real challenge left in the game. There is also a lack of variety in the side quests which in general amount to more stabbing, but most often the same sort of stabbing. The core missions and story are entertaining and worth their time, though many feel forced or contrived.\nThe most jarring element is the lack of integration or reinforcement between the Ezio and Desmond plots. The Ezio plot comes so to the fore that after 20+ hours I'd forgotten Desmond existed. I was only reminded when suddenly, the game dropped me back into the real world, and asked me to show that I\u2019d leaned what I\u2019d learned in the first hour.\nThe game is at its most frustrating when the camera decides to get stuck, and Ezio loses track of which way forward and backward are. It would seem to be a trope of third person platform to pick random moments to lock the camera and make direction no longer absolute. There are a few moments where this works, but most feel arbitrary and unnecessary. They are made worse when \"tucked\" into chase sequences, breaking the flow, and often sending you back to the start. The only thing that saves this is the lack of a failure state for chasing down guards.\nThe final issue I would cite relates to the PC port. On the console, the four control buttons are shown, corresponding to which actions they will trigger in game. On the PC, these labels show which sort of command is needed to activate jump or dive, but do so with a generic icon. Even at 10 hours in, I was still digging through the control options to see what the little foot icon, or the head with a plus sigh icon actually meant. It is a small thing, but it makes combat feel much less organic, and much more frustrating.\nAssassin's Creed 2 is not automatically a short game. I've put over forty hours into the game, and have possibly as much as another ten to go. Total completion is attainable, but becomes more and more pointless as time passes. The only rewards the game can offer for exploration are feathers, which make you money, and money which makes you more money. The sense of accomplishment feels lacking as the money piles up with nothing more to spend it on.\nIt is a well constructed game with a lot of good moments, and even a few touching ones. It comes up short in feeling poorly paced, slow, and lacking in interesting things to do outside of the main plot. Renaissance Italy should be an exciting place, but in the end it just feels lifeless. Given its age and relatively low cost, I\u2019d recommend it for where it excels, but I\u2019d advise against trying to finish everything. Do enough to outfit yourself, enjoy the main story and take a few sunrises to watch the cities go by, but do feel obligated to finish everything that\u2019s where the game is weakest.", "hours": 70.7, "user_id": "76561198007017912", "username": "Francis Bacon", "products": 91, "early_access": false}

Performance-wise it's excellent too, very well optimised.\n-Varied missions that aren't repetitive; you never know what you'll be doing next and it will always be fun and awesome. You could be soaring across the city with a makeshift hang glider or playing games in Carnivale with a golden mask on.\n-Beautiful locations, such as Venice, Florence and other such italian renaissance places.\n-Stunningly beautiful overall style. The overall style of the game is so good, just look at Ezio's robe below. In my opinion that's the best robe in the entire AC series, elegant and majestic as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Not to mention the UI is smooth and simple while the menus are all red and white to match the theme, they're smooth and well done.\nBy far the best in the series, followed by Black Flag. I enjoyed playing Assassin's Creed 2 on a level I've experienced with very few games and it is a memorable experience that I will never forget. Here are some good points:\n-Every character you meet will feel like an entirely different person that you'll never forget. Quirky Leonardo and his eagerness towards inventions. The sultry yet tough-as-nails Caterina Sforza. Bartolomeo and his trusty greatsword Bianca, and of course the cocky yet ever gentlemanly Ezio Auditore himself.\nIf I had to give it any criticism it would be that the button prompts are all symbols instead of letters, so you have to learn what symbol means what key. (For example, the red leg button means Shift, the yellow head means E and the blue dagger means the Left Mouse Button)\nBut once you get used to that it's all good, and other than that I don't really have any other big criticisms. Go play it, it's the best in the series by far and it's not an experience you'll regret.

There is only one savegame!!!\n- Some of the acting is kind of lame, though most of it was ok.\n- Some faces look/animate pretty badly\n- It often forces the main storyline down your throat and won't let you get to the cool stuff if you don't go with it. Again, the game feels like it should be sandboxy and open-ended but it isn't really.\n- You are forced to install and use Uplay from Ubisoft to play the game. Uplay will glitch out and not let you play or mess up your savegame and is just generally annoying and forced and I will make a consious attempt not to use it anymore.\n- Obviously this is not entirely the game's fault but, for such a famous game, I am surprised to see almost no mods for it. Again, the surprise is in the fact that sandbox-type games like this one usually have good modding support.\n- When the parkour acrobatics system fails, it looks quite clumsy and annoying. The player has little control over the process as it simply involves holding 3 buttons together, so you can't get much better at it except by trying to turn your character better.\n- The controls and interface clearly show that it's a console port.\nSo yes, there are many points that annoy me, but the game is still awesome.", "hours": 24.9, "user_id": "76561198011484192", "username": "[SF] Jaydo", "products": 136, "early_access": false}

Now that I've finished Assassin's Creed 2 for my second time (and on PC this time), I still firmly believe this is the best AC game that I've played so far. Story, characters, music... all excellent! The visuals are well done, not ground breaking but they're very decent. And the PC version does offer better graphics.\nAs for the gameplay aspect, I played AC2 mainly with the Xbox One controller and no issues whatsoever. The Keyboard + Mouse scheme wasn't too bad and much improved from AC1 but I still preferred to play AC2 with a gamepad. The gameplay mechanics were refined too from AC1. The parkour works better, the combat is slightly more fluid than AC1.\nWithout giving you too much detail, this game improved in all aspects from AC1. It is a fantastic sequel and if only the other AC games were that good...\nPROS:\n+Strong narrative, impressive and deep story, Renaissance setting.\n+HUGE world to explore.\n+Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a strong new protagonist in the game.\n+Secondary characters (npc) were well implemented.\n+Jesper Kyd music composer (THE BEST AC SOUNDTRACK TO DATE).\n+More weapons, more ways to kill enemies.\n+Greater variety of missions / side-missions in AC 2 (Many side missions too if you want to play them (assassinations, courrier, races, etc).\n+Many Tombs, Templar lairs to uncover and they unlock the most useful item in the game.\n+Lenghty playtime. Just the story can take you a good 20 hours at least.\nCONS:\n-At the game's launch, it required a permanent internet connection. Totally unacceptable for a single player game. Granted, Ubisoft Montreal removed that draconian DRM but years later.\n-Uplay DRM.\n-Too many treasures and feathers to collect. The feathers do unlock a useful item once completed but I had no patience to recollect them all over again. Done it once on the PS3 and that's that!\n-Graphics aren't top notch. A few glitches here and there time to time but nothing gamebreaking at least!\nOVERALL:\nA close to perfect sequel! If you loved the first Assassin's Creed game, you'll love this one even more. If you disliked AC1, give AC2 a shot, you may like it as it improved upon the weakneses of AC1.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nSi! Even if you never played it, Assassin's Creed 2 is a very good game.\nRATING:\n9.0 / 10\nAnd now, time to revisit Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood...", "hours": 30.8, "username": "LIKEUCARE", "products": 1534, "early_access": false}

Assassin's Creed 2 is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed.\nDesmond Miles was about to be executed but were saved due to the intervention by Lucy Stillman. It appears that Lucy is an assassin in disguise. She helps Desmond escape Abstergo. After some rough journey, Desmond finally reach the assassin's hideout. There he meet Rebecca and Shaun. Desmond needs to learn how to become a real assassin. So there he goes again, into the Animus. This time, Desmond will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, an Italian Nobleman.\nThe gameplay then. Ubisoft really learned their mistake this time I think, and not just that, the gameplay aren't just no longer repetitive, but really expanded. You can now earn money and buy weapons and upgrades to improve yourself. You're going to pickpocket letters no longer, but you're going to steal money instead. Notoriety system are now included, which mean, the more bad things you do, it will get you wanted and will make the guards aware of your present and at some notoriety level, will attack you on sight. You can also now hire a thief or some mercenary to help you do some task or distract the guards. Ezio can now swim in water.\nThe graphics are also improved. Ragdoll physics are even better than the previous and the Italian environment are really much detailed and feels more alive. The water effects, the skies, the textures, the lightning, everything is better. The animation may look pretty much the same with the previous game, but with better physics.\nThis may be the best Assassin's Creed game yet.

After rescuing Desmond she relocates him in one of the secret assassin hideouts. This time Desmond must go inside animus once more and locate and aquire the apple of eden and become a true assassin through the memories of Ezio Audotore. Ezio is florentine nobleman who lived during the renaissance. At the age of 17 he witnessed his father and two brothers being executed which forced him, his sister and mother to flee to Tuscany, Moteriggioni at Villa Auditore. After learning about his heritage from, his uncle Mario, Ezio began his assassin training and set on his quest for vengeance against templar order, and their master Rodrigo Borgia who ordered the execution. Even though the game follows the cliche of \"muh revenge\" it's still pretty good story and gameplay wise plus you get to visit many iteresting locations like Venice and Florence and meet interesting characters of that time including Leonardo Da Vinci.\nThe gameplay in first installment wasn't really polished, but in AC2 controls are responsive and movement is fluid. The animations are smooth, wide variety finishing blows and finally you get to chose what weapons  and armor you equip. You also have new tools to make your assassinations easier and more interesting like double hidden blade, pistol, poison blade and now you can fight with hidden blade and won't get pushed back and lose HP like in the first game. I also enjoyed the assassin tombs which where rather interesting and rewarding. Once finished all tombs you get Altair's armor as a reward for your work. What I really hated is lack of stealth in this game, considering the first game clearly established how assassins operate: they're never seen or heard and kills only key target. I also disliked how guards were guarding seemingly uninportant locations which does no good to the series and breaks immersion. Overall it's pretty fun to play but could be better polished with more possibilities like stealth for hardcore fans.\nThe only downside I can think of is cancer named uPlay. When I purchased the game there was no mention in store page about 3rd party software. It is really annoying to punish paying customers by making trilions of accounts just to play one game. In this case it's Uplay. I don't know why I am required to register ANOTHER account just to play a game I already purchased on steam, don't make me use another platform. It is the only downside of the game, the DRM so if you're OK with purchasing it on steam and then adding it on Uplay go ahead.

This was the first game of the series I have bought or played, and wow I love it. The main storyline is pretty fun, the side missions you can do for extra money are plentiful (if somewhat familiar after a while), and Ezio is just a bad a**. Great graphics and music, plenty of weapons and upgrades to choose from, and some great free running puzzles. A really fun, immersive game. I have heard this is the best game in the series, and I could see why.\nSome negatives:\n- can't replay main missions, which is sad since they are, in my opinion, the most fun\n- I did not really feel extremely motivated to complete side missions. Money was always plentiful enough to get much of what you wanted, and some side missions where kind of dull. But maybe that's not such a bad thing, since this way you do not have to complete them to \"grind\" for money.\n- this game did not make me a bad a** in real life. It should have a disclaimer or something.  :)\n- somewhat repetitive and tedious at times. Things can become veeeery familiar.\nOverall I'd give this a 8.5/10. Definitely worth buying and playing at least once, especially since if you wait you can ge it for 5 bucks during steam sales.\nNote: Use a controller. The controls are not entirely PC friendly. You'll get the hang of them eventually, but a controller is much much easier and less frustrating.", "hours": 16.1, "user_id": "76561198091760099", "username": "StarryFox", "products": 193, "early_access": false}

You have bigger ones at your disposal (such as two-handed swords, axes and hammers) that have different animations and make the combat look even more exciting.\n--Your protagonist, Ezio, can actually swim this time. This is a must as you'll go to Venice and you have missions where swimming is necessary or just helpful in order to get rid of enemies.\n--To be honest, I was not familiar with the era of the first game. Now, when it comes to the 15th century the second installment takes place in it brought back memories from history classes. It's actually quite cool that Ezio regularly visits Leonardo Da Vinci and at one point in the game you get to use his flying machine.\n--There are a lot of cities in the game with TONS of side missions. You even have your own mansion surrounded by several buildings. You can upgrade these and the economy system incorporated provides you with a steady income.\n--Obviously, the game employs better graphics and you also have night-day cycle in the sequel. Horse-riding returns and it still looks cool.\n--Enemies are more varied and you are required to use different tactics instead of just bashing the counter key when it is necessary. Also, countering is easier this time.\n--The incorporated notoriety system requires you to lay low for a while after a fight with the soldiers in town - otherwise you are recognised as the local villain and immediately get attacked by the next group of guards.\n--No more eavesdropping and pick pocketing as mandatory missions! There were far too many in the first game and after a while they became annoying and very repetitive. Thank God the sequel has more varied and exciting missions and locales.\n--The plot is more interesting this time and while Altair you got to know from the beginning as an assassin Ezio now starts out as teenage boy of a noble family unaware of the conflict between the Templars and Assassins. You follow his story from the very beginning and it is nice to see how his personality develops as the plot thickens.\nIt may be the best in the series.

You will find neither of those things here.\nThe free running/parkour mechanic is pathetic, you simply hold down two buttons and Ezio will perform all the jumps, stunts and tricks without any input, as you simply steer him in the direction you want him to go. Why can't I have more precise control over him, as I do in Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands? (Which, after all, was made in the same engine.) This mechanic, while boring, should work fine for more casual gamers in theory, but leaves someone like me incredibly frustrated when Ezio doesn't do exactly what I want him to do. Frequently I am running away from guards, and instead of running straight ahead in the direction my mouse is pointing he starts running up a bloody wall to my left. Sometimes Ezio will leap elegantly off the side of a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing building to his well-deserved fate, because he doesn't precisely follow my mouse aim.\nBasic game design rules are thrown out the window here. Why is the grab button the same as the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing let-go button? If you're catapulting through mid air, scrambling for a ledge to clasp and accidentally press \"grab\" twice, then you'll end up falling to your death. Why can't the climb up and climb down buttons be used for this, like in every single other 3D platformer in existence?\nThe combat is also shallow and boring, and you spend most of your time waiting to counter attack. Some of the bigger fights with allies on your side can be fun, as you can sneak around your enemies to stab them in the back while distracted, but most of the time it will be you against a bunch of guards, waiting around or taunting them into making a move so you can counter. The actual countering is also way too lenient; you have about a 10-second window in which to press the button as your opponent slowly winds up his attack.\nPlanning assassinations can be fun, but they get incredibly samey and they never really challenge you. The stealth mechanics can be too easily exploited, and most of the time you don't even have to kill any of your target's body guards. Get in for a quick stab, wait for Ezio and his victim to have a boring and equally pretentious conversation, then run for the hills as soon as you regain control. Rinse and repeat.\nThis game is mindless, there's no need to pay attention to anything any of the characters say in this game. Every mission can be completed by running to the big target on your minimap, performing the easily executed action, then running back or escaping. Just a few hours in I had enough money to buy every end game item three times over. This game simply refuses to present a challenge. Occasionally I felt frustrated, but never properly challenged.\nI have a feeling most fans of the series are here for the story and the aesthetics. The story has some pretty cool ideas, but is sometimes let down by poor presentation and execution. A lot of the cutscenes are pretty awkward, and they seem reluctant to put any focus on the present-day portion of the plot. You only come back to the present day a few times over the 20 hours of play time, sometimes for (literally) no more than 10 seconds. I actually forgot about Desmond and Co a couple of times. Some of the secondary characters were interesting, but I personally found Ezio to be quite unlikeable.\nAs for the Aesthetics, you can tell a lot of attention to detail was put into the visuals. From the Italian architecture to the in-game menus, everything is very polished. Some of the cities are impressively big, and running through crowds of people, or sprinting along the rooftops above them can feel fantastic. Unfortunately the colour palette is quite dull and muted in places, and detracts from what otherwise is a vibrant experience.\nThe sound design is quite nice, but nothing unique or amazing. Some of the melodies in the score are very memorable and energetic, but you'll be mostly listening to the same 2 or 3 pieces over and over again.\nI did have one enjoyable play session of Assassin's Creed II, but I also happened to be quite drunk at the time. And I think that is the only way I could ever really enjoy this game. If you want to buy this game do not expect precise platforming. Do not expect enjoyable combat. Do not expect to be challenged. If you want to play this game, make sure it's because you like the story and the aesthetics, otherwise, like me, you will be severely disappointed.", "hours": 28.3, "username": "Mirkwood", "products": 280, "early_access": false}

It does SOME things REALLY well: the characters are really intriguing and it draws you nicely into its universe. In the beginning, you're thinking: WOW, what a game.\nBut then as you actually try to PLAY the game, its significant weaknesses begin to show, and then to annoy. Here's a list of my criticisms that made me go from \"I'm addicted - this better never end\", to \"yawn, this game is annying as hell and I wonder if I want to finish it\":\n1. It is a crappy console port. The controls are dumbed down for the average console player with a restricted controller, rather than an accurate mouse and a decent keyboard. So the game can't let you aim and choose the direction of your movement: instead, it tries to guess where you want to go/whom you want to attack etc. This can be a bit annoying when trying to jump to a precise spot, and the game keeps guessing the wrong spot and lets your character jump there instead.\nAlso, the third-person view with the camera is annoying as\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665- especially in the platform jumping sequences. First off, you can't look around in all directions - which sometimes makes it hard to find stuff like runes/feathers because you can't look all the way up. Second, in some of the timed \"jump-from-pole-to-pole\" sequences, the designers figured the player is too stupid to find the way, so the camera FORCES you to look in the \"right\" direction, which essentially suddenly restricts your usual movement - especially in the harder timed sequences. So if you were planning to run a little curve and try to steer by looking where you go, you suddenly can't and the game will interpret your jump wrongly and let you jump to your doom... Trying too hard to make it easy for supernoobs ruins the game for people who have played shooters where you actually have to aim...\n2. The game is ridiculously easy for the most part - except for the super-annoying timed jumping sequences.\nFighting: you can easily kill a whole group of guards, and even if a second group of guards happens to join the fight, no problem (unless you are too stupid to spam your left mouse button). This means you begin by playing this game like a Deus EX/Thief game, trying hard not to alert the guards - but once you figure out that they can't hurt you, are not scared of enemies anymore and simply run from waypoint to waypoint to complete your missions without paying attention. -> ruins the atmosphere.\nEconomics: after you completed 25% of the game, you will be FLOODED in money. Simply start by renovating the bank, like the game tells you, then play for 1-2 hours more, do all the remaining renovations and you will have way more money than you can possibly spend. This ruins the point of being able to pickpocket money in the street/seaching for loot boxes, and completing side missions - whose only point is more money, of which you already have too much. Which brings me to:\nSide missions: super-repetitive! It's either a race (run through all the waypoints within a given time, or deliver a letter within x seconds), or a \"kill these people\", or \"beat up my unfaithful husband\". Yawn after the 15th mission...\nFighting: Like I already said: there's absolutely no reason to use any of the weapons you can buy, or any of the \"disarm/dodge/push/headbutt/taunt/defend\" moves you can learn. Simply equip your assassins weapon, spam the left mouse button until all enemies are dead. If too many, it will take too long, so throw a smoke grenade - your first or second kill victim will drop a new grenade. If low on heath, use a health pack, your first or second kill will drop a new one... YAWN.\nI really wish the developers would have assumed that the players of this game aren't all idiotic spastic mentally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 16-year-olds with NO ability to learn a game, figure out its economics and fighting mechanisms etc. Now, the easy fix for all of this would have been to include a difficulty setting which makes fighting actually dificult, sneaking inevitable and saving money and considering what to purchase necessary - but THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY SETTING and everything is tuned to the lowest full-idiot setting.\nHaving said that: you can still have a lot of fun with this game if you just pretend you have to be scared of the enemies and if you focus on the atmosphere, exporing the nice cities and landscapes, experiencing the awesome historical setting and rich background information on all the locations and characters. BUT if you have played games from the Bioshock, Deus Ex, or Thief series, you will feel very annoyed at the developers at many points because of the above reasons and you can't help but feel that playing this game is a bit pointless because it presents no challenge to the player and doesn't punish mistakes.", "hours": 64.4, "user_id": "76561198025804890", "username": "RattenKind", "products": 36, "early_access": false}

References to the first game are made, and I would definitely suggest playing them in order.\nI think you can best compare this to the improvements made from GTA III over Vice City to San Andreas. Everything got bigger, more detailed, and more refined.

You certainly don't have to complete every single \"grind\" quest anymore, although you most likely will anyway.\nMoney plays a big role, because you can aquire upgrades and other items with it, bribe people etc. Citizens and guards react to your actions, and you, in return, have to take steps to make yourself less known.

I recommend this game, it's a good game with a very good story.\nI began with Asssassin's Creed 2 because before buying I toke a look at the forum of the game, and saw several reviews about  Assassin's Creed \"1\", and several people say the game is very good but with a lot of repeatitivy missions, and can be boring after some hours of gameplay. In the other side, I read good reviews about AC2, then I did a option to take Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood and Revelations, and with it get a game and two after with the same protagonist, Ezio. I bought the games during a steam sale, and thought good to take 3 games at same time with a good price.\nAt this time when I write this review, I have finished AC2 and started Brotherhood yesterday.\nWell, it's an amazing game with amazing story, I really like the game and sure recommend it.\nPros:\n* Amazing story, based on Italy near 1490, 1500.\n* Some historical persons like Leonardo da Vinci, Machiavel, and others.\n* Good mechanical of fights, with a variety of weapons, swords, and the hidden blade \\m/\n* Good side missions, some timely chalenged, some stealth. I didn't get bored with them.\n* Several hours of gameplay.\n* The evolve of habilities in fight and parkour during the game.\nCons:\n* The 3rd person view sometimes sucks. Sometimes the camera changes, you didn't view the back of your person, view by the side, the controls change too. Sometimes it sucks a lot to do right directional jumps, and sometimes when a jump is wrong you need to return and restart the mission from the beginning, very anoying. Fortunatelly this type of problems begin when you are at +-80% of the game.\n* Because last explained, some missions is a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665to finish. Imagine like you play for 5 or 6 hours just to finish a mission with 5 minutes of duration. And when you go youtube for help, you see other players saying the same: some anoying missions are really very, very anoying.\n* The mechanism of stealth in this game seems some broke. I had played Far Cry 3 some time before, I really like stealth way of play, and in Far Cry 3 the AI and stealth works very better.\n* The way the game shows controls during the game: the game don't show the keys (like E, shift, button 2, space), and instead shows icons related to the actions. Not a big problem, but take some time playing to fixing in mind these associations. I noticed it is better on Brotherhood that shows the keys instead of icons. A tip: I swap right mouse button with shift key, I think is better to run by holding the shift key (like in Battlefield, Call of Duty and other games) instead of holding mouse button.\n* Uplay DRM. It's not really a cons for me, fortunatelly I didn't get problem with uplay, but several people don't like uplay.", "hours": 117.3, "username": "voomba", "products": 268, "early_access": false}

Most of the game consisted of me screaming at Ezio to \"GO UP!! GO UP!!\"\nControl scheme aside, the game suffered from stale combat mechanics, repetitive tasks, boring assassinations (don't bother sneaking about; just make a b-line for your target, do the deed, and run away frantically), and repetitive tasks.  For a game about assassins, there were disappointingly few stealth tactics.\nFinally, my biggest frustration with modern games was displayed prominently in Assassin's Creed 2: Gameplay takes a backseat to the story.  If I wasn't stabbing those obnoxious lute players for my own twisted amusement, I was running to get from unskippable cutscene A to unskippable cutscene B... to unskippable cutscene C.  Frankly, I didn't find the story or its characters to be terrifically compelling.  For a noble's son, Ezio gains his aptitude for senseless killing suspiciously quickly.  And two games later, I'm still not sure why the Templars and the Assassins are forever at war, but I am sure that I don't care.\nI know I'm in the minority here, but AC2 is all about free-thinking and individuality.

At the end of the game, the Database looked like a collector thing, experting the beauty and construct, and architecture of the many many many Churches that populate Northern Italy.\nRenaissance... Really ?\nThinking about every stone, stolen from the glorious monuments of Old Antique. And for doing what, to build one christian church, then another, and one more, and in that corner of the street, place enough for still another one... of these damn churches. And so on, and so forth, until Rome (not really present here) looking af is a maddened achitect let loose, had opportunity and resources, to build every single one, of his repetitive ideas. And so the churches like mushrooms grown, until no stone or shadow, or memory left, of what was before. To the roman citizen, to think and recollect, the memory of his far ancestors. Them that created a Nation long ago.\nThis game, to complete it in a matter of a few days, with every side quest except for the Feathers...\nStill wondering why the Petruccio kid was collecting them ? Maybe he desired to have a larger pillow, for the calm of his night's dreams, not to hear the silly dialogues of his relatives and close family. Or perhaps for the wish to fly like a bird in the Sky, in anticipation of Leonardo's wonder woodened machinery.\nThe game is fun to play, but the music with that guy singing \"agnus dei\" over and over again, after a while, gets so boring that i had to shut off all music for good.\nIn this game you can jump, and climb. You can stab and kill. You can run after npcs, and hit them hard bronx-brawler style. You call yourself an Assassin, and believe to possess nobility and justice. But the trail you leave behind, has a lot of ghosts awaiting in silence. That are there on the far bank, when eventually you will have to cross the Styx, to enter the Realm of Ar\u00e8s. They want to talk with you, to see into your eyes, and await, and hear... all of what you will be by then.\nHope that the life of an assassin will bring enough wisdom and arguments, to face that dreaded challenge and perpetual monologue.\nSo many crimes, that this religion had to bring upon the world. Two thousands years of it, and going...\nAnd today, what horrid truth to acknowledge, than to say that Christianism is still (by numbers) 1st religion. Every time my steps in real, just like in the game with Ezzio Auditore... Nearing the shadows thrown onto the earth, the land and the people, by a churche's walls and bells and gilded prestige... Then i shutter in motion, and remember. The Antique, the fame of Rome's legions, the pride of greek legends and heroes and nation cities.\nGreat game after all, as it makes us think, and doubt, about the values of modern societies. Those values, that governments, politicians, and groups of \"interest\", love to spread like a plague, upon all medias, and the daily life of any of us.\nI was a christian too, in older days... until i changed. By looking on the side path, into anecdotes and \"faits divers\".. the smaller things that shape life and give much color to it. Because all else of what i heard and saw around me, day for day, was so desperately dumb.\nValues pretended.. That were none.\nThey loved so much to make party in Venice, and feast along their streets. With fancy clothes, dancing, drinking and singing... While under them, the water full and staunched from their presence and dejections, smelled to heaven so putrid and horrid, that every tourist come by, ventured by mistake or by chance, on this criminal ground, had to ask himself, why so much of a contrast ? Why... Indeed.\nWhen you kill... then what was killed is gone. That is so, for a human being, or also for an entire Civilization.\nOnly the shadows are left, for those that still desire to think and remember. Only a dream at night, when the cold starts to creep upon your doubts. It is gone now... and will not return. Not by a wish, not with a \"Renaissance\".\nAnd what you kill, you keep.

Because the rest of this review can not focus on the game after the bitterness of getting it working. The game is fun, however getting it working is like doing taxes.\nLet me explain how this normally works. I buy a game; I play a game. I buy a game; I play a game. I buy a game; I play a game - see how well this works? It is like a perfect circle.\nI buy assassins creed 2. I get an immediate road block. I have to install uplay, update it, update it again, update it again, and again, and again. I am not being funny about this. It updates for about a half an hour. And when I say this I mean Uplay updates - not the game - the launcher. For 30 minutes or so.\nWhile this is going on I have been reading about this uplay system and Assassins Creed 2. Disconnects you in the middle of the game, Check. Breaks your saves, check. Unable to be played in offline mode, check. Have to make an account on another system, check. According to what I heard and seen much of this is finally fixed. [probably not.]\nDuring this process I have immidiately decided that this game was a bad idea and that I do not like buying games from ubisoft. They, in the first few minutes after buying this game and getting it \"installed\", have convinced me that I should be looking for a crack of somesort FOR A GAME I OWN. That I should move on to piracy methods to play a game I own without a hassle.\nFinally it is done updating - Wonderful! Now to make my account. I enter my account info and press submit. Uplay - No network connection. I go back to the video of an adorable kittty cat playing a keyboard on youtube... \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t. Again? Same. Long story slightly shorter, I end up going to their site and creating an account.\nFinally! After a bit more futzing I start the SINGLE PLAYER game in offline mode. Check my settings. Press play and....\nNo network connection.\nOk\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665on it. I ended up having to start the game in online mode before it would play at all. After this it would lett me play in [sort of] off line mode.\nOk Ubisoft. I bought the game. I GAVE YOU MONEY. Why are you abusing me with this? I could have pirated the game, still very easy to do - Infact I almost grabbed the cracks during this just so I would not have to suffer any longer.\nAt my customer hourly rate this game would have cost over $200 US dollars just to get into working order. Please justify that cost to me. No - no never mind, you can't.\nThe game is great fun, if you can suffer through the uplay process. My advise is - Don't buy ubisoft games. They have gone insane on this whole \"pplz is steelin our gamez!\" kick. And software pirates are not the ones that suffer in the end.

Desmond has uncovered the location of \"The Apple\" a rare piece of eden that has the power to manipulate and enslave other humans. Desmond escapes Abstergo with one of the workers who reveals herself to be an Assassin named Lucy Stillman. After they escape Lucy tells Desmond their struggle against the templars and they're losing, with Desmond she explains it'll help their and for him to become one of them he has to go through \"training\". With that he must go through another of his ancestor's and one of the best main characters in AC to date: Ezio Auditore Da Firenze, an Italian noble starting his journey as an Assassin in 1476 at the age of 17. Desmond also meets Shaun and Rebecca, Rebecca provides the animus 2.0 and gives tech support to desmond while Shaun provides historical information, people, events, letters, etc to Desmond while he's in the animus. What can I say about this story....holy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 not only is this story long but it's both edge of your seat exciting,scary,funny,saddening and all in one package.....except the dlc. 9.9/10\nGRAPHICS: The graphics in ACII are surprisenly better here than the first one. Ubisoft did a good job in caring for the PC version like the consoles. There's some added graphic features and it makes it all the better sweeter. 9/10\nGAMEPLAY: WOW WOW WOW! Ubisoft how much did you put in this game? The hidden blade as it's own weapon? Two hidden blades? More weapons and customization features? Side missions that are more enjoyable than the first? Sign me up! Ubisoft put everything they got into this sequel by innovating so many ideas and it freaking worked! I didn't feel at all hindered by this game and I always kept smiling everytime I kept playing. Again thank you so much Ubisoft for putting in so much effort into this sequel. 10/10\nCONCLUSION: This is the definition of sequel, with an amazing story, surprisenly better graphics, and so much gameplay changes and ideas that worked. The only con I would put in would be the dlc as it either shouldn't have been made or it should of been included in-game.

Exploring Florence and Venice is also a great delight and a visual feast. Overall, there is a good 30 hours of top-notch assassinations, intrigue, and exploration. Add in the fun meta-plot about mysterious symbols and powers and you have a winning combination.\nThere are two main downsides. First, there\u2019s the repetitive nature of the exploring, unlocking viewpoints, and notoriety system. The repetitive nature perhaps indicates the game is a bit too long, with too many similar missions that could have been trimmed to tighten up the flow of the game. Secondly, the combat system is a boring affair, with overly long kill animations and dumb AI that waits its turn to die.\nOverall, there\u2019s a reason why people say ACII is the best of the series.

I had played a little bit of Assassin's Creed II earlier, but I got bored pretty fast because all I wanted to do was to run around killing guards. When I fired the game up again 1 year later, my goal was to finish the game without losing interest. And thanks to Ubisoft's amazing story and interesting setting I did just that. When the end credits rolled I had one thought: This was a damn good game!\nYou play as Desmon Miles, a bartender who in the first game was kidnapped by Abstergo Industries to explore the life of Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, Desmond's ancestor. In the sequel you have escaped Abstergo and seek to train to become the ultimate Assassin by visiting another ancestor, the Italian Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. Though Desmond you follow Ezio on his quest for revenge upon the ones who betrayed him. You visit four beautiful cities that you can explore as much as you want to, and there are tons of side activities if you somehow get tired of playing the incredible story.\nFor a 2009 game, the visuals are still a joy to look at, especially at the highest settings at 1080p, but the game is nowhere near as beautiful as Crysis 3 or Battlefield 4. The gameplay is also great. It's a bit more challenging that the newer games, but that is not a bad thing. After playing a lot of Assassin's Creed III and IV it was refreshing with a more difficult experience.\nAssassin's Creed II is definitely the best game in the franchise. The story is gripping, the protagonist is interesting and the setting is full of good experiences and fun side activities. You absolutely have to pick this game up during the steam sales where the price drops down to 2.50\u20ac or your local equivalent, but the game is worth it at full price as well.

The jumping is also well done.\n+ The combat animations are good, with several weapons you can use, such as swords, daggers, warhammers, hidden blades, throwing knives etc. You can perform some cool counter moves against enemies and special attacks as well.\n+ A fairly interesting storyline, although it has its flaws. The plot continues from the original Assassin's Creed, where Desmond once again enters the Animus and this time takes control of Ezio, an assassin who is out for vengeance against those who killed his father and brothers, while also trying to discover the truth about who he is and what he must do.\n+ Set during the 15th Century across many cities in Italy, this game has a unique feel. Graphically it's not that great, but the colours are really nice and the towering, iconic buildings have lovely architecture, giving you the impression that you're really in a Renaissance era town.\n+ You can purchase new weapons and upgrades for your armour, along with treasure maps to locate hidden chests of loot, which encourages exploration. You can upgrade your own city and learn new fighting moves in combat training. Raid assassin tombs, clear out templar lairs or complete assassination contracts. There's so much to do. There's also numerous features in the game designed to assist players in avoiding guards or enemies, such as blending in with the crowd to reduce attention from authorities, or utilising places to hide, like haystacks and rooftop gardens.\n- Clearly, the developers didn't quite understand how horrible their controls were in the initial Assassin's Creed for PC. As such, they decided to use the exact same formula here. Fortunately, it's not a total disaster. The tutorial is better this time and explains key usage much more thoroughly. Assassin's Creed 2 does a much better job of anticipating your actions and this results in free-flowing, natural movement, making the game enjoyable. The controls could still be simplified and significantly more efficient though. It is obvious this game was once again poorly ported from consoles and it's disappointing.\n- The graphics in this game could be improved.\n- While the movement system is fluent mostly, it falls apart when you want to move fast in combat and switch between targetting enemies. There's multiple keys involved here which are too complex to grasp in the small reaction time available.\n- Travelling between locations within a city can get tedious and boring. There's a lot of climbing, running and leaping in this game, which has its benefits and drawbacks. There's no fast travel option to accomodate players who don't wish to lug themselves across the city every single time.\nOverall Score 7.5/10\nAssassin's Creed 2 is a lot better than the first installment in the series.

And Honestly I enjoyed the Ezio Auditore Saga than the other Assassin's Creed games. What Assassin's Creed II offers is that it is an open world game with around 4-6 cities to go to in the 15th century Italy. The age of the Renaissance. This game offers one of the greatest cast in an Assassin's Creed game waay before Black Flag. You get to meet Leonardo Da Vinci, the Pope and Machiavelli. The details in the cities is so good even though this game was around 7-9 years ago. It is so impressive to see the landmarks that the cities had to offer. Now the important things that I look for in games is the display, the gameplay and the customization. The graphics are okay for a 2009 game, the colours are vibrant and they look really great. In terms of gameplay it seems it takes more time to defeat and enemy than the current Assassin's Creed games from Brotherhood - AC4 even though Assassin's Creed Unity's combat is much more complex. But it seems a little more easier still. Customization is a little lacking, but you do get a couple of costumes in the game which is an awesome thing as well. The length of the story is so much longer if you want a story driven game that makes you connect more with Ezio and the other characters as well. Theres not much more to say about this game but I highly reccomend this game as it is one of the best ones in the franchise. This game deserves a 9/10", "hours": 55.4, "user_id": "76561198054564148", "username": "Boba Fett", "products": 45, "early_access": false}

This controls horribly on PC, you might often find yourself getting frustrated with just trying to jump off a railing into a street and run along it, while Ezio will repeatedly jump across to some other perch or try to run up every wall and cling to every little thing when you need to hurry somewhere. You also use the same button to grip stuff and let go, how stupid is that?\nThere don't seem to be any engaging missions in the story, it's usually something completely trivial, sometimes forcing you to utilize a mechanic you wouldn't otherwise even remember exists, and usually requiring you to do some navigation over the same old boring identical rooftops or streets. Combat is easily cheesable and tedious either way, stealth is disfunctional, climbing is too clingy and unreliable at the same time.\nI honestly enjoyed the first one much, much more. I would recommend this one only if you are genuinely a fan of the renaissance Italy setting, which I personally am not.

The gameplay videos on Youtube look amazing and the game comes with a fair prize during Steam's campaign sales. AC2 and AC:B are available on OS X as well so there was no second thought about purchasing it.\nBut it doesn't all smell of roses.\nWhen you buy the game, they don't tell you that you can't play it before a forceful subscription into Uplay which seems to be some kind of Ubisoft's own gaming platform/environment thing. And if this does not feel enough like Big Brother breathing down your neck, then check this out: you have to agree to some freakin' long legal document before they let you play. Now, what if I didn't want to agree to it? Would I get a reimburse? I won't answer that. Basically Ubisoft kicks in some extra demands AFTER you've paid them.\nThe game starts off pretty awesome and you get the feeling of a great story unfolding but once the intro videos end and you receive control you'll get exposed to a really complicated set of controls. I found myself spending more time in options page during the first hours of gameplay than in-game. Overall I felt very stuck and it was not fun at all. AC discards many 101's of gameplay controls for a reason unclear. It would not even be a problem if the game would give you time to get accommodated with it's specifications, but instead the game starts off with a competition where you have to put those newly learned combos into full use in a tight race over rooftops. It took me full 30+ times to complete it and there was nothing fun about it.\nBEWARE! As if this was not enough, PC and Mac users have another major obstacle to deal with. After 30 minutes of gameplay it's quite likely that your keyboard or mouse stop working. There's especially high risk that the game starts to conflict if you're using Logitech hardware. If you don't believe me, google something like 'Assassin's Creed 2 keyboard not working' and you'll see that there are whole forums full of guys in trouble with this problem. Ubisoft's own homepage has a topic on this with no suggestions or help from their side. Don't expect any solution or help if you face this problem, you're on your own. I exchanged my Logitech mouse to a Microsoft one and now I can play for about 15 minutes, after that the mouse freezes and I have the option of either to continue playing with Mac's touchpad or restart the game. I have given up any hope to receive better performance out of the game.\nThe game is very mission-based and there's not as much freedom as you would expect if you saw the gameplay videos. I constantly have the feeling that if I only play a little more, it will all become more relaxed and free but I know it's an illusion. It's nothing like Elder Scrolls or Gothic.\nBig brother Ubisoft really screwed me with this purchase. It's been a very bad experience for me and I know to keep away from Ubisoft products in the future for sure.", "hours": 83.8, "user_id": "76561198027692026", "username": "Jamez", "products": 184, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Listening to it makes you feel like an assassin just like Ezio, but you'll never be as cool nor as good as he is. There are miles and miles worth of city to track and explore. There's also several unique assassination techniques that are extremely satisfying to pull off. As you complete missions, you will earn yourself some cash and be able to buy better armor and weaponry. The weaponry is also very interesting indeed. You can use smokebombs to make quick getaways. Throwing knives to kill those pesky archers on rooftops, use poison on one of your enemies by injecting them with it via your hidden blade. You can also use a neat little gun attachment on your arm, which is extremely useful for making assassinations quick and sword-free.\nOne of the best things is the combat system. When you're engaged in hand-to-hand combat, you can dodge, taunt, and perform epic killmoves. Are you one that likes to use swords, daggers, or even your fists? Then you'll enjoy the combat system very much. Another thing that the game executes very well is in the \"free run\" system. This running system allows you to climb onto objects and get onto rooftops and perform some very darn good parkour.\nBut if there is but on reason to play this game, it is the storyline. The great voice acting and fun and touching storyline are what make or break games. But Assassin's Creed 2 has done that very, very well. If you are one who enjoy the Assassin's Creed series, or even if you're someone who has never heard of it yet, you should definitely pick the game up. You'll enjoy amazingly detailed cities, great combat, amazing story, and an overall satisfyingly spectacular experience.\n9/10", "hours": 33.6, "username": "xCibooo", "products": 42, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "33230", "page": 462, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-12-31", "text": "Assassin's Creed II is a sequel that improves on it's predecessor in many ways. That being said, the game still does many things wrong. As a PC game, it is really frustrating for a variety of reasons.\nCONS:\nFirst, the UI is clearly not made for PC. It seems every multiplatform game these days has to use like size 24 font or the equivalent. I understand that consoles need this because people sit farther from the screen and the control input is imprecise, but PCs do not and the fact that developers don't make this very simple change to adjust the UI for the PC is really frustrating. Assassins Creed 2 is very bad about it. In the menu, you don't have a mouse cursor, instead you use directional keys to navigate, but the mouse's movement still swings your navigation wildly, which makes doing anything in AC2's menus really annoying and consolized.\nSecond, the control interface is also heavily influenced by consoles, but not only is it clunky or unresponsive at times, but it actually misinterprets commands wildly in some situations. So much of what you do in the game is contextual (to compensate for a controllers' lack of buttons) that it is very annoying to use on PC, where people are used to one button generally meaning one thing. I found myself accidentally jumping backwards off buildings or not \" locking on\" to landing areas when free running, which gives the player a sense that he is not really in control. I have learned to anticipate this over time, but I wouldn't call what I have learned a useful gaming skill. The controls are really counter intuitive. For example, the spacebar, which combined with right click, allows you to sprint and freerun, also makes you jump, and since you are sprinting everywhere constantly in order to get places faster, this means you accidentally jump quite often.\nAnother minor gripe is the use of a weapon wheel and no keyboard numbers for weapon selection. While the wheel is all good and well, nothing is quicker that pressing a single button and instantly bringing up the desired device. The lack of this and the lack of mouse scroll wheel controls is a clear mark of consolization.\nFinally, the controls tutorials are atrocious in this game, and the tooltips that pop up reminding you how to perform special actions are nearly useless. This is all for one reason. The controls are not labeled with their keyboard equivalents, but with symbols. This means that before the player learns that holding right click means going into high profile mode, the player must first learn what the games' silly \"fist\" symbol means by looking it up. Remembering exactly what these symbols and their combination do is an unnecessary hassle, and should have been gotten rid of altogether. They are however, labeled with colors, a reflection of controller buttons, and this is yet another piece of sloppy console porting.\nThe Camera is another aspect of the game which is frustrating for PC users. While normally, it stays comfortably in position behind Ezio, like in any Third Person game, there are times (mostly in platforming sequences) where the camera flips around wildly, which can be really disorienting. This is designed to help people see what they are doing in platforming sequences. The problem is that for some reason, moving forward means moving in the direction the camera is pointing, not the direction Ezio is pointing. This means that if you are running along a beam and the camera suddenly switches angles, you will start moving in a completely different direction and probably fall off.\nOne final consolization lies in the graphics engine. Like in assassin's creed 1, the shadows are still impressive, but the character models, poly count, texture quality, and draw distances are not. The engine is looking really dated, and as they open up the gameworld, it really starts to show. That being said, the game still looks really great, especially in motion and compared to other multiplats. It hasn't lost anything since AC!, but it also hasn't gained much either.\nMy final gripe with the game is the plot and character development. The silly plot about \"genetic memory\" and a grand Templar conspiracy throughout all of human history has been expanded to include supernatural elements including aliens and ancient technology. I suppose it has gotten a little better now that Desmond finally does something, but it is still really goofy. The glyphs and their attached puzzles are mind numbingly awful in this regard. The Templar and the pieces of Eden were apparently behind every conspiracy theory since JFK and the Moon Landings. Next they'll bring in 9/11. It's just absurd. In addition, the characters are really underdeveloped and in places, hard to believe. Ezio's mother, a Florentine noblewoman in the 15th century, tells him crassly that he needs to find \"other outlets for his energies besides \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s.\" REALLY? I found that and many other lines delivered by characters to be absurdly out of place. Not just for the time, but for the believability of such characters as modern interpretations of the past. The delivery and scripting of many such encounters are really hard to believe. In addition, the Assassin techies in the present helping Desmond apparently miss the fact that connecting unknown bits of technology to your system and not protecting it will have consequences as well.\nOverall the game pushes the limits of reasonable suspension of disbelief well beyond their maximum.\nPROS:\nThe being said, the game does many things right. Like in AC1, the actual atmosphere is great. You really do feel like you are walking the streets of 15th century Italia. The crowd dynamics, minor AI interactions, sounds and artwork all are great.\nThe villa, fast travel, less generic missions, not dying in water, improved blending mechanics, and less generic collectible quests all make for a much better gameplay experience by fixing flaws from the first game. But I'm not going to praise these things too much because the 1st game was AWFUL in many of these regards. Fixing them is simply what should have happened, nothing more.\nI will say there is a lot to do here. The game is very fun, and it is a good buy for the $10 I got it for. Wouldn't have paid $20, however.\nUltimately, if you liked Assassin's creed but wanted it to be fixed, that's exactly what you'll get with AC2. It's just still a sloppy console port with a really silly plot.", "hours": 29.0, "username": "Brendissimo", "products": 329, "early_access": false}

While reading my review you are exposed to a risk of breaking into tears. Read at your own risk!\nAssassin's Creed 2 has got many new fancy features and starts a new aspect from a new protagonist (but does not entirely leave the previously one; Alta\u00eer Ibn-La-Ahad). Also a new storyline starts from 1459 at Florenz, Italy (actualy 1467, where you begin to play) one of my personal favourite key features. This game is satisfying long to play and comes in with new suprises. Also some history characters are playing some role here too. Good! I had my joy with this game.\nAs for Desmond Miles his tale goes on...\nThe BAD things of Assassin's Creed 2 are:\n- UPlay! What the fakc? I don't need another useless program running on the background with my processor and slowing overall performance down! Because UPlay has problems with me, I had to bypass this by modifying certain UPlay files to get this to work.\n- Sometimes AC2 appears to be crashing randomly on any action if i play for a long period of time (about 1 hour)\n- Some necessary settings are resetting after EACH start of AC2. These are 2. Subtitles = OFF (from ON) and mouse sensetivity X & Y = 5/10 (from 9/10)\n- Lucy Stillman has a much different and ugly skin. I don't see her as Lucy Stillman from the first AC!\nI do not recommend to pay for this game since the developers have gone on a moneyhunt and are releasing since AC3 non-assassin games with cheap tricks. AC 2 IMO is still a good game and is worth playing. I do not support the dev's any further because their products have gone worse and I still have the inability to play it \"clean\" without UPlay.", "hours": 23.2, "user_id": "76561198013724550", "username": "\ud83d\udc8a\ud83d\udc89\u2800+\u2800\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc59\u2800=\u2800\ud83d\ude0d\u2764", "products": 211, "early_access": false}

Incredibly fun.\nEDIT: I would like to come back to this review and give an honest opinion on what I think about the game. I originally made the \"review\" above when I had only a few hours of game time.\nI'm going to say it right now, this is probably my favorite game in the series, or at least top two, as of August 9th, 2014.\nTo start off, the story of Assassin's Creed 2 is above and beyond what I would have expected after playing the first game. It's not just a linear \"go kill this person and come back\" type of story this time around. There are genuine reasons for killing the people you kill, the cutscenes have many, many times more emotion than in the first game, and the voice acting is superb. In the first game, Altair's voice is monotone the whole way through. You could chalk this up to his serious personality, but if you have ever played games showcasing Altair later, such as in Revelations, you'll know this is not the case. It shows that Ubisoft really put many more hours of effort into making the story in Assassin's Creed II the best it could possibly be.\nNow, as far as content goes, the overall content in Assassin's Creed I can be smushed into 15 hours at max, and 8-9 hours if you just play the story. However, as you can see, I have 50+ hours in Assassin's Creed II as of the time this review is being written. I have replayed the game once now, but many hours were spent dicking around in the unique environment that is Renaissance Italy. There are endless possibilities for things to do in Assassin's Creed II, even after finishing the story. The best part is though, that even after finishing the game, I can start a new game and not be bored. That's the beauty of this game to me, and all of the Assassin's Creed games really.\nOverall, this game is worth the money twice over, and if you're thinking about buying it, you really should. I can honestly say that you'll have a hard time regretting it if you give it a chance.", "hours": 52.4, "username": "Svetroid", "products": 440, "early_access": false}

Especially when you enter Venecia, it evolves again in a lot of ways that you didn't expect.\nThe Story is one of vengeance, thus it already is cool by definition. You follow Ezios quest to avenge the demise of his family, while rebuilding an existence, it just draws you in.\nHowever, there are points in this game, where I was just frustrated.\nThe side characters are fine, as long as you're presently interacting with them. When you're finished with their quests, they simply vanish, only to be seen again at the end, at which point I was actually asking myself, who were these guys again? So yeah, rather forgettable and especially annoying in the case of your uncle Mario (who has the funniest line in the game), who basically gives you his house to live in and is never seen again.\nThe controls are mostly fine, but there are points in this game, for example when you're supposed to follow a fleeing templar and kill him before he alerts his mates, when you just want to curse and throw away your controller, because Ezio just made another jump into the unknown depths of wherever you did not want to go. As I said, for the most part, it's fine, but it gets annoying sometimes. Another nice example is trying to tail someone unseen, on the rooftops, like a cool assassin, trying to drop on a ledge below, instead jumping on the person you were supposed to follow.\nBut the thing that annoyed me most was the fact that this game just... does... not... end.\nIt's really excessive in it's length, towards the end, there are at least two hours of storyline that give nothing to the story and in parts consist of extremely annoying quests. When I came to Venecia, I figured I was about halfway through the game, I had my Villa all set up, was at maybe 60% with the sidequests. Actually, it was maybe a third, and not all of that rest of the game was good.\nStill, I recommend the game to anyone, it is a lot of fun and has really cool moments.", "hours": 47.5, "user_id": "76561198044970982", "username": "Gumba23", "products": 445, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 471, "page_order": 5, "recommended": false, "date": "2013-12-19", "text": "This game is the epitome of butt.\nLet me list the reasons of butt:\nUPlay. You'll already know of this. Once the game is downloaded and installed, UPlay launches and installs updates for about half an hour. Not updates to the game, updates to UPlay. It's not just one update, it's a bunch of incremental updates. Good job, guys. Once it's installed, it's not awful. Just bad. It loads, and then the game loads (so it's the equivalent of a splash screen really), but you have to close it manually once you quit the game (which is mildly annoying).\nThe controls for this game took no account of the fact that the player would not be using a gamepad. What the hell is \"Face Arrow\" button? Apparently it's F. Or sometimes it's right-click because those two symbols look exactly the same. Just awful. The moving around system controls work terribly, due to the context sensitive only-using-a-few-buttons-because-designed-with-controllers-in-mind control system decides that you want to jump off a tall building instead of just keep running in a different direction. Oh, and sometimes left is up and right is up, but up is forwards. I know, it doesn't make any sense to me either.\nGiven these control issues, the quick time events become especially butt (instead of the normal just butt that QTEs normally are). It asks the player to quickly press the FOOT button. Given that I'm not holding a controller, when a cutscene happens I'll sit back a bit. My hands aren't right on the controller, I can't immediately hit a button with no warning at all. Also there's the added mental step of having to process what button FOOT is. Which is distinctly unhelpful. Thankfully, the QTE events that are actually important are very rare. They still exist elsewhere, so they're just annoying.\nAlso in the area of controls: the mouse look. It's awful. I'm not sure if it's mouse acceleration, or if there's any mathematical relation between mouse movement and camera control. It's that awful. You can't look up or down very much, which is just frustrating. Side-to-side isn't awful (I think there's a bunch of acceleration here), but the camera moves independently of the mouse as you run around with WASD. So as you turn a corner, you try to turn the camera with the mouse. But the game notices you're running around a corner and says \"HERE LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT I KNOW HOW YOU WANT THE CAMERA.\" No, game. Bad game. Stop.\nThe HUD is butt. In the first game, it was a pretty minimal system (apart from the map, which was big and useless). This time the health bar takes up a ton of screen, bunches of annoying messages flash up on the left side of screen (like tips that lots of games have, but they repeat very frequently and you can't turn off ones you've seen already), the mini-map is still big (but actually useful now! hey a plus! nice job!). The context-sensitive control indicator is still a similar size to in the first game, which is quite small and tucked away in the top right hand corner. I can live with that one at least.\nThe story. Oh jesus, the story. It's so bad, it's hilarious. I was quite literally laughing out loud at points of supposed seriousness. The characters are just awful and incredibly bland - it doesn't help that the main characters motivation for doing his stuff is the most generic, bland and overused thing ever.\nSeriously. The least inventive thing possible. And given that it's a story that's been travelled so much, the character and his progression is the dullest thing possible. Boo. We're meant to be able to identify with our main character, not hate him because his character just bores the hell out of us. He makes the most stupid decisions ever (because the plot demands it), which does the exact opposite of attach to his character. It's so damn annoying.\nThe midway reveal was really unimpressive and it could be seen coming twenty miles off. It wasn't an awful reveal, and it made sense in the story - but it could have been pulled off with so much more style and feeling. The ending was just an utter mess. They seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I certainly had no idea what they were doing.\nThe whole game just had too much padding. It was too long, but this was most notable towards the end. Instead of disguising it's \"do the same mission all over the place\" as a bunch of story, it just admits that you're going to do the exact same thing a bunch of times and that you aren't going to progress until you've done it. It's just terrible. The game was about 10 hours too long, and had way too many false endings. Hate it.\nAlso: tail missions need to go die in a fire. They're so god damn boring. Similarly, so do missions in which you need to stay undetected in a hostile area. This game was NOT built for stealth in the slightest, so it's a terrible idea to enforce it on the player in an area where there are so many opportunities for failure (at something which the game does it's best to stop you doing).\nOne plus (apart from the minor one of the minimap earlier):\nThe combat this time is actually half decent! The game introduces varieties of enemy AIs and attacks, so you have to stay on your toes and think about how to approach multiple enemy fights. Fist-fighting is terrible though. Punch-punchy punch punch over and over again. No other approach needed.\nTo sum up in way less words than I just wrote:\nThis game is so god damn dull, and so god damn boring. The story is boring, the characters dull and some just annoying. Combat is decent. The game is way too long and has no need to be this long and just pads it out with repetition.\nIt just feels like a bunch of people making a game, but none of these people actually cared at all about the game. No love was put into it at any stage. And that comes out through the playing experience, and makes it pretty much impossible for me to love it. Poor unloved game.\nIf you really care about getting the story because you want to play AC4 because there are pirates or something, just read the story on wikipedia. The story won't be any better, but at least you won't have to endure the heinous gaming experience of playing it. Avoid this game like a really bad bout of the flu.

The visual aspect, even when is quite remarkable, is not what really stands out, but the absurdly amazing art and design. Again, each corner of the renaissance Italy is detailed, rich, full of life.

I, however, had a great experience with the game. The wonder of playing an open world game set in an historical era was such a mind-blowing experience that I found it easy to look past the repetition, the janky climbing mechanics, and the various other problems the game shipped with. Honestly, new IPs as ambitious as the first Assassin's Creed game deserve a little leeway anyhow, since they're attempting to accomplish so much while starting from scratch. Nevertheless, the game was severely flawed, and it rightfully got some flak for it.\nAssassin's Creed II, when it released, was a perfect example of why the medium of video games is filled with successful sequels. It's difficult for a studio to nail everything in their first try when, many times, they're starting from the ground up by building things like graphics and physics engines from scratch. So much time focused on the building blocks of a game leaves little time to flesh out the more dynamic aspects on top of those, which is why the first game featured so much reptition. Assassin's Creed II, however, improves upon everything that the first game promised. The graphics were superb at the time they released. There were literally no other open world games that looked this good, and they even stand up pretty well today. The cities were beautiful, they were alive. Florence is not a city that's changed much, and they completely nailed the feel of what I imagine it would be like at the turn of the 15th century. Platforming is improved, it's quicker, and it's more intuitive, but it's unfortunately not fully polished in this effort. When it works, it's improved massively over the previous game. The campaign itself is a meaty, lengthy game that's packed with content. You're visiting multiple cities here, you're visiting the beautiful Tuscan countryside, and the game is spanning decades. As somebody who's visited most of the areas depicted in this game, I can confidently say they've nailed the feel of the entire region. Ezio as a character is interesting, he's charismatic. He's an easy guy to root for, and his story begins personally and eventually emerges into a grand scale. He's been dealt a raw deal, but he lets things slide in a way that feels simultaneously incredible and admirable. Combat and player management has been expanded upon from the first game as well, as armor management, weapon and gadget management, and new costumes are all greatly designed. Customizing your Ezio is one of the most satisfying parts of the game. Combat is built upon from the first game, and now feels far more in depth. Probably the single best mechanic in the game is the build-your-own-stronghold aspect with Ezio's family villa. It's very addictive, and the visual change you experience in the small city is one that's immensely satisfying. As you invest money in building up your walled city, the population increases, the streets are cleaner and brighter, and the city is louder and more bustling as a result. I didn't realize quite how much it changed until I began a new game and saw how murky and depressing the place was when you first arrive there.\nOne specific thing I'd like to highlight here and really stress is just how good the soundtrack of this game is. It's been mentioned before but I haven't seen anybody truly do it justice, yet. Jesper Kyd absolutely kills it, and sets the bar so highly here that he can't hit the same heights of quality in AC: Brotherhood or AC: Revelations. The music all fits the settings so superbly that I really can't imagine playing this game without it. Half of the reason the world is so immersive is the setting, the ambient nose, the lighting, and the architecture. The other half is all soundtrack. No exaggeration. The music is all ambient, and very low-key, but it flows like a satin ribbon, enveloping your brain and keeping you floating through the streets like you're walking on air. It's just so effective at immersing you into Ezio's world. It breathes life into an already beautiful world, and Kyd's dismissal as the series composer is a big part of the reason why Assassin's Creed III seems dead and less alive to me. The Florence theme in particular is utterly spectacular.\nThis game, though, is certainly not without its flaws. Free running control has aged poorly since 2009 and can be frustrating at times, especially when attempting to move quickly. This makes any races and chase sequences an annoyance at best, and downright infuriating at worst. Ezio simply doesn't always go where you want him to, and story mission chase sequences are often purely trial and error as a result. Most frustrating would have to be Ezio's tendency to inexplicably stop when scaling straight up a building, and look the left at nothing in particular. This happening during a chase is especially frustrating. At times the camera is a massive pain during combat sequences, getting stuck behind buildings and spires. I also had an issue with the lack of a quick checkpoint restart option and fewer and further between checkpoints. It makes the light stealth gameplay here a frustrating experience at times.\nTo put it with as much brevity as possible: This game is an experience. It's a thoroughly atmospheric, immersive delight that will transport you straight into this time period and make you want to do nothing but walk the streets of Florence and pole through the canals of Venice for hours on end, with no goal in mind more than collecting a few treasure boxes, seeing the sights, and listening to Jesper Kyd's wonderful score.

{"product_id": "33230", "page": 475, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-12-06", "text": "Right out of the bat I'm going to say it... Assassin's Creed 2 manages to improve on (and in most cases) correct a lot of the 'mistakes' made in the first Assassin's Creed. The story flows more naturally, the environments are lively and invite you to explore... and there's no horrible 'hub' map that seemingly is just home to a horde of angry guards guarding pointless view point towers!\nEzio as a character has more life and soul too, which only helps the story along. It allows you to easily get to know him and makes his pimping actions across Italy enjoyable. There's just something fun about running around the roof tops of Italy and generally acting like the biggest lad in all of Rome. I can't really explain it, but it's there - 'fun'.\nThat was an element I felt was lacking in the first Assassin's Creed game where everything felt like a chore; a long drawn out chore with little reward.\nIn Assassin's Creed 2 there are no 'chore' out moments to progress the game's content, the memory cores are all linked together and essential - so there's no climb a viewpoint, evesdrop on this guy and pluck a chicken style build up to Assassinations. Instead all story elements are told through memory segments, which allows the game to flow and the pace to build and fall in such a way that the game doesn't drain you emotionally or bore you to death.\nHowever, having said that I personally found Memory Block 12 & 13 to be totally out of place and to ruin the pace of the game. I found out that these 'chapters' were the added DLC, which would explain to the tacked on feel they had and the horrible pacing.\nAll things considered looking back that was my only real issue with the game, which is amazing considering the mountain of issues I had against the first Assassin's Creed.\nPersonal highlights for me were just the random events that would happen due to the Havoc/Ragdoll physics going a bit strange. Not in a terrible buggy kind of way, just natural mistakes happening such as people falling off buildings or running into each other. It was those natural unexpected events which caused me to laugh the most, it made the world feel alive. Also, I get some sort of sick enjoyment out of seeing Ragdoll death mechanics contort bodies... I'm not entirely sure why I've admitted that in written form, but there we go.\nI'll go seek help.\nThe story was another bonus in Assassin's Creed II, as it expands on the strange historic, yet future pretense blend set in Assassin's Creed. Drawing influences from Templars and... Tron?! Well perhaps. There weren't too many Desmond scenes in this game, but the few you have are interesting and finally expand on his connection everything happening with Assassin's Creed.\nI don't want to say much more as it might spoil content, but I really enjoyed it and the ending... and the credits strangely enough.\nOverall, if you've been interested in Assassin's Creed but have been weary, I would recommend checking out an edited Youtube video of the Assassin's Creed cutscenes as a lead in towards actually playing Assassin's Creed II. The rest builds up and hooks in to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Revelations.", "hours": 29.5, "username": "Chris", "products": 1901, "early_access": false}

The main improvement is it's NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.\nYour hero in Assasin's Creed 2 is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Ezio's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the bits outside the Animus) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note (you can even switch to playing the game in Italian with english subtitles!).\nThe gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are VERY fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.\nAlso, it easily has one of the best soundtrack! The music is not only original and cool, it changes perfectly to match the action in the game (chase scenes, flying, hiding etc). The developers really went out of their way with this one.\nThis remains one of my favorite series of all time and I highly recommend it to all gamers.

This installment in the assassin's creed series is the first of what is now known as the Ezio Trilogy, to which there are three games you follow in the footsteps of Ezio Auditore. The game enviorment breaks from the bleak and extremely uncolored backgrounds, giving people in and out of the animus character and depth. This allows for great dialog with people who actually seem human and not clone back water breed people seeking power.\nThe game starts off as you with a sort of rebellious italian spitfire where you witness your families death, save your mother and sister. While on the path to revenge, you meet your uncle mario and he reveals that your father was more then a banker, he was an assassin. Uncle Mario guides and trains you and you in turn decide to take up your fathers work and finish what he started: To stop the templars and protect the Apple of Eden.\nThe game, for my taste, is just the right length and unlike the first Assassin, Ezio is not water solvent and does not navigate like a land yacht. The PC version of the game is complete, but the console versions are not. They added two DLCs which are Sequence 12 and Sequence 13.

Where the first Assassin\u2019s Creed was very repetitive in terms of combat and gameplay, AC2 is a large step ahead of its predecessor. They have added multiple new weapons including a hidden pistol, poison darts and smoke grenades. On top of that the counter system is much improved and Ezio has many more moves when killing someone.\nAnother thing that AC2 improved on is that they did away with the horse riding between cities as a lot of people felt that was a boring and unnecessary part. They leave you to exploring just the cities and if you have the money later you can buy maps to even find all the feathers and flags later in the game.  It isn\u2019t without its bugs, sometimes Ezio won\u2019t counter and you\u2019ll get hit or you\u2019ll slightly get pushed off a ledge and fall all the way to the ground but these are very minor problems in a very good game.\n\nIf you have never heard of the Assassin\u2019s Creed series or never played the first one I\u2019ll give you a quick synopsis to get you caught up. The Assassin\u2019s and Templars have been at war for close to a millennia. You are actually an assassin from the future that was captured and forced to use a device called the animus that allows Desmund, the main character, to relive his ancestor\u2019s lives in order to find out about the Apples of Eden. In the first game Desmund goes through the memories of Altair, labeled as one of the greatest assassins of all time. Eventually other Assassin\u2019s free Desmund and takes him somewhere safe to go through the memories of Ezio, the assassin for the next 3 games.\nIt starts out when Ezio was a women chasing young whipper snapper in the year 1476 B.C. and he comes to find out that the men of his family, he still has a younger sister and his mom, have been captured by the Templars and are hung in front of a crowd. Ezio escapes and is taken in my his Uncle Mario in order to train him to become an assassin and get his revenge on the Templars. I\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665you not the line Mario says is what you would what him to say. Who says Ubisoft doesn\u2019t have a sense of humor:\n\nEzio goes through the trials of becoming an assassin while meeting more allies including a very young Leonardo da Vinci. As he progresses he gets more weapons and discovers more about the truth involving the ancient humans and the \u201cPieces of Eden.\u201d Many years pass and Ezio doesn\u2019t get his final revenge until much later.\nAs for the graphics, this is an older game and was ported from consoles but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t have some impressive visuals. The scenery is very nice and they did a really good job of re-imaging 15th century Italy that includes locals like Rome, Florence and Venice. The voice acting is all top notch and the music matches up with the events in game really well.\n\nBecause this is a console port, like the first game it is recommended you have a machine more powerful than just the recommendation. I would say at the very least have a quad core CPU and a 200 series Nvidia (4000 ATI/AMD) GPU along with 4 gigs of ram. Overall though they took the criticism from the first game very well and looked to improve the second.  It does have its problems with a few bugs and sluggish or poorly designed keyboard/mouse controls.

Assassin's Creed was great, and Ubisoft immediately learned that to improve the series, they'd need to sideline Altair, the protagonist. They demonstrated a drastic shift in setting and tone, and with that showed the series' flexibility, as they moved the entire series in a new direction- The setting changed from the Holy Land to Italy, and with that we were introduced to a new legend of gaming- Ezio Auditore. Charasmatic, funny and lethal, Ezio is regarded as one of the best developed characters in gaming, and this is partly due to the fantastic writing and story of the game- Bringing in historical elements and characters such as Leonardo DaVinci and the Borgias, aswell as exciting, epic moments chasing through the rooftops of Florence and the canals of Venice. Ezio's story of revenge brings him through the lands of Italy, and the game shines greatly in its setting and story. Thankfully, the Desmond backstory was not hugely developed yet, and most of the aliens and mumbo jumbo of the later games were spared, the game's main focus is Ezio, and Desmond really does fit in where he should, he's not shoved down your throat with all his conspiracy theories, *cough Assassin's Creed 3 cough*\nGraphically, the game was good, but not inredible. Faces were realistic but at the same time off somehow, hair looked like an error all the time, and in typical AC fashion, ragdolls and derpy physics were plentiful, but yet somehow, the beauty of the cities and the landscapes made the game look and feel incredible.\nThe gameplay evolved upon the epic foundation left by the first game, making combat and freerunning seem accessible for everyone. New elements such as rowing a boat on the canals and hidden pistols, made by DaVinci himself, add alot to the gameplay, and the combat was made incredible. The inclusion of dual hidden blades, more weapons, easier controls and the multitude of guards made each city a playground- As sadistic as it is, I found myself in glee at diving off a rooftop to dual assassinate afew guards, and then take on another half a dozen before getting overwhelmed- The difficulty was perfect, and the combat provided a challenge, which is something the later games failed to provide. Missions and assassinations themselves were given a facelift too, with added mechanics, which gave a nice balance between handholding and freedom.\nI loved the mission structure of the original Assassin's Creed, and sadly this was not included, rather than given a target and a sandbox to kill him in, you are given routes and ways to kill him, which does allow for epic moments attacking targets on castles and towers, but lacks the satisfaction of figuring out the perfect route to go.\nOverall, AC2 remains probably the best in the series, and the most original game of its type in its time. It was revolutionary, innovative and inventive. Plus, who can beat punching the pope in the face? If I had to rate it, I'd give it a 9.5/10. Buy this game, it's cheap and there's no excuse. I got it for \u20ac10 or something, trust me, it's worth it. Even if you haven't played the original, this is worth a shot.

I stated in my review, though, that it felt like a disjointed collection of minigames.\nAssassin's Creed 2 (\"AC2\") takes those individual game elements from the first Assassin's Creed, and remixes them to create a game that's far more entertaining.\nFor this second game, the developers kept the stuff that works (climbing towers, free-running), and eliminated the things that were less fun (eavesdropping, picking pockets, long combat sequences). You're doing a better mix of stuff in AC2.\nThere are several indoor locations in this game, and the addition of storefronts on the city streets makes these Italian cities feel much more alive than the dusty, beautiful, barren cities of the first game.\nAC2 offers a variety of things for completionists to work at. Weapons and armor to purchase, art to collect from city merchants, Investments to be made in the infrastructure and services of the city around your family's villa. Feathers to collect from high city ledges, and a conspiracy theory to unravel. So many things to do! Bopping between them is great fun.\nThere are typical side-quests: assassinate so-and-so in service of your mentor, beat up someone's cheating husband, race through the city against a timer, deliver package from point A to point B. Yada yada yada.\nHowever, there are also a few exceptional sidequests in the guise of raiding underground tombs or Templar hideouts. These are masterful puzzles, in which you must make your way carefully through a maze of acrobatic leaps and climbs to obtain a special prize. This style of gameplay in AC2 is reminiscent of Mirror's Edge or Portal 2, in the way it challenges you to puzzle your way through an enclosed area that is reluctant to reveal its secrets. These special side quests each take about 45 minutes to complete. They were a high point of the game for me.\nI have two complaints. First, I would have preferred more stealth gameplay, and an option to complete the game without murdering hundreds of innocent city guards. Don't get me wrong; I found it very satisfying to pull an unsuspecting victim off a rampart and watch him fall to his death. But the body count is very high in this game, and the gratuitous murder sprees don't really mesh with the main character's \u201creluctant hero\u201d personality.\n\nMy other complaint with AC2 is its excessive length. The gameplay here is fun, but it doesn't change much over time. What you're doing in the 5th hour is very similar to what you're doing in the 30th hour. I spent over 40 hours in this game, and I was hoping for a finale after 20. This is a rare example of a game where too much of a good thing makes the overall experience less pleasurable, less memorable.\nBut don't let that stop you from playing. AC2 is frequently on sale for $5, and I can't think of many games that deliver better entertainment at any price.", "hours": 45.5, "username": "7grain", "products": 355, "early_access": false}

Then I played it with a controller - which makes the game not only bearable but actually very enjoyable. It is not a perfect game by any means, but leaping about rooftops and assassinating Italians is great fun. The storyline seems quite good and there are a lot of side missions (although more than a few of them are classic copy pasted fetch quests) which add a bit of depth. The game world is not the most immersive I have ever seen but it is nevertheless very much alive and the atmosphere is well conveyed. A lot of the game revolves around platforming, which is for the most part a fluid and enjoyable experience although occassionally Ubisoft's daft 'One button does 200 things!' design philosophy means I end up leaping backwards 15 metres when I actually wanted to silently climb up to the next windowledge.

The main setting now is 15th/16th century Italy, mainly Florence and Venice. Very pretty.\nThe game is superior to its predecessor in every regard.\nYou can now swim! And although they somehow managed to make fights even easier (you should give up on having a challenging game and mostly enjoy the story), they are more interesting.\nThe freerunning/parkour aspect gets quite literal Tomb Raider treatment, where you traverse tombs to get loot. Also sometimes you get light puzzling elements when the scaling of walls isn't all that obvious.\nAlthough at any given time your choice of actions is pretty limited (most of the time it's only a choice between either pushing main story forward or getting an optional assassination assignment), there is huge variety of things to do, unlike the repetitve nature of the first installment. Coupled with openly designed maps this gives you a lot of breathing room to enjoy the show.\nEven the collectibles make more sense and at least the treasure ones can be mapped for you if you buy a map. But instead of flags you pick up feathers, the rewards maybe aren't all that great but they are there and you also get a shred of emotional involvment in getting all these (to make your mother feel better, no, really).\nAlso Desmond Miles himself gets some action, although overall you get to see him very little. Besides the lady you know from previous game, you get a comedy relief sidekick and hacker action-girl, would me more fun to visit them more often out of the Animus 2.0 simulation.\nThere's some money making / villa restoration minigame added to the game and to get better weapons or armor you actually need to pay some florins. Also for repairs and resources like bullets, medicine (yes, there's medicine now!) and knives (though you can pick them up from bodies too, they aren't common though). But you're never really in the need of cash it pours at you in big amounts. Hey, at least this gives some extra collector's aspect that may give you sense of 100%-ing the game and cherish the display of pretty loot you've gathered.", "hours": 68.5, "username": "Blue Award", "products": 857, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "33230", "page": 500, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-02-07", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed II is what the original Assassin\u2019s Creed should have been. With the inner workings of an engine already in place and two years to work with, the developers were able to produce a game that proves the potential of the series. AC2 successfully builds on the formula that was established in the first game and manages to improve upon what worked and fix most of what didn\u2019t. The story picks up where the original left off, with Desmond Miles (and some new allies) on the run from the Templars. But this time he\u2019s going back into the Animus willingly to re-live the memories of another ancestor, an Assassin named Ezio Auditore, in order to brush up on the Assassin skills that he\u2019ll need for the battle ahead. Ezio\u2019s story takes place in 15th century Renaissance Italy, primarily in the cities of Florence, Forli, and Venice.\nThe environments are, as usual, the most interesting element in the game. The sheer scope of the cities and all of the activity going on within is amazing. Just exploring the city, climbing buildings, etc is pretty fun in and of itself, but what you actually get to do in those cities is what elevates AC2 so far above its predecessor. The missions are no longer a series of boring identical tasks cranked out of some tedium factory. Instead, there is a huge variety of mission types and new game mechanics to go along with them. You now have the ability to blend into crowds at will, hire groups to assist you, and much more. Another welcome change is the addition of a \u201cnotoriety\u201d system, where you gain notoriety by performing suspicious or illegal actions. Guards will typically only attack you on sight if your notoriety is high or if they see you doing something illegal. This is a huge and most welcome change from the first game, where you\u2019d end up being attacked for the most ridiculous of things (you know... atrocities such as walking too fast). Combat is also improved from the first game. Although it\u2019s still ultimately really easy, it remains fun due to the sheer variety of things you can do (there are lots of different weapons to try and a whole series of new techniques).\nIn addition to the main quest, there is also a ton of other stuff to do. Dozens of optional side missions are available, as well as a series of levels that take place in unique environments that utilize the free-running and platforming elements of the game to great effect (think Prince of Persia style tombs). There is also a \u201chome base\u201d Villa area that you can spend time upgrading and exploring if you wish. Doing so awards you with income that can be used to buy further improvements, more weapons, paintings, etc. This can potentially add hours of playtime and is completely optional. Such is the scope of this game. Perhaps my favorite \u201cextra\u201d bit this game offers is a sub-quest dubbed \"The Truth\". Hidden throughout the environments are glyphs that grant access to a series of puzzles, that when solved, unlock tiny portions of a mysterious video (which, when fully decoded, truly expands the mythology underlying the whole series).\nWhat really makes all of these elements come together so well is the main character of Ezio. He is just a likeable guy and is fun to play as. It\u2019s really as simple as that. All in all, it\u2019s hard to ask much more from a sequel. While yes, there are still some flaws here and there, there was nothing that ruined the experience for me to any large degree. Maybe part of it is just how leaps-and-bounds better AC2 is than AC1 that it\u2019s easy to be more forgiving of any blemishes. I suppose that could be it. But then again, it could just simply be that a good game is a good game... I\u2019m inclined to think that\u2019s probably the case here.\nGrade: A-\nNote: I don\u2019t recommend playing any of the Assassin\u2019s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad).

I wrote this review immediately after completing the game in late 2012.\nBottom line:\nDrags on  ALOT, repetitive combat, tedious platforming sections, good story after its passes the initial cliche revenge story.\nThe game is a great improvement over the first but it sure has its flaws, its not full price anymore so definitely worth buying/playing.\n***What's Good***\nMuch improved combat from AC 1 in terms of weapons and guards to fight (Lights, Mediums, heavies, agiles and archers which are lights anyway).\nBeing able to use the hidden blade in regular combat as well as new additions such as the smoke bomb, poison and hidden blade pistol add variety.\nAbility to have dual hidden blades to do dual takedowns is great too.\nThe addition of medicine is brilliant especially when Ezio decides to randomly jump off a ledge and fall to the ground when you move the analog stick half a mm from the wall. Trouble is it eliminates some of the challenge or game feel, especially when against the final boss and i can simply regain all my health multiple times by constantly downing medicine while i wail on him. There's no urgency to attack when you can just turtle any and all opponents.\nThe ability to leap up from a ledge you're hanging from to a higher ledge is a great addition, too bad its introduced mid-late game. Free-Running and climbing is really fun.... when it flows.\nGraphical improvements are welcome after AC 1 (which looked great at the time too). New Italian city environments as well as one swamp environment are nice, Venice is the best by far.\nCarnivale games add some much needed variety to missions.\n***What Lets The Game Down**\nGame is a lot of fun most of the time but its ruined by buggy AI and tedious platforming sections that breakup the open-world style of game AC is. View points are a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 i hated them in the first game and i hated them here, some here dont even make sense when a viewpoint is at regular one or two storey high roof height.\nCounter is incredibly OP, as is countering with the hidden blade which results in an unblockable insta-kill against any guard. Heavies are weaker than medium guards, simply counter them while unarmed and take their pike or haliberd and kill them easily, while mediums wont let you take their weapon and will counter your counters.\nMoney is redundant by mid-game.\nFree-running and climbing is easily broken up by clunky slow animations or odd gameplay mechanics. Why are certain horizontal poles able to be swung from but not climbed while others arent and must be climbed. Swing only poles are thinner and smaller but why cant i swing from the larger ones?\nAI is decent most of the game, pretty easy but im sure they'd kick your\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665if you were a younger player. AI ramps up a lot for 2 assassinations in the 2nd or 3rd last sequence though, archers can suddenly see you behind or above their heads and can alert others in the split second you're in the air and above them making you fail the mission.\nColour saturation and overall colour is strange. One minute everything is vibrant and looks great, the next its all washed out and looks terrible.\nThe pistol hidden blade upgrade given late in the game is impractical and a useless addition due to its slow firing speed and slow reload.\nThe game's pacing and story direction is questionable.Why not go find and take out the main antagonist rather than taking out the pissy targets below him? The game/story drags on a lot and missions get overly repetitive (all AC games have this problem), they include:\nGo here kill this guy\nGo here, kill this guy and don't be detected.\nRace here.\nChase down this guy before he does X.\nFinally", "hours": 37.4, "username": "Hank", "products": 1016, "early_access": false}

The characters are interesting and add mysteries as well as conflict, and set the stage fro various missions as well as side missions, which unlike the first game, aren't repetitive. Collecting diamonds is a fun way to just explore any of the cities available. A particular mission and future memory is the funnest thing in the whole game for me, involving Da Vinci, nighttime and a whole lot of fire....just a couple of hints. This is the game that truly makes the series and gives ti a notable reputation. Brotherhood and Revelations can never top the plot and gameplay of AC2, even with multiplayer.

Ultimately, however, the bland main character, sheer repetitiveness of the mission design, and abrupt ending kept a good game from achieving greatness. Fast forward two years, however, and Ubisoft Montreal had crafted Assassin's Creed II, a sequel that was superior to the original in every conceivable way. Moving from the middle east to Europe got rid of the monochromatic desert locales, giving way to vibrant cityscapes bustling with color, denizens, and side missions. That latter detail, along with the streamlined story structure, effectively eliminated the first game's biggest flaw. The main story path no longer consisted of having to perform the same mundane tasks over and over again to clear a path to the target. Each memory was now its own, self-contained concoction of writing, combat, and sneaking that added tangible weight to the player's actions. II also served to introduce the gaming world to Ezio Auditore, to this day the series' most beloved protagonist, as well as to famous faces from history that would become a series staple. Machiavelli, Pope Alexander the Sixth, and Leonardo Da Vinci each left impressions that characters from the first could only dream of. Even the present-day storyline got a face lift, fleshing out the characters to the point of acceptance by the majority of the players, as well as ending on a nail-biting cliffhanger that neatly paved the way for future installments.
